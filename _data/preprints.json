          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer",
          "abstract": "The importance of open research information, particularly publication metadata, is widely recognised. Crossref is one of the most important infrastructures for registering open metadata as part of DOI record registration. It is widely known, however, that the metadata of many publications is far from complete, with many publishers making certain metadata openly available, but failing to do so for other metadata elements. \n\nOf course, publishers' ability to register this metadata with Crossref depends on their capacity to capture and retain this data in their production workflows. Manuscript submission systems are an important, yet largely overlooked, factor in the extent to which publishers make metadata available through Crossref. \n\nIn this paper, we present the results of an analysis investigating the correlation between the level of metadata that publishers deposit with Crossref and the submission systems that they deploy for their journals. We have looked at the 153 publishers with the largest amounts of publications in Crossref and concentrate on the four most commonly used systems: Editorial Manager, ScholarOne, Open Journal Systems (OJS) and eJournalPress. \n\nWe show that some submission systems appear better suited to capturing certain metadata elements. However, there are always cases where publishers using the same system differ widely in the level of metadata they register, suggesting that technology is not the only prohibiting factor and other considerations are at play.",

          "authors": "Miguel A. Segura-Vargas; Kristof Hoorelbeke; Michelle Kelley; Adrian Jorge Bravo",
          "abstract": "Objective. Rumination has been linked to maladaptive responses following trauma exposure. Although often treated as a unitary construct, accumulating evidence indicates that rumination comprises multiple facets, each of which may relate differently to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Method. The current exploratory study used Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) modeling (1,000 bootstrapped samples) in a U.S. military veteran sample (N=300) to identify potential pathways between rumination facets (repetitive thoughts, counterfactual thinking, problem-focused thoughts, anticipatory thoughts) and PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, hyperarousal). We examined the robustness of the findings across estimation methods. Results. The averaged DAG revealed two subnetworks, reflecting activation patterns among PTSD symptom clusters and among rumination facets. Within the PTSD subnetwork, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal contributed to re-experiencing symptoms. Avoidance and hyperarousal also activated negative alterations in cognition and mood, which emerged as a central bridging hub to rumination facets. This node further activated problem-focused thoughts, cascading into anticipatory thoughts. Robustness analyses indicated potential bidirectionality within each subnetwork. However, the connection between the subnetworks was predominantly characterized by an outgoing influence from PTSD symptom activation toward rumination facets. Conclusions. Although cross-sectional, our findings highlight PTSD-related alterations in cognition and mood as a key driver of rumination in military veterans, a pattern replicated across different estimation methods. These results point to specific pathways through which PTSD symptoms may propagate into ruminative processes. Longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to clarify the temporal dynamics between PTSD symptoms and rumination facets.",

          "authors": "Kimmo Sorjonen; Bo Melin; Marika Melin",
          "abstract": "Mercier and Lubart analyzed data (N = 1384) with necessary condition analysis (NCA) and concluded that creativity self-efficacy and, to a lesser degree, creative process engagement, creative personal identity, openness to experience, and creative personality appeared necessary for creativity in the workplace. However, it has been established that necessity effects in NCA may be spurious due to correlations between the variables. Here, we estimated ranges of spuriousness across 1000 necessity effects estimated in data generated to have the same sample size and correlations between variables as in the data used by Mercier and Lubart. The necessity effects reported by Mercier and Lubart did not fall above these ranges of spuriousness, meaning that the reported effects may have been spurious and the conclusions by Mercier and Lubart premature. It is important for users of NCA to be aware that necessity effects in NCA do not prove necessity any more than correlations prove causality. We recommend researchers using NCA to scrutinize their findings by estimating, as we did here, ranges of spuriousness and to require that necessity effects fall above this range before claiming necessity.",

          "authors": "Anna Bosshard; Linli Zhou; Cameron Brick; Frenk van Harreveld",
          "abstract": "Repair can help extend clothing lifecycles. However, this behavior is infrequent in high-income countries, especially among younger adults who often lack practical repair skills. In this quasi-experiment, we tested whether a group workshop could motivate repair and reduce consumption in young adults. Participants were assigned to a skills workshop (n = 62) or a control group (n = 51) who only received a persuasive message about clothing repair. The workshop strongly increased self-efficacy both immediately after the workshop and four weeks later. Although the workshop did not impact environmental attitudes or emotions associated with repair, workshop participants reported moderately higher intentions to repair their clothes and identified more with others who did (but these effects were not durable). The workshop did not increase the number of self-reported repairs nor reduce purchases four weeks later. There was some evidence for lower disposals at follow-up (but the effect was uncertain). A single workshop may thus spark motivation but not materialize in behavior changes four weeks later. This study highlights the importance of hands-on practice for boosting self-efficacy and demonstrates how quasi-experimental designs with follow-up surveys can contribute to understanding the potential of behavioral interventions.",

          "authors": "Georgia Turner; Amy Orben",
          "abstract": "Despite ubiquitous concern about human self-control over technology use, there is little scientific consensus on how to define digital autonomy. Here, we propose a conceptualisation of digital autonomy as comprising not just the ability to pursue one’s current goals, but also to have these goals themselves free from manipulation. To motivate this definition, we review theories of digital autonomy across philosophy, human-AI alignment and cognitive psychology. We then integrate these approaches by considering digital behaviour as a hierarchical control system, with theories of autonomy in different disciplines referring to different parts of this system. Finally, we discuss evidence for technology-induced goal change within the hierarchical system. This framework bridges across cognitive disciplines, providing an expanded definition to direct future research.",

          "authors": "Pia Schoknecht; Shravan Vasishth",
          "abstract": "When the research question targets online measures of sentence processing, offline tasks are sometimes an afterthought in experimental design. The present study shows that offline tasks (acceptability judgments vs. comprehension questions) can modulate online processing. We investigated how the task shapes local coherence effects in German. Previous and present data using the same local coherence design in German was analyzed in a single model and it was found that P600 modulations due to local coherence were task sensitive. Previous work using acceptability judgments found a more positive P600 for a locally coherent condition compared to a control condition. In the present experiment using comprehension questions, the mean estimate of the difference between conditions was reduced to almost zero. The absence of a meaningful processing difficulty due to local coherence under questions is compatible with two opposing interpretations. One interpretation is that comprehension-driven reading enhanced grammar supervision, mostly preventing merely locally coherent parses from being considered. The alternative interpretation is that comprehension-driven reading induced good-enough processing. Good-enough processing might leave syntactic relations underspecified or parsing conflicts unresolved; as a result, the merely locally coherent parse competed less with the global parse, which eliminated the local coherence effect. Overall, our findings demonstrate that offline task demands can shape online syntactic processing.",

          "authors": "Courtney Michael Goodridge; Rafael C. Gonçalves; Ali Arabian; Anthony Horrobin; Albert Solernou; Yee Thung Lee; Audrey Bruneau; Jonny Kuo; Michael G. Lenné; Gaëtan Merlhiot",
          "abstract": "Arousal plays a vital role in facilitating the human ability to respond flexibly in a goal-directed manner. Adaptive Gain Theory (AGT) posits that the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine (LC-NE) system is implicated in this regulation and that pupillometry is a non-invasive indicator of LC activity. Most tests of AGT have focused on highly controlled cognitive and perceptual tasks, however it has been proposed that the LC-NE system plays a more general role in regulating the cortical based mechanisms involved in arousal. Transitions of control from intermediate levels of automation to manual driving are a potentially useful testbed for complex processes that are mediated by this neuromodulatory arousal system. To date, pupillometry has focused on the detection of cognitive load in the context of automated and manual driving. Therefore, this driving simulator experiment had two general aims: to establish whether pupillometry during hands-off Level 2 (L2) driving was a reliable and valid indicator of cognitive load, and to test the predictions of AGT in an applied context. The size and reactivity of drivers’ (N = 38) pupils were measured during hands-off L2 driving with and without a cognitive load task, followed by critical and non-critical transitions of control. Analysis revealed that mean, not standard deviation, of pupil diameter was a reliable indicator of cognitive load. Furthermore, partial support for AGT predictions was found; higher baseline pupil diameter was associated with smaller task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs), even after correcting for regression to the mean artifacts. Finally, more critical events were associated with larger tonic pupil diameter, indicating that drivers were exerting greater effort to manage the transition. These results indicate that pupillometry is a useful measure of cognitive load as well as an indication of the physiological arousal needed to facilitate cognition during transitions of control. We discuss the need for neuroscientific theories and methodologies in the pursuit of valid and reliable Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS).",

          "authors": "Kinga Wołoszyn; Mateusz Hohol; Michal Kuniecki; Piotr Winkielman",
          "abstract": "Facial mimicry of visually observed emotional facial actions is a robust phenomenon. Here, we examined whether such facial mimicry extends to auditory emotional stimuli. We also examined if participants’ facial responses differ to sounds that are more strongly associated with congruent facial movements, such as vocal emotional expressions (e.g., laughter, screams), or less associated with movements, such as non-vocal emotional sounds (e.g., happy, scary instrumental sounds). Furthermore, to assess whether facial mimicry of sounds reflects visual-motor or auditory-motor associations, we compared individuals that vary on lifetime visual experience (sighted vs. blind). To measure spontaneous facial responding, we used facial electromyography to record the activity of the corrugator supercilii (frowning) and the zygomaticus major (smiling) muscles. During measurement, participants freely listened to the two types of emotional sounds. Both types of sounds were rated similarly on valence and arousal. Notably, only vocal, but not instrumental, sounds elicited robust congruent and selective facial responses. The facial responses were observed in both sighted and blind participants. However, the muscles’ responses of blind participants showed less differentiation between emotion categories of human vocalizations. Furthermore, the groups differed in the shape of the time courses of the zygomatic activity to human vocalizations. Overall, the study shows that emotion-congruent facial responses occur to non-visual stimuli and are more robust to human vocalizations than instrumental sounds. Furthermore, the amount of life-time visual experience matters little for the occurrence of cross-channel facial mimicry, but it shapes response differentiation.",

          "authors": "Beray Macit; Annalisa Lipp; Armin Zlomuzica; Harald Engler; Simon Edward Blackwell; Felix Würtz; Jürgen Margraf; Marcella Lydia Woud",
          "abstract": "Exposure is highly effective for treating acrophobia and there is growing consensus that cognitive mechanisms play an important role in exposure-based therapies. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether adding a Cognitive Bias Modification - Interpretation (CBM-I) training to a single-session exposure therapy further facilitates cognitive change. The sample included diagnosed acrophobia patients (N = 81), all of whom received exposure therapy. One day later they were randomized to receive either CBM-I or a sham training. The CBM-I trained patients to interpret and appraise ambiguous, height-related scenarios in a less threatening and adaptive manner, whereas the sham training comprised ambiguous, neutral scenarios. Outcomes included changes in interpretational biases (Encoding Recognition Task, Heights Interpretation Questionnaire, Scrambled Sentences Task), acrophobia-related symptoms (Acrophobia Questionnaire), and behavioral avoidance (Behavioral Approach Test). In intention-to-treat analyses patients receiving CBM-I showed a greater reduction in interpretational biases post-training compared to the sham condition (primary outcome). However, group differences were not sustained at follow-up, with both groups demonstrating improvements across all outcomes, except for the Scrambled Sentences Task. No significant group differences in reductions in other acrophobia-related cognitions, symptoms, or behavior emerged over time. Exploratory analyses revealed strong associations between the assessed cognitive, behavioral, and subjective outcomes, but neither of these outcomes correlated with the hormonal measures (progesterone, estradiol). To conclude, our findings suggest that while CBM-I can temporarily facilitate cognitive change in the context of exposure, its long-term benefits and downstream effects may require further optimization. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols to maximize its efficacy as a potential adjunct to exposure therapy.",

          "authors": "Britt Hadar; Nir Halevy; Taya R. Cohen; Evan Apfelbaum; Lauren Chan",
          "abstract": "Antisemitism, characterized by prejudice, discrimination, and hostility toward Jews, is marked by two enduring paradoxes. First, although people typically defer to powerholders, perceptions of Jews as powerful are associated with disdain rather than deference among antisemites. Second, antisemitism emerges among individuals with opposing ideological worldviews, those who strongly support societal hierarchies and those who vehemently oppose them. To explain these paradoxes, we introduce the Dual Threat Model of Antisemitism, which highlights the central role of perceived Jewish power in fueling antisemitism. The model posits that perceived Jewish power—defined as perceived control over valuable resources—elicits two distinct types of threat. For proponents of hierarchy, perceived Jewish power threatens in-group dominance, challenging their desire to maintain group superiority. For opponents of hierarchy, perceived Jewish power threatens egalitarian ideals, undermining their vision of a fair and equal society. Evidence from the US, Mexico, Australia, UK, Germany, and Poland lends cross-cultural support to the model. We discuss the implications of the model and the empirical evidence for designing interventions aimed at curbing antisemitism.",

          "authors": "Hiroshi Matsui; Kohei Yanagawa",
          "abstract": "Tolman, an experimental psychologist renowned for his research on the “cognitive map”\nand “latent learning” in rats, pursued his career within the tradition of behaviorisms. In the\nhistory of psychology, he is positioned as a precursor to cognitivism. This is because the\nconcepts he introduced as intervening variables were later interpreted as having a\nrepresentational nature. On the other hand, the philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty was\nalso influenced by Tolman's concepts, particularly his theory of sign-Gestalt. Merleau-\nPonty’s ideas, especially as developed in The Structure of Behavior, have had a profound\nimpact on the notion of embodiment within enactivism. Enactivism, as a school of thought\nopposing representationalism, sharply contrasts with cognitivism, which places Tolman at\nthe intersection of two opposing intellectual currents. This paper, thus, reexamines\nTolman’s ambivalent nature, exploring how it arose and reassessing his ideas as a\nprecursor not only to cognitivism but also indirectly to enactivism. We argue that Merleau-\nPonty inherited Tolman’s concept of sign-Gestalt as having a non-representational nature\nand utilized it within his relational account of behavior. While Tolman’s own theoretical\nframework remained ontologically ambiguous, Merleau-Ponty recast his insights into a\nconception of behavior as a structured, embodied interaction between organism and\nenvironment. These reformulated insights subsequently provided a conceptual foundation\nfor enactivist cognitive science, particularly in its emphasis on the co-constitution of\nperception and action, and the dynamic coupling of agent and environment. By tracing\nthis lineage, we can move beyond the standard narrative and reposition Tolman as an\nintellectually ambivalent figure whose work served as a hidden source for both cognitivism\nand enactivism.",

For two weeks, participants either interacted with a chatbot or a human peer, or simply wrote a brief journal entry (control condition). Although our chatbot “Sam” was designed to offer consistent support rooted in principles from relationship science, the psychological benefits of interacting with this chatbot were smaller in comparison to interacting with a randomly selected first-year university student.

          "authors": "Mahbod Mehrvarz; Jeffrey N. Rouder",
          "abstract": "An independent cluster model in confirmatory factor analysis (ICM-CFA) is a factor model in which each variable loads on one and only one of several factors. Accordingly, variables that load on the same factor form a cluster corresponding to a specific construct. Correlations between factors represent latent correlations among these constructs. In this paper, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the manifest correlation matrix under which an ICM-CFA model holds. The key is that within- and between-cluster correlation submatrices must *align*, such that within-cluster correlation patterns constrain between-cluster correlations up to a multiplicative constant. This alignment condition imposes a geometric constraint on the manifest correlation matrix. Importantly, it provides a framework for studying how misspecification affects latent correlations. Misspecification can occur in two ways: variables may be assigned *a priori* to the wrong cluster (misassignment), or within-cluster correlation patterns may fail to align with those between clusters (misalignment). Using the alignment condition, we prove that misassignment necessarily leads to inflation of latent correlations. Using simulation, we show that misalignment can also inflate latent correlations. The alignment geometry also provides a new approach to understanding the relationship between ICM-CFA and bifactor models.",

          "abstract": "Australia implemented the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024 (Cth; SMMA) on December 10, 2025. This policy represents a world-first social media age-restriction, which requires age-restricted social media platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account. Preliminary estimates suggest that approximately 1,194,000 young people will be affected by the deactivation of accounts. As the SMMA is enacted, we are collecting data to examine the outcomes for young people, parents, and families. This study protocol paper serves as a summary of the methodological design for the evaluation of the implementation and outcomes of the SMMA, including a) young people’s adherence, and the SMMA’s impact on b) their digital practices, c) their physical, psychological, and social wellbeing, d) their families, and e) community attitudes and dynamics. To evaluate the impact of the SMMA implementation, a mixed-methods approach is being undertaken involving 4,121 young people aged 10 to 16 years and their parents or caregivers. Data collection involves longitudinal parent-child surveys, opt-in passive smartphone tracking, administrative data, qualitative interviews, focus groups and diary studies. Findings from this evaluation will inform national policy oversight and implementation in Australia;  contribute empirical evidence to international debates; and inform other countries considering similar age-based regulation of social media. Results will be disseminated through public-facing reports, peer-reviewed publications, and stakeholder engagement activities to support evidence-informed decision-making in digital safety regulation in Australia and internationally.",

          "authors": "Jan Pavlík; Nikol Kvardová; Petr Palíšek",
          "abstract": "The Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale (SOBBS) was adapted to the Czech context using multiple independent translations and subsequent cognitive interviews. A pilot analysis of a secondary dataset (N = 959) evaluated using Dynamic Fit Indices (DFI) indicated a suboptimal fit for the original structure (χ²(76) = 569.253, CFI = .903, RMSEA = .083, SRMR = .065) and a lack of scalar invariance. Subsequently, data for the main study were collected from a non-random online sample of 548 participants, including 72% women and 27% men, aged 18–75 years (M = 25.8, SD = 10.1). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated unsatisfactory fit of the original model (χ²(76) = 292.76, CFI = .930, RMSEA = .072, SRMR = .054, BIC = 18321). However, a modified model excluding Item 2 (related to clothing choices) satisfied the dynamic fit criteria (χ²(64) = 210.40, CFI = .948, RMSEA = .065, SRMR = .053, BIC = 16825). These results support SOBBS’ two-factor structure (i.e., body self-monitoring and body as a representation of the Self). The modified SOBBS (13 items) demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .87, ω = .90 for the total scale; α = .87, ω = .87 for body self-monitoring; and α = .83, ω = .83 for body as a representation of the Self), and correlations with body shame and body self-monitoring scales provided evidence for concurrent validity. In contrast to the pilot study, measurement invariance of the modified model in the main study was supported at the level of the scalar model (i.e., with constrained factor loadings and intercepts), allowing for gender-based comparisons. The main analysis revealed a statistically significant but small difference in overall self-objectification between women and men (d = 0.22). An exploratory analysis showed a higher body surveillance in women (d = 0.48), with no significant differences in the body as a self-representation dimension. The results provide evidence supporting the construct validity and reliability of the modified Czech version of the SOBBS. The scale may serve as a useful tool for further research on self-objectification in the Czech context. We conclude with suggestions for future research, mainly wording revisions and clarifications for the conceptual placement of body shame within the Objectification Theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997).",

          "abstract": "Many chronic neurological, psychiatric and interface disorders can be understood as conditions where maladaptive homeostatic set points become entrenched, driving pathological states that resist spontaneous resolution. This paper proposes a novel conceptual framework, the therapeutic reset, which unifies diverse interventions that transiently disrupt pathological equilibria, thereby leveraging the intrinsic plasticity of biological systems to facilitate recalibration toward healthier set points. Drawing insights from active inference, dynamical systems theory and nested somatic collective intelligences, we illustrate how treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy, psychedelics, inflammatory perturbations and anaesthetic interventions create brief periods of heightened plasticity. We argue that the reset itself and plasticity more generally do not necessarily incline in the direction of better health and that therapeutic efficacy may depend especially on the quality of contextual elements including preparation, support and post-intervention scaffolding that guides the system towards an adaptive equilibrium. Future research should prioritise mechanistic studies to identify biomarkers of plasticity and delineate intervention-responsive signalling pathways, alongside clinical studies refining precise dosage and anatomical targeting, and identifying therapeutically salient parameters of the scaffolding around high-plasticity states. By strategically harnessing systems’ inherent capacity for correction, this framework offers transformative potential for treating otherwise intractable disorders through proactive, precision-based recalibration of maladaptive homeostatic networks.",

          "abstract": "Background\nImpaired control over alcohol consumption is a core feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD), yet its mechanisms remain unclear. Habit theories posit a shift from goal-directed to habitual control with repeated alcohol use, but human evidence is mixed and often lacks translational alignment with animal models. Recent accounts therefore call for paradigms assessing contingency sensitivity with disorder-relevant reinforcers.\nMethods\nWe adapted a free-operant contingency degradation task to compare goal-directed control when responding for a natural (juice) versus disorder-relevant reinforcer (alcohol). Eighty-one participants were tested, comprising 49 non-treatment-seeking individuals with AUD (31.22 ± 8.35 years; 28 females) and 32 healthy controls (27.44 ± 6.71 years; 22 females). We expected reduced goal-directed control in AUD, indexed by weaker response-rate and causality judgment adaption to changed contingencies, particularly for alcohol.\nResults\nContrary to our hypothesis, goal-directed control was preserved in both groups, with behavioral responding and causality judgments remaining contingency-sensitive. Rather than a generalized deficit, a reinforcer-specific attenuation emerged: across groups, behavioral sensitivity was selectively reduced when responding for alcohol. Explicit contingency judgments remained intact and were stronger in individuals with AUD than in healthy controls.\nConclusion\nThese findings do not support a generalized deficit in goal-directed control in AUD. Instead, goal-directed control appears selectively attenuated in alcohol-related contexts across diagnostic groups, potentially reflecting reinforcement-history-dependent shifts toward cue-driven responding. Alcohol-specific reductions in goal-directed control may emerge early in alcohol use, underscoring the importance of reinforcer context.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization is fueled not only by what people believe but also by what they think others believe about them. Across four studies, we investigate moral metaperceptions—beliefs about how ideological outgroups evaluate one's moral values—as a novel contributor to intergroup division. In Study 1, we analyze a large corpus of abortion-related tweets and find that pro-life users emphasize binding values when describing their own stance but shift toward individualizing values when discussing pro-choice positions, whereas pro-choice users consistently rely on individualizing values. These framing differences show how moral values structure group self-presentation versus outgroup characterization, motivating our direct tests of metaperceptions in Studies 2–4. In Studies 2 and 3, preregistered experimental studies compare perceptions and metaperceptions of moral values across ideological stances. Results reveal asymmetric inaccuracies: liberals underestimate how much conservatives think liberals uphold binding values, while conservatives overestimate how much liberals think conservatives uphold individualizing values. These metaperceptual distortions predict intergroup trust and perceived threat. In Study 4, participants were randomly assigned to one of three feedback conditions. When shown that the outgroup viewed their moral adherence more positively than expected, both liberals and conservatives reported higher trust and lower perceived threat, with effects strongest among individuals higher in empathy. These findings identify moral metaperceptions as a key psychological mechanism that sustains polarization and highlight their potential as a target for interventions aimed at fostering constructive cross-ideological engagement.",

          "abstract": "We propose a state-centered, behavioral view of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism is often incompletely understood at the nation-state level, categorizing particular regimes as authoritarian, or at the individual level, as a set of tendencies or worldviews. We reposition behavior—specifically, person-state interaction—as the main unit of analysis, putting the “authority” back into authoritarianism. We argue that only behaviors that use state rules and state punishments to consolidate ruling class power should be considered authoritarian. In doing so, we achieve three main aims. First, we describe authoritarianism as a fundamentally motivational process, in which the state is used as a means to self- or group-serving ends. Second, we identify a set of behaviors that are rightly understood as authoritarian (e.g., punishing dissidents), as well as behaviors that should not be (e.g., interpersonal forms of punishment). Third, we identify previously overlooked behaviors that fit our definition of authoritarianism (e.g., administrative burden). Finally, we call for the exploration of situations where people might prefer state (to interpersonal) punishment, and prefer the enforcement of official rules (over social norms). Crucially, our view stands in sharp contrast to the prevailing understanding of punishment as cooperative, by centering the uniquely oppressive capacity of state power—with its monopoly on legitimate violence and its last word on legality in the courts. In sum, our state-centered behavioral view bridges individual- and regime-level interpretations of authoritarianism, to capture the unique opportunities available to satisfy self- or group-serving ends by use of the modern state.",

This study examines whether two core mechanisms of cooperation—reputation and reciprocity—operate differently in groups with varying gender, race, and age compositions. Across three studies (N = 875) using the Public Goods Game, we independently assessed how group diversity affects reputation and reciprocity in cooperative settings. Contrary to expectations, group composition (heterogeneous vs. homogeneous) did not significantly alter reputation perceptions. While reciprocity differences emerged, they were due to varying leniency towards non-cooperators rather than a clear in-group bias, except in race, where White participants showed greater cooperation with similar cooperative partners over Black ones. Our findings suggest that, while similarity may influence initial group dynamics, its impact on reputation and cooperation wanes over time.",

Three studies evaluated global cognitive function in middle-aged adults. Two studies reported impairments in individuals with midlife obesity and a more rapid decline in those who were metabolically unhealthy. One study found no association. Long-term obesity was also linked to poorer global cognition in midlife. Executive functions appeared to be impacted by obesity. Research on memory was mixed, as two studies found a negative association with obesity, while two found no association. Methodological weaknesses included imprecise exposure measurements and inadequate adjustment for confounding factors.\nConclusions\nDespite evidence that obesity may increase the risk of cognitive impairment in midlife, evidence from a very limited number of studies is inconsistent, and an independent association remains unconfirmed.

          "abstract": "Effort-based decision-making is a highly studied topic that investigates how agents allocate resources to exert physical or mental effort to overcome task difficulty and obtain a reward. However, designing experiments investigating effort-based decision-making is complex, as the experimenter needs to ensure that all participants experience the same task difficulty, regardless of their prior proficiency in the task. While effective methods for solving this problem have been proposed for physical tasks, participant-specific calibration of task difficulty in a mental effort task remains challenging, above all if the calibration procedure needs to be implemented in a short time window to minimize the overall duration of the experiment. In this manuscript, we propose a novel and computationally lightweight method, named Fast Difficulty Calibration algorithm, that allows for the fast calibration of task difficulty by dynamically adapting the response time limit during trial execution. We test this method on a mental arithmetic task with four difficulty levels, and show that only 20 calibration trials are sufficient to make the subjective task difficulty similar for all the participants.",

          "abstract": "Community violence is an epidemic in the United States. Studies estimate almost 30% of youth experience community violence, with higher rates in low-income, urban settings. Community violence exposure is consistently linked to adverse mental health outcomes, including post-traumatic stress, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. In response, nationwide efforts have emphasized increased financial investment in social services as a potential means to mitigate the impact of violence exposure. Yet, gaps remain in understanding whether structural investments (i.e., social service expenditures) moderate mental health outcomes. This study aimed to: (1) provide an updated examination of the associations between community violence exposure and mental health outcomes, and (2) test whether state-level social service expenditures moderated these associations. We conducted a spatial meta-analysis using a three-level random-effects model, linking study data to publicly available Census expenditures data. A total of 155 studies representing 23 states yielded 769 effect sizes. Results indicated a significant small-to-moderate positive association between community violence and mental health (Fisher’s z = 0.22, p &lt; .0001; 95% CI [0.20, 0.24]), with heterogeneity across studies (Q = 9524.4, df = 768, p &lt; .0001). Hospital and veterans’ services spending weakened the positive associations with somatic and post-traumatic stress outcomes. By contrast, employment security and health spending amplified the positive associations with internalizing outcomes. Findings underscore the enduring mental health burden of community violence, the potential role of targeted policy investments, and the need for cross-disciplinary research to clarify how psychological and structural factors impact mental health outcomes among those exposed to community violence.",

          "abstract": "How people decide whether to invest cognitive effort in demanding tasks or shift to easier alternatives is central to understanding motivation and cognitive control, yet the latent mechanisms governing these moment-to-moment decisions remain insufficiently understood. Here, we combine a novel parallel-task reinforcement learning and working memory (RLWM) paradigm with a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HMM) to track trial-level cognitive states as participants freely and dynamically allocate attention between simultaneous low-demand and high-demand learning tasks. We show that our model adequately identifies behavior as reflecting one of three latent states: engaged in the low-demand task, engaged in the high-demand task, or disengaged. Across three independent samples (N=269), including a preregistered replication, we demonstrate that: (i) subjective effort predicts model-estimated disengagement, linking perceived cognitive load to attentional lapses; (ii) intrinsic motivation for cognitive challenge (Need for Cognition) predicts voluntary selection of the demanding task; and (iii) switches into higher demand are accompanied by increased policy entropy, revealing that effort investment reflects exploratory information-seeking. Our framework unifies perspectives from cognitive control, working memory, and curiosity-driven exploration, demonstrating that trial-to-trial fluctuations in attention provide a mechanistic window into how subjective effort, intrinsic motivation, and information-seeking jointly shape the dynamic allocation of cognitive resources.",

Four studies (N = 604 4-9-year-old children and 577 adults) show that no amount of significance is too small to matter, even for small actions from early in life. Children and adults strongly preferred artistic activities with minimal significance (i.e., where their work would be saved) over activities with no lasting existence. This preference held for both repetitive and one-time tasks and was specific to creating artwork, not just observing it. Anticipating even minimal significance motivated participants to engage in productive tasks rather than effortless alternatives. In the absence of significance, focusing on enjoying the process partially, but not fully, compensates for motivation. These findings illuminate the scope and sensitivity of significance as a powerful motivational force, offering insights into how to promote motivation in an increasingly fast-paced, transient world.",

Theorists have created a large body of mathematical work based on the iterated prisoner’s dilemma game that explores which strategies are evolutionarily stable in a range of conditions including when there are behavioral errors. However, there is a mismatch between the vigorous pace of theoretical research and the trickle of empirical studies that have tested predictions generated by the theoretical work. Furthermore, findings from the empirical work on dyadic cooperation in humans deviate from theoretical predictions in important ways. We argue that this discrepancy suggests that the standard theoretical framework is poorly suited to account for key features of the real-world cooperation, and suggest possible avenues that the theoretical exploration of reciprocity needs to take to close the gap between theory and real-world cooperation.",

We propose an alternative perceptual-calibration account in which early intersectional difficulty arises because children’s perceptual gender prototypes are tuned to the statistical properties of faces they most frequently encountered rather than entrenched stereotypes. U.S. children (N = 101, ages 5-10) and adults (N = 47) completed a speeded gender-categorization task with matched Black and White faces controlled for masculinity, femininity, and dominance; a separate adult sample (N = 54) completed the same task using unmatched faces. Children were reliably slower to categorize Black than White women despite high discriminability and minimal response bias, with this asymmetry emerging around age 7.3. Adults showed no intersectional difficulty with matched stimuli but renewed slowdown with unmatched stimuli. This developmental dissociation suggests that intersectional difficulty in perceptual categorization reflects experience-dependent prototype tuning rather than stable conceptual bias.",

Alexithymia, a condition that co-occurs with many psychiatric disorders, is characterized by impairment in emotional processing. However, computational mechanisms by which it alters social inferences based on feedback cues remain unexplored. To examine this, 60 participants with low and high levels of alexithymia completed an emotional learning task involving contradictory social (verbal and visual) cues to infer targets’ emotions. Computational analyses, including bin-based, reinforcement learning, and drift-diffusion modeling, revealed how alexithymia alters latent parameters that govern value updating and choice. Individuals with high alexithymia demonstrated lower accuracy in learning from social feedback. Drift diffusion analysis revealed a perceptual bias toward the visual cue, higher drift rates in the visual-correct condition, and greater evidence accumulation to infer others' emotions. These findings suggest that individuals with high alexithymia exhibit impaired social learning and difficulty with decision-making in situations with conflicting social information, with computational modeling quantifying the latent processes involved and advancing mechanistic targets for computational psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Climate change poses an existential threat to humanity, with profound ecological, social, and health consequences. Beyond policy and structural transformations, effective mitigation and adaptation require widespread behavioural change. Knowledge about the causes, impacts, and solutions of climate change is therefore a key target of climate communication. Yet, the empirical role of knowledge in fostering climate action remains unclear, partly due to varying conceptualizations and limited psychometric quality of existing measures.\nTo address these limitations, we developed the 15-item Climate Change Knowledge (CCK) scale using a mixed-methods approach that integrates expert input and psychometric validation. The scale captures three domains: ecological mechanisms, societal impacts, and mitigation/adaptation measures, reflecting content validity grounded in both scientific literature and real-world understanding.\nBased on a representative German sample (N = 10,377), the CCK scale demonstrated good factorial, convergent, divergent, and criterion validity. It captures climate-specific knowledge that is distinct from general/ environmental knowledge and risk perception, and it explains unique variance in readiness for climate action, particularly individual behaviour, policy acceptance and political participation beyond these constructs.\nThe CCK scale provides a concise, domain-specific and empirically validated instrument for assessing climate-related knowledge. By clarifying construct boundaries and enabling precise tests of how knowledge relates to engagement, it supports theory development and evaluation of climate education and communication initiatives. In doing so, it strengthens the evidence base for policies and interventions that aim to promote climate action.",

We present results from a longitudinal study involving two measurement occasions approximately 13 months apart, utilizing data from the German Personality Panel with 404 young adults (69% female; on average 24 years old). We found that self-related core beliefs explained 18 % of the variance in life satisfaction over demographic variables and the Big Five (p &lt; .001). Significant predictors were being optimistic vs. pessimistic, content, and trusting, accounting for most of the variance previously explained by Big Five traits. Results were largely replicated when controlling for initial levels of life satisfaction, indicating that self-related core beliefs also predict trajectories across time. We conclude that self-related core beliefs provide finer insights, compared to broad personality traits, to understand levels and change in life satisfaction. Given that beliefs can be modified through intervention, they may serve as a valuable starting point for enhancing life satisfaction.",

The aim of this study is to provide the Japanese translation and cultural adaptation of the PAQ and GREP to facilitate the inclusion of gender and gender variables in future biomedical, psychological and social research conducted in Japanese.",

          "authors": "Theodore Piper; Jamie Torrance; Conor Heath; Stephen Sharman; Philip Newall",
          "abstract": "Previous research has documented the frequency of gambling adverts during international football tournaments, but it is important to understand how these trends might continue to evolve. We therefore aimed to analyze the frequency and content of TV gambling adverts shown in the UK during the 2024 Men’s UEFA European Football Championship (Euro 2024), and to compare these findings with two previous major men’s tournaments: the 2021 Men’s European Football Championship (Euro 2021) and the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup (MWC 2022). Twenty-five broadcast matches were recorded, and all commercial-break gambling advertising coded. Coded variables included the gambling operator, advertisement type, advertised product, celebrity endorsement presence, and safer gambling message inclusion. We observed 122 gambling adverts (average 4.9 per-broadcast) from 8 operators. These comprised 79 financial inducements, 37 brand awareness, and 6 ‘safer gambling’ adverts. Sports betting was the predominant gambling product advertised (88.8%), and celebrity endorsements appeared across all advertisement types. Most adverts (74.6%) appeared before the matches began. Comparative analyses showed no significant differences in gambling advertisement frequency per-match between UEFA 2024 and the two previous men’s tournaments (UEFA 2021, MWC 2022). Unlike these two previous men’s tournaments, no odds adverts were observed in this tournament. Although the overall frequency of gambling advertising might have been similar to previous men’s football tournaments, differences in content were observed, revealing the need to continue monitoring gambling advertising for both its frequency and content.",

          "authors": "Ymke de Bruijn; Jana Vietze",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Children in Europe grow up in societies with high ethnic-racial diversity. It is therefore imperative to understand how they learn about ethnicity and race (ethnic-racial socialization). Knowledge on parental ethnic-racial socialization, however, is very heavily based on U.S. research, and sociohistorical and -political differences limit generalizability. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to create an overview and synthesis of research on parental ethnic-racial socialization in the European context. Methods: A preregistered scoping review was conducted following the PRIMSA-ScR guidelines. Three electronic databases (PsychInfo, ERIC, Web of Science) were searched for papers published up and till 2024. After two rounds of screening, 32 out of 1431 papers were deemed eligible and included for data extraction and synthesis. Results: The findings display an overrepresentation of Northern/Western European countries, families of immigrant or minoritized backgrounds and quantitative research on adolescence. Cultural socialization by families or immigrant or minoritized backgrounds has received the most attention. Qualitative study results furthermore describe how parental ethnic-racial socialization is shaped by developmental timing, reactive and reciprocal processes, intersecting identities, and selective engagement with cultural “others. Conclusions: The findings of this scoping review underscore both the promise and current limitations of research on parental ethnic-racial socialization in Europe. To further this research agenda, we need more systematic inclusion of underrepresented populations, greater investments in qualitative and mixed-methods designs, openness to diverse and self-identified ingroup boundaries and identity meanings, and the development of conceptualizations and measures that reflect Europe’s distinctive sociohistorical trajectories, demographic diversity, and linguistic practices.",

          "authors": "Artem Baratiuk",
          "abstract": "The article presents a conceptual model of using virtual reality (VR) interventions to foster psychological readiness for motherhood. Psychological readiness is understood as a dynamic integration of cognitive, affective and behavioral components that is sensitive to individual experience and sociocultural context. Against the background of significant gaps in traditional perinatal education, VR is considered as a medium that combines psychoeducation with emotionally engaging simulations and safe skills training. The paper synthesizes empirical findings on the mechanisms of presence, immersion, embodiment and behavioral simulation, showing how VR scenarios can model childcare, bodily changes, communication with medical staff and partners, and the experience of responsibility for a newborn. Within the proposed three-layer architecture, the technological layer regulates immersion and stimulus dosing, the psychological layer facilitates empathy, self-compassion and tolerance of uncertainty through narratives and guided accompaniment, and the content layer targets birth preparedness, complication readiness and core perinatal anxieties. It is assumed that VR can temporarily reduce state anxiety, open a \"learning window\" and support the consolidation of more realistic mental models of motherhood, stronger maternal-infant bonding and more confident behavioral patterns. The article outlines the innovative potential, limitations and directions for future randomized studies of VR-based perinatal psychoeducation.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Previous research has shown that interpersonal trauma is associated with higher rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms, with coping responses playing a vital role in individual differences in symptom presentation. The present online study examined differential associations between trauma type, coping styles, and trauma-related symptomatology to deepen understanding of variation in trauma-related symptomatology.\nParticipants: The sample included N = 300 participants who reported a traumatic life event within the past 18 months, assessed with the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5). \nStudy Method: Events were classified into interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma. Participants completed retrospective questions assessing posttraumatic coping strategies, current levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction.\nFindings: The present study reports secondary analyses. Correlational analyses within both trauma groups revealed positive relationships between avoidant coping and trauma-related symptoms. Group comparisons revealed higher levels of trauma-related symptoms, lower life satisfaction, and greater use of avoidant coping strategies following interpersonal compared to non-interpersonal trauma. Furthermore, avoidant coping predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms within both trauma groups, and trauma type itself significantly predicted symptoms across the entire sample. Finally, exploratory analyses showed that avoidant coping partially mediated the relationship between trauma type and posttraumatic stress symptoms.\nConclusions: These findings underscore the important role of avoidant coping in the differential associations between trauma type and trauma-related symptoms. The results highlight potential targets for intervention and prevention efforts, particularly for individuals exposed to interpersonal trauma.",

          "abstract": "The recent rise in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has led to a new wave of GenAI products, many of which are toys designed for young children. These toys could raise exciting possibilities for early years education while also posing risks to children. To understand how those working in the early years sector view GenAI toys, we conducted a three-step consultation process: a survey, a series of focus groups, and a workshop. Through descriptive and thematic analyses of both quantitative and qualita-tive data, we detail three key themes arising from our data. First, those working in the early years sector felt fearful of the unknown implications of GenAI toys, particularly when considering children’s privacy and safeguarding. Next, sector representatives felt that while GenAI toys might have a role to play in children’s language and communica-tion, they felt social roles such as friendship would not be appropriate for GenAI toys. Finally, participants were concerned with the accessibility of GenAI toys, worrying that any possible benefits may only reach those who can afford them. Our findings provide a first insight into how the rise in GenAI is impacting the early years sector and show the need for both guidance and regulation to support practitioners in navigating this change.",

          "abstract": "Unexplained heterogeneity is a pervasive challenge that undermines the validity of meta-analytic inferences, often even after accounting for plausible moderators. To address this issue, this paper introduces a Bayesian meta-analytic mixture modelling approach that enables data-driven clustering of effect sizes. The resulting mixture components can subsequently be interpreted in light of study characteristics and domain knowledge, providing a principled, data-driven way to understand heterogeneity. To accommodate publication bias, I combine the mixture modelling framework with selection models. The number of mixture components and the presence and type of publication bias can be evaluated using Bayes factors. Two simulation studies validate the method and compare it to existing publication bias correction methods. Results show that wrongly assuming effect sizes follow a single normal distribution can substantially distort inferences from standard publication bias correction methods, which can be addressed by using meta-analytic mixture modelling. To facilitate application in practice, I implemented the methods in the R-package metamix.",

          "abstract": "While excessive academic anxiety significantly impairs student learning and well-being, the foundational cognitive antecedents that predict divergent threat appraisals and anxiety responses remain insufficiently theorized. Drawing on Control–Value Theory and the Transactional Model, this study proposes a Belief–Value–Appraisal (BVA) Model, which contends that academic beliefs function as the key predictors of anxiety by shaping students’ value orientations and threat appraisals. To delineate key beliefs most salient to academic anxiety, we conceptualized a framework categorized by belief referents (i.e., the specific targets of students' convictions), covering: (1) academic competition, (2) personal ability, (3) outcome uncertainty, and (4) the structural nature of competence. We empirically tested this framework using path analysis with a sample of 1,391 high school students. The results primarily support the BVA model: zero-sum competitive beliefs are associated with increased anxiety via a cascade of extrinsic value orientations and elevated threat appraisals, whereas beliefs in conformity to natural outcomes serve as protective factors by negatively predicting this maladaptive chain. By articulating the BVA Model, this research illustrates that academic beliefs represent a foundational cognitive antecedent of the appraisal processes that generate academic anxiety. This perspective offers new avenues for educational intervention, emphasizing the cultivation of adaptive academic beliefs in educational practice.",

          "abstract": "Slow-moving environmental hazards create uneven stress and conflicting risk perceptions, which can weaken solidarity. Yet, how leadership and identity can manage such diversity remains unclear. We shed light on this issue through an ethnographic study of identity leadership in a school in Finland with long-standing poor indoor-air quality and health issues. We identified five components (i.e. contents) of shared social identity managed by the principal that acted to support good morale and mutual support in the group. Together these identity contents produced a system of meanings offering a shared social identity to both those whose health was impacted by the stressor and those who were largely unaffected. We conclude that leaders are not only identity entrepreneurs and impresarios who manage and craft shared identities, but they are also ‘conductors of identity’ who play a key role in stabilizing a system formed by different identity contents.",

          "abstract": "Although body image scholars are increasingly centering marginalised communities in their research, individuals who identify as asexual or on the asexual spectrum remain largely invisible in this work. To overturn this, we explored understandings and experiences of positive body image in asexual adults using reflective thematic analysis. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 asexual adults (five woman-identifying, six man-identifying, four identifying as gender diverse or non-binary; aged 20 to 45 years) from the United Kingdom. Our analyses revealed four themes that illustrate the core characteristics of positive body image in our participants: Appreciating and Respecting the Body; Body Authenticity; Body and Self-Acceptance; and Countering Aesthetic Norms. Our findings suggest that, while some aspects of positive body image in asexual individuals reflect similarities with other communities, the challenges of heteronormativity and allonormativity mean that asexual individuals sometimes rely on unique processes to develop and maintain positive body image. Further research with this marginalised community is necessary to better understand how journeys towards asexual identities can foster more positive body image, and what this may mean for allonormative societies.",

Its efficacy has been demonstrated in semi-scripted laboratory studies but has yet to be tested in less controlled contexts. Within the current study, we developed and evaluated a 2-hour training module designed to teach novice interviewers to independently apply the SoS approach in mock interviews. Participants (N = 31) were randomly assigned to one of three training conditions: Basic, SoS, or SoS-Delay, and conducted four interviews each with mock suspects (N = 125). Participants assigned to Basic only received foundational interviewing training before conducting their interviews. Participants in the SoS and SoS-Delay conditions received the same foundational training as well as the SoS module, though SoS-Delay participants received the SoS training after completing half of their interviews. We predicted that interviews that were based on SoS training (i.e., all SoS and the latter half of SoS-Delay interviews) would outperform those that were solely based on basic training (all Basic and the former half of SoS-Delay interviews). Interviews based on SoS training involved more frequent use of SoS tactics and obtained more general information from mock suspects than those based on Basic training. However, we observed no significant training-related differences in interviewers’ ability to elicit previously unknown information. However, the use of several SoS tactics was positively associated with eliciting such information. These findings suggest that even brief SoS training improves novice interviewers’ use of tactics and ability to elicit information.",

The present study aimed to investigate the network structure linking PEs, social functioning, and loneliness, and to identify the central mechanisms underlying these associations. \nMethods: We analyzed data from a representative sample of Slovak adults (N = 1200) who completed validated measures of PEs, loneliness, social functioning, emotional distress, social motivation, and mentalizing. A regularized partial correlation network was estimated using EBICglasso, comprising 17 nodes. Centrality indices and edge weights were used to determine the most influential nodes and connections. \nResults: The network revealed 40 non-zero edges. Friendship approach, bizarre experiences, social withdrawal, paranoia, and avolition emerged as the most interconnected nodes. Paranoia was strongly associated with loneliness and social withdrawal, while avolition was linked to loneliness and reduced social participation. Negative affect showed associations with loneliness and diminished participation. Social withdrawal linked negative symptoms to diminished social engagement and interpersonal communication. In contrast, hallucinations and grandiosity showed no notable direct associations with social functioning or loneliness. \nConclusion: These findings highlight paranoia, social withdrawal, and avolition as central mechanisms connecting PEs with social functioning and loneliness, while social approach motivation may serve as a protective factor. The results support a dimensional model of psychosis and point to early social and motivational targets for intervention.",

          "abstract": "A short-term memory (STM) version of the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm was employed to investigate how true and false recognition evolved as STM contents were lost over a short time window immediately after initial encoding. Presentations of five-word DRM lists were followed by list-specific recognition tests applied either immediately or after a distractor-filled retention interval of 3, 9, or 27 s. Results showed a decrease in the probability of true recognition and an increase in the probability of false recognition as the retention interval grew longer. Based on the fuzzy-trace theory, we suggest that this pattern emerged from the different durability of item-specific phonological representations, which would play the dual role of supporting true memory and preventing false recognition, and integrative semantic representations, whose overlap with the critical items would give rise to the DRM illusion. As a further contribution, our study helps establish the DRM illusion in STM as a genuine and robust phenomenon by showing that it can be observed even with no delay and no intervening distraction between study and test, and that it occurs when participants are explicitly warned about the presence of semantically related distractors and instructed not to be misled by them.",

          "abstract": "Bilingualism has been proposed to confer advantages in cognitive aging, yet the neural mechanisms underlying any such advantages remain debated. In a pre-registered analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from elders in the HABS-HD cohort, we asked whether bilingualism affects three measures of brain structure (total brain volume, hippocampal volume and white-matter lesions) and/or moderates the relationship between brain structure and two measures of cognition (executive function and episodic memory). Overall, we found no significant differences between bilinguals and monolinguals in their baseline brain structure or subsequent change in brain structure, suggesting that a life of bilingualism does not affect Brain Reserve or Brain Maintenance in old age. However, bilingualism did moderate the baseline relationship between total brain volume and executive function, and between hippocampal volume and episodic memory, such that these cognitive functions were less dependent on these brain measures in bilinguals. This suggests that bilingualism functions as a form of Cognitive Reserve. Further, exploratory analyses showed that the effects of bilingualism on hippocampal volume, and on its relationship with episodic memory, might differ according to clinical dementia status. In summary, our findings suggest that bilingualism is associated with altered brain–cognition relationships, rather than with preservation of brain structure.",

The Global Burden of Disease study identified key dietary exposures linked to health outcomes, but dietary exposures are not yet linked to mental disorders in the Global Burden of Disease, which led to the establishment of the Global burden of disease Lifestyle And Mental Disorder Taskforce to investigate diet–mental health associations, including the role of ultra-processed foods Aim: To assess the prospective associations between dietary exposures and the incidence of depressive symptoms among Brazilian adults participating in the NutriNet Brasil Cohort Methods: Data from 18,033 adults free of depression at baseline were analyzed. Dietary intake was assessed using two web-based 24-hour recalls (Nova24h). Exposures included food groups and nutrients defined by the GLAD project. Incident depressive symptoms were identified using the PHQ-9 scale (score ≥9) during a 31-month follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models were applied, and the models were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: During follow-up, 3,590 participants developed depressive symptoms. Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, unprocessed/minimally processed whole plant foods, fiber, and calcium were inversely associated with depressive symptoms (varying from 4% to 8% lower risk). Conversely, higher consumption of processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, ultra-processed foods, sodium, and trans fatty acids was associated with an increased risk (varying from 6% to 21% higher risk). Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Healthy dietary patterns rich in unprocessed and minimally processed foods and low in ultra-processed products were associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms. Findings reinforce diet as a modifiable determinant of mental health and support policies promoting unprocessed and minimally processed foods and regulating ultra-processed products.",

One example are the apparently opposing conceptualizations of trust as a inner state versus as behavior and surprisingly weak correlations between them. We propose to integrate disparate research traditions by conceptualizing trust as a favorable attitude towards accepting vulnerability towards a trustee—the Trust-as-Attitude Perspective (TAP). By drawing parallels between trust and attitudes, TAP leverages decades of attitude research to systematize core trust phenomena and resolve critical puzzles. For instance, implications from the attitude-behavior-consistency debate can resolve the inconsistent findings between self-reported trust and trust behavior; research on affect, self-perception, and implicit processes reveals often overlooked drivers of trust (behavior) beyond cognitive deliberation.",

A total of 346 adults completed an online survey including the YFAS 2.0, measures of maladaptive eating, impulsivity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and social desirability. Translation followed established cross-cultural adaptation procedures, and psychometric analyses examined factorial structure, internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. Food addiction (FA) prevalence was 9.3%. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original unidimensional structure of the 11 diagnostic criteria, with strong factor loadings (.73–.94) and good model fit. Internal consistency (KR-20 = .86) and test–retest reliability (ICC = .70) were adequate. FA symptoms were found correlated with related constructs, including BMI, depressive and anxiety symptoms, emotional and uncontrolled eating, and impulsivity— particularly urgency—demonstrating convergent validity. Weak but significant correlations emerged with cognitive restraint and (lack of) perseverance, whereas no meaningful associations were observed with sensation seeking or social desirability, providing evidence for discriminant validity. Item-level analysis of the short-form item set indicated largely comparable but partially shifted highest-loading items relative to the original mYFAS 2.0 configuration, suggesting possible cultural or linguistic influences on item functioning. Overall, findings indicate that the Turkish YFAS 2.0 is a valid and reliable measure for assessing addictive-like eating in non-clinical adult populations. The scale performs similarly to previously validated international versions and provides a robust instrument for future research on food addiction, emotion-related eating, and associated psychological correlates among Turkish-speaking individuals.",

          "abstract": "Understanding human personality from nonverbal behavior is a longstanding challenge in psychology and artificial intelligence. This study presents a video-based, automated framework for personality recognition that integrates dynamic visual cues with the PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) emotional state model. We introduce the Cross-Modal Attention Vision Transformer (CMA-ViT), a dual-stream, multi-task learning model that fuses raw video frames with pre-extracted features, including facial action units, head motion, gaze, and frame-by-frame PAD values. The model captures temporal dynamics in emotional expression, head motion, and gaze patterns to infer the Big Five personality traits.\n\nExperiments on the MDPE dataset demonstrate robust performance, with an average classification accuracy of 71.7%, highest for Neuroticism (90.1%) and lowest for Openness (57.4%), suggesting that not all of the personality traits are explicitly expressed in observable behaviors. Gradient-weighted feature importance analysis revealed that PAD emotional features, gaze patterns, and head-related cues are the primary contributors, while facial action units introduced noise in this dataset. Temporal analysis of PAD fluctuations further indicated that indices such as variability, frequency, intensity, and transition rate provide trait-relevant signals, supporting the notion that personality is reflected not only in average states but also in dynamic patterns of emotional change.\n\nThese findings have methodological and theoretical implications: they highlight the value of integrating multi-dimensional information---such as temporal emotional dynamics, head motion, and gaze---for accurate personality recognition, challenge assumptions about the predictive role of facial actions, and empirically support dynamic models of personality such as Fleeson's Density Distribution Theory. This work provides a novel, interpretable framework for video-based personality computing, advancing both the accuracy and theoretical grounding of automated trait inference.",

Most existing systems are evaluated in controlled settings, focus primarily on in-person interactions, or rely on restrictive assumptions (e.g., requiring multiple speakers within fixed temporal windows), limiting generalizability to real-world use. We present an on-watch interaction detection system designed to capture diverse interactions in naturalistic settings. A core component is a foreground speech detector trained on a public dataset. Evaluated on over 100,000 labeled foreground speech and background sound instances, the detector achieves a balanced accuracy of 85.51%, outperforming prior work by 5.11%.\n\nWe evaluated the system in a real-world deployment (N=38), with over 900 hours of total smartwatch wear time. The system detected 1,691 interactions, 77.28% were confirmed via participant self-report, with durations ranging from under one minute to over one hour. Among correct detections, 81.45% were in-person, 15.7% virtual, and 1.85% hybrid. Leveraging participant-labeled data, we further developed a multimodal model achieving a balanced accuracy of 90.36% and a sensitivity of 91.17% on 33,698 labeled 15-second windows.

          "authors": "Patrick Dwyer; Rachel Schuck; Kaitlynn MP Baiden; Zachary J Williams; Mian Wang",
          "abstract": "Considerable disagreement surrounds the field of applied behaviour analysis (ABA), particularly in relation to autism. Some scholars, practitioners, and advocates – often aligned with the neurodiversity approach – argue ABA can be harmful and must be substantially reformed or even abolished. Others dispute claims of harmfulness and defend various aspects of traditional ABA scholarship and practice. This paper is a conceptual analysis of arguments and evidentiary standards in recent commentaries regarding ABA practices towards autistic individuals. We aim to identify where misunderstandings and mismatched evidentiary expectations may exacerbate polarization and to outline constructive directions for dialogue and research. Defenders of traditional ABA sometimes frame their positions as being largely objective, value-free, and evidence-based, while suggesting that criticisms are inaccurate or unscientific. We suggest the situation is more complex, with subjective biases, misinformation, oversimplifications, and fallacious arguments sometimes being apparent on both “sides.” For example, we argue that defenders of traditional ABA can mischaracterise the neurodiversity approach and key concerns about ABA. Furthermore, we suggest arguments in favour of traditional ABA and against reform efforts can sometimes raise crucial logical, scientific, and evidentiary issues. Moreover, we highlight the importance of emerging research regarding autistic people’s perspectives on the social validity of behavioural intervention. Ultimately, we propose that if researchers and practitioners actively seek to understand and engage with alternative points of view, and critically reflect on their own views to ensure they rest on solid logical and evidentiary foundations, ongoing progress towards more scientifically rigorous, socially-valid, and meaningfully effective intervention will accelerate.",

          "authors": "Wayne Kepner",
          "abstract": "Current frameworks for understanding addiction recovery rely on linear outcome metrics, stage models, or additive resource inventories that inadequately capture what is distinctive about the recovery process. Meanwhile, dynamical systems approaches to addiction, while capturing nonlinearity, are missing what may be recovery’s most defining feature: that the system is continuously rewritten, not only by each recovery attempt but by the passage of time itself. This paper introduces viability theory, a branch of mathematics developed to study constrained dynamical systems, as a formal framework for addiction recovery, and extends it to account for the recursive, self-modifying character of the recovery process. We propose that recovery constitutes a viability kernel (i.e., safe zone): the set of states from which a person can maintain functioning within livable constraints over time, given the choices and strategies available to them. Recovery capital serves as the underlying resource base that determines both the shape of the viable safe zone and the menu of options available to the individual. Three features distinguish this framework from existing models. First, recovery is reconceptualized as a process of recursive self-modification, not a dynamic one. The way the person’s life evolves, the limits of what they can endure, and the choices they can actually make are continuously reshaped both by prior recovery experience and by the temporal evolution of the person’s physiological, social, and structural circumstances, thereby rewriting the viability safe zone itself. Second, the viability boundary (i.e., danger zone) is functionally unknown to the person operating within it, creating a condition of high epistemic uncertainty. Third, boundary violation produces catastrophic collapse rather than gradual degradation, consistent with the phase-transition dynamics observed in relapse. This framework unifies recovery capital theory, dynamical systems approaches to return to use, and the lived phenomenology of recovery under a single formal apparatus, while making explicit that recovery operates by a different principle than the linear and dynamical systems models that precede it.",

We used the cultural fixation index (CFST) to measure cultural distance between people with high and low education in 95 countries (N=268,992), across beliefs, values, and behaviors assessed by the World Values Survey (2005–2022). We find that more highly educated people are significantly more culturally similar to WEIRD countries, such as the Anglosphere and Western Europe. Contrary to a general account of cultural transmission, education did not predict cultural similarities to other large, culturally and politically influential countries, such as China, Russia, and India. Contrary to modernization theories, income and self-reported subjective status did not show the same pattern of WEIRD cultural similarity. Our results suggest that cross-cultural samples of students or university-educated individuals over-represent cultural values that are typical of WEIRD countries.",

          "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment has been implicated in adulthood externalizing behaviors. However, this relationship could be explained by confounding factors (e.g., externalizing risk factors that co-occur with childhood maltreatment), rather than a direct effect of maltreatment on externalizing behavior. The current study extends this research using a longitudinal sibling study. Specifically, we leveraged the sibling-comparison design, which compares siblings from the same family to each other to examine whether greater maltreatment exposure at baseline (M age = 16.9) is associated with greater increases in externalizing behavior through young adulthood (M age = 29.1). Thus, this approach controls for familial risk factors shared by siblings. Participants included 365 probands and 376 siblings who were followed across three assessment waves. Participants were administered clinical interviews at each wave to assess alcohol use disorder (AUD), illicit substance use disorder (SUD), and antisocial behavior (ASB), and a self-report survey of exposure to physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Greater adolescent exposure to neglect and physical abuse were both associated with greater adolescent levels of AUD and ASB. Adolescent physical abuse, but not neglect, was also associated with greater illicit SUD symptoms. Additionally, greater emotional abuse was associated with steeper increases in AUD and illicit SUD symptoms through young adulthood. Importantly, none of these effects were explained by familial confounds. These findings provide strong evidence for adolescent emotional abuse playing a causal role in later AUD/SUD, suggesting that preventing such abuse and mitigating its effects may have downstream effects on reducing AUD/SUD.",

          "abstract": "Emotions change through internal momentum and reactions to events. However, the literatures examining these forces have proceeded separately, emphasizing either endogenous regulation such as baseline attraction or exogenous value signals such as reward prediction errors. This separation obscures a convergent account in which both influences jointly shape momentary affect. We address this gap by applying sparse equation discovery (SINDy) to a large happiness dataset from a mobile app gambling task (N = 16,337) and introduce DynAffect-C, a unified model that separates and quantifies endogenous and exogenous influences through inertial dynamics. DynAffect-C recovers known value-signaling effects and, with regulatory baseline-attraction terms, explains substantially more moment-to-moment variation than value-only models. The model reveals nonlinear pull toward baseline affect, alternating mood states in a subset of participants, and a trade-off between stronger internal momentum and transient impacts of external events. We reassess and validate these findings in an extended, laboratory-controlled version of the gambling task (N = 50). DynAffect-C thus integrates two literatures and yields a unified theory and testable equation for affect.",

          "abstract": "Interoception is increasingly recognized as an important factor in mental health, partly due to its central role in affective processes. However, it remains unclear what components are captured by self-reported interoception and whether they overlap with affective processes, like emotional awareness and regulation, hindering interpretation of relationships with psychopathology. The current study addresses this by situating the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness–2 (MAIA-2) relative to established affective measures to clarify its components and relationships with psychopathology.\nIn a community sample (N=658), network analysis investigated whether subscales from the MAIA-2, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale – 20, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire form cross-measure communities, reflecting divergent components. Structural equation modeling (SEM) further assessed coherence of the communities and associations with dimensional psychopathology (Personality Inventory for DSM-5-Brief Form).\nNetwork analyses identified a robust three-community structure: Primary Interoception (noticing body signals), Secondary Interoception (responses to body signals), and Affective Distance (poor awareness and acceptance of affect). SEM supported these as coherent components with unique patterns of relationships with dimensional psychopathology. Secondary Interoception and Affective Distance components were particularly associated with psychopathology. Notably, MAIA-2 subscales participated in all three communities and replicated community-level psychopathology relationships.\nBy clarifying the complex structure of the interoceptive–affective construct space, particularly in relation to the MAIA-2, this work improves interpretation of self-report findings and highlights where interoception aligns with or diverges from affective processes. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for more precise hypotheses, clearer characterization of interoceptive components relevant to psychopathology, and ultimately, better identification of intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "People describe social inferences using hundreds of words. How do people mentally represent these inferences? A long-standing tradition suggests that social inferences are underpinned by a small number of dimensions (e.g., warmth, competence). Another long-standing perspective argues they are more complex and require many dimensions to capture – an idea that has regained support by recent work using naturalistic designs. Motivated by this debate, we propose a network theory explaining how social inferences are mentally structured and generated in response to social information. Specifically, we propose that mental representations of social inferences form a small-world network with two principles: growth – the network expands by adding inference concepts, and preferential attachment – new concepts preferentially connect to well-connected ones. This representation is scalable while remaining cognitively parsimonious. We discuss the plausibility of this account based on existing social, developmental, and neurological findings. Our network theory accounts for classic phenomena—halo effects and psychological dimensions—as emergent network dynamics. Specifically, in small-world networks, nodes (social inferences) are connected with only a few steps from one another, so initial activation in a small set of nodes from constrained stimuli propagates broadly, producing synchronous covariation that mimics halo effects or low-dimensional structures. Dimensionality of activation gradually increases with input complexity. This network account reveals that established psychological phenomena may emerge from computations performed on mental representations in response to specific contextual inputs. By reconciling seemingly contradictory findings, our theory advances understanding of how the mind efficiently organizes vast social knowledge while adapting to environmental complexity.",

          "abstract": "How do U.S. partisans expect members of their political ingroup to react when they diverge from the typical view of their party on a partisan issue (e.g., a Democrat adopting a more conservative stance on private gun ownership)? How accurate are these expectations, and how do they influence whether people choose to speak up or stay silent? Five main studies and five supplemental studies (N = 4,535) employing diverse research methods—including surveys, behavioral outcomes, live participant interactions, and coded open-ended responses—revealed that partisans consistently overestimate the social sanctions they will face for changing their minds (average weighted effect size (d) of .87). These inflated expectations, which are associated with a greater likelihood of self-censoring dissenting views, may reflect a concern that dissent will signal greater group disloyalty than it actually does. Indeed, a brief intervention prompting individuals to reflect on their past loyalty to the group reduced this concern and was associated with more accurate expectations about ingroup reactions to their dissenting belief change. By examining the social forces that suppress dissent within political groups, this work offers insight into how to reduce conformity pressures and promote more open political discourse.",

This paper argues that cognitive science has lost sight of deliberative thought as a distinctive, core feature of human cognition. We survey areas of the literature that attempt to characterize deliberation and argue that they generally fail for one of two reasons: either they attempt to deflate deliberation by reducing it to cognitive states and processes that admit of automation and thereby fail to capture what is unique about deliberative thought, or they simply restate the non-automatic character of deliberation in other terms (“executive function” or “loading on working memory”) without providing a deeper understanding. We then point to some threads that offer hope for a theory of deliberation, including the potential role of consciousness as a driver of cognitive operations rather than a passive monitor of otherwise-implicit processing.",

Here, we combine a novel parallel-task reinforcement learning and working memory (RLWM) paradigm with a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HMM) to track trial-level cognitive states as participants freely and dynamically allocate attention between simultaneous low-demand and high-demand learning tasks. We show that our model adequately identifies behavior as reflecting one of three latent states: engaged in the low-demand task, engaged in the high-demand task, or disengaged. Across three independent samples (N=269), including a preregistered replication, we demonstrate that: (i) subjective effort predicts model-estimated disengagement, linking perceived cognitive load to attentional lapses; (ii) intrinsic motivation for cognitive challenge (Need for Cognition) predicts voluntary selection of the demanding task; and (iii) switches into higher demand are accompanied by increased policy entropy, revealing that effort investment reflects exploratory information-seeking. Our framework unifies perspectives from cognitive control, working memory, and curiosity-driven exploration, demonstrating that trial-to-trial fluctuations in attention provide a mechanistic window into how subjective effort, intrinsic motivation, and information-seeking jointly shape the dynamic allocation of cognitive resources.",

A pretest confirmed that dog meat evoked the highest moral concern, rat the highest contamination-related appraisals, and cow was neutral, while Study 2 substituted monkey to test generalization. Prejudice and punitive intent were strongest for morally protected animals (dog, monkey), moderate for rat, and lowest for cow. Visceral disgust showed more consistent association with bias, whereas compassion played a more limited role.

In contrast, experiment-level factors such as stimulus type and temporal progression had limited effects. Fine-tuning the Lookit model on Korean data improved target-domain performance, but at the cost of reduced accuracy on the original source dataset, consistent with catastrophic forgetting.

Stuttering is a fluency disorder characterized by recurrent disruptions in the temporal organization of speech, such as part-word repetitions, sound prolongations, and blocks. Despite the relevance of temporal aspects for the characterization of stuttering, there is currently no corpus in BP specifically designed to support rhythmic and prosodic analyses of stuttered speech. The proposed corpus aims to fill this gap through the systematic collection, acoustic analysis, and annotation of data from children, adolescents, and adults who stutter, encompassing a wide range of stuttering profiles. These profiles include different stuttering types and degrees of severity, co-occurrence with cluttering, covert stuttering, acquired stuttering, and speech produced before and after behavioral treatment. Within this phonetic model, stuttering is analyzed as part of a continuous rhythmic process rather than as a set of isolated disfluent events, allowing stuttered and non-stuttered intervals to be examined in terms of vowel-to-vowel (V–V) unit duration, rhythmic variability, and the organization of stress groups within a coupled-oscillator framework. The corpus design integrates clinical and acoustic variables, enabling a detailed investigation of how stuttering affects speech rhythm in BP.",

          "title": "Why Conventional Practices in Construct Validation Provide Limited Evidence of Construct Validity",
          "authors": "Leon Patrick Wendt; Steffen Müller",
          "abstract": "The construct validity of psychometric instruments is a foundation of psychological science, ensuring that they measure their intended constructs rather than unintended ones. Yet some conventional construct validation practices produce weak, uninformative evidence and fall short of the strong, risk-bearing tests emphasized by validity theorists. As a result, the available evidence is often insufficient to support meaningful claims about construct validity. To address this issue, we introduce a framework based on Meehl’s logic of hypothesis testing that can be used to evaluate the evidential value (or quality) of construct validation efforts. We define evidential value as the extent to which conducting a test of construct validity can shift confidence in the proposed construct interpretation over plausible alternative interpretations. Using this framework, we identify three conventional practices that contribute to low evidential value in construct validation: (a) treating constructs as conceptual placeholders, (b) overrelying on generic psychometric methods, and (c) performing post hoc revisions to the nomological network (i.e., the Lakatosian defense). This article demonstrates how using these practices allows virtually any psychometric measure to be portrayed as “validated”, while providing only nominal evidence of construct validity. We offer recommendations to guide researchers in achieving construct validation of high evidential value.",

          "authors": "Aliona Tsypes; Joseph T. McGuire; Alexandre Dombrovski",
          "abstract": "Background. People in a suicidal crisis feel forced to choose among coping, waiting passively, or attempting suicide. They must continually decide whether to persist in their efforts to cope or quit.  One hypothesis is that suicidal behavior reflects a preference for immediate escape over longer-term prospects, but findings from delay discounting studies have been mixed. Importantly, these studies relied on hypothetical choices without real waiting and did not require people to re‑evaluate ongoing actions as events unfolded. We examined (1) quitting vs. re‑engagement after setbacks and (2) calibration of persistence in depression and attempted suicide.\nMethods. Adults from a mid‑ to late‑life depression cohort (N=277; 87 attempters, 59 ideators, 63 depressed, 68 controls) completed the Willingness‑to‑Wait task, in which brief persistence (~3 s) maximized reward, whereas longer waits were counterproductive. Immediate quitting was modeled with multilevel logistic regression; quitting latency with Cox mixed‑effects models. Exploratory analyses examined attempt lethality and age of first attempt. Sensitivity analyses accounted for impulsivity, cognition, and personality. \nResults. Suicide attempters were more prone to quit immediately after a prior-trial failure than other groups. Once a wait began, attempters and depressed non-suicidal participants over-persisted relative to controls. Earlier age of first attempt, but not attempt lethality, was linked with stronger loss-triggered quitting and overpersistence. Findings were robust to confounds. \nConclusions. Depression was associated with maladaptive overpersistence, whereas suicide attempts were additionally predicted by loss-triggered disengagement. Behavioral intervention targets aimed at improving re-engagement after failures may help people problem-solve more effectively in a suicidal crisis.",

          "abstract": "Background: People with intellectual disability experience higher rates of multi-morbidity, preventable deaths, and barriers to healthcare access compared to the general population. Emerging digital technologies have been identified as potential tools to address these healthcare disparities, but evidence examining their application, effectiveness, and feasibility for people with intellectual disability remains fragmented across multiple disciplines.\nObjective: To examine applications of emerging digital technologies for health outcomes in people with intellectual disability and evaluate evidence for their effectiveness and feasibility across health domains.\nDesign: Scoping review conducted following Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. \nMethod: Systematic searches were conducted across PsycINFO, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases in June 2025. Studies were included if they reported on emerging digital technologies (excluding telehealth) used to support health outcomes for people with intellectual disability, presented quantitative or qualitative data, and were published from 2015-2025. \nResults: Thirty-six studies were included, spanning seven health domains. Physical activity and motor skills were the most frequently addressed domains, whilst healthcare access and mental health remained underexplored. Technologies included gaming consoles, head-mounted displays, mobile applications, and augmented and mixed reality technology. Most interventions reported improvements on primary outcome measures including physical fitness, balance, anxiety reduction, and skill acquisition. Minor adverse effects including motion sickness and equipment discomfort were noted in some studies. Most interventions required continuous support during use and were delivered in institutional settings rather than home or community contexts. Only eight studies involved people with intellectual disability in intervention development. \nConclusion: Emerging digital technologies demonstrate feasibility and safety for people with intellectual disability across multiple health domains. Research to date has focused on physical health applications using readily available consumer technologies. Future research should expand to healthcare access and mental health interventions, involve people with intellectual disability as partners in co-design processes, and demonstrate pathways to independent use in home and community settings to address documented health disparities.",

However, evidence regarding the reliability and validity of EMA measures remains limited, and validated instruments are scarce, highlighting the need for EMA-specific psychometric evaluation.\nObjective.\tTo assess the reliability, validity, and structural characteristics of a brief 11-item smartphone-based EMA of mood in a non-clinical sample.\nMethods.\tWe used data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating a one-week digital self-efficacy training in 93 stressed Swiss university students. Baseline psychometric assessments included the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The EMA assessment included moods such as cheerful, irritated, anxious, happy, insecure, lonely, relaxed, sad, thoughtful, focused, and stressed. Analyses included descriptive statistics, internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha), and external validity (correlations between baseline questionnaires and participant-level aggregated EMA ratings from the first 24 hours). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and network analyses assessed the structure.\nResults.\tWe considered the data of all 93 participants for the analysis. Participants (78.5% female) were on average 23.27 years of age (SD = 3.49). EMA items showed normal distribution, good internal consistency (α = 0.88), and low correlations (0.19-0.39) with the BDI II, the PANAS (positive affect subscale), and the GSE. Moderate correlations (0.40–0.48) were found with the PANAS negative affect subscale, the STAI, and the PSS. An exploratory factor analysis indicated two or three factors, while network analysis revealed positive and negative affect communities. Confirmatory analysis supported the network model as best fit (CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.01).\nConclusion.\tSmartphone-based EMA of mood item set showed strong psychometric properties and distinguished positive from negative affect as well as depressive from anxious factors, supporting its use as a scalable tool for monitoring transient mood states in non-clinical samples.",

          "abstract": "Americans today report fewer friendships than ever before despite many opportunities for social connection. What prevents people from leveraging these opportunities? Prior work documents a “liking gap,” whereby people underestimate how positively others evaluate them, but this research has focused largely on first encounters with strangers. It remains unclear whether similar biases persist when people consider reaching out to potential friends and what their consequences are. Across four preregistered studies (N = 1,211) with college and community samples, we consistently show that people believe others will judge their invitation attempts more harshly (meta-perception) than they judge others extending identical invitations (other-perception). Notably, we identified a novel three-dimensional structure underlying these perceptions: positive attributes (e.g., friendly, warm) operate as relative, comparison-based biases, whereas negative attributes function as absolute biases comprising two subdimensions—hesitant-negative (e.g., anxious, socially awkward) and assertive-negative (e.g., desperate, creepy). These biased meta-perceptions were stable individual differences, though the magnitude of bias decreased with age. Lastly, people’s meta- and other-perceptions of friendship initiation differentially predicted both short-term social judgments, such as likelihood of initiation and acceptance, and real-world outcomes, such as proactiveness in recent friendships and social network size. Together, these findings challenge the assumption of a unidimensional negative self-bias and demonstrate that biased meta-perceptions in friendship initiation reflect a broader socio-cognitive construal style with important implications for relationship formation across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Obesity remains a major public health concern in the United States, with disproportionately high prevalence in low socioeconomic status communities. Chicago communities experience elevated rates of both economic hardship and obesity. The present study used a cross-sectional ecological design to examine the relationship between socioeconomic hardship and adult obesity rates in Chicago, and evaluated physical inactivity as a mediator. Using publicly available data from the Chicago Health Atlas, analyses were conducted across 75 Chicago community areas (N = 75). Community-level hardship was operationalized using the Chicago Hardship Index, obesity was measured as the percentage of adults with a body mass index of 30 or greater, and physical inactivity was defined as the percentage of adults reporting no physical activity in the past month. Bivariate correlations and a mediation model were tested using Hayes’ PROCESS Macro. Results indicated that hardship was positively associated with obesity and physical inactivity. Physical inactivity significantly mediated the relationship between hardship and obesity, accounting for a substantial proportion of the association while retaining a significant direct effect. Correlational analyses revealed higher obesity rates amongst Black residents and females. Findings suggest that unmet basic needs in economically disadvantaged communities may impede engagement in health-promoting behaviors such as physical activity. These results highlight the importance of addressing structural and environmental barriers to physical activity when designing obesity prevention strategies. Policy and community-level interventions that target economic hardship and promote accessible opportunities for physical activity may be critical for reducing obesity-related health disparities in urban populations.",

          "abstract": "Racial discrimination is one of the most disruptive and psychologically damaging experiences that ethnoracially minoritized youth encounter. Research resoundly indicates that such discriminatory experiences can evoke trauma-like responses that can endure across development. However, literature documenting the traumatic implications of racial discrimination among youth remains limited by significant gaps that constrain understanding of the developmental significance and impact of this association. To this end, the current article aims to provide perspectives on avenues of future research needed to address these gaps and advance the developmental science of racial trauma. We first review recent developments and innovations that clarify the connection between racial discrimination and traumatic stress symptoms. We then provide six recommendations spanning conceptual and methodological domains that can guide the next generation of research. By highlighting these directions, we aim to support the development of a more robust evidence base needed to accurately conceptualize, assess, and intervene on the traumatic impact of racism-related experiences among ethnoracially minoritized youth.",

          "abstract": "Learning to read is a process and milestone with far‑reaching implications for education, vocation, and health. Most models and empirical studies of reading development, however, focus on school entry and often limit potential influences to children’s oral language and print-based skills. In contrast, a smaller corpus of behavioral, genetic, environmental, and neuroimaging research strongly suggests that reading development begins far earlier, in utero. This article first reviews major theoretical frameworks of reading development and synthesizes studies demonstrating that lower-order oral language and cognitive skills necessary for higher-order reading skills (e.g., reading comprehension) begin emerging during the perinatal period. It then characterizes the development of the “reading brain,” starting with regions involved in proficient reading and proceeding to neuroimaging work suggesting that the perinatal brain may already be equipped with a neural scaffold that supports reading development. Although brain scans are not suitable for identifying individual children at risk, they can inform accurate developmental, multifactorial models of reading that, in turn, can better guide preventive educational practices.",

          "abstract": "The Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale (SOBBS) was adapted to the Czech context using multiple independent translations and subsequent cognitive interviews. A pilot analysis of a secondary dataset (N = 959) evaluated using Dynamic Fit Indices (DFI) indicated a suboptimal fit for the original structure (χ²(76) = 569.253, CFI = .903, RMSEA = .083, SRMR = .065) and a lack of scalar invariance. Subsequently, data for the main study were collected from a non-random online sample of 548 participants, including 72% women and 27% men, aged 18–75 years (M = 25.8, SD = 10.1). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated unsatisfactory fit of the original model (χ²(76) = 292.76, CFI = .930, RMSEA = .072, SRMR = .054, BIC = 18321). However, a modified model excluding Item 2 (related to clothing choices) satisfied the dynamic fit criteria (χ²(64) = 210.40, CFI = .948, RMSEA = .065, SRMR = .053, BIC = 16825). These results support SOBBS’ two-factor structure (i.e., body self-monitoring and body as a representation of the Self). The modified SOBBS (13 items) demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .87, ω = .90 for the total scale; α = .87, ω = .87 for body self-monitoring; and α = .83, ω = .83 for body as a representation of the Self), and correlations with body shame and body self-monitoring scales provided evidence for concurrent validity. In contrast to the pilot study, measurement invariance of the modified model in the main study was supported at the level of the scalar model (i.e., with constrained factor loadings and intercepts), allowing for gender-based comparisons. The main analysis revealed a statistically significant but small difference in overall self-objectification between women and men (d = 0.22). An exploratory analysis showed a higher body surveillance in women (d = 0.48), with no significant differences in the body as a self-representation dimension. The results provide evidence supporting the construct validity and reliability of the modified Czech version of the SOBBS. The scale may serve as a useful tool for further research on self-objectification in the Czech context. We conclude with suggestions for future research, mainly wording revisions and clarifications for the conceptual placement of body shame within the Objectification Theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997).",

We found that reward information was reflected in pattern similarity during encoding in ventral temporal cortex and in changes in similarity from encoding to retrieval in anterior hippocampus (aHC). Strikingly, aHC reward-sensitive representations also varied with age such that adults’ memory benefitted from stability of hippocampal representations, whereas younger participants’ memory improvements were associated with greater drift in representations over time. Moreover, across all participants, reward-related univariate activation in the ventral tegmental area was associated with a greater tendency toward representational drift in aHC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that reward modulates neural memory representations, and that the representational patterns supporting reward-motivated memory shift with age.",

Importantly, in light of previous contradictory findings, we found that math achievement significantly mediated this relationship. Crucially, we found that gender, spatial anxiety, test anxiety, neuroticism, and math achievement together accounted for 66% of the variance in MA, with gender uniquely accounting for only 5%. \nConclusions: The commonly reported gender gap in MA is less pronounced when other anxieties are controlled for, especially given that we did not observe gender differences in the strength of the relationship between MA and math achievement.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discern the statistical regularities in our environments has been shown to support key cognitive functions, including attention, prediction and language learning. While most research has focused on stable regularities, real-world patterns often change over time, requiring adaptation. In the context of embedded pattern learning, where continuous input consists of hidden pairs or triplets, prior work showed that learning of an initial structure can hinder learning of an updated one. Alongside post-exposure (offline) learning measures, the current study incorporated online target detection during exposure to gauge real-time learning and adaptation to novel patterns more directly. In three separate blocks, participants were exposed to a stream of embedded pairs that were reshuffled into new pairs halfway through the stream. We administered the same task in both the visual and auditory modality, allowing us to explore modality differences. In the auditory modality, the online target detection measure revealed that participants learned both the initial and updated regularities, but with an advantage for learning the former. In contrast, the offline measure only evidenced recognition of the initial patterns, echoing previously reported primacy effects. In the visual modality, learning was not observed online but was revealed in sensitivity to both sets of regularities in the offline test. Our results provide evidence for flexible statistical learning of different types of sensory regularities under incidental learning conditions, which is important for the challenge of learning in dynamic environments. They also underscore the non-overlapping information that is provided by on- and offline measures.",

          "authors": "Mark Rubin",
          "abstract": "p-hacking occurs when researchers conduct multiple significance tests (e.g., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2) and then selectively report tests that yield desirable (usually significant) results (e.g., p2 ≤ 0.05;H0,2) without correcting for multiple testing (e.g., 0.05/2 = 0.025). In the present article, I consider p-hacking in the context of two philosophies of significance testing — the error statistical approach and the formal inference approach. I argue that although p-hacking inflates Type I error rates in the error statistical approach, it does not inflate them in the formal inference approach. Specifically, in the error statistical approach, the “actual” familywise error rate (e.g., 1 − [1 − 0.05]2 = 0.098 for two tests) is relevant because it covers both the selectively reported and unreported tests in the “actual” test procedure (i.e., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2). In this approach, Type I error rate inflation occurs because the “actual” error rate (0.098) is higher than the nominal error rate (0.05). In contrast, in the formal inference approach, the “actual” familywise error rate is irrelevant because (a) the researcher does not report a statistical inference about the corresponding intersection null hypothesis (i.e., H0,1 ∩ H0,2), and (b) the “actual” familywise error rate does not license inferences about the reported individual hypotheses (i.e., H0,2). Instead, in the formal inference approach, only the nominal error rate is relevant, and a comparison with the “actual” error rate is inappropriate. Implications for conceptualizing, demonstrating, and reducing p-hacking are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy has shown promising effects for treatment-resistant depression, but it remains unclear whether its proposed mechanisms --- reducing emotional repression, negative affect, and psychological distress --- actually mediate treatment outcomes. Methods: We reanalyzed publicly available data from a randomized controlled trial N = 86) comparing 20 sessions of Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy to waitlist control for treatment-resistant depression. Depression and process measures were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models analyzed trajectories; bootstrap mediation and cross-lagged panel analyses examined mechanisms. Results: Treatment produced large effects on depression at post-treatment (Cohen's d = 1.68) that continued to increase through 3-month follow-up (d = 2.50, 95% CI [1.88, 3.11]). All proposed process measures also showed very large effects (d = 1.96--2.95). However, neither emotional repression nor negative affect significantly mediated depression improvement. Distress showed apparent mediation, but a sensitivity analysis removing the overlapping depression subscale eliminated this effect entirely, confirming it reflected construct overlap rather than a genuine mechanism. Cross-lagged analyses revealed no temporal precedence for any process measure, indicating concurrent rather than sequential change. Discussion: These findings confirm that this psychotherapy produces large, durable effects on treatment-resistant depression. However, the theorized sequential mechanisms --- whereby reducing defensive functioning leads to improved affect regulation, which in turn alleviates depression --- were not supported. Instead, the treatment appears to produce broad, simultaneous therapeutic change across multiple psychological domains. Understanding how psychotherapy works may require finer temporal measurement and observational methods that capture in-session processes.",

In addition to transparency, confidentiality, and accessibility, participants emphasized the importance of a study to have a social impact on communities, be consistent with community values, and for research to be built on a foundation of trust between researchers, institutions, and communities. Conversations also revealed a clear demand for sharing results that are personally relevant or relevant to local communities. The results from this study have implications for all fields of psychological science and allied disciplines. Concrete recommendations are offered, including a call for more training and resources to conduct Community Based Participatory Research.",

          "authors": "Tadeg Quillien; Max Taylor-Davies",
          "abstract": "Predicting what other individuals will do is an important adaptive challenge for many organisms. Social prediction can be achieved by constructing a detailed model of the mental states of other agents, but this is computationally expensive. We argue that mindreaders can often bypass the need for constructing such a detailed model: they can keep track of the facts in their own world model that another agent also knows, instead of explicitly representing the content of the agent's world model. Using a simple computational approach, we find that this 'factive' mindreading strategy emerges as the optimal social prediction strategy for organisms with limited cognitive resources across a range of social ecologies. Factive mindreaders in our model behave like young human children and non-human primates: they successfully predict the behavior of knowledgable and ignorant agents, but fail to predict the behavior of agents with false and even accidentally true beliefs. Our results elucidate the computational principles underlying efficient social prediction, and provide a first-principles account for a range of empirical findings about human and non-human mindreading.",

          "abstract": "As debates over the impact of smartphones on young people intensify, we urgently need ways to identify which smartphone behaviours are related to poorer mental health. While many approaches focus on specific harmful or beneficial smartphone activities, here we instead suggest that the relationship between smartphones and mental health may partly depend on how users transition between activities. To test this, we develop a novel network analysis method to analyze objective smartphone data. We construct networks capturing how each user journeys across mobile Apps within a smartphone usage session, which we term ‘App-journey’ networks. Across a dataset of participants aged 18-22 (n = 82), exploratory statistical analyses show that features of ‘App-journey’ networks correlate with user mental health and attentional control. For example, users with higher depressive symptoms typically transition to a wider variety of Apps within each phone session (higher network density) and are less likely to confine each phone session to repeated groups of Apps (lower network modularity). Additionally, specific Apps which users report using more automatically are more central in App-journey networks than Apps users report using less automatically. In contrast to features of App-journey networks, time spent on one’s phone is not significantly related to mental health. In summary, this novel method to study smartphone use abstracts away from activities themselves and instead quantifies patterns of activity transitions. We show such transition patterns are related to user mental health and subjective experiences of automatic use, thus representing targets for future research and interventions.",

          "authors": "Benedek Kurdi; David Melnikoff; Adam Morris",
          "abstract": "The tide is turning against a major idea in social psychology: that implicit evaluations reflect mental content that lies beyond conscious awareness. This view is being reconsidered in light of mounting evidence that people can predict their own implicit evaluations with high accuracy. However, there are reasons to question whether such predictive accuracy reflects introspective access. First, prior studies have relied almost exclusively on familiar targets (e.g., racial groups), allowing predictions to be informed by background knowledge (e.g., knowing that a group is stigmatized) rather than introspection. Second, implicit and explicit evaluations have been highly correlated in prior work, enabling accurate predictions simply by assuming that implicit evaluations mirror explicit ones. Here we report eight experiments (five preregistered; N = 6,794) designed to minimize these non-introspective routes to predictive accuracy. We introduced participants to novel targets and shifted implicit and explicit evaluations of these targets in opposite directions, rendering explicit evaluations an unreliable cue. Under these conditions, predictive accuracy ranged from low to non-existent: participants frequently anticipated shifts in their implicit evaluations in the opposite direction of the actual chance. These results generalized across two learning paradigms (impression formation and attribute conditioning), two implicit evaluation measures (IAT and EPT), and between-participant and within-participant designs. We consider multiple interpretations of these findings, including the possibility that implicit evaluations reflect mental content that is largely inaccessible to conscious awareness.",

Este artigo tem como objetivo discutir a pesquisa participativa como uma abordagem metodológica e epistemológica capaz de reduzir esse desalinhamento, com ênfase na inclusão de experts por experiência na produção do conhecimento, particularmente no campo da saúde mental. Trata-se de um artigo teórico, baseado em análise crítica da literatura internacional sobre pesquisa participativa, experiência vivida, experts por experiência e coprodução do conhecimento. São discutidos os fundamentos da pesquisa participativa, seus diferentes níveis de participação e suas implicações éticas, clínicas e epistemológicas. Argumenta-se que a articulação entre conhecimento acadêmico e experiência vivida contribui para pesquisas mais relevantes, acessíveis e alinhadas aos contextos reais de vida, além de favorecer intervenções mais viáveis e eticamente responsáveis. O artigo também identifica riscos associados à instrumentalização de experts por experiência, especialmente quando a participação ocorre de forma pontual ou desvinculada de espaços decisórios, bem como desafios estruturais para a consolidação dessas práticas no contexto brasileiro, incluindo limitações institucionais, regulatórias e formativas.

          "abstract": "Background: The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF) is widely used to assess childhood abuse and neglect in adolescents, but its scaling properties, meaning the ability of its subscales to form coherent and progressively ordered severity structures, have not yet been investigated.\nObjectives: This study aimed to evaluate the scaling properties, namely scalability and monotonicity, of the CTQ-SF among adolescents.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a probabilistic, stratified sample of 721 adolescents from public and private schools in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Brazilian Portuguese version of the CTQ-SF was administered to assess five trauma dimensions: physical neglect (PN), emotional neglect (EN), physical abuse (PA), sexual abuse (SA), and emotional abuse (EA). Mokken Scale Analysis was applied to assess scalability, using Loevinger’s coefficients, as well as latent and double monotonicity. Gradient maps were generated to visualize the scalability of the items and subscales.\nResults: PA and SA exhibited strong scalability and met both latent and double monotonicity assumptions, supporting their utility in severity-based assessments. EN and EA also demonstrated strong scalability, though some items showed violations of latent and double monotonicity. PN displayed very weak scalability and serious violations of monotonicity, indicating poor alignment with a unidimensional, progressively increasing construct of physical neglect.\nConclusion: Overall, the findings support the use of the PA, SA, EN, and EA subscales in adolescent populations, while highlighting the need for conceptual and operational revision of the PN subscale. As the first study to examine the scaling properties of the CTQ-SF, replication in diverse cultural and developmental contexts is recommended.",

          "abstract": "Background:\n\nThe number of autistic students entering higher education (HE) has increased, yet many continue to face systemic barriers that can hinder their academic success. Despite their unique cognitive strengths, such as hyperfocus, attention to detail, and strong analytical skills, many autistic students report challenges with academic learning experiences. This study aimed to develop and validate the Academic Learning Experiences Questionnaire (ALEQ), a tool designed to assess specific learning experiences and inform autism-inclusive educational practices.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe co-created the ALEQ with autistic and non-autistic students to assess learning experiences across five academic contexts: small and large group teaching, self-directed study, examinations, and coursework. A total of 829 university students (formally-diagnosed autistic: n = 106; self-diagnosed autistic: n = 112; non-autistic: n = 611) completed an online survey comprising the ALEQ and an autism screening measure (SRS-2). To establish the ALEQ’s psychometric properties, we conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and tested for measurement invariance between the autistic and non-autistic groups.\n\nResults:\n\nThe ALEQ produced seven theoretically relevant factors with good local and global fit: Microtransitions’, Social Anxiety, Sensory Reactivity, Planning and Prioritising, Monotropic Focus, Group Work and Global Comprehension). Configural and metric invariance were supported for this factor solution, demonstrating equivalence of the factor loadings across groups and warranting examination of group differences in ALEQ scores. Using this final, 34-item version of the ALEQ, autistic students reported significantly more challenges than non-autistic students across all five subscales, with the greatest disparities in Sensory Reactivity and Microtransitions.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe ALEQ provides a structured way to understand the academic challenges that autistic students face in different learning contexts. By identifying key learning experiences, it offers both a practical tool for educators and a measurement instrument for researchers that can identify adjustment needs and, ultimately, enhance accessibility and inclusion in HE.",

          "abstract": "Various methods exist to include quadratic or interaction terms involving latent\nvariables in structural equation models (SEM). Most use system-wide estimation,\nwhere all parameters are estimated simultaneously, and have been investigated in\nmodels with few nonlinear effects. Recently, structural-after-measurement (SAM)\napproaches have been proposed, where estimation proceeds in two stages:\nmeasurement model first, then structural model. Rosseel et al. (2025) extended local\nSAM (LSAM) to handle second-order nonlinear effects among latent variables. In this\narticle, we present a formula for two-step standard errors (SEs) not previously available\nfor LSAM. We also conducted two simulation studies varying latent exogenous\npredictor distributions (normal, right-skewed, uniform), reliabilities (0.4, 0.6, 0.8),\nsample sizes (400, 1000), and measurement error and structural disturbance\ndistributions (normal, right-skewed). The first study examined a model with three\nnonlinear effects. LSAM produced largely unbiased estimates with stable coverage,\nSEs, and Type I error rates, though power fluctuated and performance was adversely\naffected under low reliability, particularly with uniform latent exogenous distributions.\nLarger sample sizes mitigated these issues. Traditional methods (LMS, QML, UPI)\nshowed results consistent with prior literature. The second study, excluding LMS,\ntested a more complex model with eight nonlinear effects. LSAM maintained adequate\nperformance despite greater complexity, though similar limitations emerged and power\ndecreased under certain conditions. Traditional methods yielded more variable results,\nwith generally poorer performance relative to Simulation 1 and LSAM. Right-skewed\nmeasurement errors affected the abovementioned results more than right-skewed\nstructural disturbances, particularly under low and medium reliability.",

Concurrent validity was supported by positive correlations with the DASS-Y (r = .71-.82) and CPSS (r = .73), and negative correlations with the WEMWBS (r = -.53 to -.69). Moderate inter-factor correlations (r = .67-.77) provided preliminary discriminant validity evidence.

          "authors": "Arlen McKinnon; Gerda Kabailaitė; Robert D Rogers; Paul Rauwolf",
          "abstract": "Objective: Many of humanity’s largest challenges, such as managing our shared resources, are long-term collective action problems, where we must learn to cooperate with others over time. However, research has found that participants play repeated resource dilemma games less sustainably over time. Improving our understanding of this is vital to inform policy advocating long-term cooperation. One hypothesis is that increasingly uncooperative behavior is driven by other uncooperative actors – if others act unsustainably then other individuals reciprocate. Alternatively, given the environmental and social uncertainty often found in collective action problems, individuals might struggle to learn to find cooperative, sustainable solutions even if other uncooperative actors are removed. Here, we experimentally juxtapose these hypotheses. Method: Over two incentive-compatible experiments involving monetary payments (Experiment 1) and raffle tickets (Experiment 2), 351 participants played three consecutive resource dilemma games with three computer partners who collectively deployed a conditionally cooperative ('tit-for-tat') strategy (i.e., where one cooperates if others cooperate, but defects if others defect). The best strategy for the participant was to learn to sustain the resource, maximizing long-term gains. Results: By the third game, most improved their outcomes, but only 9.12% of participants found long-term sustainable strategies which outperformed short-term unsustainable strategies. We demonstrate that this failure is partially due to difficulty learning the social and environmental dynamics at play. Conclusions: These results suggest that most struggle to learn to act sustainably even when interacting with partners who are willing to cooperate, illuminating a systemic difficulty with learning to act sustainably over time.",

This study examined associations between distinct ACE types and the persistence of PLEs until 24 years old.\n\nMethods: Using longitudinal data from participants in the ALSPAC cohort with at least one PLE datapoint, we used group-based trajectory modelling to estimate longitudinal trajectories of PLEs from age 12-24. We examined their associations with bullying victimisation, maltreatment, parental mental health problems, parental substance abuse, parental separation, and parental intimate partner violence in infancy and childhood prior to first PLE experiences. \n\nResults: Amongst 4,448 participants, a three-group trajectory model provided the best fit, revealing low, increasing and persistent PLEs groups from ages 12-24. In fully adjusted multinomial logistic regression models, those exposed to bullying were more likely to belong to either the increasing (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.83, 95%CIs: 1.26 – 2.66) or high (RRR: 1.78, 95%CIs: 1.07 – 2.93) PLEs group than the low PLE group; those exposed to maltreatment were more likely to be in the increasing PLE group (RRR: 1.47, 95%CIs: 1.03 – 2.10). No other ACEs were associated with PLE trajectories.\n\nConclusions: Bullying was associated with persistent PLEs up to 24 years old, independent of other forms of childhood adversity, with timing-specific effects of maltreatment on increasing symptoms emerging later in adolescence. Findings provide further evidence for the importance of prioritising bullying and maltreatment reduction as salient public health targets.",

The present study investigated the use of digital flashcard applications among 245 French secondary school students (Grades 8–9) within a Research–Practice Partnership framework. We examined (a) whether academic level, self-efficacy, and growth mindset predicted voluntary adoption of the app, (b) whether study frequency predicted exam performance, and (c) whether a brief supervised group intervention increased subsequent usage. Usage data were collected automatically from 37 classroom flashcard sets across five subjects, and analyzed using regression and mixed-effects models.\nPrior academic level was the strongest predictor of spontaneous adoption: higher-performing students were more likely to use the application. However, growth mindset was positively associated with adoption among students with lower self-efficacy. The intervention increased the likelihood of adoption among low-performing students, reducing the gap with medium-level peers, although high-level students remained the most consistent users. Among users, study frequency predicted higher exam grades for low- and medium-level students, but not for high-level students.\nOverall, digital flashcards appear particularly beneficial for students with greater room for improvement. However, structured exposure may be necessary to promote long-term adoption of retrieval practice among those who could benefit most from it.",

We analysed 22 hours of naturalistic dyadic audiovisual conversation between teachers and learners, assessing which of the teachers’ verbal and non-verbal behaviours, and their combinations, impacted learning of unfamiliar objects’ names and semantic properties. We found that both verbal and non-verbal behaviours impacted learning, modulated by learner’s individual differences. While learning of names and semantic features was supported by different verbal factors, only meaningful gestures showed robust effects across the two outcome measures, underscoring the importance of these gestures in adult, in addition to child, learning. We thus provide the first snapshot of real-world adult learning, with implications for educational practice.",

          "abstract": "A central purpose of exploration is to reduce goal-relevant uncertainty. Consequentially, individuals often explore by focusing on areas of uncertainty in the environment. However, people sometimes adopt the opposite strategy, one of avoiding uncertainty. How are the conflicting tendencies to approach and avoid uncertainty reconciled in human exploration? We hypothesized that the balance between avoiding and approaching uncertainty can be understood by considering capacity constraints. Accordingly, people are expected to approach uncertainty in most cases, but to avoid it when overall uncertainty is highest. To test this, we developed a new task and used modeling to compare human choices to a range of plausible policies. The task required participants to learn the statistics of a simulated environment by active exploration. On each trial, participants chose to explore a better-known or lesser-known option. Participants generally chose to approach uncertainty, however, when overall uncertainty about the choice options was highest, they instead avoided uncertainty and chose to sample better-known objects. This strategy was associated with faster decisions and, despite reducing the rate of observed information, it did not impair learning. We suggest that balancing approaching and avoiding uncertainty reduces the cognitive costs of exploration in a resource-rational manner.",

          "abstract": "Wearable neurotechnologies collect brain data outside clinical settings, raising increasing concerns about privacy and data sharing among academics and policymakers. But are these concerns shared by the public? And if so, do they reflect the novelty of the technologies, the perceived accuracy of brain-derived inferences, or the special symbolic status people attach to the brain itself? We tested these possible explanations in four preregistered experiments (N = 627) conducted in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and the United States. Participants evaluated scenarios in which emotional states were inferred using one of three data sources: brain activity (EEG), heart rate, or pupil size. The scenarios varied in data recipient (public or private institutions) and data sharing purpose (personal or collective). Participants rated the acceptability of sharing each data type, as well as the perceived reliability of and familiarity with each method. Across countries and contexts, participants were consistently more reluctant towards sharing brain than heart data. This effect did not track perceived reliability: heart data were often judged as equally or more reliable than brain data. Familiarity with the technologies increased overall acceptance but did not explain the specific reluctance to share brain data. For the U.S., lower willingness to share brain data was specifically associated with viewing the brain as central to personal identity. These findings show that neurotechnologies are treated as uniquely sensitive not because they are seen as more informative, but because the brain is perceived as closely tied to the self.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) present a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric comorbidities, particularly anxiety disorders, depression, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These conditions substantially intensify the clinical, functional, and psychosocial challenges associated with the autism spectrum across the lifespan. This study aimed to analyze, through a narrative review of the literature, the association between ASD and these comorbidities, as well as their impacts on mental health, daily functioning, and overall quality of life. The literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, prioritizing recent and methodologically relevant studies addressing this topic. The findings indicate that symptomatic overlap between core ASD features and co-occurring psychiatric disorders complicates early identification, differential diagnosis, and clinical management. This overlap often leads to delayed treatment and suboptimal outcomes, underscoring the need for integrated, developmentally sensitive, and personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In addition, the literature highlights significant structural barriers, including a shortage of trained specialists, limited access to multidisciplinary services, and the lack of targeted public policies, all of which hinder the provision of adequate care for this population. In conclusion, multidisciplinary interventions, combined with social inclusion strategies, community-based support, family and caregiver guidance, and the promotion of neurodiversity, are essential to improve emotional well-being, functional autonomy, and quality of life for individuals with ASD. Such efforts also have a positive impact on families and caregivers, contributing to more equitable and effective mental health care.",

          "authors": "Samuel Finnerty",
          "abstract": "Policy responses to the climate crisis have lagged behind the scientific consensus on its seriousness, prompting a growing number of scientists to engage in activism, including civil disobedience. This shift challenges traditional norms of neutrality and objectivity, raising questions about how scientists reconcile their professional identity with activism and sustain engagement. Drawing on two years of immersive ethnography (participant observation and autoethnography) with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion (S4XR) in the UK, this study traces the lived processes through which scientists enter activism, manage identity tensions, and decide how far to go. Findings show that identity-aligned spaces legitimise first steps and foster belonging. Scientists strategically draw on professional expertise and scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, peer-reviewed papers) to legitimise action and unify scientist-activists; at the same time, these symbols present challenges, as not all scientists identify with them, and they may invite audience expectations about universal expertise. Over time, activism reshapes professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act and producing a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Sustained commitment depends on collective efficacy, peer affirmation, and care practices that enable self-determined roles and buffer burnout. Escalation is non-linear: risk thresholds often rise with experience, yet professional, personal, and ethical considerations continue to influence decisions. Structured around a process-oriented framework, the analysis identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories, from initial hesitation to sustained participation, offering insights for social psychological models of collective action and for strategies to engage scientists in effective, sustained climate action.",

          "abstract": "This position paper argues that Usable Security and Privacy (USP) research can only be as cumulative and trustworthy as its record of issuing and finding post-publication corrections, yet current infrastructure and norms make such corrections difficult to observe, evaluate, and act on. Errors are a normal by-product of complex empirical work, but when they persist silently in the publication record, they can compromise replication efforts, undermine evidence synthesis, and misdirect theory, practice, and policy. Drawing on a case study of major USP publishing platforms, we show that post-publication policies vary in clarity and scope, that basic descriptive statistics on corrections and retractions are not publicly reported, and that even when corrections exist, they can be hard to discover and may disappear when records propagate across platforms. We contend that these gaps are reinforced by a research culture that rewards novelty over correctness, limiting incentives to detect and publicly document errors. We therefore propose a coordinated agenda for post-publication integrity in USP: clearer and more coherent correction policies, systematic collection of correction and retraction cases in a public database, and point-of-use visibility via integration with existing meta-scientific services and researcher workflows.",

          "authors": "Niels Oliver Kempkens; Julia M. Haaf; Anna-Lena Schubert; Alodie Rey-Mermet",
          "abstract": "Attentional control refers to the ability to maintain a goal and goal-relevant information in the face of distraction. Typically, measures of this ability compare performance on incongruent trials that induce response conflict with congruent trials that do not. Previous research has highlighted the difficulty of obtaining attentional-control measures that have good reliability and that correlate across different tasks. To address this difficulty, Moretti et al. (2025, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition) have selected and analyzed only those trials with the highest response conflict. That is, in two tasks, they selected and analyzed the trials following congruent trials and the trials with a fast response. They concluded that their approach resulted in increased reliability and correlation estimates. While promising, the results raise several questions. Why was the increase in reliability and correlation estimates observed not only for fast but also for slow trials? Do the results stem from the corrections applied to compensate for the trial reduction inherent in the selection? Do the results generalize to other tasks and designs? The purpose of the present study is to address these questions. To answer the first question, we conducted a simulation. For the second and third questions, we plan to compute reliability and correlations on several existing datasets using hierarchical models. These models have the advantage of accounting for the trial reduction without corrections. Overall, the present study should clarify whether selecting trials improves the measurement of attentional control.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual learning helps listeners cope with the lack of invariance in speech perception. Exposure to a nontypical phoneme in disambiguating contexts can bias subsequent perception. Such learning is driven not only by lexical context but also by visual cues. One such visual cue is the beat gesture, a simple up-and-down hand movement that usually co-occurs with stressed syllables in everyday conversation. Beat gestures can influence stress perception and thus bias word recognition. However, gesture-speech temporal alignment varies substantially across speakers. The current study examined whether listeners can learn about speaker-specific gesture-speech alignment patterns from disambiguating auditory stress cues. Across three experiments, participants were exposed to a speaker consistently gesturing earlier than stressed syllables in one group, and later in the other. After exposure, both groups categorized minimal stress pairs (e.g., VOORnaam–voorNAAM) with ambiguous auditory stress cues and a beat midway between two target syllables. A reliable group difference emerged when the test stimuli were sufficiently ambiguous: word recognition was biased by the gesture-speech alignment learnt during exposure. However, this learning appeared not to generalize to novel words. Our results demonstrate that the learnt gesture-speech alignment can be applied to word recognition for the same speaker, optimizing face-to-face interaction.",

          "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly used to promote mental health and resilience, yet their applicability within racially marginalized communities remains underexplored. Ethiopian-Israeli young adults face chronic stressors related to socioeconomic disadvantage, racialized discrimination, and complex identity negotiations, creating a distinctive context in which mindfulness practices may function differently. The present qualitative study examines how Ethiopian-Israeli young adults experienced participation in a standard Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program and identifies cultural and structural factors shaping its relevance, acceptability, and impact. Twenty-five Ethiopian-Israeli young adults completed an eight-week MBSR course and took part in semi-structured in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Findings revealed four central themes: (1) layered stress arising from identity tensions, community responsibility, and experiences of racism; (2) transformative processes of mindfulness practice, including enhanced emotion regulation, embodied awareness, and coping with discrimination; (3) cultural and practical barriers to engagement, such as norms discouraging emotional vulnerability, emphasis on productivity, and competing life demands; and (4) conditions for safety and belonging, highlighting the importance of group composition, facilitator qualities, delivery format, and the implicit presence of racism as an unspoken concern. Participants described mindfulness as a meaningful resource for coping with stress and discrimination, yet emphasized that its effectiveness depends on cultural resonance, practical framing, and relational safety. The findings underscore that mindfulness should not be assumed culturally neutral and point to the need for contextually grounded adaptations. This study contributes to growing efforts to develop culturally responsive MBIs that address minority stress and support well-being within marginalized communities.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous fluctuations in pupil size are often interpreted as a direct readout of arousal-related neural activity. When pupil size correlates with behavior, this is therefore assumed to reflect arousal. However, pupil fluctuations also have optical consequences: larger pupils allow more light in the eye, whereas smaller pupils improve focus. These effects are rarely considered. Generally, the relationships between pupil fluctuations, neural activity, and behavior are complex and context-dependent. We propose four mechanisms to better understand these relationships. The first is mediated by arousal. The second relates to the optical effects of pupil fluctuations. The third relates to visual stimulation, which both constricts the pupil and activates visual brain areas. The fourth relates to brightness constancy with respect to pupil size.",

          "authors": "Mark Rubin",
          "abstract": "p-hacking occurs when researchers conduct multiple significance tests (e.g., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2) and then selectively report tests that yield desirable (usually significant) results (e.g., p2 ≤ 0.05;H0,2) without correcting for multiple testing (e.g., 0.05/2 = 0.025). In the present article, I consider p-hacking in the context of two philosophies of significance testing — the error statistical approach and the formal inference approach. I argue that although p-hacking inflates Type I error rates in the error statistical approach, it does not inflate them in the formal inference approach. Specifically, in the error statistical approach, the “actual” familywise error rate (e.g., 1 − [1 − 0.05]2 = 0.098 for two tests) is relevant because it covers both the selectively reported and unreported tests in the “actual” test procedure (i.e., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2). In this approach, Type I error rate inflation occurs because the “actual” error rate (0.098) is higher than the nominal error rate (0.05). In contrast, in the formal inference approach, the “actual” familywise error rate is irrelevant because (a) the researcher does not report a statistical inference about the corresponding intersection null hypothesis (i.e., H0,1 ∩ H0,2), and (b) the “actual” familywise error rate does not license inferences about the reported individual hypotheses (i.e., H0,2). Instead, in the formal inference approach, only the nominal error rate is relevant, and a comparison with the “actual” error rate is inappropriate. Implications for conceptualizing, demonstrating, and reducing p-hacking are discussed.",

We compared traditional machine learning (ML) models, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), with two deep learning (DL) models (i.e., xDeepFM, FGCNN+xDeepFM) for predicting probable EDs among Chinese adolescents. Using a four-wave (18-month) longitudinal dataset, we predicted probable ED status at follow-up (T4) from risk factors assessed at T1–T3, with models trained and evaluated separately for females and males. Performance was assessed with accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. XGBoost achieved the best overall performance across sexes (accuracy = .9099, AUC = .9472, F1 = .6314) and outperformed the evaluated DL models. The hybrid DL model (FGCNN+xDeepFM) showed the second-highest performance. Feature-importance analyses indicated that prior eating disturbance was the strongest predictor for both sexes. Among females, the next highest-ranked predictors were body shame, peer appearance pressure, and weight bias internalization; among males, they were weight bias internalization, psychological distress, and family appearance pressure. Thus, traditional machine learning, particularly XGBoost, may support early detection of probable ED risks, while DL approaches were competitive but not consistently superior. Sex-specific profiles may inform tailored prevention.",

          "abstract": "Background: Chronic primary low back pain (CPLBP) is highly prevalent and associated with physical impairment and psychological distress. Fear avoidance (FA) is one contributing factor in the development and persistence of CPLBP. Previous studies proved existing connections between pain, physical activity, stress, and FA, which is also present in pain-free individuals. However, the roles of FA and psychophysiological stress responses have not been systematically disentangled and related to movement patterns combined in one standardized experiment involving pain induction. \nMethods: To address this gap, 76 pain-free participants (20: phase 1; 56: phase 2) will perform standardized movement tasks (Back Performance Scale, Sit-To-Stand-Test) with and without wearing a back pain simulator in a within-subject design. Movement will be recorded with wearable sensor-based and novel radar-based motion capture technology. Additionally, psychophysiological stress parameters (e.g. salivary cortisol, heart rate variability), and self-reports on stress, pain, and FA will be assessed. This will be followed by a qualitative feasibility and acceptability interview in phase 1. In this phase, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel back pain simulator enabling a standardized simulation of low back pain, and the motion capture technology. Phase 2 will investigate the effects of pain induction on self-reported pain, back pain-related movement parameters, and stress responses. Associations of these factors with FA will be analyzed. We anticipate high feasibility and acceptability. We expect higher pain ratings, lower mobility, and higher stress responses in the pain condition compared to the control condition. We expect FA to moderate mobility and stress responses in the pain condition.\nDiscussion: This study protocol establishes an experimental paradigm to investigate the association of pain, FA, movement, and stress in healthy samples under controlled pain conditions. This paradigm aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay of psychological and physiological mechanisms in CPLBP.",

Hence, the findings by Yang et al. may have been spurious and their conclusion of positive affect being necessary for life satisfaction premature. It is important for users of NCA to be aware that necessity effects in NCA do not prove necessity any more than correlations prove causality. For increased rigor, we recommend users of NCA to estimate, as we did here, ranges of spuriousness and to require that estimated necessity effects are above the range before concluding necessity.",

          "abstract": "The biological origin of the same-different concept has been extensively studied especially with pigeons, and attention and memory may be key factors in further understanding the mechanisms supporting the same-different concept formation. The primary goal of the present study was to investigate how the location of changed items affected pigeons’ performance on same-different discrimination between two successively presented multiple-item displays using the same training procedure as Gibson et al. (2011). However, after encountering pigeons’ difficulty in learning the discrimination (Experiment 1), we shifted our focus to discrimination training itself. The poor performance during training and the resulting pattern in the simplified test suggested that entropy, or degree of heterogeneity, of each display may have been more salient to the pigeons than the abstract same-different relationship between them. In Experiment 2, we switched to the training procedure based on Katz &amp; Wright (2006). This procedure, in which two displays were presented simultaneously, may facilitate learning by allowing pigeons to compare overall perceptual properties rather than relying solely on abstract relational concepts. In this revised task, one display was presented above the other, enabling perceptual comparison between the two displays. Although we observed slight accuracy improvement when single-item displays were used, it remained highly improbable that pigeons would achieve same-different discrimination between multiple-item displays under the current methodology. We discuss our task manipulations and the corresponding changes in pigeons’ performance, which may provide useful insights for developing robust training methods that enhance same-different discrimination learning in multiple-item displays.",

Adding to and going beyond previous literature, we additionally focused on the relationship between people’s estimation abilities and personal (i.e., habitual eating behaviour, general nutrition knowledge) as well as meal-related characteristics (i.e., meal size) as potential correlates. Data from 95 participants revealed that they were relatively accurate in estimating energy content, while they overestimated carbohydrates significantly across meals. Moreover, the data suggest that participants perceive overlaps in low-calorie and low-carb diets, as well as in low-carb and low-sugar diets. Yet, more research is needed to draw precise conclusions about perceived overlaps and to shed light on underlying mechanisms of overestimations. Interestingly, we did not find any clear pattern regarding personal characteristics as correlates of misestimations, but we found energy content misestimations to be more pronounced with increasing meal size.

However, little guidance is available regarding how to use EAMs to instantiate cognitive process theories, which often involve complex mappings of parameters to experimental designs. This tutorial illustrates how to embed such theories using the R package EMC2. We show how the effects of cognitive processes can be estimated by mapping EAM parameters to experimental designs using an augmented linear model language. We demonstrate with two examples. The first instantiates a theory of prospective memory. The second instantiates a theory of how humans integrate advice from automated decision aids into their choices. We then show how to combine these two different theories in a unified framework. We conclude by discussing further directions for theory embedding, including non-linear mappings from stimulus values to EAM parameters and the incorporation of trial-by-trial dynamics.",

Evaluation was informed by an early prototype of an AI enabled digital connector, prior to any design commitment or implementation.\nResults \nThe inquiry identified a set of pre-engagement conditions shaping whether participation in community-based social opportunities feels possible in practice, including discovery, identity and social fit, feasibility, readiness, and trust. Participants also raised system-level considerations relevant to youth social prescribing.  \nDiscussion\nEight practice-oriented recommendations are presented that position early-stage co-design as a means to support informed judgement about whether, how, and under what conditions youth-facing digital pathways to offline social connection should proceed within health and community systems, before tools are built.",

          "abstract": "Risk preference varies considerably across individuals, but the consequences and causes of this heterogeneity remain insufficiently understood. This study examines the predictive validity of risk preference for various life events (i.e., selection effects) and the role of life events in shaping risk preference (i.e., socialization effects). Using a large representative sample from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP; N = 14,558), we employed propensity score matching to construct synthetic treatment and control groups—individuals experiencing (or not experiencing) a life event—while controlling for various confounding variables. We then evaluated the extent to which general and domain-specific measures of risk preference predict the occurrence of 12 life events related to family transitions (e.g., marriage) and professional development (e.g., self-employment), as well as how these life events shape risk preference. Our findings provide evidence for selection effects by demonstrating that risk preference significantly predicts the occurrence of various life events. Furthermore, the predictive utility of risk preference generalizes across domains, with general or composite measures demonstrating somewhat superior predictive power relative to domain-specific ones. In turn, after adjusting for selection bias, socialization effects were negligible, with most life events showing no significant association with changes in risk preference. Overall, our results suggest that while risk preference has broad predictive power across various life areas, life events have a limited influence on shaping it. These findings reinforce the predominance of selection effects and underscore the importance of carefully distinguishing between selection and socialization processes.",

          "abstract": "Humans can flexibly organize their behavior to pursue hierarchically structured goals, dynamically updating their commitment to goals and their concomitant subgoals in response to changes in environmental contingencies. Through a novel hierarchical goal selection paradigm, we investigate human persistence patterns in goal and subgoal pursuit, especially in the presence of varying subgoal prospects. We observe that humans exhibit a depth-first commitment to hierarchical goals, preferring to persist on a goal--subgoal pair until termination rather than the breadth-first approach of alternating between subgoals within a goal. We also show that this depth-first persistence in goals and subgoals is modulated by goal and subgoal progress, respectively. We further demonstrate that a momentum-based account that parsimoniously estimates the values of ongoing goals explains depth-first patterns of persistence in hierarchically organized goals. We explicitly dissociate the effects of momentum computations from switching costs on goal persistence, and show that momentum computations drive persistence choices above and beyond dynamic costs imposed by switching goals and subgoals.",

Word-learning episodes were coded from a corpus of videorecorded shared-reading interactions between caregiver-child dyads (N = 78, children’s age range = 4;0 – 5;11). Results support the prediction that scaffolding and engagement are coupled during word-learning moments. This coupling was robust across reading media. Further, child age was a significant predictor of engagement. These findings confirm that engagement is a critical social interaction mechanism involved in the scaffolding process that supports word learning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sex differences in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) have been observed across several domains, including epidemiology and clinical presentation (e.g., age of disorder onset, comorbid mental disorders, OCD symptom dimensions). However, findings have been mixed, particularly with regard to possible sex differences in treatment outcome.\nMethod: Data of 2540 adolescents (16%, n = 417) and adults (84%, n = 2123) with OCD (59% female, n = 1508) who received inpatient treatment at the Schoen Clinic Roseneck (Prien am Chiemsee, Germany) between January 2015 and April 2024 were analyzed.\nResults: Female patients were younger, had a longer length of stay, were more likely to have OCD subtype with predominantly compulsive acts and comorbid anxiety-related and eating disorders and were less likely to have behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence than male patients. When examining self-report questionnaires, female patients had higher scores for compulsions in general and compulsive washing in particular, and for depressive, somatic, and anxiety symptoms. There were no sex differences in changes in OCD-specific and other symptoms from admission to discharge based on both self-reports and therapist ratings.\nConclusion: Despite sex differences in OCD symptom dimensions and comorbid symptoms, treatment response was comparable for female and male patients. These findings suggest that while sex may shape how OCD manifests, it does not appear to influence the degree of symptom improvement achieved during inpatient treatment.",

          "authors": "Katarina Kliit; Uku Vainik; René Mõttus",
          "abstract": "Relatively stable personality traits shape people’s motivations and attitudes, and their potential effect on pro-environmental attitudes and resulting behaviours can accumulate over time. However, narrow personality traits—nuances that tend to provide stronger and more refined associations with various outcomes—have received little attention in relation to pro-environmental attitudes. Furthermore, research has almost exclusively focused on self-reports that are prone to biases. This suggests that the associations between personality traits and pro-environmental attitudes have likely been underestimated. We collected participants' self- and informant-reports of narrow personality nuances and broad Big Five domains from three samples (Estonian, N = 20,926; Russian, N = 762; English, N = 600). This allowed us to estimate their true correlation (rtrue) with and predictive accuracy (rtruepred) for pro-environmental attitudes, while controlling for single-method, occasion-specific, and random errors and estimating the findings’ generalizability. The rtrues were higher than self-reports-based correlations, and nuances had larger effect sizes than domains. In the largest sample, the Openness (rtrue = .35) and Agreeableness domains (rtrue = .27) had the highest rtrues with pro-environmental attitudes. However, a range of nuances had even stronger rtrues , primarily those reflecting progressive views, care for other people, and appreciation of art. The combined predictive accuracy of nuances for pro-environmental attitudes reached nearly rtruepred = .60, even with only three “top” nuances; the domains’ predictive accuracy was lower (rtruepred = .50). The findings replicated well across samples and suggest that pro-environmental attitudes are linked with personality traits more strongly and in more nuanced ways than previously thought.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the dynamic interplay of persons and situations is central to explaining human behavior and experience. Although personality psychology has made substantial progress in\nconceptualizing and studying situations over the past decade, current approaches remain limited by their reliance on self-reports, which constrains the assessment of objective and temporally fine-grained situational information in everyday life. New technologies, such as mobile sensing methods, have been proposed to overcome these limitations by providing continuously collected data. Yet despite this potential, mobile sensing has not been fully integrated into situational assessment. To address this gap from a conceptual point of view, we identify three key challenges in situation research that hinder the investigation of person-situation relations and where mobile sensing can have great impact: (1) the neglect of objective situation cues and situation classes, (2) insufficient differentiation between person and situation measures, and (3) limited attention to within-situation dynamics. For each challenge, we outline next steps for integrating mobile sensing, discuss potential hurdles, and suggest possible solutions. We conclude by highlighting how aligning current challenges in situation research with mobile sensing methods can advance the study of person-situation relations with unprecedented ecological validity and temporal resolution.",

I show that decline effects can arise as an artifact from a much simpler source: the original article determining the sign of the effect in a meta-analysis.

Robust predictors of faith development included low agreement with the truth of texts and teachings subscale of the Religious Schema Scale (RSS), low frequency of prayer, and high openness to experience (NEO-FFI), while xenosophia/inter-religious dialog emerged as a moderately significant predictor. Predictive validity of FDI was demonstrated, though with limited strength.

This approach risks the “perils of partialing” in which partial constructs have lower reliability and different nomological nets than their unpartialed counterparts. The present studies tested the effects of partialing optimism and pessimism using structural equation modeling to test differences in external validity and intraclass correlations (ICC) to test similarity of profiles. In Study 1 (N = 2,281 older adults), the optimism-pessimism correlation was modest (r = -0.32), but nomological nets for unpartialed and partialed constructs with personality and health were significantly different (all p &lt; .00001). In Study 2 (N = 739 younger and midlife adults), the optimism-pessimism correlation was higher (r = -0.61). Nomological nets were significantly different (all p &lt; .00001). Examination of item correlations indicated that partialed constructs may have lost convergent validity with key theoretical elements of trait optimism. Differences between optimism and pessimism were fewer than those between each and its partialed counterpart, and results with partialed optimism and pessimism constructs should be viewed with caution.",

When AI can provide emotional support, people become less willing to empathize with the suffering of others. Four studies reveal “empathy offloading:” when people see AI as capable of empathy, people save themselves the emotional labor of emotionally connecting with others. Higher perceptions of AI’s capacity for empathy both correlationally (Study 1) and causally (Study 2) increase empathy offloading. When people learn that someone has received emotional support from large language models (LLMs), they become less willing to empathize with them (Studies 3 and 4). Empathy offloading extends beyond simple scale ratings and includes reduced perspective-taking (Study 3) and offering fewer empathic responses (Study 4). Empathic AI might provide low-cost, easily accessible emotional support, but it risks fraying the ethical and emotional commitments to other human beings.",

We tracked 263 children for three years (starting in grades 1-3) and measured spoken word recognition annually using the Visual World Paradigm alongside standardized language and reading assessments. Principal component analysis of fixation dynamics identified five orthogonal dimensions explaining 80% of the variance, revealing a multidimensional architecture. Growth-curve analyses showed that the second dimension—activation rate—showed robust developmental change and uniquely covaried with language ability, independent of non-linguistic processing and cognitive regulation. A third dimension—competitor suppression—was also linked to language ability, particularly among children with weaker language skills. Together, these findings demonstrate continued reorganization of spoken word recognition across later childhood, with distinct competition mechanisms differentially linked to language development.",

These may include a loss of trust in research and healthcare actors in oncology and a rejection of their recommendations, sometimes in favor of risky alternative practices. Research on this topic has most often focused on analyzing factors related to the victims of misinformation. However, the producers and vectors of misinformation remain understudied.\n\nMethods:\n\nWithin this framework, the authors of the present manuscript propose a critical analysis of an article in which they, as well as other individuals and institutions, are subjected to personal attacks. The article also contributes to the production and dissemination of misinformation related to oncology. The authors conducted an analysis of the rhetorical devices and fallacious arguments contained in the article, drawing on established academic approaches, typologies, and reference works. In addition, an analysis of potential breaches of editorial and ethical standards was carried out in comparison with several sets of widely recognized guidelines.\n\nResults and discussion:\n\nThe analysis of the article reveals the use of numerous non-scientific persuasive argumentative strategies (e.g., logical distortions, emotional appeals, diversionary tactics, and discrediting of opponents), as well as several potential shortcomings on the part of both the author and the editorial process with regard to ethical and integrity standards. In particular, the similarities between the analyzed article and misinformation discourse are discussed, along with the potential harmful effects on the credibility of research and healthcare in oncology, and the resulting perspectives for research and for combating misinformation.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive fatigue is widely invoked to explain performance breakdowns, yet many laboratory inductions are repurposed tasks that may inadvertently confound fatigue with learning, monotony, or disengagement. We present WAND (Working-memory Adaptive-fatigue with N-back Difficulty), a purpose-built, open-source protocol designed to induce active cognitive fatigue (ACF) under controlled conditions. WAND combines (a) structured practice and a performance-plateau phase to minimise learning effects, (b) tiering of task performance, and (c) adaptive difficulty and time compression in interleaved tasks to sustain high cognitive load of appropriate difficulty while limiting boredom. In a behavioural validation study (N = 27), after completing a comprehensive practice phase, participants completed a 65–70-minute induction comprising fixed “probe” Sequential N-back blocks interleaved with adaptive Spatial and Dual N-back blocks. Confirmatory mixed-effects modelling showed a robust decline in working-memory sensitivity from the first to the final block, representing a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen's d = −0.71). This impairment was accompanied by a modest speeding of responses rather than the compensatory slowing typically expected in passive fatigue contexts. A brief visual mini-distractor embedded within the probe task did not show an increased post-distractor cost with fatigue. Subjective ratings of mental fatigue, effort, mind wandering, and feeling overwhelmed increased monotonically across five assessment points. Together, these results validate WAND as a practical and methodologically precise tool for inducing a behavioural profile consistent with ACF, while providing a transparent framework for reproducible fatigue induction and measurement in behavioural and neurophysiological studies.",

We summarized the evidence on differences across motor imagery ability components following Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\nData sources: Six databases were searched up to February 2024.\nReview methods: Studies comparing adults with these conditions to healthy individuals were included. Two reviewers independently selected studies and assessed Risk of Bias. Qualitative analyses were applied. Outcomes were motor imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation, assessed through questionnaires, mental chronometry, and mental rotation tasks. \nResults: Fifty-two studies with low or moderate bias were included (Stroke: n=26; TBI: n=1; PD: n=14; MS: n=11). Qualitative analyses suggested possible differences in Stroke and MS for manipulation of MI, while for PD the evidence was contradictory. For imagery generation and maintenance, contradictory evidence for Stroke and MS (stronger towards a difference) was found, while for PD moderate evidence for a difference was found. For TBI, a limited number of studies impeded performing formal syntheses of the evidence. \nConclusion: Differences in specific motor imagery ability domains may be present in people with neurological conditions of different aetiologies.

A total of 1887 (67%) audience members provided kiosk feedback, and 458\n(24%) completed questionnaires. Overall, the reception was positive, but kiosk ratings varied\nsignificantly across performances, indicating that the collective live audience experience\nfluctuates from one showing to another. The distributions of kiosk ratings and questionnaire\nresponses to the same question were almost identical, showing that brief kiosk feedback\nprovides a valid and efficient measure of audience experience, yielding high participation with\nminimal effort from spectators. Cluster analysis of questionnaire data identified three distinct\naudience profiles that differed primarily in overall engagement and appreciation of artistic\nquality. These results demonstrate that audiences of a single production form experientially\ndiverse groups. Qualitative responses, obtained from participants whose quantitative ratings\nwere most representative of each cluster, provided short written accounts of their experiences.\nThese narratives enriched the interpretation of the data by clarifying how similar numerical\nprofiles could correspond to distinct emotional tones, interpretive emphases, and personal\nconnections to the performance. Interviews with the director, artistic director, and an external\nplaywright highlighted both enthusiasm and hesitation toward incorporating audience data into\ncreative work. While all acknowledged the potential of empirical insight to support artistic\nreflection, they emphasized the need for sensitivity in how feedback is framed and shared\nwithin production teams.",

          "abstract": "Double Empathy Problem (DEP) proposes that communication breakdowns across different neurotypes arise from reciprocal mismatches, challenging the traditional pathological model of social difficulties in autism. Despite its conceptual appeal, DEP lacks formalization for empirical testing. Drawing on a constructivist view of communication, we operationalized DEP by distinguishing between global interpersonal autistic-trait differences and local dynamic interpersonal adjustment. 152 participants formed low-low, low-high, and high-high autistic-trait dyads. In a real-time conceptual coordination task, dyads developed novel signaling systems to coordinate target choices. Mixed-trait dyads exhibited reduced interpersonal adjustment, greater signaling variability, and more heterogeneous adjustment dynamics than matched-trait dyads. Interpersonal adjustment promoted communication outcomes and mediated the relationship between autistic-trait disparity and communicative outcomes. These findings suggest that autistic-trait differences may initially hinder coordination but can be attenuated through accommodate mental states towards each other. Integrating global and local processes advances theoretical precision of DEP and provides a foundation for future mechanistic investigation of neurodiverse communication and inclusive social practices.",

This position paper gives an overview of the ways in which HIV stigma impacts cascade of care outcomes, provides guidance for effective stigma reductions interventions, and delineates priorities for understanding and addressing stigma in the HIV response. It makes clear that various forms of stigma deleteriously impact prevention and testing, linkage to care, initiation and adherence to antiretroviral treatment, and viral suppression, and describes stigma reduction methods for public stigma, self-stigma, and structural stigma. It furthermore argues that stigma interventions should be systematically developed, theory- and evidence-based, tailored to context, and codesigned and co-implemented with recipient populations. Lastly, this paper argues for better measurement of stigma, not by seeking consensus on construct definitions and corresponding measures but rather through the transparent reporting of definitions and their operationalizations.",

          "authors": "Tianze Xu; Xiaoming Jiang",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Despite the central role of voice perception in social interaction, the mechanisms underlying cross-linguistic voice similarity judgments remain underexplored. This study examined how voice similarity is perceived within and across languages, using bilingual speech as a means to isolate language-driven effects while controlling for anatomical variation.\nMethod: English-speaking listeners with and without Cantonese proficiency completed a perceptual similarity rating task involving Cantonese–English bilingual speakers. Listeners rated the similarity of voice pairs on a nine-point scale, including both within-language and cross-language comparisons. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was applied to the dissimilarity ratings to model perceptual voice space, and acoustic–perceptual correlations were used to relate perceptual dimensions to acoustic properties of the speech signal.\nResults: Cross-language voice pairs were perceived as significantly more dissimilar than within-language pairs, particularly for same-speaker items, indicating a language mismatch effect. No robust language familiarity effect was observed between listener groups. Importantly, same-speaker pairs were consistently judged as more similar than different-speaker pairs even across languages—a finding further supported by MDS, which revealed a stable underlying perceptual structure in which speakers generally clustered with themselves across languages. Perceptual dimensions were primarily associated with pitch, vocal tract size, and harmonic-to-noise spectral characteristics, with their relative weighting modulated by language context.\nConclusions: The findings indicate that while language mismatch reduces perceived similarity between speakers, the vocal identity of a speaker remains perceptually stable across languages. These results refine the prototype model of voice perception by demonstrating dynamic, context-sensitive weighting of acoustic cues in bilingual voice processing.",

          "authors": "Tobias Grossmann",
          "abstract": "The prevailing account of human life-history evolution holds that selection for larger brains drove the prolongation of childhood: because neural tissue is metabolically costly, encephalization necessarily slowed developmental pace. Recent fossil evidence calls this causal sequence into question. Across multiple hominin lineages spanning over three million years (including Australopithecus afarensis, early Homo at Dmanisi, and Homo naledi), prolonged developmental timing appears in species with chimpanzee-sized brains. Moreover, Neanderthals exhibited faster dental development than Homo sapiens despite comparable or larger brain volumes, and the prolongation of childhood in our lineage, including a distinctive phase of postnatal brain globularization, continued after maximum brain size had been attained. Together, these patterns indicate that brain size and developmental pace are decoupled and that the extension of human childhood was not a passive consequence of encephalization. I propose the Childhood-First Hypothesis, which reverses the conventional causal arrow: the emergence of a cooperative childcare niche, in which allomaternal provisioning and early weaning extended juvenile dependency, may have preceded and facilitated brain expansion rather than resulting from it. Drawing on fossil geochemistry, comparative primatology, computational modeling, and developmental neuroscience, I argue that the evolutionary foundations of human cognition were social before they were neural. If this cooperative childcare niche (a self-reinforcing caregiving ecology, continuously reconstructed across generations) created the conditions under which encephalization became viable, then current theoretical frameworks may overstate the causal primacy of brain size and understate the role of social organization in shaping human developmental trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Learning to read is a process and milestone with far‑reaching implications for education, vocation, and health. Most models and empirical studies of reading development, however, focus on school entry and often limit potential influences to children’s oral language and print-based skills. In contrast, a smaller corpus of behavioral, genetic, environmental, and neuroimaging research strongly suggests that reading development begins far earlier, in utero. This article first reviews major theoretical frameworks of reading development and synthesizes studies demonstrating that lower-order oral language and cognitive skills necessary for higher-order reading skills (e.g., reading comprehension) begin emerging during the perinatal period. It then characterizes the development of the “reading brain,” starting with regions involved in proficient reading and proceeding to neuroimaging work suggesting that the perinatal brain may already be equipped with a neural scaffold that supports reading development. Although brain scans are not suitable for identifying individual children at risk, they can inform accurate developmental, multifactorial models of reading that, in turn, can better guide preventive educational practices.",

          "abstract": "Background. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are a marker of deficient socioemotional processing linked to severe conduct problems. Although resting-state studies implicate altered large-scale network organization in CU traits, few have comprehensively examined connectivity both within and between the default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and frontoparietal (FPN) networks and none have done so across development in large samples. Methods. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 11,868, 48% female), we examined associations between CU traits and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within and between the DMN, FPN, and SN with repeated timepoints (4) across youth spanning 9 to 18 years-old. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess main effects of CU traits along with moderators of age and sex, and sensitivity analyses included covariates for co-occurring psychopathology. Results. CU traits were associated with reduced within-DMN rsFC. No interactions between CU traits and sex were found, but an interaction between CU traits and age emerged, showing a negative association between CU traits and DMN-SN rsFC was evident in mid-to-late adolescence, with higher-CU youth showing an age-related decline in DMN-SN rsFC. Conclusions. These findings suggest youth with elevated CU traits exhibit atypical development of resting-state connectivity in networks crucial for empathy and salience processing. Specifically, youth with elevated CU traits showed persistent DMN hypoconnectivity and a later-emerging but accelerated age-related segregation of DMN-SN connectivity during adolescence. This pattern may reflect delayed yet ultimately exaggerated differentiation of socioaffective networks, highlighting adolescence as a developmental window for interventions targeting socioemotional functioning.",

The study of the basic neural mechanism underlying response inhibition has produced some of the most-cited empirical work in cognitive neuroscience to date, with a large portion of the most influential work relying on unimodal BOLD-fMRI. More than 25 years after the first fMRI studies of response inhibition, new work using the method to investigate its basic neural mechanisms still appears with regularity. This article seeks to outline why fundamental questions regarding the basic neural mechanism underlying response inhibition still remain unresolved, why new fMRI work often produces seemingly confusing results, and why experimental comparisons that are vital to understand response inhibition are almost never found in fMRI research. I will argue that due to a combination of factors – the known limitations of BOLD-fMRI, the fundamental behavioral dynamics of laboratory response inhibition tasks, and the specific properties of the underlying neural circuits – fMRI is uniquely limited when it comes to understanding response inhibition. I will then outline two potential avenues through which the method can retain its viability as a valuable method in the field despite these limitations.",

          "abstract": "A central question in cognitive development is whether language simply expresses pre-existing event concepts or plays a critical role in their construction and use. Recent findings from studies with infants, preschoolers and adults have raised the possibility that generic two-place relations (e.g., cats push rabbits) can only be represented when people have access to the transitive sentences that express them. This suggests that these concepts could be constructed as we acquire a pre-existing, external language that expresses them. To explore this hypothesis, we tested whether adult homesigners—individuals without exposure to a pre-existing language—could construct such concepts in a nonverbal imitation task. Participants viewed three instances of a given generic event (with either one or two participants), then they were given new exemplars of the same kinds (e.g., new rabbit and cat) and prompted to act. Their performance was compared to English-speaking five-year-olds. Both groups performed well in the critical two-participant condition, consistently mapping figurines of the right kind to each role. There were no group or event-type differences. Thus, homesigners have the representational resources needed to support role binding. These findings demonstrate that abstract representations of generic two-place relations can emerge without exposure to a language that models these constructions or a set of shared linguistic conventions.",

          "abstract": "Though most young adults acknowledge the importance of consent, most also report a discomfort with verbally and explicitly asking for sexual consent from a partner. This research examined the reasons young adults–both heterosexual and gay–hesitate to ask a new partner for sexual consent. We predicted that potentially overestimated concerns about peer reactions, particularly about masculinity, would drive at least some hesitation. In Study 1 (N = 337, 83 gay men, 78 lesbian women, 87 heterosexual men, 89 heterosexual women), young adults responded to an exhaustive list of reasons for discomfort with asking for sexual consent. Respondents endorsed beliefs that asking for consent ruins the flow of sex, is counter to peer and partner expectations, and–for men–violates masculine gender roles and sexual scripts. Study 2 examined whether people’s assumptions about peer norms were accurate. Heterosexual and gay young adults (N = 259, 67 gay men, 61 lesbian women, 65 heterosexual men, 66 heterosexual women) believed their peers are less likely to ask for sexual consent than they are and predicted that their peers and prospective partners hold more negative attitudes about consent than they hold themselves. Men–both heterosexual and gay–predicted their same-sex peers believe asking for consent is less masculine than they believe it is, suggesting concerns about masculinity may be a particular consent barrier for men. Together, this research suggests that gender roles, sexual scripts, and misperceptions of peer norms deter sexual consent behavior among young adults.",

          "abstract": "This paper identifies striking selection biases based on STEM field of study in the 2025 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) competition. Since 1952, GRFP has recruited “the best and the brightest” early-career individuals into STEM careers by providing support for them to attend graduate programs and to pursue research of their choice. The fellowship was founded to support talented people rather than particular research projects, with awardees going on to win Nobel prizes and lead innovation in U.S. science and engineering. Not only did 2025 see major cuts to the number of GRFP awards, but for the first time there was a finger on the scale: rather than recognizing talent across all STEM fields of basic research, the 2025 GRFP competition prioritized a narrow set of “priority areas.” We curated the publicly available data from 2025’s unprecedented two-step release of results (only 1,000 awards in April rather than the 2,300 projected, followed by another 500 in June) in order to identify and analyze bias in the selection process. The distribution of awards among fields of study appeared to depart significantly from previous years, when numbers of awardees within fields of study were driven primarily by application pressure. We found particularly strong bias in the second release of awards, which excluded the life sciences entirely—even though the life sciences had the highest number of applications. We discuss the risks of redefining NSF’s long-standing GRFP funding policy in order to favor narrow sectors of the STEM research workforce while disadvantaging other fields. Although the favored fields, artificial intelligence and quantum science, are national priorities, it is counterproductive for GRFP to prioritize them, as merit is independent of an early-career applicant’s field of study. We discuss the potential harm of such biases for seeding innovation in science as well as for broadening participation of women and others in basic research and the U.S. STEM workforce.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: When studying how factors influence multiple outcomes (e.g., acoustic measures in phonetics), researchers often analyze each outcome separately using a univariate approach. However, this approach ignores relationships between outcomes, which can reduce estimate accuracy and make it difficult to examine how effects are related across outcomes. A multivariate approach addresses these issues by modelling all outcomes jointly. This tutorial illustrates how to fit Bayesian multivariate linear mixed effects models using the R package brms.\nMethod: We present three example applications in phonetic research, using a corpus of Greek utterances. We focus on a rising accent, that is, a deliberate f_0 movement temporally aligned with a word’s stressed syllable and used to highlight that word in speech. Specifically, we examine whether the phonetic characteristics of the rising accent depend on two factors: (a) the presence of a preceding accent within the same utterance, and (b) the location of the stress in the accented word relative to its final syllable.\nResults: The multivariate approach reduced uncertainty in population-level effect estimates compared to univariate models and provided a convenient way to examine correlations among effects across outcomes.\nConclusions: This tutorial provides guidance on implementing Bayesian multivariate linear mixed effects models and demonstrates their potential.",

Research indicates that language and reading disabilities are frequently misidentified in this population (e.g., Mancilla-Martinez et al., 2023). Misidentification of language and reading disabilities has serious consequences, as children with significant learning needs may not receive appropriate supports. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify which kindergarten early language and literacy measures have good classification accuracy for predicting first grade reading difficulty among Spanish-English bilingual children. Two hundred twenty children across South Carolina and Texas participated in this study. Children were enrolled in kindergarten, when they completed measures of oral language and early literacy skills in Spanish and English, and followed through first grade, when they completed measures of Spanish and English reading skills. Approximately 60% of the sample was enrolled in dual language instructional programs, and the remainder of the sample was enrolled in English-only programs. Results indicated that kindergarten English rapid letter naming had strong classification accuracy for distinguishing risk for dyslexia at the end of first grade among children enrolled in Spanish-English dual language instruction. However, no measures had strong classification accuracy for distinguishing children at risk for reading difficulty in English-only instructional contexts. These results have clear practical implications for screening bilingual students for risk for dyslexia and highlight the importance of considering language of instruction when evaluating risk for reading difficulty.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems are rapidly becoming embedded in research and knowledge work, promising efficiency gains but potentially accumulating hidden cognitive costs. This paper proposes the concept of cognitive debt—the delayed cost to attention, learning, and mental health from chronic reliance on AI that reduces active cognitive engagement. Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, human factors research, and occupational mental health literature, this theoretical analysis synthesizes emerging evidence suggesting how AI-mediated work may erode sustained attention, displace effortful learning, and contribute to “silent burnout,” particularly among neurodivergent professionals operating near sensory and attentional limits. A threshold transition model formalizes the proposal that three mechanisms—attentional erosion, effort displacement, and affective depletion—operate additively until exceeding individual capacity thresholds, at which point acceleration toward burnout may become non-linear. This framework is situated within predictive processing accounts of cognitive control, where passive AI offloading is conceptualized as maladaptive precision-weighting over internal versus external models. Three patterns of AI use are distinguished—passive offloading, guided co-construction, and reflective scaffolding—that are predicted to differentially contribute to or mitigate cognitive debt. The paper concludes by reframing design principles as testable hypotheses, proposing a minimal measurement battery, and outlining a multi-site Cognitive Debt Observatory to build systematic evidence. Implications for theories of attention, methodological practices in cognitive science, and research integrity frameworks are discussed. Without deliberate intervention, unreflective AI reliance may risk systematic intellectual atrophy in research ecosystems.",

We document a “many-one effect” in how people weigh these costs and benefits when assessing others’ actions. For example, people might believe the expected air-quality benefits outweigh the personal inconvenience to 10,000 people walking to work instead of driving, but not one person. More generally, people more often judge the combined prosocial benefits to outweigh the combined personal costs when there are many actors than when there is just one (or a few). We find support for this hypothesis across 13 experiments (N = 8,402), including samples of adults and children, individualistic and collectivistic sample populations, elected policymakers, and lawyers and judges, in both between-subjects and within-subjects designs, and in both judgments of hypothetical scenarios and real decisions about how other participants should spend bonus payments. The many-one effect persists in scenarios designed to limit rational justifications, e.g., when each additional actor has a smaller marginal impact (Experiments 2A-2E). We propose that this effect arises from “differential scope sensitivity.” Compared to personal costs, the societal benefits can more easily be compared to the size of the societal problem (Experiment 2F), which will make people more scope sensitive to them.",

Partners learn to resolve conflicts, colleagues train for their roles within large teams, and people adopt the shared practices of their community. \nOften, these activities do not benefit others per se. Rather they facilitate future cooperative interactions. Yet such cooperation investments are rarely captured in evolutionary game theory, which focuses on cooperative decisions instead of the preparatory efforts that enable them. Here, we develop a model that allows individuals to incur upfront costs to lower their future cooperation costs. Through mathematical analysis and evolutionary simulations, we show that cooperation investments serve a dual function. First, they allow individuals to transform into more effective partners, enabling cooperation where it would otherwise be too costly. Second, they can serve as honest signals of cooperative intent. When their costs deter would-be cheaters, investments allow observers to identify trustworthy partners, further expanding the cooperative domain. Our model helps to explain why people are attentive to others’ cooperation investments. When someone takes the time to learn more about a partner's hobbies or a community's norms, they do more than build capacity — they signal an intent to cooperate with us.",

We analysed 22 hours of naturalistic dyadic audiovisual conversation between teachers and learners, assessing which of the teachers’ verbal and non-verbal behaviours, and their combinations, impacted learning of unfamiliar objects’ names and semantic properties. We found that both verbal and non-verbal behaviours impacted learning, modulated by learner’s individual differences. While learning of names and semantic features was supported by different verbal factors, only meaningful gestures showed robust effects across the two outcome measures, underscoring the importance of these gestures in adult, in addition to child, learning.

Although feedback can improve emotion recognition, learning dynamics and social factors through which feedback enhances pain assessment from facial expressions remain unclear. Forty-seven participants judged others’ (Targets’) pain based on facial responses, and half (n = 23) received trial-by-trial feedback reflecting Targets’ self-reported pain. Feedback robustly improved accuracy in categorical pain judgments (p &lt; .05) and continuous intensity assessments (p &lt; .001), independent of Targets’ pain. Critically, feedback produced distinct learning dynamics, eliminating the No Feedback Group’s underestimation bias by jointly correcting over- and underestimation over time. Perceived similarity and confidence further dissociated the mechanisms underlying performance with versus without feedback. These findings illustrate that feedback engages a multidimensional learning process that improves pain assessment beyond spontaneous adaptation, highlighting potential for bias-reducing and evidence-based training protocols in clinical pain assessment.",

          "abstract": "Digital media use is rising among Saudi youth, raising concerns about mental health and wellbeing. This qualitative study aimed to gather perspectives from relevant stakeholders (e.g., teachers, religious leaders, community members, influencers, etc.) to inform the development of a culturally tailored intervention to improve digital wellbeing among adolescents in Saudi Arabia. Using snowball sampling, we recruited 58 stakeholders to complete either semi-structured individual interviews or focus groups in Arabic. Thematic analysis by bilingual coders identified key themes around participants’ definitions of digital wellbeing, perceived positive and negative impacts of digital media use, suggested strategies to regulate digital media use, and potential intervention pathways to promote digital wellbeing in Saudi society. Stakeholders emphasized a multi-level approach that integrates self-regulation, school- and family-based intervention components, community activities, and general awareness campaigns as essential for addressing problematic digital media use. Intervention efforts must resonate culturally and align with the Kingdom’s evolving social dynamics, traditional values, and rapid technological advancement.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the interplay of persons, situations, and behavior (the Personality Triad) is a key task of psychology. However, previous research has largely focused on Western samples. We examined the Personality Triad across cultures with N = 15,221 participants from 61 countries and one geographic region. Participants reported on one situation from their daily lives. We examined (1) situation characteristic–behavioral state, (2) trait–behavioral state, and (3) trait–situation characteristic associations, as well as (4) trait × situation characteristic interactions predicting behavioral states. We focused on six traits (Big Five, Honesty-Humility), seven situation characteristics (Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Sociality), and three self-reported behavioral states (Agency, Enthusiasm, Self-Negativity). Importantly, we included 15 country-level variables (collectivism, self-construal, cultural value orientations, tightness, independent and interdependent happiness, national socioeconomic status) as moderators that might contribute to country differences in the Personality Triad. Bayesian multilevel models showed sizable and expected situation characteristic–behavioral state and trait–behavioral state associations with a high degree of generalization across countries, some cultural differences, and moderator effects contradicting theoretical expectations. For instance, we found weaker situation characteristic effects in collectivistic cultures and stronger trait effects in embedded cultures. Trait–situation characteristic associations were meaningful but smaller, and trait × situation characteristic interactions were small and less often significant (although we observed some expected interactions). We found little evidence for country differences in the latter two relations. We discuss implications and future directions for cross-cultural work on the Personality Triad, including replications and extensions using intensive-longitudinal designs.",

          "authors": "James Downs; Anna Carnegie; Mollie Twitchell; Bella Reed; David Morris; David Viljoen; Samuel Chawner; Agnes Ayton",
          "abstract": "The concept of “Restrictive Intake Self-Harm” (“RISH”) has recently been introduced to conceptualise divergent and/or complex presentations of restrictive eating behaviours as a form of self-harm, rather than symptoms of an eating disorder. Whilst this may represent a well-intentioned response to poorly met clinical needs, it also raises significant conceptual, ethical, and clinical concerns. This paper, written by authors with clinical, academic, and lived experience, situates “RISH” within a broader history of classificatory innovation in eating disorders, whereby new terminology has been introduced with insufficient empirical support and a lack of co-production with people with lived experience. Our analysis highlights the unintended consequences of this approach and how conflating restriction with self-injurious behaviour risks conceptual ambiguity, diagnostic misclassification, and the diversion of patients away from specialist services and evidence-based treatments that may benefit them. We advocate an empirical, data-driven approach to understanding the heterogeneous nature of restrictive eating and its diverse psychological, social, and cultural drivers across diagnoses. In clinical practice, greater skill in differential diagnosis and collaborative, individualised formulation is needed, alongside reform of service design to facilitate more integrated care. Vitally, terminology and care pathways for disordered eating need to be meaningfully co-produced with the people who need them, recognising the plurality and legitimacy of experiential knowledge as central to creating more inclusive and attuned care.",

On 30th November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT and the public relationship with artificial intelligence (AI) changed abruptly. ChatGPT gained 100 million users within two months, and technological development in the field since then has been rapid. There are various technical definitions of the term ‘artificial general intelligence’ (AGI), but the crux is AI that can match or exceed human level performance on essentially all cognitive tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI) refers to technology capable of performing all cognitive tasks at levels that far exceed the most capable humans. There is talk of AI providing cures for cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, solving the climate crisis, and bringing about a utopian future of unlimited abundance. Conversely, ASI threatens our utility in the job market, raising prospects of mass unemployment and a crisis of meaning, and may fundamentally change the nature of human relationships. It also presents an existential threat to our species. Leaders in the field, including CEOs of major AI companies, acknowledge these risks. However, they have also stated their intentions to develop ASI anyway, and the industry associated with a ‘move fast and break things’ ethos is racing ever faster toward that goal.",

          "authors": "Niels Oliver Kempkens; Alodie Rey-Mermet",
          "abstract": "Attentional control refers to the ability to maintain a goal and goal-relevant information in the face of distraction. Previous research has highlighted the lack of reliability and shared variance in attentional-control measures. This may result from the heterogeneity of the control processes induced by the tasks. The aim of the present study was to reduce or control for this heterogeneity in two ways. First, we used one task – the AX-CPT – with different stimulus materials (letters, words, dot patterns, matrices, and pictures). In this task, a target response is required in trials where two specific stimuli occur in sequence (e.g., the letter “A” followed by the letter “X”). In all other trials, a non-target response is required. Second, we disentangled proactive control (goal maintenance) from reactive control (goal reactivation) by computing separate indices for each process. Using data from 667 young adults, we obtained good reliability for most indices. Structural equation modeling identified models with factors representing shared variance across stimulus materials. In a subsequent analysis, we bypassed the indices by modeling proactive and reactive control directly from error rates and response times. Using a bifactor modeling approach, we found shared variance across stimulus materials for error rates only. However, in both analyses, the pattern of latent correlations contradicted the expectations. For example, a positive and very high correlation was observed between indices representing proactive and reactive control. Overall, these findings question the validity of AX-CPT measures, suggesting that the task cannot resolve the measurement problem in attentional control.",

          "abstract": "Anatomical features that define facial identity also influence how a face moves during expres- sion. This overlap suggests the visual system might form expectations about facial motion based on shape. However, recent theories propose that facial shape and motion are processed in independent brain pathways. We used reverse correlation to test whether expectations about natural facial movement are shaped by facial structure, and vice versa. Participants judged syn- thetic dynamic faces with randomly varying shape or motion. We estimated expected speed of facial expression components and compared these across different identities. We also identified shape features used for face recognition and assessed whether these changed with familiar ver- sus unfamiliar motion. Our results show that expectations of natural motion during expression are influenced by face shape, but the shape features used for identification remain stable across motion contexts. We interpret these findings within the independent pathways framework, suggesting a form of motion-from-structure processing.",

          "abstract": "Achievement emotions are a common experience in sport and exercise, yet comprehensive frameworks for conceptualizing and measuring these emotions are lacking. To address this gap, we introduce a taxonomy to the sport and exercise domain that organizes achievement emotions by valence (positive, negative), arousal (activating, deactivating), and object focus (activity, prospective outcomes, retrospective outcomes). To provide a measure that is consistent with this taxonomy, we further introduce the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire – Sport and Exercise (AEQ-SE), a new instrument assessing prototypical emotions across all twelve resulting emotion categories. Across two independent samples (total N = 862), results from network modeling and regression analysis supported the relevance of valence, arousal, and object focus for capturing the structure of achievement emotions in sport and exercise. Moreover, AEQ-SE scales were systematically associated with key theoretical antecedents (control and value appraisals) and outcomes (satisfaction, motivation, sport and exercise behavior, indicators of well-being). Together, our findings provide empirical evidence for the proposed three-dimensional taxonomy and establish the AEQ-SE as a psychometrically sound tool for studying achievement emotions in sport and exercise contexts.",

However, people preferred to explain unfairness as the result of both a bad actor and bad system, and preferred to enact system-level change, even after they had already punished the Allocator (Study 3, N = 404), or when the outcome was uncertain (Study 4, N = 401). This research challenges the assumption that sanctioning decisions reflect single attributional preferences and that addressing one source of unfairness satiates punishment motives.",

Here we used a transparent Dyadic Interaction Platform and Cooperation–Competition Foraging task in which pairs of participants jointly or individually collected variable-payoff targets while continuously observing each other's gaze, ongoing actions, and outcomes. Using a round-robin design (N = 125 participants), we examined how Interpersonal Circumplex traits and prior dyadic history shaped real-time strategic outcomes. Dyads rapidly converged on stable cooperative, mixed or competitive strategies within sessions, and showed increasing cooperation in subsequent sessions as compared to the first session both participants played. Strategies in earlier sessions predicted later ones, indicating experience-dependent adaptation. Higher mean Communion predicted greater cooperation, higher mean Agency predicted greater competition. Critically, dyadic minima for Communion and maxima for Agency outperformed dyadic means, revealing an asymmetry in which competitive tendencies exert disproportionate influence on interaction dynamics. These findings demonstrate that continuous, transparent paradigms uncover how stable personality traits and interaction history jointly shape social strategy, bridging game-theoretic models with ecologically valid accounts of social decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Verbal fluency requires generating items according to specific rules. While semantic fluency is often preserved in dyslexia and stuttering, phonemic fluency is typically impaired. Most research, however, focuses on total word counts rather than underlying mechanisms. \nMethod: This online study compared 62 dyslexic adults, 62 adults who stutter (AWS), and 62 neurotypical adults using typed verbal fluency and mouse-drawn design fluency tasks. Design fluency assessed whether impairments stemmed from general executive control or specific phonological deficits. \nResults: Using hierarchical regression, we observed that dyslexia and stuttering predicted lower correct output for phonemic fluency but did not predict scores on the semantic or design fluency tasks. At a finer-grained level, dyslexia and stuttering both predicted a smaller number of switches between subcategories on the phonemic fluency task, whereas stuttering also predicted the size of phonemically-related clusters of items. \nConclusion: Overall, these results indicate that the executive fluency impairment found in dyslexia is related to accessing phonological representations, whereas adults who stutter have an impairment in terms of the phonological representation. These findings suggest that despite similar phonological impairments, the phonological mechanisms in dyslexia and stuttering are distinct, necessitating specialized clinical interventions.",

          "abstract": "Resistance to artificial intelligence (AI) is widespread and persists even when known psychological barriers are removed. What explains this persistent aversion? Across four studies, we investigate whether moral reactions to AI—rooted in deeply held beliefs about right and wrong—help explain resistance beyond pragmatic concerns. In Study 1, we analyzed all news headlines in a major US media corpus (COCA, 2018–2024) and found that AI is moralized at levels comparable to GMOs and vaccines—technologies whose moral opposition has received considerable attention—and that surges in moralization followed the launch of major AI applications such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. In Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, representative samples of Americans reported their attitudes toward several AI applications and other technologies. Although few participants opposed AI outright, most opponents indicated their views would remain unchanged even if AI proved beneficial—suggesting moral rather than pragmatic roots. Structural equation models revealed that moralization of AI was best captured by a single latent factor, indicating a generalized moral sentiment rather than domain-specific risk–benefit appraisals. Qualitative analyses further uncovered the most common justifications people invoke and how opponents and supporters differ in their reasoning. In Study 4, participants from Studies 2b and 3 completed a subsequent behavioral grading task; moralization scores measured in the earlier surveys predicted greater reluctance to use AI even when doing so would benefit participants (a one standard deviation increase in moralization corresponded to 42% decrease in AI usage). Together, these findings demonstrate that resistance to AI is partly moral in nature, suggesting that reaping the potential benefits of AI tools may require addressing moral concerns rather than relying solely on pragmatic arguments.",

          "abstract": "Defensive responses to threat are critical for survival and often involve freezing-like behavior, which has been linked to action preparation. However, it remains unclear how this preparatory mechanism is influenced by unpredictable aversive stimuli that are difficult to discriminate or anticipate. In this study, we introduce a modified paradigm to examine how freezing-like behavior is affected by action preparation under temporal threat predictability, unpredictability, and safety. Using a multimodal approach in a large sample (n = 235, 148 female), we assessed postural sway and heart rate as markers of freezing-like behavior, alongside skin conductance levels, electromyographic startle responses, behavioral performance, and subjective ratings. Behaviorally, participants responded faster but less accurately under threat compared to safety, replicating previous findings. Physiologically, threat conditions were associated with both parasympathetically mediated postural freezing and sympathetically driven increases in skin conductance. Importantly, the temporal (un)predictability of threat did not modulate freezing-like behavior or skin conductance responses. Startle responses were generally inhibited during all conditions (threat and safety) relative to the inter-trial interval. These findings indicate that action preparation under threat involves concurrent activation of both parasympathetic (postural freezing) and sympathetic systems (skin conductance), consistent with animal models of freezing. The absence of modulation by temporal threat unpredictability may be indicative of a generalized defensive mode that prioritizes readiness over specificity.",

Nowadays, the focus of teaching quality research is shifting; Teachers’ adaptation of instruction to students and interactions between teacher and student behaviors are used increasingly to explain effective teaching. Uncertainty remains about the extent to which teachers adapt their instruction to students. Additionally, it is unclear which assessment scales measure stable teacher traits and which measures are affected by students. To address these questions, we conducted a quasi-experiment involving 146 German and math teachers and 3,980 of their students from various educational tracks in Germany. Teachers either taught the same group of students for two consecutive years or different groups each year. A difference-in-differences approach was employed to determine whether teaching quality ratings were more consistent when teachers taught the same group than when they taught different groups at both timepoints. Results suggest that especially student ratings of teaching quality and teacher ratings of student disruptions are affected by different student groups. Teachers’ ratings of their own instructional behaviors, however, are less affected. We discuss the causal informativeness of our findings regarding teachers’ instructional behaviors and give recommendations on how to interpret associations between different assessments of teaching quality with student outcomes.",

First, we define unusualness as the extent to which an individual’s personality deviates from that of others in the population, either through rare expression of individual variables (unusual values) or through atypical co-occurrence of multiple variables (unusual combinations), and distinguish it from related concepts in personality research. Second, we introduce and compare various methods to measure unusualness in a simulation study and demonstrate how reliability and validity of unusualness measures can be established. Third, we propose methods to uncover the elements of unusualness (i.e., unusual values, unusual combinations) and validate these methods through simulation. Fourth, we illustrate our framework using three empirical datasets (combined N = 1,834) and multiple assessment methods, showing that unusualness can be reliably measured and offering first insights into its generalizability, nomological network, incremental validity, and possible explanatory factors.

          "abstract": "Confidence, the “feeling of knowing” that accompanies every cognitive process, plays a critical role in human reinforcement learning; yet its computational bases in learning scenarios have only recently begun to be studied. Prior work has distinguished between value confidence (certainty in value estimates) and decision confidence (certainty that a choice is correct), but how these two forms of confidence are computed and interact has not been directly tested. Here we combine two experiments and previously published datasets to test competing computational hypotheses. We find that value confidence is best explained by a Bayesian computation reflecting the precision of value estimates, and that it adaptively guides behaviour by reducing exploration and promoting exploitation as certainty increases. In contrast, decision confidence departs from Bayesian predictions, especially on errors. A hybrid model integrating Bayesian probability with the precision of the decision variable better accounts for decision confidence. Moreover, the relative weights assigned to these two sources of information characterize individual differences in confidence reporting and, in addition, they are predictive of task and metacognitive performance, where the more Bayesian the subject, the higher the performance. Together, these results provide a unified computational mechanism through which distinct forms of confidence shape learning and choices in uncertain environments.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation difficulties are widely recognised as transdiagnostic mechanisms underlying emotional disorders, yet the role of beliefs about the usefulness of emotions remains underexplored. This study investigated whether beliefs that emotions are useless contribute to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders via secondary emotions (i.e. emotions about emotions, such as feeling guilty about feeling angry). A large sample of students (N = 1036) completed validated self-report measures assessing emotion beliefs (EBQ), secondary emotions (DERS), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and eating psychopathology (EDE-Q). Participants with high levels of psychological distress showed significantly stronger emotion uselessness beliefs (η² = .01) and elevated secondary emotions (η²=.16). Mediation analyses revealed secondary emotions significantly mediated relationships between uselessness beliefs and all three conditions, with complete mediation for eating psychopathology. These findings suggest that viewing emotions as harmful or pointless may lead to maladaptive emotional responses, which in turn contribute to psychological distress. The results support the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders as emotional disorders with shared underlying mechanisms and highlight the potential of transdiagnostic interventions targeting emotion beliefs and secondary emotions to improve treatment efficiency across diverse clinical presentations.",

          "abstract": "Visual dominance is a well-documented phenomenon, yet the reasons for such dominance remain unclear. We hypothesise that, specifically in visuo-haptic multisensory scenarios, part of the reason for this dominance is the ecological expectation for the perception of vision to temporally precede the perception of touch. This study investigated whether the order of presented stimuli impacts reaction times using a Virtual Reality (VR) oddball paradigm combined with ultrasound mid-air haptics. Twenty-eight participants responded to target stimuli across four conditions: touch-touch (TT), touch-vision (TV), vision-touch (VT), and vision-vision (VV). We hypothesized that, due to ecological expectation, Vision-then-Touch (VT) priming would be stronger than Touch-then-Vision (TV) due to its ecological expectancy, and that within-modality priming would generally exceed cross-modal priming. Results indicated that participants were significantly slower in VT conditions compared to TV conditions, contradicting the ecological hypothesis. We attribute this to visual dominance, where response times are faster whenever the target stimulus is visual, regardless of priming order. We also found that within-modality priming (VV and TT) elicited significantly faster responses than cross-modality conditions. Interestingly, exploratory analyses found that reaction time differences between conditions were significantly greater in trials where the participants responded to visual stimuli than in trials where participants responded to touch stimuli, suggesting that touch is perceptually more \"stable\" and less susceptible to priming effects than vision. Overall, visual dominance appears to override ecological sequential expectations in multisensory integration, though it is impacted more heavily by priming effects than touch.",

          "abstract": "Several studies have suggested a link between aphantasia (the absence or reduction of visual mental imagery) and alexithymia (the difficulty in identifying and describing one's feelings/emotions, associated with an externally oriented thinking style). However, results and interpretations differ from one study to another, and no consensus emerges from the current literature. To progress on this issue, we sought 1) to gather a large amount of data on aphantasia and alexithymia in the same participants from the most commonly used questionnaires, 2) to group participants into four categories of visual imagery ability as proposed by recent literature on aphantasia (no visual imagery, weak, typical, and excellent visual imagery), and 3) to use non-linear data analysis methods. We combined previously published (N = 1130) and new unpublished data (N = 348) from studies in which participants completed the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire - VVIQ (the higher the score the better the visual imagery ability) and the twenty-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale - TAS-20 (the higher the score the worse the emotional abilities). The total sample comprised 147 aphantasics (no imagery, VVIQ = 16), 141 hypophantasics (weak imagery, 16 &lt; VVIQ &lt; 33), 1115 typical imagers (32 &lt; VVIQ &lt; 75) and 75 hyperphantasics (high imagery, VVIQ &gt; 74). Results showed that among participants able to do visual imagery (from hypo- to hyperphantasia), a negative linear relationship existed between mental imagery and alexithymia, i.e., the higher the VVIQ score, the lower the TAS-20 score. This relation was present for all subscales, but was particularly pronounced for the two TAS-20 scales assessing difficulty in identifying and describing feelings. Importantly, participants with a total inability to produce visual mental images (complete aphantasia, VVIQ = 16) broke this linear relationship and exhibited better emotional abilities than hypophantasics, at a level similar of that of typical imagers. Overall these results support the hypothesis of Kvamme et al. (2026) and suggest that when visual imagery is unavailable, alternative psychophysiological processes develop to process emotions, which are as effective as visual imagery. Our results also suggest that these processes do not develop when imagery is possible, even to a very limited extent, which further argue for fundamental differences between aphantasics and hypophantasics.",

Although CBM-I has shown promise, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear and integration with psychophysiological and neural measures has been limited.\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, eighty-eight participants with high levels of social anxiety completed two lab sessions, an online training in between, and online follow-up. Participants filled out questionnaires, completed interpretation bias tasks, and underwent neuro-psychophysiological assessments. Active CBM-I trained positive resolutions of ambiguous social scenarios, while the sham version used neutral scenarios.\nThe primary outcome, i.e., scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), decreased across time in both groups, without group differences. The Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation decreased only in the active group. Interpretation bias shifted more strongly toward positive outcomes in the active group. Autonomic measures confirmed sensitivity to stress induction but did not differentiate between conditions. Electrophysiological results paralleled subjective ratings, as participants exhibited ambivalent responses to socially relevant stimuli but clearly differentiated responses toward neutral stimuli. Baseline correlations indicated strong convergence across self-report and interpretation tasks. Mediation analyses showed that reductions in negative interpretations mediated the effect of the training group on LSAS scores at follow-up.\nThese findings identify interpretation bias as a modifiable mechanism underlying social anxiety and underscore its role as a transdiagnostic marker. Targeting interpretation bias through easily accessible and applicable online interventions may strengthen preventive and therapeutic approaches for social anxiety and related disorders.",

These may include a loss of trust in research and healthcare actors in oncology and a rejection of their recommendations, sometimes in favor of risky alternative practices. Research on this topic has most often focused on analyzing factors related to the victims of misinformation. However, the producers and vectors of misinformation remain understudied.\n\nMethods:\n\nWithin this framework, the authors of the present manuscript propose a critical analysis of an article in which they, as well as other individuals and institutions, are subjected to personal attacks. The article also contributes to the production and dissemination of misinformation related to oncology. The authors conducted an analysis of the rhetorical devices and fallacious arguments contained in the article, drawing on established academic approaches, typologies, and reference works. In addition, an analysis of potential breaches of editorial and ethical standards was carried out in comparison with several sets of widely recognized guidelines.\n\nResults and discussion:\n\nThe analysis of the article reveals the use of numerous non-scientific persuasive argumentative strategies (e.g., logical distortions, emotional appeals, diversionary tactics, and discrediting of opponents), as well as several potential shortcomings on the part of both the author and the editorial process with regard to ethical and integrity standards. In particular, the similarities between the analyzed article and misinformation discourse are discussed, along with the potential harmful effects on the credibility of research and healthcare in oncology, and the resulting perspectives for research and for combating misinformation.",

However, neurological impairment may be related to deficits in motor imagery ability. We summarized the evidence on differences across motor imagery ability components following Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\nData sources: Six databases were searched up to February 2024.\nReview methods: Studies comparing adults with these conditions to healthy individuals were included. Two reviewers independently selected studies and assessed Risk of Bias. Qualitative analyses were applied. Outcomes were motor imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation, assessed through questionnaires, mental chronometry, and mental rotation tasks. \nResults: Fifty-two studies with low or moderate bias were included (Stroke: n=26; TBI: n=1; PD: n=14; MS: n=11). Qualitative analyses suggested possible differences in Stroke and MS for manipulation of MI, while for PD the evidence was contradictory. For imagery generation and maintenance, contradictory evidence for Stroke and MS (stronger towards a difference) was found, while for PD moderate evidence for a difference was found. For TBI, a limited number of studies impeded performing formal syntheses of the evidence. \nConclusion: Differences in specific motor imagery ability domains may be present in people with neurological conditions of different aetiologies. Clinicians should consider assessing all three components before applying motor imagery interventions.",

          "abstract": "This participatory qualitative study explores how autistic adolescents conceptualise inclusion within mainstream secondary schools in England. Against the backdrop of ongoing reforms to Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) provision, nine autistic pupils co-designed a qualitative study which involved interviewing twenty autistic pupils aged 11-17yrs. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis within a critical realist framework. Three interrelated themes emerged: (1) “They think it [autism] is some weird thing”—the importance of whole school understanding; (2) “I see being autistic as part of who I am”—affirmation of difference and (3) “School is made for neurotypical pupils”— the need to belong. Collectively, these findings reveal autistic pupils define inclusion as belonging, understanding, and affirmation of difference, rather than assimilation. The study highlights the persistence of deficit-based constructions of autism in schools and calls for a shift towards neurodiversity-informed, co-designed approaches that embed autistic voices at the heart of policy, pedagogy, and practice. By reframing inclusion through the neurodiversity paradigm, the research argues for schools to move from remediation to recognition, creating educational environments where difference is both expected and valued.",

Focusing specifically on the context of large-class STEMM teaching, this study investigated the conceptions of sixteen STEMM lecturers, adopting a phenomenographic, interview-based methodology.  Four conceptions were differentiated: large-class STEMM teaching as presentation; as guided learning and individual reflection; as active participation in a community of learning; and as the promotion of metacognition beyond the curriculum. These conceptions were further dissected in terms of three dimensions of variation comprising interactivity, the role of students, and aims of large STEMM classes. The findings also showed that the teachers' conceptions needed to be understood in relation both to contextual factors and to the extent to which they felt different strategies were accomplishable in particular settings.",

Conference inclusion criteria: International, psychology/behavioural medicine, 1000+ attendees, years 2023-2025. Total and per capita CO₂eq were estimated for in-person and online attendance based on emissions estimates from 22 in-person and 10 online conference emission publications.\nThe included 21 conferences generated approx. 63,481 tonnes of CO₂eq. A senior scientist attending two such conferences in-person emits approx. 2.51 tCO₂eq annually, already exceeding the individual annual carbon budget compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C target (2.3 tCO₂eq per person/year until 2030).\nThese figures contrast the disproportionate climate impact of frequent academic travel against urgently needed emission reductions. By sharing striking emission estimates from select major conferences – excluding many smaller meetings – we aim to prompt discussion on more sustainable conference and travel choices by scientific organizations and scientists.",

Instead of producing uniform change, the intervention yielded a differentiated pattern of effects that are highly relevant for promoting zero-tolerance educational environments. This pattern underscores that bystander-related outcomes do not evolve homogeneously, but through distinct and temporally differentiated pathways of change.",

Integrating data across six studies from multiple international surveys (N=63,403; 20 countries), expert-coded party systems (71 countries; 14 datasets), and longitudinal panel studies, we demonstrate that individuals with stronger authoritarian orientations are consistently more prone to conspiracism across diverse cultures, political contexts, and time. These results remain robust when controlling for populist attitudes and multiple political, psychological, and demographic variables. The link between authoritarianism and conspiracism appears to constitute a durable and generalizable psychological relationship. This may help explain why conspiratorial narratives and authoritarian politics so often co-occur, with important implications for democratic resilience in an era of rising institutional distrust, anti-scientific attitudes, misinformation, and post-truth politics.",

          "abstract": "THIS PREPRINT IS THE INITIAL SUBMISSION OF A PAPER THAT CURRENTLY UNDERGOES PEER-REVIEW FOR PUBLICATION\nSelf-report questionnaires are widely used in research and practice. In most applications, the vulnerability of these questionnaires to response biases like faking is ignored. However, especially in high-stakes situations such as personnel selection, measurement can be severely biased when test-takers engage in faking to present themselves more favorably. To separate faking-related variance from substantive trait variance, the Multidimensional Nominal Response Model (MNRM) has been used to reduce systematic bias in trait estimation by allowing for item-specific relations between response categories and social desirability. A critical but untested assumption of this approach is that perceptions of social desirability are homogeneous across test-takers. However, individuals may differ considerably in how they perceive the desirability of the item content. Here, we conducted simulation studies to investigate how violations of this assumption affect the MNRM’s ability to recover substantive trait person parameters. We implemented three distinct manipulations of heterogeneous desirability perceptions and examined their impact on person parameter recovery. Results showed that the MNRM is robust against violations of homogeneous social desirability perceptions as long as test-takers’ faking behavior is aligned with their perceived desirability of the item content. In contrast, when test-takers fake responses in ways that are inconsistent with item-wise desirability perceptions, parameter recovery seems to decline. Implications for practice and possible model extensions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "A transtheoretical framework for dissociation acknowledges emotional regulation. However, interoception—closely linked to emotional and autonomic regulation—remains underexplored, despite growing evidence connects it to dissociation and its correlates. This study applied a network analysis to examine multidirectional associations among dissociation, trauma exposure, post-traumatic symptoms, sleep quality, and interoception. A cross-sectional design was employed in a community sample of 574 adults (18–60 years) from Upper Silesia, Poland. Participants completed validated self-report measures of dissociative experiences (Dissociative Experiences Scale; Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire), interoception (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness; Body Perception Questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), trauma exposure (Life Events Checklist for DSM-5), post-traumatic stress symptoms (International Trauma Questionnaire), and demographic and health variables.\nThe network was estimated using a graphical Gaussian model with the graphical LASSO algorithm. Absorption showed the highest strength and expected influence, affective dysregulation the greatest closeness and betweenness, while autonomic reactivity and emotional awareness also emerged as highly central nodes. Contrary to theoretical expectations derived from post-traumatic and sociocognitive models, neither trauma exposure nor sleep quality occupied central positions in the network.\nThese findings suggest that dissociation may be more tightly embedded in interoceptive and autonomic regulatory processes than in trauma exposure per se. Atypical interoception may represent a transdiagnostic mechanism linking posttraumatic and sociocognitive accounts of dissociation, while aligning with attachment-based perspectives emphasizing disrupted bodily and affective co-regulation. These results provide a rationale for incorporating interoceptive-focused interventions in the treatment of dissociative symptoms.",

This study aimed to develop and field-test provisional research criteria for obsessional jealousy and describe the clinical features of individuals meeting these criteria.\n\nMethods: Provisional research criteria were developed based on DSM-5 descriptions and applied in a self-referred sample of individuals reporting problematic jealousy (n=58). Participants underwent structured clinical assessment, including best-estimate diagnostic procedures, evaluation of differential diagnoses, and measures of functional impairment. Participant’s views on introducing a formal jealousy diagnosis were explored.\n\nResults: 34 (59%) of the participants met provisional research criteria. The criteria demonstrated strong sensitivity but modest specificity, reflecting a deliberately conservative threshold to avoid over-pathologization. All individuals meeting criteria were judged to meet DSM-5 and ICD-11 definitions of mental disorder. Obsessional jealousy was typically recurrent across relationships, with onset in mid-adolescence and clinical significance emerging in early adulthood. Participants showed generally good insight; comorbidity was more common with mood and anxiety disorders. Many reported prior help-seeking and ongoing need for treatment. Participants expressed balanced views regarding formal diagnosis, citing both potential benefits and risks.\n\nConclusions: These findings identify a group of individuals with pervasive, recurrent obsessional jealousy that is distressing, impairing, and not readily explained by existing diagnostic categories. The proposed criteria provide an initial framework for research and clinical development but require further refinement and validation in more representative community and clinical samples, with careful attention to diagnostic boundaries and stakeholder perspectives.",

Feedback, as a core component of successful learning, plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of technology-supported learning environments. This scoping review provides an overview on the influence of feedback on learning in VR, examining learning domains, feedback content and presentation design, research objectives and designs, and key findings. Relevant online databases were systematically searched, and 70 publications were included in the analysis. Most studies were conducted in domains where VR offers clear advantages over real-world settings, such as reducing physical risk in medical or emergency training, lowering costs in sports or skill acquisition, saving personal resources in educational contexts, and enabling remote access to training. The studies differed widely in terms of the information provided and how the feedback content was presented. Previous research has primarily taken a technology-driven approach, emphasizing system development and preliminary evaluations of feedback implementation. These studies show that VR systems with feedback show advantages in terms of more positive learners’ experiences and performance. However, only a small number of studies applied controlled experimental designs to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of feedback, the conditions under which it works best, and influencing factors. To advance the field, future research should adopt theory-driven approaches and complex experimental designs taking into account individual learner conditions as well as the affordances of VR environments.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have underscored the importance of academic advisors to attend to culture for graduate student success and development, yet research examining cultural processes within the advisory relationship is limited. In contrast, the Multicultural Orientation (MCO) framework has been increasingly applied to examine and further understand cultural processes as they unfold in therapeutic relationships and clinical supervisory relationships. Given existing literature on the importance of addressing culture within the advisory relationship and the positive influence of therapist and supervisor MCO on various client and trainee outcomes, this study extends the MCO framework to examine the effect of advisor MCO on the advisory alliance. Data for this study consisted of 343 doctoral advisees and 187 advisors across 45 APA-accredited Counseling Psychology (CP) programs in the United States. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the effect of partitioned variance components of advisees’ perceptions of their advisor MCO: within-advisor MCO, between-advisor MCO, and between-faculty MCO, as well as the interaction between these components on the advisory alliance. Results indicated significant and positive MCO-alliance effects within-advisor, between-advisor, and between-faculty for cultural humility and cultural comfort. More specifically, advisees who perceived their advisor to be more culturally humble and culturally comfortable compared to the perceptions of other advisees of the same advisor, rated the advisory alliance higher. Similarly, advisors that were perceived higher in cultural humility and cultural comfort compared to other advisors were rated higher on the advisory alliance (between-advisor). Lastly, advisees’ perceptions of their faculty’s cultural humility and cultural comfort (i.e., aggregated advisee perceptions of the advisors within a CP program faculty) were positively associated with the advisory alliance, meaning that advisees who perceived their faculty-as-a-whole to be higher in cultural humility and cultural comfort compared to other groups of faculty, rated their advisory alliance higher. Regarding cultural opportunities, when advisees rated their advisor higher on cultural opportunities compared to the other advisors, they perceived the advisory alliance to be higher. These preliminary findings lay the foundation for future directions in training practices and research on the importance of cultural processes within the advisory relationship.",

To address this, we conducted a large (n=355), pre-registered online experiment measuring perceived chronic stress (PCS), five cognitive capacities, and decision-making capacity (via the knapsack optimisation task). This paradigm provides an objective, preference-free measure of decision-making capacity, allowing us to systematically modulate the computational demands of each decision. Surprisingly, in a broadly representative US sample, higher PCS within a `normal' range had no credible relationship with decision-making capacity or cognitive performance, even on computationally demanding decisions. However, post-hoc analyses provided a more nuanced picture, tentatively suggesting that young adults, the tertiary educated, and those with lower processing speed may be more vulnerable to chronic stress's effects. These results challenge a generalised view of stress's impact, hinting at a potential reconciliation of differential effects observed across the literature.",

          "abstract": "How should morality be measured in a cross-cultural context? Although Moral Foundations Theory combines etic (universal) and emic (local) concepts, existing measures are largely etic. Therefore, we proposed an emic approach for measuring etic constructs of MFT, introduced a new construct, Moral Foundations Patterns, and developed the Moral Foundations Patterns Questionnaire (MFPQ) in Japan. We conducted five studies to develop and validate the MFPQ (total N = 2,161), using two different sampling platforms to diversify sample characteristics. We showed MFPQ has adequate reliability and validity. Finally, we discussed how this emic MFPQ can be applied in cross-cultural research and argued that MFPQ can contribute to the stringent tests of the Moral Foundations Theory's key claims and support cross-cultural comparisons of its construct.",

          "abstract": "The evidence for the structure of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model relies heavily on analyses of correlations among DSM diagnoses, which entrenches some of their limitations. In this study, we deconstructed the mental disorders covered in HiTOP into individual symptoms—with personality disorders represented via item-level assessment of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders facets—and rebuilt the HiTOP model from the ground up. Participants self-selected into an online mental health study and were randomly split into primary (n = 11,762) and hold-out (n = 3,000) samples to identify a robust hierarchy of empirically derived constructs in the results, ranging from symptoms and syndromes to very broad ‘superspectra’ of psychopathology. In each sample, both hierarchical clustering and hierarchical principal components analyses were used; the final hierarchical structure was derived based on points of cross-sample and cross-method agreement. The resulting model was remarkably similar to the HiTOP model, including nearly all of the same subfactors, spectra, and superspectra—albeit with some reorganisation in the structure. The inclusion of broad hypomania/disinhibition and pathological introversion dimensions represented the most prominent differences compared to the current higher-order structure of HiTOP. The detailed lower-order constructs found here also mirrored many of the existing components and traits in HiTOP, as well as indicating some potential areas for revision. Finally, we re-mapped the disorders included in the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 onto the new model. Overall, the results suggest that the structural foundations of the HiTOP model are largely sound.",

          "abstract": "Background: Self-harm in young people is a pressing public health issue, with family support playing a crucial role in the young person’s prognosis. Concurrently, the impact extends to families themselves, who must navigate caregiving responsibilities while also requiring support. Understanding these experiences is key to providing more effective assistance in their caregiving roles. Aim: This mixed-methods systematic review aims to investigate the experiences, barriers, and needs of families of young people who self-harm. Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted across PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases in July 2024 and April 2025. A total of 31 studies were included in the review, and quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A narrative synthesis was employed for the quantitative data, while qualitative data were analysed using thematic synthesis. Results: The quantitative findings revealed two themes: (1) the repercussions of self-harm in the family, and (2) family support needs. Qualitative analysis identified four themes: (1) parents’ emotional and psychological impact; (2) impact on parenting and bond with young person; (3) disruption in wider family dynamics; and (4) barriers to and pathways for support. Conclusion: The review discusses the implications of these findings, offering recommendations for future research and improvements in family support services to alleviate caregiver burden and foster supportive environments for recovery.",

          "abstract": "Objective: We explored how White, Black, and Hispanic people rated their trust in juries, whether these patterns differed from trust in courts, what potential mechanisms might help explain any observed differences, and what potential outcomes might be associated with them. \n\nHypotheses: We expected White participants to have the most trust in juries (hypothesis 1) and Black participants to have the least trust in juries (hypothesis 2). We expected Hispanic participants to have more trust in juries than Black participants (hypothesis 3). However, given inconsistencies in the existing literature, we did not make definitive predictions for Hispanic compared to White participants; they may have less trust in juries than White people (hypothesis 4a) or may not significantly differ from White people (hypothesis 4b).\n\nMethod: Participants were 1,220 adults (406 White, 410 Black, 404 Hispanic) recruited from Prolific Academic (M age = 39.31, 53% female) who rated their trust in juries (α = .97, Bornstein et al., 2020), trust in courts (α = .87, Tyler &amp; Sevier, 2014), and answered exploratory measures about potential mechanisms or consequences related to trust.\n\nResults: Patterns for trust in juries were distinct from those for trust in courts. White and Black participants reported higher trust in juries than Hispanic participants, but White participants reported higher trust in courts than Black and Hispanic participants. There was also an indirect effect on trust in juries through perceived representativeness in which Black and Hispanic participants perceived juries as less representative of their own racial or ethnic group and, in turn, had less trust in juries.\n\nConclusions: Results extend the existing literature on institutional trust by demonstrating unique racial and ethnic patterns on trust in juries. They also underscore the role of perceived representativeness, highlighting the importance of increasing the diversity of juries. Such efforts can increase trust in juries and have downstream effects on legal behaviors.",

          "authors": "James Downs; Anna Carnegie; Mollie Twitchell; Bella Reed; David Morris; David Viljoen; Samuel Chawner; Agnes Ayton",
          "abstract": "The concept of “Restrictive Intake Self-Harm” (“RISH”) has recently been introduced to conceptualise divergent and/or complex presentations of restrictive eating behaviours as a form of self-harm, rather than symptoms of an eating disorder. Whilst this may represent a well-intentioned response to poorly met clinical needs, it also raises significant conceptual, ethical, and clinical concerns. This paper, written by authors with clinical, academic, and lived experience, situates “RISH” within a broader history of classificatory innovation in eating disorders, whereby new terminology has been introduced with insufficient empirical support and a lack of co-production with people with lived experience. Our analysis highlights the unintended consequences of this approach and how conflating restriction with self-injurious behaviour risks conceptual ambiguity, diagnostic misclassification, and the diversion of patients away from specialist services and evidence-based treatments that may benefit them. We advocate an empirical, data-driven approach to understanding the heterogeneous nature of restrictive eating and its diverse psychological, social, and cultural drivers across diagnoses. In clinical practice, greater skill in differential diagnosis and collaborative, individualised formulation is needed, alongside reform of service design to facilitate more integrated care. Vitally, terminology and care pathways for disordered eating need to be meaningfully co-produced with the people who need them, recognising the plurality and legitimacy of experiential knowledge as central to creating more inclusive and attuned care.",

          "abstract": "With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions).  This paper's main contributions are drawing attention to downstream effects of confusion errors, and providing an approach to measure and potentially recover from these errors. Specifically, we use a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. By fitting a joint model of speech behavior and algorithm behavior on real and simulated data, we show that classification errors can significantly distort estimates for both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and a slightly more accurate open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system). We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution.",

          "abstract": "Carl Rogers' concept of positive regard (PR) is central to client-centered therapy,\nemphasizing acceptance and respect to foster self-growth. While most PR research has focused on\nWestern cultures, this pilot study explored its expression among Indian therapists in a collectivistic\ncontext. Using a quantitative study design, this study aimed to explore how PR is perceived and\nexpressed by Indian therapists within a collectivistic framework. The sample consisted of 11\nfemale therapists residing in South India who completed two measures: the Psychotherapists'\nPerception of Positive Regard (PPPR) and the Psychotherapists' Expression of Positive Regard\nScale-Revised (PEPR-R). Descriptive statistical analysis using SPSS revealed that Indian\ntherapists highly valued empathy, emotional validation, authenticity, and non-verbal cues like body\nlanguage and tone of voice as affirming expressions of PR. Direct verbal affirmations, such as\n“I’m proud of you” and “I admire that about you,” were also highly rated, indicating that\nreinforcing client strengths is valued within this cultural context. However, therapist self-\ndisclosure and humor were seen as less affirming, consistent with collectivistic norms that\nprioritize professional boundaries. These findings align with Rogers’ concept of PR while\nhighlighting cultural nuances in its expression. Though the study provides preliminary insights\ninto PR in collectivistic contexts, its small sample size and limited regional scope point to the need\nfor further research with larger, more diverse groups.\nKeywords: Positive Regard, Carl Rogers, Indian therapists",

          "abstract": "Machine learning methods, like decision trees and random forests, allow researchers to investigate complex non-linear and interaction effects, making them valuable tools for exploring complex psychological processes. Recently, attempts have been made to extend decision tree methods (multilevel-trees) for their application to multilevel data, e.g., with level-1 (e.g., students) and level-2 (e.g., classes) units. While these adaptations include adding random effects to address lack of independence between observations, they do not consider the influence of the levels at which predictor variables operate. We investigate how predictor level (level-1 vs. level-2) and clustering (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), number of clusters, cluster size) affect inference and prediction in six tree-based methods: rpart, ctree, REEMtree, REEMctree, MERT, and lmertree. Using simulation studies, we evaluate variable selection, predictive performance (PMSE, r2), and predictive contribution of single predictor variables. Our results show that both standard and multilevel-tree methods are seriously affected by the level of the predictor variables and clustering in the data regarding prediction and inference. In particular, the risk of falsely selecting non-informative level-2 predictors is substantial, especially when the ICC is high. Ignoring the multilevel structure of the data might lead to erroneous research conclusions even though multilevel tree methods are applied.",

This study estimated differences between those reporting CHS symptoms and others who use cannabis daily and less frequently on measures of drug use, mental health problems, other health problems, antisocial behavior, and personality. \nDesign: The National Firearms, Alcohol, Cannabis, and Suicide (NFACS) survey, a nationally representative survey of US adults. \nSetting: United States\nParticipants: 7034 adults with survey adjustments to match the US adult population. Comparisons focused on: those with daily cannabis use and CHS symptoms (n = 191) vs those with daily cannabis use without CHS symptoms (n = 882), those with past year cannabis use but not daily use (less-than-daily) (n = 1288), and those without past year cannabis use (n = 4673).\nMeasurements: Survey items assessed substance use, common psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, and symptoms of CHS. Group differences were estimated using logistic and linear regression models. \nFindings: Those with CHS symptoms reported the highest rates and greatest variety of drug use compared to others who used cannabis. Those with CHS symptoms reported higher rates of other drug use than those who used cannabis daily without CHS symptoms across a variety of drug classes, including opioids (OR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.49, 5.78), hallucinogens (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.35, 3.68), and sedatives (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.06, 2.70), as well as higher rates of drug overdoses (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.71, 6.44), and greater use of all drug classes than those with less-than-daily cannabis use. Those with CHS symptoms also reported more symptoms of depression and anxiety, greater sleep problems, chronic pain, antisocial behavior, intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization, and personality traits associated with disinhibition than those who used daily (mean d = 0.58, all p’s &lt; .001) and less frequently (mean d = 0.69, all p’s &lt; .001) and those with no cannabis use in the past 12 months (mean d = 0.99, all p’s &lt; .001).\nConclusions: Those with CHS symptoms exhibit a variety of psychological and behavioral problems including higher rates of other drug use, psychiatric symptoms, antisocial behavior, and dysfunctional personality traits. Most research on CHS has focused on characterizing the physical symptoms of CHS and treatments to address nausea and vomiting. Our results highlight the importance of understanding and addressing the broader psychosocial challenges faced by people experiencing CHS symptoms.",

          "abstract": "High self-control is widely valued and linked to health, occupational success, and well-being. Despite its popularity as a research topic, major conceptual ambiguities remain. Such inconsistencies are not trivial: they obscure whether researchers study the same phenomenon, weaken construct validity, and produce conflicting findings. Clarifying what self-control is – and is not – is therefore essential for theoretical progress. Key issues concern whether self-control is best understood as an ability or a personality trait, and whether we should conceive of effortless habits as self-control processes.  Another key issue is that some conceptualizations of state self-control (momentary attempts to regulate behavior) show little overlap with trait self-control (being generally good at regulating behavior), although they should be conceptually aligned. Further confusion arises around what constitutes self-control conflict: some definitions include any motivational conflict between goals, others limit it to intertemporal choices where short-term and long-term benefits are opposed, and some require affective components such as desire. This article outlines these definitional problems and proposes clearer conceptual boundaries as a foundation for future theoretical and empirical work and proposes that self-control deals with “intentionally avoiding or attenuating anticipated or resolving present conflicts between two response options in favor of the response option that benefits a more important goal or standard, even though the competing response option represents a momentarily dominant, affectively charged response tendency”.",

I argue that efforts to bolster HIV prevention should focus first and foremost on ascertaining the various determinants of uptake for the various prevention modalities available, and acknowledge that people’s preferences for prevention strategies are neither universal nor static. We should therefore engage in ongoing monitoring of the many sociocognitive and structural determinants of the different prevention modalities over time, and make our sexual health services free from stigma, judgment, and risk eligibility criteria.",

By fitting drift-diffusion models to accuracy and response times, we found that starting with hard problems reduced girls’ processing efficiency and response caution on subsequent hard trials, whereas starting with easier problems selectively increased girls’ caution. Boys’ decision dynamics were largely unaffected by trial sequence. In a second experiment, starting with hard problems increased anxiety and reduced confidence for both genders, but only girls showed reduced willingness to choose harder, higher-reward challenges.

Second, we introduce and compare various methods to measure unusualness in a simulation study and demonstrate how reliability and validity of unusualness measures can be established. Third, we propose methods to uncover the elements of unusualness (i.e., unusual values, unusual combinations) and validate these methods through simulation. Fourth, we illustrate our framework using three empirical datasets (combined N = 1,834) and multiple assessment methods, showing that unusualness can be reliably measured and offering first insights into its generalizability, nomological network, incremental validity, and possible explanatory factors.

Participants were tested across immediate recall, delayed recall, free recall, and recognition, with encoding and retrieval contexts systematically varied. Results revealed that rhythmic environments enhanced encoding performance in male participants and acted as contextual cues for recall across genders. Performance was consistently higher when encoding and recall occurred in the same environment, extending classic findings on context-dependent memory to fine-grained architectural features. Exploratory analyses further suggested that upbringing environment through self-reported city complexity may shape sensitivity to spatial rhythms. These findings highlight architectural rhythm as a contextual cue for memory, suggesting that the built environment can influence episodic memory processes even in the absence of movement.",

Importantly, processes varied across people. People who formed cross-race kin relationships were the most likely to have stable cross-race contact, and people who engaged in “high effort” activities with their different-race contacts (e.g., confiding in) had closer relationships with them.

To address this lack of progress, we conducted a multi-stage modified Delphi study (n = 85 round one; n = 59 round two) followed by an in-person World Café workshop (n = 30) involving experts from most major game studios, international policy bodies, NGOs, research funders, and academia. Across online and in-person stages, participants identified shared priorities for future research and articulated practical steps needed to advance them. Using preferential-rank Single Transferable Vote analysis and reflexive thematic synthesis, we derived four cross-cutting conditions which had general consensus across stakeholders as necessary for coordinated progress: (i) strengthening evidence, (ii) improving communication, (iii) fostering collaboration, and (iv) building literacy. We translate these into a cross-sector roadmap outlining concrete near-, mid-, and long-term actions for researchers, industry, policymakers, funders, and civil society. Although developed in the context of video games, the structural barriers and proposed solutions generalise to behavioural science as a whole. Our findings show that while progress can often be difficult in digital behavioural science, applying the often underutilised Delphi and World Café methods allowed for the creation of both convergent priorities and a concrete path forward that stakeholders across sectors support. We see this as a foundation for building a more cumulative, transparent, and collaborative science of human behaviour in digital environments.",

We then examine the mechanism underlying this effect, showing that moral, rather than emotional, evaluations account for the observed patterns. Finally, we assess robustness by deriving predictions in equity–efficiency trade-off, ultimatum, and corruption games, and by showing that GPT evaluations predict human behavior also in these contexts.

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into career guidance and organisational decision systems, yet empirical evidence on applications designed to support women’s career development remains limited. Following PRISMA-ScR and a preregistered protocol, we searched 7 databases (plus backward and forward citation searching) and synthesised 13 empirical studies published between 2018 and 2025. Using inductive thematic analysis, we identified three functional domains: (a) bias mitigation and representation (e.g., auditing gendered language and platform-level disparities), (b) skills development and empowerment (e.g., AI-supported learning and writing interventions), and (c) career pathways and retention (e.g., matching and attrition-risk modelling). The evidence base was concentrated in system-facing applications that detect or shape inequities within recruitment, evaluation, and exposure systems; fewer studies evaluated individual-facing developmental support, and sustained career outcomes were rarely measured. Formal theory use was limited, with only a small minority of studies explicitly drawing on established frameworks; reporting on ethics, transparency, and governance was inconsistent. We suggest that research prioritises longitudinal and theory-informed evaluations, including intersectionality-informed analyses, and assess downstream impacts on women’s career trajectories alongside robust governance and accountability practices.",

          "abstract": "We constantly move between rooms, transitioning between spaces with different spatial features. When entering a high-ceilinged space through a lower one, we experience the compression-expansion effect, a well-established architectural principle long used to amplify perceived spaciousness. Despite its prominence in architectural theory and practice, the underlying perceptual psychometrics remain poorly understood. Here we identify and specify the psychometric function governing how sequential changes in ceiling height shape spatial perception. Using immersive virtual reality with freely moving participants, we manipulated room-height ratios and asked participants to adjust perceived room height following exposure to a preceding space. Perception followed a nonlinear sigmoid function rather than geometric scaling, revealing a marked asymmetry: height reductions were perceptually undershot by 33.45% (ratio 0.8), and equivalent increases were overshot by 12.11% (ratio 1.2). These dynamics align with predictive accounts of perception and parallel serial dependence effects in vision, indicating that architectural experience is temporally extended and shaped by prior spatial context. We provide the first quantitative characterization of the compression–expansion effect, transforming a long-standing design principle into an evidence-based model with implications for human experience, material efficiency, and sustainable architectural practice.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Implementation intentions are simple action plans that may help people with lower socio-economic position (SEP) to navigate their behavior in environments that undermine their healthy intentions. Implementation intentions hold potential in being a relatively simple, but remarkedly effective behavior change technique. However, it remains unclear whether such a micro-intervention fits the daily realities, needs and skills of lower SEP groups. We aimed to explore how adults with lower SEP 1) perceive (generating) implementation intentions for changing their health behavior, and 2) independently generate implementation intentions. Methods. Adults living in lower SEP neighborhoods (n = 15) participated in semi-structured interviews. Participants were instructed to think aloud while independently generating an implementation intention following written instructions. Interview data were thematically analyzed, and the plans were evaluated. Results. Participants perceived health as a central value in life, which translated into high readiness for health behavior change. Implementation intentions were perceived as helpful and motivating, because they provide structure, support small, doable steps and stimulate conscious decisions and reflections. Participants expressed strong motivation to use implementation intentions in daily life. However, although participants expressed that generating their plan was pleasant and easy, guidance was frequently requested and provided during plan formation. Besides, generated plans often lacked the essential if-then structure and concreteness. Conclusions. Implementation intentions appear acceptable and appealing as a behavior change strategy for adults with lower SEP. However, independent formation of well-structured, actionable plans is challenging. Guided support is needed to ensure successful use of implementation intentions in lower SEP populations.",

          "abstract": "Theory-driven computational psychiatry attempts to use cognitive models of computation to understand how mental health problems might relate to (or be caused by) changes in cognitive processes such as learning and decision-making. However, the potential applications and relevance of this approach are contingent on several (often implicit) assumptions, including that computational parameters 1) are recoverable, 2) are reliable over time, 3) reflect conceptually similar processes across different tasks, and 4) relate to symptoms. To illustrate and test these assumptions for a selection of commonly used tasks, we recruited a large online sample of participants (n=548), who completed seven mental health questionnaires and five tasks. A subset of n=115 was re-invited to complete the five tasks 14 days later. For each task, five models (including a null model, or model of no interest) were fit and the winning model was selected through Bayesian model comparison. The parameters from the winning models showed good recovery (mean r=0.853, sd=0.135), and good to excellent levels of test-retest reliability (mean ICC=0.635, sd=0.30). Parameters that were theoretically or mathematically similar to each other were, however, generally not related, with relationships only found within the class of ‘inverse temperature’-like parameters (significant r values ranged from 0.11 to 0.23): indicating that in general, parameters do not generalise across task contexts. Finally, only parameters from two of the five tasks (four-armed bandit and cognitive effort) related to symptoms, and these relationships were weak (maximum absolute r values ~0.10). To conclude, it seems that at least some of the implicit assumptions when advocating for the use of computational models in psychiatry are not met for these popular tasks and computational models. This limits the clinical and translational utility of this approach. Computational psychiatry researchers should carefully assess the assumptions and psychometric properties of their tasks and models as part of their early-phase development to ensure robustness of the field going forward.",

We discuss how AI can support the creation of audio summaries, multilingual publications, and other content that makes research more accessible and engaging to broader audiences. We provide AI-generated proof-of-concept examples for each aspect, such as a podcast version of our commentary. While using AI carries risks and ethical challenges, we believe these examples highlight the potential of AI to enhance the inclusivity and reach of academic publishing, which should be considered both within PoPS and beyond.",

In a preregistered study (N = 535), we examined how people perceive different types of moral behaviors and whether those perceptions help distinguish between moral and social norms. To test this, we assigned participants to one of five types of commonly studied norms—conventional, fairness, harm, purity, and generosity—and presented them with eight behaviors, four prescriptive and four proscriptive. To capture differences in belief internalization, participants answered a series of measures for each behavior assessing intrinsic motivation to follow the behaviors, beliefs about the importance of norm adherence (or avoidance), and sensitivity to reputational concerns in their intentions to engage in the behaviors. We had two main findings: First, our measures of internalization varied across behavioral domains, such that harm was generally perceived as the most internalized and conventional behaviors the least. Second, harm perceptions partially mediated differences in intrinsic motivation between harm and several behavioral domains, suggesting that harm perceptions may underlie differences in internalization between social and moral norms. Together, our results reveal important differences in how people perceive social and moral norms, informing our understanding of norm cognition and internalization.",

Using data from the WVS and adopting a multilevel approach (57 countries, N = 73,838), we found that greater personal experience of economic precarity and crime witnessing predicted stronger justification of violence. These relationships were moderated by the country-level socio-ecological roots of honour, defined in terms of national-level low income, unequal distribution of resources, and low adherence to the rule of law, used as proxies of resource scarcity and inadequate law enforcement. In countries with weak socio-ecological roots of honour, personal experiences of precarity and crime were associated with stronger justification of violence, whereas in countries with strong socio-ecological roots of honour, the effect sizes of these associations were negligible. We discuss the social comparison, cultural fit, and cultural backlash hypotheses as potential explanations of the interaction effect observed between nation- and personal-level factors.",

          "authors": "Gina Katharina Goebel; Nicole Krämer",
          "abstract": "Technological innovations repeatedly spark public controversy and often encounter societal resistance, especially regarding perceived risks and benefits. In early phases, when no broad public discourse exists, people are required to engage with new technologies before reliable knowledge or regulatory frameworks are available. Public acceptance thus plays a central role in the successful implementation of emerging technologies. Intuitive perceptions and informational needs are particularly influential in these phases yet remain insufficiently studied. Societal perception thereby becomes a key factor in the success or failure of technological development. This study examines how individuals respond to an emerging, explanation-intensive technology they have never encountered before. Terahertz (THz) serves as an exemplary case: it is largely unknown outside expert circles, yet holds significant potential in areas such as medicine, security, and communication. The analysis is based on 17 semi-structured individual interviews with members of the public without prior technical knowledge. Participants were asked about their general perceptions and attitudes toward emerging technologies, drawing on examples they were familiar with before being introduced to potential applications of THz. The interviews revealed a general openness paired with a strong demand for information about risks, use cases, and societal relevance. Trust in institutions, perceived controllability, data privacy concerns, and emotional reactions to uncertainty emerged as key influencing factors. The findings offer insights into early meaning-making processes in relation to unfamiliar technologies and provide a basis for anticipatory, audience-sensitive strategies in science and technology communication.",

This preregistered controlled design allowed us to compare demographic-similarity with a theoretically grounded alternative: motivational alignment, defined as the match between a protagonist’s current motivation and the observer’s own motivational priorities. Motivational alignment reliably predicted narrative interest and remained a significant predictor even when demographic-similarity was included in the same model. We also found no evidence that demographic-similarity predicts interest, even when specific information about the protagonist’s motivation was absent. These findings identify motivational alignment as a central determinant of narrative interest.",

This scoping review mapped digital media interventions for young people and/or their caregivers that have been empirically evaluated, and described what has been tested, for whom, where and with which methods. We identified 120 peer-reviewed publications reporting 131 intervention evaluations (2006-2024) from 38 countries. Overall, 68.7% (n = 90) reported at least one statistically significant improvement on an intended outcome. Quasi-experimental designs predominated (72.5%; n = 95); experimental designs were less common (27.5%; n = 36). Interventions more often focused exclusively on risk reduction (45.8%; n = 60) than exclusively on opportunities (25.2%; n = 33); 29.0% (n = 38) did both. Across 34 target domains, literacy-related aims dominated – particularly media literacy (n = 37) – followed by cyberbullying (n = 23) and online safety behaviour (n = 9). Coverage across populations was uneven: among interventions with determinable sample ages (n = 97), most targeted adolescents (70.1%; n = 68), with limited early-childhood evidence (4.1%; n = 4). Few interventions targeted special educational needs (3.8%; n = 5) and ethnicity/race was rarely reported (13.7%; n = 18). Schools were the most common implementation context (74.8%; n = 98); structured pre-intervention training was reported for teachers in 22.9% (n = 30) and for parents in 4.6% (n = 6).

          "abstract": "Everyday listening often requires the auditory system to move beyond the perception of individual sound sources towards a more global representation of acoustic scenes. While auditory behaviour has been well characterised for one or a few sources, it remains unclear how listeners perceive scenes containing many simultaneous sounds. One way to address this question is through auditory numerosity judgement, the ability to estimate how many distinct sound sources are present in an acoustic scene. Because numerosity perception is known to saturate at higher source counts, it provides a useful window into how representations shift from discrete sources towards more scene-level percepts. Here, we measured numerosity judgements separately along the three dimensions of auditory space: azimuth, elevation, and distance, allowing each spatial axis to be examined in isolation. As these dimensions rely on markedly different spatial cues and differ strongly in spatial acuity, this design enabled the dissociation of spatial and non-spatial contributions to numerosity perception. Across dimensions, numerosity judgements showed no systematic relationship with individual spatial hearing performance. Speech intelligibility likewise exerted only a weak influence, suggesting a limited role for higher-level or linguistic processing. In contrast, perceived numerosity was significantly modulated by the spectrotemporal coverage of the acoustic mixture, a low-level property independent of spatial cues. Together, these findings suggest that auditory numerosity judgement is largely insensitive to spatial hearing precision and instead reflects more general constraints on how complex sound mixtures are represented at the scene level.",

Therapists who outsourced tasks, whether to an LLM or a human colleague, were generally evaluated more negatively than those who completed tasks themselves. Overall, human and LLM outsourcing were viewed similarly, but evaluations varied by task type. LLM outsourcing was seen as particularly inappropriate for core clinical tasks, yet more acceptable for peripheral tasks.

          "abstract": "Recently, several authors have argued that the current impasse in consciousness science supports a pluralistic interpretation: the view that seemingly contradictory findings may both be valid because consciousness can be brought about in different ways, each sufficient to generate conscious experience. We analyze different versions of pluralism to determine under what conditions it offers a viable interpretation of consciousness science. We argue that viable pluralism requires a two-factor framework distinguishing general consciousness factors (mechanisms rendering contents conscious) from content encoding itself. Moreover, NCC kinds must be finite in number and systematically ordered to enable a unified scientific model. While pluralism enables testable hypotheses, significant ontological tensions arise: how can consciousness constitute a unified natural kind if realized by fundamentally distinct NCC kinds? Drawing on philosophy of science, we propose an alternative interpretation in terms of scientific rather than natural kinds. Our goal is not to advocate for pluralism, but rather, to critically examine its viability and implications. Based on this, we urge the field to engage more explicitly with the foundational assumptions that shape consciousness research.",

This study included 493 Italian children and adolescents aged 7-16 years old (M = 11.35; SD = 2.64): 147 (126 boys) with ASD without intellectual disability, 105 (88 boys) with ADHD, and 241 (203 boys) non-diagnosed peers. Parents completed standardized measures assessing communication skills, ASD and ADHD traits. Both clinical groups showed significant communication difficulties compared to non-diagnosed peers, with large effect sizes (ASD-ND: d=1.66; ADHD-ND: d=-1.00). Importantly, results supported a dimensional model: individual differences in communication were more effectively explained by variation in ASD and ADHD traits across the entire sample (BIC = 4151.39) than by diagnostic group membership alone (BIC = 4324.75). Both trait dimensions independently predicted communication challenges across clinical and non-clinical population, though ADHD traits had a slightly weaker effect. This perspective provides a more nuanced understanding of how ASD and ADHD traits may relate to communication challenges across the general population, extending beyond the boundaries of clinical diagnosis.",

While influential theories, including Scalar Expectancy Theory and the Striatal Beat Frequency model, have shaped our understanding of timing, they leave unresolved how the timing process is first triggered. This article proposes the Sensory-Origin Timing (SOT) model, a novel mechanism whereby prospective timing is initiated by sensory organs, with their activity providing the source for duration estimation. Specifically, we suggest that the total activity generated by the sensory organ during the transduction of a stimulus is directly related to its duration and is monitored by the striatum to form a neural representation of elapsed time. Two electroretinography studies tested this proposal in the visual modality. In Study 1, retinal activity predicted subjective duration judgments even when objective stimulus duration was held constant. In Study 2, retinal activity conformed to two fundamental scalar principles of prospective timing: mean accuracy and Weber’s law. These findings are consistent with the SOT model, providing direct support for its validity. By grounding the origin of duration perception in sensory activity, SOT addresses key limitations of existing cognitive and neurobiological theories, provides a bridge between them, and delivers a unified framework that can explain established temporal distortions and cross-modal differences. More broadly, by clarifying how timing is initiated, SOT strengthens the theoretical foundations of time perception and advances our understanding of its role in cognition and behaviour.",

          "authors": "Eva janssen; Bernd Figner; Zhang Chen",
          "abstract": "Background and aims: Online gambling has given rise to game designs that may pose unique risks of harm. One novel format of online gambling is crash gambling, a fast-paced game in which players must cash out before a randomly determined crash (aka “bust”) point. A distinctive feature of this design is that even when winning, players often miss out on a larger potential win, a feature we term missed-opportunity wins. This study examined the effects of such missed-opportunity wins on subsequent risk-taking behaviour. Methods: We analysed behavioural tracking data from a crypto crash gambling game. First, an exploratory analysis was conducted on 2,000 players, followed by a pre-registered confirmatory analysis on 15,000 new players. Using Bayesian mixed-effects models, we tested whether the size of a missed-opportunity win in one round predicted changes in wager size and/or the likelihood of being busted in the next round, as indicators of risk-taking. Results: Larger missed-opportunity wins were associated with a greater likelihood of changing one’s wager in the next round. When players adjusted their wager, larger missed-opportunity wins increased the likelihood of raising rather than lowering the wager. Additionally, larger missed-opportunity wins predicted a higher likelihood of being busted in the following round, all indicating different forms of increased risk-taking. Discussion and Conclusions: Missing out on a larger potential win encourages subsequent risk-taking. By demonstrating how counterfactual elements in crash gambling designs shape behaviour, this study highlights behavioural shifts associated with novel online gambling mechanics and can inform policy discussions on their regulation.",

          "abstract": "Stress is an umbrella term that lacks a universally agreed upon definition. The construct ambiguity of stress undermines theoretical integration, construct validity, and cumulative knowledge development. In our critical review, we trace the historical evolution of the stress construct, delineate sources of conceptual ambiguity, and evaluate whether the term stress itself is necessary for scientific exploration. We show that we do not need the term stress to describe the phenomena studied in stress research. However, the term ‘stress’ may still be useful to refer to a field of research and to integrate research findings. We demonstrate that phenomena related to stress can be described using more precise constructs: stressors, stress responses, and health outcomes. To facilitate conceptual clarity, we synthesize umbrella definitions for these constructs. Because such umbrella definitions remain necessarily broad, we emphasize that specifying the conceptualization and operationalization of the stressor, stress response, and health outcomes is indispensable for empirical rigor. To this end, we introduce the Stress Conceptualization Checklist for Empirical Studies (SuCCES), a structured reporting framework that guides researchers to describe the theory and conceptualization, specify which type of stressor, stress response and health outcome is studied, describe how they have arrived at their operationalization and differentiation  between the stressor, stress response and health outcomes, and specify the context, time scale, life period, and assessment window of their stress measurement. This reporting standard aims to strengthen construct validity, improve measurement coherence, and promote cumulative progress in research on stress-related processes.",

          "abstract": "Climate anxiety – negative emotional reactions to climate change – has been linked to poorer psychological wellbeing and has shown to have mixed associations with pro-environmental behaviour. Although a growing number of studies have examined the correlates of climate anxiety, few have investigated its prevalence in national samples. Addressing this gap, we used the Hogg Climate Anxiety Scale to measure levels of climate anxiety in New Zealand. Using a representative sample by age, ethnicity, gender, and region (N = 429), our goals were threefold: (1) measure the prevalence of climate anxiety in the New Zealand population and across the 16 regions; (2) examine the associations between climate anxiety and both sociodemographic variables and psychological wellbeing; and (3) clarify whether the correlation with pro-environmental behaviour fits linear versus non-linear models. Overall, 5.2% (95% CI [3.4; 7.8]) of participants reported experiencing climate anxiety, and .5% (95% CI [.0; 1.8]) reported nearly daily climate anxiety, with the highest prevalence observed in the Bay of Plenty region, and highest severity in Southland. People who experienced climate impacts, those working in environment-related jobs, those who felt less prepared for climate change, and younger people reported higher climate anxiety. Those with higher climate anxiety also reported greater psychological distress, reduced wellbeing, and more engagement in pro-environmental behaviours. We discuss potential strategies for supporting at-risk groups, and ways to capitalize on the benefits of climate anxiety while preventing its maladaptive consequences in New Zealand.",

The illusion consists of a larger circle at 50cm, and smaller circle in front of it at 40cm, with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation in depth between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) or constant retinal disparity (6.7cm)? Observers choose constant disparity. We therefore argue the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’ appears to suggest that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities rather than 3D geometry.",

          "abstract": "Tractography is a key component of efforts to map brain connectivity. As a rapidly-evolving field of neuroscience, current tractography methods are diverse, often varying across research laboratories and different software pipelines. Therefore, it suffers from a lack of standardization leading to inconsistencies in results, which can limit reproducibility, and affect the robustness needed for research and clinical applications of these methods. Variability in data acquisition procedures, inconsistencies in spatial referencing schemes and implementations, and anatomical heterogeneity —at the individual level, across the lifespan, and across species— hinders comparative analyses. Additionally, the lack of consensus on best practices complicates the development of robust automated quality control pipelines and limits the clinical translation of tractography-based procedures. Establishing standardized protocols for acquisition, preprocessing, and tractography reconstruction are critical towards enabling reliable tract-specific analyses, facilitating cross-study harmonization, and supporting replicable large-scale population studies. The present article provides an overview of the current challenges in tractography standardization and identifies the key aspects that require standardization for reliable, reproducible, and robust tractography.",

          "abstract": "The AI revolution has produced synthetic faces that often appear more human than photos of real people. We tested whether individual differences in human face recognition ability explain variation in discriminating AI from real faces. Super-recognizers – people with exceptional ability to recognize human faces (N = 36) – outperformed a typical sample by 15% and by 7% compared to a group of higher performing, motivated control participants (Cohen's d = 0.55; N = 89). Individual difference analysis revealed that this pattern reflected a positive association between human face recognition and AI face discrimination abilities. AI discrimination ability was also associated with individuals' sensitivity to the ‘hyper-average’ appearance of AI faces. Deep neural networks optimized for face identity processing confirmed a more central distribution of AI faces in face-space. Moreover, centrality was associated with a higher probability of super-recognizers judging the faces as AI, but this pattern was not observed for controls. Super-recognizers' correct interpretation of hyper-averageness as a cue to artificiality constitutes the first mechanistic link between evolved expertise in face processing and AI face detection and addresses a common misconception regarding the structure of human face space.",

          "abstract": "Accusations that foreigners are “eating pets” tap into deep fears of impurity and cruelty. Despite the dark history of such moralized disgust and evidence that purity- and harm-based emotions can intensify bias, little experimental work has directly tested how these processes jointly shape prejudice. Across two main-text experiments and one supplemental replication (N = 2,710, U.S.), we tested whether hostility is greatest when cultural outgroups are portrayed as consuming meat that elicits both visceral (purity-related) disgust and moral concern. A pretest confirmed that dog meat evoked the highest moral concern, rat the highest contamination-related appraisals, and cow was neutral, while Study 2 substituted monkey to test generalization. Prejudice and punitive intent were strongest for morally protected animals (dog, monkey), moderate for rat, and lowest for cow. Visceral disgust showed more consistent association with bias, whereas compassion played a more limited role. Invoking disgust and perceived cruelty can become a potent trigger of hostility toward cultural outgroups.",

          "abstract": "Research on international student mobility has predominantly emphasized economic, academic, and structural determinants of study-abroad decisions. While these approaches illuminate macro-level patterns, they offer limited insight into the psychological and sociocultural meanings students attach to prestigious foreign institutions. This qualitative study examines how Korean undergraduate and graduate students perceive their decision to study in the United States, focusing on identity development and future goals. The study employs identity-based motivation theory, possible selves, and consumer identity theory to frame U.S. higher education as a symbol of status and social recognition. In-depth interviews with Korean students at U.S. universities identified seven key themes shaping their decisions: relational self-concept, family expectations, prior academic experiences, job security goals, the desire for independence, cost considerations, and the reputation of U.S. schools as markers of global competence. The results show that studying abroad involves more than acquiring skills for employment; it helps students develop their identities, compare themselves socially, and navigate social and academic hierarchies. By integrating psychological and sociological perspectives, the study explains how motivation, identity, and the symbolic meaning of education influence students’ decisions to study abroad.",

Estimation is based on sufficient statistics of future expected values by future migration flows and novel data on rail network disruption from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The TTE risk reduces welfare not only in vulnerable regions close to the expected epicenter but also in more distant regions, revealing the regional spillover effects of the disaster risk. The maglev train project increases welfare by 1.6\\% on average, with effects that are larger in the north-east regions under the economy with TTE risk, highlighting the distributional effect under the disaster risk.",

          "abstract": "Education and public engagement are increasingly recognized as essential levers for biodiversity conservation. Over the past decade, biodiversity-related education and engagement initiatives have expanded considerably, yet their evaluation remains fragmented and methodologically uneven. This diversity complicates assessments of effectiveness, comparability, and long-term conservation relevance.\nWe conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2015 and 2025 to examine how evaluation practices are designed, implemented, and reported in biodiversity-related education and engagement initiatives. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, 74 articles were selected from the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed in terms of implementation contexts, target publics, educational practices, evaluation objectives, methodologies, temporalities, reported outcomes, limitations, and levers.\nThe review reveals a strong concentration of evaluations in formal education settings, primarily targeting children and young people. Objectives are largely structured around the knowledge–attitudes–behaviors (KAB) framework, with limited attention to competencies, empowerment, collective processes, or ecological outcomes. Most studies rely on short-term, self-reported quantitative measures, while longitudinal, qualitative, participatory, and process-oriented approaches remain underrepresented. Although experiential, place-based, creative, and participatory practices are identified as promising levers, their impacts are rarely assessed beyond immediate individual-level outcomes.\nOverall, the findings expose a structural tension between the diversity of biodiversity education practices and the absence of shared, integrative evaluation frameworks. Advancing evaluation in this field requires systemic, reflexive, and multi-scalar approaches linking individual learning, collective action, institutional change, and conservation outcomes. Such a shift is essential to strengthen the contribution of education to conservation and to support more robust, cumulative, and policy-relevant evidence.",

We first explored and identified key patterns across 8,550 sensor-logged showering events from 319 German households. We then combined this high-resolution smart-meter data with time-stamped post-shower surveys to analyse shampoo-shower duration. The Gamma mixed model (14 predictors spanning demographics, context, in-shower behaviour and hair characteristics) explained 68.4% of deviance (AIC = 4281.6). Behavioural predictors showed the clearest associations: showers with two or more shampoo applications were 27% longer than those with one, while showers with three or more water pauses were 28% longer than those with one. Some contextual and demographic predictors also mattered: soft water areas were linked to 23% longer durations, and younger/mid-age adults had durations up to 31% longer than adults 50+. Other factors (gender, employment, household composition/size, home type, bills responsibility and most hair characteristics) showed small or uncertain effects after adjustment. Findings demonstrate how smart metering, event-level behavioural data and robust modelling can reveal actionable levers for demand-side management, behavioural interventions and product design.",

We use a difference-in-differences design based on county-level variation in average wage levels to assess how the 2015 minimum wage reform in Germany affected the employment of 1) mothers and childless women, 2) mothers of pre-school and school-aged children, and 3) mothers in counties with low and high childcare availability. We contrast theoretical predictions from neoclassical economics and theories of gender norms to derive hypotheses. Using panel data from the German Microcensus (2014-2015) for West Germany, we estimate the impact of the minimum wage at the county level (N=324 counties) on women’s transition probabilities between inactivity, marginal, part-time, and full-time employment. Findings support that inactive mothers were more likely to take up marginal or part-time work after the reform, whereas already employed mothers tended to reduce their working hours, thus consolidating maternal marginal and part-time work. Childless women show little response to the reform. Overall, raising wage floors may reduce gaps in employment participation between mothers and childless women, but is unlikely to reduce gaps in employment intensity.",

          "abstract": "This study provides new evidence for the understanding of the consequences of family policies on poverty: we investigate if and to what extent higher childcare availability when the youngest child is aged 0-2 affects household poverty in subsequent years. Unlike prior cross-country research, we focus on within-country variation in childcare availability over 400 German counties using panel data from the Microcensus (2012–2019) linked to local childcare provision data. Our findings show a significant reduction in household poverty risk over and above the mediating role of maternal employment. This effect is notably stronger in Eastern than in Western counties. In Western counties, higher ECEC coverage is associated with poverty declines primarily for single mothers and mothers whose partners work non-standard jobs, while in Eastern counties mostly for mothers with partners employed in standard or non-standard jobs. Poverty risks decrease as children grow older for less affluent households regardless of childcare availability. We conclude that more childcare “today” does improve the economic wellbeing of households with children “tomorrow”. We discuss policy implications arguing that more widespread and substantial poverty reduction cannot be envisaged via higher childcare availability only. This is particularly true in institutional settings promoting the “adult worker model” for mothers against the background of persistent and large gender pay gaps and where the burden of reconciling work and care falls largely on mothers’ shoulders.",

We bridge these two literature streams by using a dynamic approach, illustrating how actual-to-preferred-hour mismatches evolve when the youngest child is aged 0-3.\nMethod\nWe apply multichannel sequence and fuzzy clustering analysis on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP, 2008-2023), restricting our sample to 645 cohabitating couples. Next, we use Dirichlet regression to link the identified (fuzzy) patterns to individual, household, and contextual characteristics.\nResults\nAmong mothers, mismatches between actual and preferred working hours increase as children grow older, with many mothers employed in short part-time jobs wishing to work more hours (i.e., underemployment), while most full-time working mothers would prefer to reduce their hours (i.e., overemployment). Among full-time working fathers, a substantial share feels either overemployed or satisfied with their current hours. Dirichlet regression reveals that among fathers, especially job characteristics are associated with overemployment, while individual characteristics and constraints are associated with longer-term preferences for inactivity among mothers.\nConclusion\nResults highlight that overemployment and employment matched with preferences is much more common among parents than underemployment, leaving little room for reallocation of paid and unpaid work within couples.",

          "abstract": "The term ‘paper park’ is widely used to label protected areas that only exist ‘on paper’. Identifying and rectifying paper parks could be critical for producing ‘effectively conserved and managed […] systems of protected areas’, a core component of Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3. However, the term is not well defined and often applied to cases more accurately described as protected areas with low management effectiveness. This inconsistency is problematic because areas where management interventions are entirely absent (true paper parks) fundamentally differ in conceptualisation, monitoring, and required solutions from those where management is insufficient or poorly executed (ineffective management). To address this, here we propose a new paper park definition as “a site that has been legally or otherwise designated as a protected area, but where management interventions have been absent for at least 5 years”. We present a decision tree to identify paper parks and discuss how they differ from other types of conservation areas. We suggest addressing the problem by measuring the extent of paper parks, investigating the causes of absent management, and prioritising investment to implement effective interventions. Without such work, there is a risk that Target 3 will perversely incentivise the creation of more paper parks.",

          "abstract": "The United States (U.S.) food system is governed by an extensive set of regulations that determines, in part, which foods reach consumers and how. Regulations play an important role in protecting public interests, such as environmental well-being, but their complexity and number are criticized for delaying innovation and increasing business costs. We explored how the regulatory landscape varies across U.S. food industries and compares to industries’ associated environmental impacts. We analyzed five decades of federal regulatory data from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for 44 food industries across five food production sectors. We found that the total number of food system regulations has increased over time, with large disparities across individual food sectors. Since at least 1970, the aquaculture sector was annually subject to a greater number of direct regulations than any other food sector, on average. Aquaculture regulation originates from a larger number of CFR titles and federal agencies, and aquaculture is often subject to more regulations within each title and agency, than other food sectors. Our analysis identified several cases where food industries with smaller environmental impacts (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, water use, land use)—including industries in the aquaculture sector—were subject to as many or more total regulations as food industries with larger environmental impacts. This pattern also persisted when comparing impacts only to the number of environmental regulations. While the number of regulations is only a proxy measure of regulatory burden, our results suggest that the U.S. federal regulatory landscape might disadvantage some lower-environmental-impact food industries and their products in the U.S. marketplace, especially aquaculture.",

          "title": "From Climate Distress to Psychedelic Insight: Exploring the Lived Experience of Eco-anxiety and Psychedelics",
          "authors": "Luisa Čapková; Ginie Servant Miklos",
          "abstract": "Eco-anxiety is gaining attention as a growing mental health issue. This phenomenon emerges due to perceived lack of control over ecological destruction, and is characterized by a spectrum of emotions, such as grief, anger, worry, uncertainty and hopelessness. However, eco-anxiety appears to affect more than one’s emotional state, with consequences for behaviour and engagement with environmental and societal issues. While existing mental health interventions such as Acceptance Commitment Therapy have been adapted and studied for addressing eco- anxiety with mixed results, there remains a gap in understanding and addressing the experiential dimension of this challenge. To address this gap, this study uses Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to explore the lived experience of eco-anxiety and the impact of psychedelic experiences on coping mechanisms and meaning-making processes. In-depth interviews exploring individual accounts revealed that psychedelics could serve as transformative catalysts for eco-anxiety. Psychedelic experiences triggered shifts in worldviews and broadened perspectives, leading to a sense of interconnectedness of the self, nature and the universe. Furthermore, such experiences enabled emotional release and reconfiguration, further alleviating distress. Those emotional and cognitive shifts gave opportunities for new ways of understanding and responding to eco-anxiety, mitigating feelings of hopelessness and anger through adaptive environmental action. This study contributes to the current dialogue on eco-anxiety and offers insights into understanding how ecological distress and psychedelics interact, proposing psychedelics as transformative catalysts.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to examine the interrelated effects of finance structure, institutional quality, and macro-demographics on CO₂  emissions per capita in OECD countries from 2004 to 2021. Building on the conventional linear and aggregate nature of the finance–environment relationship, this study suggests an improved methodology based on a hybrid framework combining panel estimation, machine learning-based clustering, and nonlinear modeling. The empirical findings support a positive relationship between bank-based intermediation structure, represented by private credit and credit quality, and CO₂  emissions per capita, which could be explained by a scale effect. At the same time, a negative relationship is found between non-performing loans and CO₂  emissions per capita. In addition, a negative relationship is found between the assets of pension funds and mutual funds and CO₂  emissions per capita. This suggests a critical role played by long-horizon investors in offsetting the carbon footprint of economic activity. Government effectiveness is found to have a positive relationship with CO₂  emissions per capita. This could reflect development stage considerations rather than institutional failure. Finally, a weak positive relationship is found between population density and CO₂  emissions per capita. This supports scale efficiencies. The K-means clustering methodology reveals a strong structural heterogeneity in the finance–environment relationship. This supports the view that there are unique structural regimes in which similar CO₂  emissions per capita outcomes are influenced by a variety of interrelated finance structure and institutional quality drivers. In addition, the Random Forest methodology outperforms other machine learning techniques. This suggests a strong nonlinear nature in the finance–environment relationship. Finally, the empirical findings support a relatively stronger emphasis placed on structural finance structure and institutional quality variables rather than short-run macroeconomic variables in explaining variations in CO₂  emissions per capita.",

This study presents an expert-informed assessment of crime threats and countermeasures associated with CCMTs, involving 28 experts from government, law enforcement, industry, academia, and civil society. Through structured idea generation, thematic analysis, and forecasting surveys, the participants evaluated 35 distinct crime threats and 36 countermeasures, of which 13 threats and 18 countermeasures were uniquely identified by them. The identified risks were found to be concentrated in CCMT supply chains and resource extraction, with high-priority threats relating to environmental harms, illegal mining, and human rights abuse, alongside cyber-enabled and financial crimes. Promising countermeasures include CCMT-specific regulation, risk assessment, data sharing, physical security, and targeted education. The findings show that the green transition reshapes rather than removes crime risks, underscoring the need for proactive governance to ensure a secure and sustainable low-carbon transition.",

          "abstract": "Present-day mobility systems centered around automobility need transformative change to become just and sustainable. In these processes of societal transitions, citizen-led social movements are often theorized to be valuable actors, yet when it comes to mobility transitions, they have received little attention. We therefore investigate a prominent fifty-year mobilization of community activism against highway construction and expansion in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The social movement to protect Amelisweerd forest is described in a historical narrative drawing on contemporary primary and secondary sources. We analyze the movement through its ability to exercise agencies for transition governance: how a highly localized movement attempts to support systemic change. Identifying destabilization, visioning alternatives, independent spaces, and reflexivity as key mechanisms, we demonstrate how activists have deployed each type of agency as required. The Amelisweerd case indicates that local social movements can build broad coalitions around alternative solutions through strategic adaptability, whose greatest obstacle is ideological entrenchment on the national scale. These transformative social movements and their potential obstructions are worthy of greater consideration in mobility transitions.",

          "abstract": "Segregation is a pervasive social phenomenon, separating individuals of different categories or groups across social foci. Workplaces are hubs of the labor market and central to economic outcomes, but may also facilitate cross-cutting social ties. Workplace segregation might exacerbate social inequality and decrease social cohesion. Most work on segregation focuses on salient categories like race and ethnicity, and we know little about segregation by more subtle statuses. Social class background is a case in point, because it is imperfectly observed by individuals involved in social interaction, and is more difficult to measure for total populations. In this paper, we analyze workplace segregation by social class background. We document substantial segregation by social background, over and above counterfactual segregation under random allocation of employees across workplaces. Moreover, we observe segregation levels over and above what would be expected under random allocation conditional on individual and workplace characteristics, including e.g. human capital, occupation, and workplace county. Also, when accounting for our richest set of covariates, employees are somewhat overexposed to coworkers who share their own class background. The excess segregation is the smallest for groups at the bottom of the class origin distribution, and larger at the top.",

          "abstract": "Immigration attitudes research is often centered on cultural and economic threat debates. However, this focus has missed an important mechanism that guides our everyday judgments: fairness. Very limited work has engaged with fairness and little has done so in the context of immigration. To address this, I construct a theoretically grounded method for measuring different dimensions of fairness. Using an original conjoint experiment, I test how varying state-level policy attributes such as eligibility requirements, intended beneficiaries, and assistance types influence perceptions of fairness. Agreement with different dimensions of fairness and policy support increase when policies include social services and exclusion criteria. I find limited evidence for xenophobic cultural threat and sociotropic economic threat in motivating policy support. The results offer a reevaluation of immigration attitude debates and demonstrate opportunities for broader use of a multidimensional measurement of fairness, as well as suggest a framework for democratically popular subnational immigrant integration policy design.",

To construct the dataset, we develop a methodological procedure based on large-language models that semi-automatically collect, standardize, and store candidate vote counts while instantly validating the resulting information. Our dataset releases multiple levels of data, including election metadata, round-level attributes, and candidate-level information with consistent election identifiers, allowing users to address key questions in electoral competition under RCV.

          "abstract": "Cultures of shared governance in academia may appear as a noble tradition to be upheld and defended against the steady encroachment of audit culture. However, building upon recent interest in the ‘dark side’ of collegiality, this theoretically-motivated article proposes that the collegial ideal of collective and participatory decision-making now co-exist alongside performance metrics in an uneasy alliance that softens their surface-level opposition. Invoking the paradoxical concept of ‘participatory Taylorism,’ this study demonstrates that faculty engagement is essential to audit culture’s apparent staying power. Performance metrics survive by opening themselves to the demos, inviting robust debates about their composition and legitimacy – provided these dialogues stop short of contesting audit culture itself. In this sense, permissible modes of shared governance perform a type of ‘collegiality-washing,’ substituting a simulacra of participation for the real thing.  Moreover, because ‘participation’ is precisely the lever through which performance measures exert their influence, conventional oppositional strategies risk co-optation. In a university setting that demands constant engagement and actively recuperates dissent, resistance may take the form of withdrawal, silence, or even a more recent trend, ‘quiet quitting.’",

          "abstract": "Combinatorial invention—the process by which new technologies emerge through the combination of existing ones—is central to technological evolution, yet it remains poorly understood. This paper develops a novel framework for analysing combinatorial invention by recognising its dual nature as both a design problem-solving process and a lineage-generating process. While existing approaches often treat combinatorial invention as a stochastic process mapping precursor technologies to composite ones, this framework reveals how the challenge of interfacing components generates multiple concurrent technological traditions. By identifying genuine design sub-problems—those requiring solutions that were novel, necessary, and culturally transmitted—we can reconstruct aspects of combinatorial invention processes through the phylogenetic traces their solutions left in the archaeological record. Using the invention of hafted tools by Neanderthals and their African contemporaries as an illustrative case study, I show how this framework reveals a complex, multi-tiered invention process involving functional organization, material implementation, and assembly procedures. The combinatorial invention of complex technologies should be understood not merely as producing composite technologies, but in addition as one generating a manifold of technological lineages through the solving of multiple design sub-problems, specifically traditions of interfaces between the components of the technologies. The proposed framework provides preliminary methodological grounds for reconstructing prehistoric invention processes.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the rise of housing populism---narratives that cast financial investors as predatory, demand investor bans, and frame housing as a fundamental social right requiring state protection. We argue that politicians embrace housing populism less because it reflects economic realities than because it resonates with public moral commitments: distrust of finance capitalism and support for housing as a collective entitlement. Using U.S. property-level transaction data (2012-2021), a difference-in-differences analysis finds no consistent evidence that investor activity increases housing costs. Yet original surveys reveal widespread, bipartisan beliefs that investors undermine the right to housing and that government should safeguard access. A candidate-choice experiment further shows that candidates advocating investor bans framed in rights-based or anti-elite terms substantially outperform those prioritizing home-building through pragmatic or market-oriented appeals. Housing populism channels social-rights claims into symbolic confrontations between ``the people’’ and financial elites, often displacing more effective policy responses.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\n\nClimate change and extreme weather events are increasingly recognized as major stressors on mental health, yet research in West Africa remains scarce. Guinea-Bissau, one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable Small Island Developing States (SIDS), faces intensifying extreme weather events, including flooding, heat, and sea-level rise, which intersect with poverty, political instability, and limited health infrastructure. This study investigates how environmental and socio-economic vulnerabilities associated with climate change influence the mental well-being of women engaged in rural-urban mobility. \n\nMethods\n\nEthnographic fieldwork was conducted among 27 Balanta women living temporarily in zinc-roofed dwellings at two docks in Bissau. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, and participant observation, with oral consent. A narrative analytical approach was employed to examine lived experiences, focusing on climate-related exposures, psychosocial stressors, and collective coping mechanisms.\n\nResults\n\nParticipants described heightened psychological distress manifested as fatigue, anxiety, and sleep disruption related to recurrent heat, humidity, heavy rainfall, and tidal flooding. Rain-related sleep deprivation and caregiving demands emerged as particularly salient stressors. Structural inequities, including economic precarity and lack of access to health services, intensified mental strain. At the same time, strong communal organization and the replication of familiar rural social structures in urban space functioned as protective mechanisms, mitigating isolation and fostering psychological resilience.\n\nConclusion\n\nFindings underscore the compounded mental health risks faced by women engaged in rural-urban mobility while temporarily living in climate-exposed urban settings. Community solidarity operates as a key resilience mechanism, highlighting the need for integrated, gender-responsive, and community-anchored mental health and climate adaptation policies in Guinea-Bissau and comparable SIDS contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Despite miscarriages being common, little is known about who and to what extent people experiencing miscarriage resort to miscarriage care at the hospital. \n\nMethods: We analysed healthcare records from the French National Health Insurance Information System (SNDS) from 2015 to 2022. Descriptive analyses and logistic regressions estimated the trend in day (ambulatory) or longer (inpatient) miscarriage hospitalisation, and characteristics of those who received that type of care instead of primary care, emergency department visit, hospital external consultation, or no care.\n\nResults: On average, 44% of miscarriages identified in the healthcare records led to ambulatory or inpatient care, with a decrease from 44% to 41% before the COVID-19 lockdown, after which the trend increased again and stabilised. Those from precarious groups, undergoing infertility treatments, with underlying chronic conditions, prior history of miscarriages and births, between 35 and 45 years old, and those from rural areas, were more likely to be hospitalised. Conversely, those from urban areas and younger age groups were less likely to receive ambulatory or inpatient hospital care. Among these hospitalisations, financially precarious women, those with chronic conditions, and prior miscarriages, were also more likely to receive inpatient rather than ambulatory care.  \n\nConclusions: Ambulatory and inpatient miscarriage care decreased over time, which signifies a shift towards other types of care, or an increase in pregnancy losses managed outside the formal healthcare system. However, the decline levelled off after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those with underlying conditions and prior miscarriage(s) may more often experience complications and therefore seek (inpatient) hospital care, or have more monitored pregnancies, leading to planned interventions at the hospital. The greater likelihood of receiving (inpatient) hospital care among those living in rural areas may reflect challenges in accessing primary care due to limited availability of practitioners. Similarly, the greater (inpatient) hospitalisation rates among financially precarious women raise concerns about potential barriers to timely miscarriage care and more complications. Improving miscarriage care should involve addressing access barriers, counselling, and potential interventions for groups with specific needs when receiving formal healthcare for a miscarriage.",

Second, their analytical strategy does not adequately correct for the fact that the dependent variables are estimated. I replicate their analyses regarding social inequality of educational attainment (OE) and educational gradient in occupational attainment (ED) correcting for both errors.

          "abstract": "In pastoral communities, seeking animal health services for livestock is a male-dominated activity. Women are not always recognized as livestock keepers and face restrictions on interacting with men outside their households. This mixed-methods study qualitatively identified barriers to women's access to vaccines, tested a gender-accommodative intervention in a Rift Valley fever vaccination campaign serving 909 households, and assessed impact on women’s decision-making, financial contributions, and number of livestock vaccinated. In half of the vaccination sites, local government implemented co-designed interventions to improve communication with women. There was no improvement of the target indicators, indicating the intervention was insufficient to address barriers like restrictive gender norms and safety concerns. About half of women reported contributing financially to the vaccination of animals in their households and were more likely to contribute when the household heard about the vaccination campaign through word of mouth, suggesting that informal communication motivated women’s support for vaccination.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how competitive pressures within transnational labor alliances can undermine their potential for effective global solidarity.  Drawing on a decade-long struggle by the United Auto Workers to organize a major automotive plant in the US, this research explores how internal conflicts within transnational coalitions contribute to organizing outcomes.  The concept of solidarity arbitrage is introduced to describe how multinational corporations strategically exploit existing rivalries among employee representative bodies to weaken labor's collective power.  This strategy involves the calculated promotion of less confrontational partners while marginalizing more militant ones—a form of differential inclusion.  These findings challenge overly optimistic views of network effects, revealing that transnational alliances are not an unalloyed good.  Successful organizing may require independent, adversarial strategies to counter solidarity arbitrage.",

          "abstract": "Türkiye sosyal hizmet sistemi son yirmi yılda hızlı bir kurumsal dönüşüm geçirmiş; hizmet kapsamı ve erişilebilirliği önemli ölçüde genişlemiştir. Bu gelişime paralel olarak, risk değerlendirme süreçlerinin nicel, çok boyutlu ve teknoloji entegreli araçlarla güçlendirilmesi giderek daha fazla önem kazanmaktadır. Mevcut Sosyal İnceleme Raporu (SİR), bilgi toplama sürecini standartlaştırma açısından değerli bir işlev görmekle birlikte, ağırlıklı puanlama, dinamik risk izleme ve yapay zekâ destekli karar desteği gibi bileşenler sisteme henüz entegre edilmemiştir. Bu çalışma, söz konusu boşluğu gidermek amacıyla Bireysel Risk Skorlama Çerçevesi'ni (BRSC) ve üç fazlı Yapay Zekâ Destekli Sosyal Hizmet Karar Destek Modeli'ni (YZDM) kavramsal düzeyde sunmaktadır.\nModel birbiriyle bağlantılı üç faz üzerine inşa edilmektedir. Faz 1 - Statik Risk Skorlama Çerçevesi, sekiz ana risk kategorisi ve 47 risk faktöründen oluşan, uzman ağırlıklı çok kriterli karar modellemesine (MCDM) dayanan yapılandırılmış bir sistemdir. Faktörlerin puanlanmasında yedi ağırlıklandırma kriteri (Şiddet, Aciliyet, İşlevsellik Etkisi, Kronikleşme Riski, Kümülatif Etki, Müdahale Gerektirme Düzeyi, Epidemiyolojik Kanıtlar) kullanılmakta; kriter ağırlıkları Analitik Hiyerarşi Süreci (Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP) ile, faktör geçerliliği Modified Delphi uzman konsensüsü yöntemiyle belirlenecektir. Faz 2 - Dinamik Ağırlıklandırma, bağlam duyarlı ağırlıklandırma (CBW), etkileşim sinerjisi (ISW) ve zaman duyarlı ağırlıklandırma (TSW) bileşenlerini içeren hesaplamalı bir uzantıdır. Faz 3 - Öğrenen Sistem, bireyselleştirilmiş risk profili üretimi ve sürekli model güncelleme kapasitesini barındıran tam otomasyon mimarisidir.\nHer risk faktörü 2828, 5395, 6284 ve 6698 sayılı kanunlar başta olmak üzere güncel Türkiye sosyal hizmet mevzuatıyla ilişkilendirilmiştir. YZDM, uzman klinik yargısının yerini almayı değil; görüşme desteği, otomatik raporlama, kanıta dayalı müdahale planlaması ve hizmet eşleştirme işlevleriyle mesleki kapasiteyi güçlendirmeyi hedeflemektedir.

          "authors": "Abbie Robinson; Brian C. Thiede",
          "abstract": "The social costs of climate change are of global interest, as vulnerable populations face new or heighted environmental stressors. Previous research has documented many social consequences of environmental change, but several important outcomes, including child marriage, remain underexplored. We address one of these gaps by examining the relationship between climate shocks and early marriage in Mali, a country where weather extremes are common and rates of child marriage are high. We draw on three decades of marriage records (1986-2016) from the Demographic Health Surveys (n=117,170 person-years), combined with high-resolution climate data. We measure overall climate impacts on early marriage and evaluate spatial differences across rural and urban areas, northern and southern Mali, and environmental conditions. Across the full sample, cooler than average temperatures reduce the probability of child marriage, while precipitation shocks show no statistically meaningful effect. However, the effects of climate conditions vary spatially. Linear models show that the marginal effect of very high rainfall increases child marriage for girls living in urban areas and northern Mali. In addition, exposure to very cold and very dry conditions predicts marriage before age 18. Overall, our findings point to meaningful but complex relationships between climate variability and child marriage, in which precipitation and temperature exposures can increase or decrease marriage risks, underscoring the need for more research on understudied populations and spaces affected by climate change.",

          "abstract": "Low- and middle-income countries host nearly three-quarters of the world’s refugees, yet\nresearch on refugee stereotypes and their social consequences remains heavily concentrated\nin high-income settings. This imbalance obscures how stereotypes operate in countries where\nrefugees lack legal recognition, where welfare and labor protections are limited, and where\npublic attitudes significantly shape the conditions of daily survival. Malaysia, home to almost\n200,000 refugees despite not being a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, offers a\ncritical context for examining these dynamics. This study analyzes six focus group discussions\nwith 47 Malaysian participants to assess the content, sources, and implications of refugee\nstereotypes in a developing-country setting. Using inductive content analysis of 382 excerpts,\nwe identify a wide range of both positive and negative stereotypes, with self-generated\nopinions emerging as the most common source. Mapping these perceptions onto the\nStereotype Content Model, developed by Fiske et al. (2002), reveals nuanced combinations\nof perceived intentions and capabilities that underpin both empathy and hostility toward\nrefugees. These stereotypes, when reinforced through prejudice, discrimination, and\nstereotype threat, erode refugees’ sense of belonging and constrain long-term socioeconomic\noutcomes. Yet, the predominance of self-held rather than socially attributed stereotypes\nsuggest meaningful opportunities for change. We argue that developing-country contexts such\nas Malaysia require tailored interventions that leverage media narratives, counter-\nstereotypical representations, and low-cost intergroup contact to shift public attitudes. By\ncentering a middle-income host country, this paper underscores the urgent need to address\nstereotype-driven barriers to refugee well-being in the places where most displaced people\nreside.",

This paper contributes to the literature by\nunifying platform-based innovation theory with refugee integration scholarship, identifying\nfinancial access as a cross-cutting determinant of digital inclusion in legally restrictive contexts.\nThe paper first defines digital platforms and platform-based innovation, then situates digital\npractices within Ager and Strang’s refugee integration framework.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the corporate capture of vocational education at a North Carolina community college, arguing that public institutions are being repurposed as subsidized human resources arms for transnational capital.  Grounded in the concept of the “shadow college,” the analysis reveals how the democratic mission of public education is subordinated to the short-term profitability needs of private firms.  Using Critical Discourse Analysis, the study demonstrates how the curriculum combines “human capital” and “deficit” models to engineer compliant neoliberal subjects.  The program enforces labor discipline through intrusive behavioral interventions—such as self-optimization and scripted social interactions—that extend corporate control into the student’s subjectivity.  Situated within the anti-union context of the American South, this model reinscribes historical industrial paternalism under the guise of workforce development.  Ultimately, the study concludes that this employer-driven model compromises workforce resilience by producing non-transferable skills, leaving workers vulnerable to market volatility while socializing the costs of training onto the public.",

We build an evolutionary model in which individuals can either learn on their own or copy others from a demonstrator pool that contains varying proportions of in-group and out-group members, and where group tags can be more or less informative about local knowledge. We find that where social learning becomes common, selection favors copying biases that track the direction of informational advantage---toward the group that tends to be better adapted to local conditions, including an anti-similarity bias when tags are negatively associated with local correctness (as may be the case for some immigrant communities). We also find conditions in which a similarity bias can stabilize social learning when such learners are already common, but not when they are rare, with implications for the role of group identities in cultural evolution.  We discuss implications for understanding parochialism as risk aversion, majority-minority dynamics, the sociology of immigration, and the lasting impacts of colonialism.",

          "abstract": "This article seeks to explore and analyze the interrelationship between environmental factors, the structure of the energy sector, and stability/resilience within the financial sector by employing data from OECD countries between 2004 and 2021. The article utilizes new data sets provided by the World Bank Group's Global Financial Development Data and Sovereign ESG Data, with specific emphasis placed on the bank capitalization indicator, which is described as the bank capital asset ratio, and is considered an important factor in sectoral stability/resilience. Using fixed effect panel data econometrics, the article suggests that methane emissions, PM2.5 air pollution, and net energy imports have statistically significant impacts on the bank capitalization process, while renewable energy and bank capitalization have positive and statistically significant associations. The positive association between fossil fuel consumption and bank capitalization suggests that there is an inherent contradiction between current sectoral stability/resilience and the challenges associated with the energy transition process. The Hausman test suggests that omitted variables may exist and that fixed effect econometrics is an appropriate model. Clustering analysis suggests that each country has an underlying regime driven by environmental factors, the structure of the energy sector, and sectoral stability/resilience. Moreover, machine learning regression analysis employing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest models indicate that significant predictive potential is possible and that energy dependence, renewable energy, and air pollution are important factors in bank capitalization processes. The article suggests that robust evidence is provided regarding environmental quality and its interrelationship with sectoral stability/resilience and has significant implications for developing macroprudential frameworks that incorporate elements of the energy transition process.",

The metric, which we call the anchor reliability coefficient (or relco), is found by creating an artificial document-term matrix of simulated documents that sequentially shift more of their probability mass from relation-relevant anchor terms to non-anchor words, and then regressing the documents' similarity to an induced relation on the anchor inclusion score of the documents. We validate the metric at the word-level with both expert- and crowd-sourced dictionaries and at the document-level with expert-annotated social media posts. We also provide some heuristic baselines for assessing reliability effect sizes and null hypothesis testing.",

          "abstract": "This article develops composition theory as a pragmatist specification of the mesosocial. Existing theories describe situated social life without adequately explaining the mechanisms that produce it. Recent pragmatist scholarship has established important foundations: Gross on mechanisms, Lizardo on habit, and Hallett on inhabited institutionalism. Yet the mechanisms themselves remain underspecified. Composition theory fills this gap through four sets of mechanisms: composition, engagement, sedimentation, and circulation. Together, these explain how problem responsive actors assemble formations, how formations become consequential as affordances meet capacities, how residues accumulate over time and how patterns extend across settings through movement and echoing. The article reinterprets Dewey's concept of situation as the flow of actors' transactions with and within their present place (relational, symbolic and material environment) while remaining cognizant of their direct and indirect experiences with other places. Place is the somewhere somewhen locatable environment that necessarily grounds each situation and social reality as such. The framework reconceptualizes microsocial, mesosocial, and macrosocial as a continuum of compositional complexity anchored in the mesosocial. It expands the range of theory-driven research questions by directing attention to processes within and across places of action rather than to the forces of abstract structural properties.",

A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

Using panel survey data on over 8,000 respondents and 145 survey questions, we find that the issue preferences of pre-acquisition Twitter users became more conservative post-acquisition. Twitter users moved right on economic and social issues -- especially racial issues -- but not on climate, an issue where Musk is less conservative. Republican Twitter users became more pro-Republican, but there was no aggregate move toward the Republican Party, in part due to backlash by strong Democratic partisans who left the site.

Drawing on the Capability Approach, the study analyzes publicly\navailable admissions documents from three Canadian universities—Cape Breton University,\nBrock University, and the University of British Columbia—using content analysis. The findings\nreveal that mature students are frequently rendered invisible through fragmented, opaque, and\ninconsistently labeled policies that obscure access pathways and place the burden of\ninterpretation on applicants. While formal criteria are often present, the absence of clear\nguidance, institutional accountability, and visible supports constrains mature students’ real\nopportunities to convert access into meaningful participation. To conceptualize these systemic\nabsences, the article introduces the metaphor of Dark Matter Policy, describing how unseen\npolicy gaps shape lived experiences in powerful yet unacknowledged ways. The study\ncontributes to critical higher education policy scholarship by reframing access not as a neutral\nprocess, but as a capability-shaping structure that can either expand or restrict educational\nfreedoms for mature learners.\nKeywords: Mature students; higher education admissions; Capability Approach; content\nanalysis; Dark Matter Policy",

          "authors": "Ines Echevarria",
          "abstract": "Research shows that children with similar levels of cognitive ability experience markedly different educational outcomes. This paper examines how innate abilities (measured using a polygenic index for cognition) and social origins (understood as different forms of family economic, educational, and sociocultural resources) interact to shape academic performance across primary and secondary education in England (ages 7 to 18). Drawing on data from the Millennium Cohort Study linked to the National Pupil Database, this study asks whether social origins moderate the association between genetic traits and academic performance, and whether the strength and direction of this moderation varies across educational stages. The findings show that gene-by-social origins interactions operate differently across levels of academic performance, becoming most evident at the tails of the performance distribution. At the lower tail, students from socioeconomically advantaged backgrounds are largely protected from low achievement regardless of their genetic traits, producing a ‘glass floor’ consistent with the Compensatory Advantage hypothesis. At the upper tail, genetic advantages translate into high performance primarily among students from advantaged backgrounds, creating a ‘glass ceiling’ for disadvantaged students in line with the Boosting Advantage hypothesis. These compensatory and boosting patterns operate consistently across educational stages: social origin gaps are already evident at the start of primary school and remain broadly stable throughout academic trajectories. Overall, this study demonstrates that the realisation of genetic propensities is strongly context dependent and points to a pattern of talent wastage, whereby high-ability students from disadvantaged backgrounds are less able to fulfil their potential within the British education system.",

          "abstract": "Well-being research has long sought to identify what enables human flourishing, with frameworks like PERMA providing structured approaches to understanding psychological well-being components. However, existing frameworks conceptualize well-being as relatively stable individual differences measured at discrete time points, an approach that cannot capture rapid fluctuations characteristic of digital environments where well-being responds to continuous social feedback, algorithmically-curated content, and frequent context switching.\n\nThis paper introduces the Adaptive PERMA Framework (APF), which reconceptualizes well-being as a dynamic, temporally evolving system. By integrating foundational well-being theory with computational psychology methods, APF addresses gaps through three core mechanisms: bidirectional feedback loops, adaptive weighting, and state-dependent transitions. Unlike prior extensions adding new PERMA dimensions, APF explicitly models how well-being evolves in digitally-mediated contexts where psychological states fluctuate rapidly. This enables predictive modeling of well-being trajectories, provides a theoretical foundation for adaptive interventions, and advances understanding of how digital environments shape human flourishing.",

I show these kinds of entanglement by reflecting on my own comparative-historical study of Brazil’s decarbonization capacities, which was conducted within a Ph.D. structured by COVID-19. Before the lockdown, fieldwork relied on direct observation and interviews with environmental fieldworkers and policymakers. During lockdown, computation provided continuity: web scraping, archival digitization, and machine learning substituted travel and extended the field in time and space. After restrictions eased, these computational results were reintroduced into interviews through visualizations that prompted important findings but highlighted blind spots.",

          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "This study proposes a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes workplace \nharassment not as isolated deviant acts but as a staged transformation of avoidance \nstrategies selected in response to criticism or problem-raising. Prior research has \nexamined anger as aggressive behavior (Averill, 1982; Gibson &amp; Callister, 2010) and \nsilence as voice suppression or interpersonal risk avoidance (Morrison, 2014; Van \nDyne et al., 2003), yet the dynamic relationship between these phenomena has not \nbeen sufficiently integrated. \nBuilding upon prior conceptualizations of silent harassment as communicative \nexclusion grounded in meta-communication dysfunction and structural ambiguity \n(Hiraoka, 2025b), the present study develops a Dual-Stage Avoidance Harassment \nModel. It theorizes anger-based immediate avoidance as the first stage and silent \nharassment as a subsequent, more invisible and sustainable avoidance strategy. \nFurthermore, the study demonstrates that this transition process is consistent with \nsocial learning theory (Bandura, 1977), institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio &amp; Powell, \n1983), and organizational learning theory (Argyris &amp; Schön, 1978). The shift from anger \nto silence is interpreted not as emotional calming but as a strategic transformation. \nBy bridging harassment research, employee silence research, psychological safety, \nand organizational learning, the model provides a theoretical foundation for structural \nintervention.",

          "abstract": "This article offers an autoethnographic and multimodal analysis of the #MeTooSTS/#WeDoSTS movement, initiated through a public Medium testimony on gender-based violence and abuse of power in academia. Writing from a scholar-survivor-activist standpoint, I trace how public disclosure operates as both epistemic intervention and affective labour, revealing field “shadow zones” in science and technology studies (STS). The article documents the testimonial writer’s journey after going public, including legal threats, institutional backlash, and attempts at containment. Methodologically, the piece combines autoethnography, visual storytelling, and movement analysis to conceptualise disclosure as field shadow work: a reparative practice that exposes hidden power relations while generating new collective forms of knowing, solidarity, and critique. Against institutional logics of closure, I argue that survivor-led disclosure produces fragile yet generative openings for transformative justice in academic fields. The article theorises public testimony as a mode of survivance that resists silencing, reclaims epistemic authority, and reimagines the conditions of academic belonging.",

          "abstract": "This article aims to contribute to a relatively understudied area of financial development, namely, the internal dispersion of trading activity. The focus is not on overall financial development measures such as total market capitalization and liquidity but rather on trading diversification, defined as the proportion of trading volume contributed by firms outside the VTX, representing the top ten most frequently traded firms. The article uses data from the World Bank’s Global Financial Development Database. The sample is constructed as a balanced panel of 23 countries over the period 2002-2021, starting with a sample of 38 countries. The article uses four key explanatory variables, namely, relative size of deposit-taking banks (DBS), remittance inflows (REM), market capitalization excluding the top ten firms (MCX), and outstanding international public debt (IPU). The article uses a combination of panel econometrics, hierarchical clustering, and machine learning methods. The econometric results show that a diversified financial system structure and remittance inflows are strongly, positively related to overall and less concentrated trading activity, while bank dominance and reliance on international public debt are related to more concentrated trading activity. The clustering results show significant cross-country heterogeneity and a core-periphery structure. The machine learning results show that, using all models, equity market structure is again found to be the most important explanatory variable, with external financial flows being important as well. The article concludes that equity market structure is key to understanding internal dispersion, with important policy implications.",

          "abstract": "With increasing concerns around food sustainability, estimating the environmental footprint of diets is critical. Supermarket transaction data are becoming prominent as a valuable source of objective dietary purchase data. We developed a method to map environmental sustainability metrics to foods and beverages sold by a major UK supermarket, using sales data from the Yorkshire and the Humber region (2022).\n\nProducts were mapped to global Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) estimates for 45 commodities in four stages. Initially, products were grouped into categories and linked to commodities. Subsequent stages disaggregated high-complexity or high-sales categories into subcategories with similar ingredients, using retailer categorisations (Stage 2) and word searches within product descriptions (Stage 3), and finally refined categorisations to aid interpretability (Stage 4). The product with the highest sales in each subcategory was selected as an indicator product and mapped to commodities using data on ingredient proportions. Land Use and Water Use estimates were generated using the final mapping scheme. A look-up tool was produced linking categories to environmental sustainability metrics for use with other food product data. \n\nBy Stage 4, 98·6% of &gt;27,000 products were mapped to GHGE, using 200 category/subcategory-based GHGE estimates. Disaggregation revealed significant variation in GHGE estimates: up to a three-fold difference between Stage 1 and 4 estimates for the same category, and up to a 30-fold difference between subcategories within the same category. \n\nDisaggregation of complex categories is important for accurate estimation of sustainability indices. Our sales-guided approach balances accuracy and efficiency when dealing with large supermarket data and could support a wide range of research into sustainable diets.",

This qualitative study aims to shed light on the global phenomenon of women anti-feminist influencers on visual social media platforms by developing a typology of women anti-feminist influencers on TikTok and Instagram. The study uncovers that women anti-feminist influencers adopt different roles such as political commentators, dating-coaches, and TradWives, among others, to disseminate their beliefs.

We contribute to these by investigating the impact of (randomly) offering an abstention option alongside the usual forced choice dependent variable.

The findings reveal that a notable proportion of respondents abstain due to non-acceptance and unwillingness or inability to choose. Abstention from binary choice also impacts the subsequent rating tasks, suggesting binary choice may overestimate favorability deduced from conjoint experiments. Mirroring the real-world decision process, which often includes abstention options, improves our understanding of preferences and prevents biases in the analysis, highlighting the importance of considering offering an abstention option in conjoint experiments.",

Parental influences are known to be key to young adults’ life courses. Yet, young adults spend much of their time with siblings and school peers (particularly classmates), whose influences might complement or counterbalance parental influences. \n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe review the literature on the roles of siblings and school peers in the occurrence, timing, and outcomes of important life-course events that tend to occur frequently in young adulthood: Leaving the parental home, returning home, entry into tertiary education, residential relocations, partnership formation and dissolution, and the transition to parenthood. We then present an agenda for research that aims to identify and disentangle the roles of siblings and school peers in these life-course events using longitudinal register micro-data. We intend to carry out parts of this agenda over the next few years and have initiated the work on it. We also pay attention to methodological issues associated with the envisaged research.\n\nCONTRIBUTION\nWe provide (1) a review of the literature on the important but under-researched topic of the roles of siblings and peers in young adults’ life-course events, and (2) an agenda for research on this topic, which includes a preview of our own ongoing and future work in the context of two research projects.",

          "abstract": "Universities face growing pressure to evidence a high-quality “student experience”, yet institutions often lack systematic ways to convert student voice into institutional actions. Therefore, this study applied a two-round Delphi method at a post-1992 UK university to identify and prioritise student-suggested enhancements, and to evaluate the method’s effectiveness for collecting and prioritising feedback.\n\nUsing an exploratory mixed-methods design and Jones’s (2017) seven-microsystem student experience framework, Round 1 (n=97) gathered open-ended suggestions across microsystems, and content analysis produced 26 categories to develop specific suggestions for the subsequent round. Round 2 (n=64 valid) converted these categories into 28 importance rating items on a 7-point scale, with a priori consensus criteria of median ≥ 6 and IQR ≤ 1. Overall, 15 items (54%) reached consensus. The strongest agreement concerned clarifying assessments (rubrics and exemplars), providing clear timetables with early access to materials, and offering online teaching options with earlier tutorials. All items concerning the “extracurricular activity” and “preparation for life after graduation” microsystems achieved consensus, signalling support for cohort-building events, integrating extracurricular learning, and early, structured placements and career guidance. Items in the “transition” and “peer/friendship groups” resulted in high medians but wider dispersion, reflecting diverse preferences. Students also reached consensus that the two-round Delphi was effective for collecting and prioritising student feedback (median=6; IQR=1). \n\nThese findings provide a pragmatic, scalable route for converting student voice into context-sensitive, actionable institutional priorities. The approach is domain-agnostic and offers a blueprint for organisations seeking to involve primary stakeholders in institutional decision-making.",

FI is prevalent, and is consistently associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes. These associations are attenuated but not eliminated by controlling for more general social determinants, with which food insecurity is correlated. Though it is clear that the associations exist, it is less clear why. In this paper, we review four possible pathways between FI and poor health: (A) FI is a non-causal correlate of general deprivation and disadvantage; (B) FI causes poor health, but this is not mediated by diet; (C) FI causes poor health by changing what people eat; (D) FI causes poor health by changing the temporal patterning of their eating. These pathways are not mutually exclusive and we suggest that several play a role. Understanding their relative importance is nonetheless an important goal if we wish to intervene effectively to mitigate the health burden of FI.",

The paper documents the labour itself in granular ethnographic detail—the acts, the bodily negotiations, the somatic aftermath, as narrated by participants in their own teenage and young-adult register. We reject both rescue and empowerment framings, arguing that student sex work in this population is a rational, degrading, temporally bounded survival strategy produced at the intersection of racial desire and institutional abandonment",

          "authors": "Bupinder Singh Bali",
          "abstract": "How do minority communities move away from places they have inhabited for generations when departure is never consciously chosen? This article examines the livelihood practices of Kashmiri Sikhs, a long-settled micro-minority in the Kashmir Valley, to argue that migration can unfold as a slow, cumulative process driven by the gradual exhaustion of everyday endurance. Drawing on longitudinal ethnographic engagement with Kashmiri Sikh households conducted across multiple phases between the mid-2010s and early 2020s, the article traces how financial uncertainty under conditions of protracted political instability reshapes the temporal horizons, moral obligations, and bodily risks through which staying is sustained. Livelihood is analysed here as ethical practice: earning, saving, commuting, and investing are shown to be the sites where political instability, communal vulnerability, and institutional unpredictability converge and must be managed at the household level. Three ethnographic scenes examine how this ethical labour operates across small-scale entrepreneurship, intergenerational household geographies, and state employment. The article introduces the concept of slow migration to describe an incremental, ethically structured form of movement that differs from both crisis-driven displacement and aspiration-led mobility. Slow migration involves no singular decision point. It emerges through accumulation, when the work required to remain in place exceeds what financial life can sustain. By foregrounding livelihood as the medium through which minority endurance is produced and eventually strained, the article contributes to anthropological scholarship on ethics, precarity, and migration in South Asia.",

Communication is central to supporting their health literacy, participation, and transition to independent self-management. This scoping review synthesises evidence on how adolescents and young adults with chronic conditions experience communication with healthcare providers and what they need and value in these interactions.\nMethods\nScopus, PubMed, and PsycINFO were searched for eligible peer-reviewed studies that reported on communication experiences of young people aged≥11 with chronic illness. Data on communication-related findings were extracted and synthesised using reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults\nFifty-one publications met inclusion criteria. Across approximately 3073 young people, key communication needs centred on trust, autonomy, health literacy, and psychosocial support. Trust was strengthened by continuity of care, clear introductions, showing genuine interest, empathy, and respect. Youth valued being listened to, taken seriously, and involved in decisions; however, many reported limited opportunities to participate meaningfully, especially those from historically marginalised groups. The literature suggested that parental involvement could both support and inhibit engagement, underscoring the need for gradual, collaborative transitions. Significant gaps were identified in condition-specific and system-level health literacy. Psychosocial concerns strongly shaped communication needs. Young people wanted proactive discussions about sexuality, fertility, alcohol, and drug use. Observational research was scarce.\nConclusion\nTrusting, person-centred relationships and proactive, developmentally appropriate communication are essential to support youth engagement and autonomy in clinical care. More observational research is needed to understand how best to support youth in healthcare interactions.",

          "abstract": "Microenterprises in Ghana are run mostly by people in the informal sector. These entrepreneurs often lack the skills needed to start a small business. As a result, most of the businesses they start up often collapse or cannot stand the test of time. The future of Ghanaian microenterprises should move away from a try-and-error approach and adopt a systematic approach. The study focused on how a model small Ghanaian business should be structured to ensure its sustainability. Important aspects of the microenterprise model, such as the composition of a new microenterprise system, including the microenterprise planning stage, the capital stage, and the execution stage, were considered. The research also considered how an entrepreneur can systematically save to enable him or her start a microenterprise venture in Ghana. This study, through a questionnaire survey, investigated entrepreneurs' awareness of starting microenterprises in Ghana and the success of those new startups, analyzing whether they have a future. The study also ascertained the difficulties entrepreneurs encounter in accessing financial support for their startups. The study revealed a low level of awareness among entrepreneurs about how to properly start a microenterprise and ensure its sustainability. Most Ghanaian entrepreneurs enter into microenterprises because there are no jobs. They lack the basic understanding of microenterprises and are unable to sustain their businesses. A number of specific action areas have been identified to proactively educate microenterprises in Ghana to ensure their sustainability.",

          "abstract": "This study sought to examine the relationship between borrower psychology or behaviour, the intended purpose of loans, and credit repayment performance. The methodology used was a cross-sectional survey design, with a sample of 800 respondents selected using purposive and simple random sampling. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data, which were processed and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS V22.0.0). The findings showed significant positive correlations between borrower psychology or behaviour, intended purpose of loans and credit repayment performance which implied that the way borrowers behaved during credit accessibility or after acquiring credit from or even before taking the loan from the bank, had a lot of effects on how borrowers use the money acquired from the bank which would in turn affect effectiveness and efficiency of credit repayment. From the regression analysis, it was apparent that borrower psychology or behaviour was a strong predictor of credit repayment performance; therefore, the management of credit institutions should put a lot of emphasis on the training of loan officers to enable them screen prospective clients well before giving them loans, since what they use the loans for affects how they repay the loans. Management should also let borrowers know the importance of using the loans for their intended purpose, since it is the business that repays the loan, not the borrower, as most people think.",

          "authors": "Leonardo Carella; Francesco Raffaelli",
          "abstract": "Social identities like class and religion are typically treated as stable antecedents of political preferences. This article shows that the causal arrow can also run in reverse: when exposed to narratives that pit immigrants against a discrete native social group, individuals can ‘update’ their identities to match their preferences over immigration. We theorise that anti-immigration individuals may claim membership of groups portrayed as threatened by immigrants as a form of instrumental belief justification: adopting this identity allows them to ground out-group aversion in concern for in-group interests. We test this framework with two original survey experiments: one on class identity in Britain and one on Christian identity in Italy. When primed with narratives framing immigration as a threat to the British working class or to the role of Christianity in Italian culture, respondents with anti-immigration preferences become more likely to claim working-class and Christian identities. In the British case, we also find evidence that pro-immigration individuals dis-identify from the working class when exposed to the treatment. These identity updates are driven by respondents who lack ‘objective’ markers of group membership (i.e., middle-class Britons and non-church-going Italians). They are also not reflected in changes in support for policies benefiting these groups, underscoring the instrumental nature of individuals' responses to these narratives. Overall, the findings speak to the literature on cleavage realignment, suggesting that when political actors strategically link immigration to ‘old’ dimensions of political conflict, traditional categories of politics such as class and religion acquire new meanings in people's minds.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nMedical Data Integration Centers (DIZ) have been established at German university hospitals to collect, transfer, consolidate, and process routine clinical data and make it available for health research. Consideration of sex and gender benefits research and enhances the quality of medical care. We therefore argue that DIZ staff members need to be well-informed and knowledgeable about sex and gender aspects in clinical data. Only then they can inform about research quality gain and advise researchers on thoughtful selection of study cohorts, appropriate encoding of sex and gender information, and the benefits of considering gender distributions.\n\nObjective: \nThis work systematically analyzes the awareness of sex and gender among technical and scientific staff members at DIZ. The  survey will guide  future recommendations for handling sex and gender aspects in clinical research. \n\nMethods: \nUsing an online survey, we assess how  knowledgeable DIZ staff currently are regarding sex, gender and gender scores. The survey  was distributed in February 2024 to all 38 DIZ in Germany via a national mailing list. It was structured into three topics: (1) perception of  sex and gender in medical research, (2) consideration of sex and gender during data collection, and (3) consideration of sex and gender in data use and reuse. We analyzed the collected data with descriptive statistics and checked for correlation within the dataset.\n\nResults: \nAfter a four-week response period, 74 current employees had fully completed the questionnaire and an additional 62 had partially completed it. The survey results show a lack of knowledge and awareness regarding sex and gender aspects among DIZ employees indicated by a high amount of ``No\" and ``I don't know\" answers, specifically regarding sex- and gender-specific training, official recommendations, and team policies.\n\nConclusion: \nAs essential links between clinics and researchers, DIZ employees need targeted training on sex and gender aspects to better support and advise research efforts. We provide first recommendations for the different levels of administration to improve knowledge and awareness of sex and gender aspects in medical research data.",

          "abstract": "Background. Food insecurity is associated with depression. Food insecurity involves distinctive patterns of dietary intake, and recent evidence suggests that dietary intake affects mood. Thus, an important pathway from food insecurity to depression may be via dietary changes. \n\nMethods. We studied two observational datasets (one from the UK, and NHANES 2017-8 from the USA) with measurements of food insecurity and affective state, plus dietary data from 24-hr food recalls. We examined variables concerning dietary composition and intake timing, as well as affective state, by food-insecurity status. \n\nResults. In both datasets, people experiencing food insecurity had significantly worse affective states. They showed dietary differences, notably more meal skipping, less regular timing of the first meal, and lower dietary diversity. A set of dietary variables (meal irregularity, night eating, dietary diversity, fruit and vegetable intake, and protein intake) partially mediated the association between food insecurity and affective state, accounting for 23% and 6% of the total association. \n\nDiscussion. Dietary intake represents one pathway via which food insecurity can negatively affect mental health. Our findings suggest that while dietary intake plays a role in the association between food insecurity and poorer mood outcomes, it does not predominate.",

This article introduces \"tool media\" as a new conceptual category to describe media technologies designed primarily for instrumental and operational purposes—such as surveillance, monitoring, and automated response—rather than symbolic human-to-human communication, yet which nonetheless mediate perception, decision-making, and social meaning. Focusing on IoT-based home security systems as a theoretically rich case, the article examines how tool media reconfigure the cultural meaning of protection by shifting emphasis from armed readiness toward prevention, surveillance, and delegation to technological systems. Drawing on media theory, science and technology studies, and scholarship on gun culture and surveillance, the analysis explores the implications of this shift for American gun culture and Second Amendment discourse, highlighting processes of cultural fragmentation and demographic differentiation. The article further examines how tool media introduce new tensions related to privacy, algorithmic authority, and civil liberties through the privatization and normalization of surveillance. By foregrounding non-discursive forms of mediation, the article argues for expanding media theory beyond content and representation to account for the growing influence of operational technologies on law, governance, and everyday life.",

          "abstract": "The identification of the occupants of the Royal Tombs beneath the Great Tumulus at Vergina remains one of the central problems in Macedonian archaeology. Recent bioarchaeological and radiocarbon analyses have excluded Tomb I as the burial of Philip II of Macedon, removing the osteological and chronological basis for the traditional attribution and leaving Philip’s resting place unresolved. This paper proposes an integrative reinterpretation of Tomb II as either the primary cremation or a secondary monumentalized burial of Philip II, constructed or refurbished during the political reorganization of Macedonia following the death of Alexander the Great. We argue that the tomb’s cremation rites, exceptional monumentality, dynastic iconography, equestrian sacrifices, and elite military regalia correspond more closely to the commemoration of a foundational warrior king than to the historically marginal reign of Philip III Arrhidaeus. Situating Tomb II within broader Greek traditions of heroization, secondary burial, and dynastic legitimation, the model explains the archaeological and historical evidence with fewer assumptions and generates testable predictions for future research.",

          "abstract": "The \"Optimistic Consensus\" suggested that fertility would recover at high development levels. We test this hypothesis using panel data from 161 countries (1990–2023, N=2,989) and find no evidence of J-curve recovery. Instead, wealthy democracies converge on a synchronized fertility decline toward a total fertility rate of 1.3–1.5 as of 2023—persistently below replacement.\n\nWe construct a \"Modernity Index\" via principal components analysis of education, gross domestic product, and urbanization, and then estimate interaction models with cluster-robust standard errors. Modernity emerges as the primary predictor of fertility decline (β=-0.68, p&lt;0.001), consistent with prohibitive opportunity costs that fiscal transfers cannot offset. Democracy shows no independent main effects but significantly moderates modernity's impact through an interaction term (β=+0.48, p=0.020): at high development, stronger democratic institutions correlate with marginally higher fertility. Robustness analysis with larger samples (N=5,589) strengthens these findings.\n\nIsrael constitutes a statistically identified exception due to religio-cultural forces. We formalize these constraints as the \"Liberal Trilemma\": advanced societies struggle simultaneously sustain meritocratic education, demographic continuity, and economic growth. Policy implications are stark—even pro-natalist spending achieves TFRs 20–30% below replacement, confirming that transfers address direct costs but have not reversed structural decline.",

This article leverages the exploratory power of (causal) machine learning to conduct a registered meta-reanalysis of both the observational and experimental literature on SPV from 1995-2025 to synthesize and summarize previous research. First, we identify three categories of individual-level predictors: politically salient identities, psychological characteristics, and attitudes toward one's political system. Second, we find that young adults are the most likely to support political violence across many recent surveys, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, in two experiments in the U.S. and India we find that young people are by far the most affected by treatments aimed at both decreasing and increasing support, respectively. Third, and in contrast to research on the perpetration of violence, we find scant evidence of a relationship between gender identity and SPV.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how internet memes contribute to the sociotechnical imaginaries surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Drawing on Castoriadis’s distinction between instituted and instituting imaginaries, we understand memes as narratives that symbolically construct AI in everyday culture. In the first section, we review research on sociotechnical imaginaries of AI across textual and visual domains, and show that memes that speak about AI have received comparatively little scholarly attention. We then introduce the notion of sociotechnical narratives to frame these imaginaries as contested and provisional rather than coherent or hegemonic. In the second section, we conceptualize memes as narratives that intervene in the symbolic institution of social reality, showing that they can reinforce dominant meanings through repetition and normalization, but also subvert or reframe them. The third section presents a mixed-methods empirical study of 560 memes collected from Imgflip.com (2016–2025). After building the corpus through manual filtering, we coded memes by topic and conducted a fine-grained qualitative analysis of four main categories: AI takeover, generative AI, art, and AI social impact. Our findings show that most memes reiterate rather than subvert dominant representations of AI. Humor tends to flatten disagreement rather than intensify it, producing what we describe as dormant agonism.",

          "abstract": "This article argues that public engagement with Artificial Intelligence (AI), as it becomes visible through media traces, is structured less as a technoscientific controversy among competing publics than as a displaced form of political antagonism. Intervening in current STS debates on AI “super-controversy,” we revisit controversy studies and recent calls for controversy elicitation, which seek to revitalize democratic problematisation by fostering participation and extended expertise. While these approaches foreground conflict, they retain an implicit epistemic horizon in which legitimate participation is tied to articulated critique and the formation of lay expertise. Drawing instead on Ernesto Laclau’s theory of antagonism and populist logic, we propose an alternative analytical lens. In this perspective, conflict is not necessarily organized around shared objects of dispute, but around the construction of political frontiers through which heterogeneous grievances are articulated against a common adversary. Empirically, we analyse 1,148,092 comments posted on 4,244 TF1.info YouTube news videos (March 2022–May 2024), comparing AI with electric vehicles, nuclear technologies, and climate change, and mapping intersections with party-political publics. While quantitative measures suggest weak AI issue-public formation, qualitative analysis reveals predominantly vertical antagonism targeting elites and institutions.

          "authors": "Chandler Bahk",
          "abstract": "The Tripartite Perception of Race Theory (TPRT) advances a new theoretical framework for explaining how racial perception structures interracial interaction. Rather than treating anxiety, threat, or prejudice as primary explanatory endpoints, TPRT conceptualizes racial perception itself as the foundational mechanism organizing communicative experience prior to interaction. The theory specifies three analytically distinct but interrelated perceptual dimensions—racial distinctness, racial inequality, and racial incompatibility—through which racial hierarchy and difference are anticipated, interpreted, and negotiated. Racial distinctness concerns perceived cultural and normative divergence; racial inequality captures perceived hierarchical asymmetry and status differentiation; and racial incompatibility reflects beliefs about the feasibility of constructive cross-racial engagement. By formalizing these dimensions through a set of propositions, TPRT articulates how perceptual orientations shape communicative expectations, participation, and avoidance, particularly in contexts marked by historical and structural inequality. The framework reorients race and communication scholarship from outcome-centered models of anxiety and threat toward a perception-centered account that links macro-level racial structures to micro-level interactional processes. Although developed within the domain of interracial communication, TPRT offers a generalizable analytic structure for examining how perceptions of social difference condition interaction across diverse intergroup contexts. In doing so, the theory provides an empirically falsifiable and conceptually integrative foundation for understanding how race is anticipated, enacted, and reproduced in everyday communicative life.",

          "abstract": "Online health communities (OHCs) are conventionally recognized as information commons for mutual exchange among peer users with similar health concerns. Extant research reckons that engagement patterns universally conform to implicit norms guided by social exchange; that is, when a topic owner (i.e., user who initiates a topic thread) receives replies from peer users, they are said to acquire social support. This overlooks topic hijacking, a prevalent phenomenon where peer users solicit instead of providing support to topic owners. Drawing on the territoriality theory, we conceptualize that OHCs, as a form of health information commons, accommodate the emergence of personal territories when a user initiates a topic for support seeking. We posit topic hijacking as territorial infringement, and theorize a fight–flight–flex response framework for topic owners who experience topic hijacking, as well as the contingency of hijacking competitiveness on responses. Using data from 368 topics in an OHC, we develop measures of hijacking and hijacking competitiveness (competitive vs. complementary). Regression analyses attest to our research hypotheses that hijacking triggers (i) defensive responses at both the topic owner territory and community levels, including fight (marking self-presence) and flight (disengagement), and (ii) expansive response at the community level manifested by flex (subsequent hijacking of other topic owners’ territories). Moreover, competitive hijacking intensifies defensive responses, while complementary hijacking fosters territorial expansion. This study advances the OHC literature by recognizing topic hijacking as territorial infringements disrupting topic owner engagement, introducing a novel fight–flight–flex framework that captures both defensive and expansive responses, and identifying hijacking competitiveness as a boundary condition discerning defensive versus expansive responses to hijacking. Our findings offer implications for platform governance by showing how different hijacking forms may disrupt or enhance community vitality.",

This article introduces tool media as a distinct conceptual category to describe media technologies that organize perception, judgment, and action through automated systems of sensing, evaluation, and response rather than primarily through symbolic representation or communicative exchange. By foregrounding operational delegation as a mediating logic, the article expands media theory beyond discourse-centered paradigms to account for technologies that structure environments and coordinate behavior through procedural systems. Focusing on IoT-based home security systems as a theoretically generative case, the article examines how tool media contribute to a reconfiguration of protection. Whereas protection has historically been associated with armed readiness and individual response---particularly within American gun culture and Second Amendment discourse---IoT security systems reorganize protection around anticipatory monitoring, infrastructural reliability, and delegated authority. This shift does not directly contest constitutional rights but subtly recalibrates the cultural conditions under which they acquire meaning. By analyzing how operational media reshape perceptions of risk, responsibility, and authority, the article demonstrates how constitutional meaning and cultural identity are reorganized through everyday technological systems. More broadly, it argues that understanding contemporary social organization and transformation requires attention to operational systems that organize perception, judgment, and action prior to and alongside symbolic communication.",

Persistent unmet demand for CLCs is well-documented. To increase access to justice, the sector has been a long-time adopter of once-revolutionary innovations, like video conferencing. As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in private legal practice to increase productivity and profits, some parts of the LAS are also exploring AI use cases. This article asks: What do we know about CLC clients and how services are currently delivered to meet their needs? What must we consider about client capabilities to ensure AI technologies are appropriate in the context of CLC service delivery? The research includes a review of policy documents, peer-reviewed research and grey literature, and secondary analysis of empirical data on how client capabilities contribute to the legal needs of CLC clients. We show in the article that the three-dimensional nature of legal need, a client’s capability and ability to self-assist, structural inequalities and current CLC service delivery models are vital considerations when developing AI tools to increase access to justice.",

          "authors": "Marius Sältzer; Corinna Oschatz; Sebastian Stier",
          "abstract": "Negative campaigning (NC) has become a prevalent campaign strategy in recent years, especially in interactive media such as Facebook, Twitter/X or Instagram where politicians can communicate without any mediation by gatekeepers like journalists. Even though the identification of NC is a crucial precondition for understanding modern election campaigns, the automated identification of NC is still in its infancy, even with state-of-the-art text analysis methods. Especially when researchers want to identify NC across elections and different levels of a polity, they need to develop and validate specific classifiers. As actor constellations and topics vary considerably across different elections, applying automated measures to lower-level elections requires a thorough validation of how well trained models generalize across contexts. Using several federal and state level elections as a test case, this paper investigates the generalizability of transformer models for text classification in the complex German multilevel and multiparty system. Based on over 40,000 social media posts of candidates in eight state and federal elections between 2013 and 2021 that were annotated by human coders, the classifier can identify negative campaigning across space and time. A leave-one-out classification shows that the model can accurately predict data even for unknown elections with moderately sized training data. We demonstrate how a classifier for a demanding theoretical concept can be trained and validated in multidimensional contexts and provide orientation for similar projects.",

This paper develops an integrative analytical framework to support the evaluation and selection of accessibility measures for TRSE. Rather than conducting an empirical comparison of metrics, the paper consolidates dispersed debates across the accessibility, transport equity and justice, and TRSE literatures into a structured set of thirteen criteria, ten theoretical and three practical, to clarify the assumptions, biases, and trade-offs embedded in accessibility measures used to assess TRSE. The framework was developed through a structured literature review and refined through consultation with academic experts. We next discuss trade-offs between the criteria, theoretical robustness, and usability, and how selection depends on analytical objectives, data, institutional capacity, and the policy instruments under control. The paper concludes with a step-by-step strategy for applying the framework in practice, making trade-offs explicit and helping analysts choose measures that are both conceptually robust and usable for decision-making in TRSE contexts.",

          "abstract": "Climate change mitigation technologies (CCMTs) play a key role in decarbonisation efforts, but may also create new opportunities for crime and security risks that have remained under-explored. This study presents an expert-informed assessment of crime threats and countermeasures associated with CCMTs, involving 28 experts from government, law enforcement, industry, academia, and civil society. Through structured idea generation, thematic analysis, and forecasting surveys, the participants evaluated 35 distinct crime threats and 36 countermeasures, of which 13 threats and 18 countermeasures were uniquely identified by them. The identified risks were found to be concentrated in CCMT supply chains and resource extraction, with high-priority threats relating to environmental harms, illegal mining, and human rights abuse, alongside cyber-enabled and financial crimes. Promising countermeasures include CCMT-specific regulation, risk assessment, data sharing, physical security, and targeted education. The findings show that the green transition reshapes rather than removes crime risks, underscoring the need for proactive governance to ensure a secure and sustainable low-carbon transition.",

These include renewable energies, carbon capture, utilisation and sequestration (CCUS), and electric vehicles. As many of them are still evolving technologies, they will likely present novel crime and security risks. Unfortunately, knowledge about such risks is still limited and fragmentary. This scoping review aims to bridge this gap and inform policymakers to prevent such emerging risks. We found 97 relevant articles from a total of 1139 references we screened from academic and non-academic sources across disciplines. They revealed 20 distinct crime threats of six different natures: property offences, cyber-attacks, financial crime and corruption, environmental threats, human rights abuse, and national security threats. Notable examples of criminogenic situations are CCUS-related environmental threats, greenwashing, and territorial conflicts over “green projects” that require adequate future crime prevention strategies. To that end, we also found 22 (potential) countermeasures, mostly of a legal or policy nature. This comprehensive overview highlights what appears to be an under-researched aspect of sustainable development, which we believe should include ensuring safety and security throughout climate mitigation supply chains.",

          "authors": "Sagit Alkobi Fishman",
          "abstract": "Homophily, the principle that similarity breeds connection, shapes network formation across diverse social systems, from scientific collaborations to online communities. While this phenomenon profoundly influences how information flows, how communities form, and how opportunities distribute within networks, classical growth-based models typically lack general mechanisms for incorporating it. This paper presents a computational framework that bridges this gap. Through a retry-based wrapper algorithm, we augment any growth-based network model with homophilic bias while preserving its original selection mechanisms. The framework remains agnostic to both the underlying growth model and the similarity function, requiring only a measure of node similarity. Its efficiency is guaranteed through bounded retry counts, making it practical for large-scale network generation. Validation using the Barabási-Albert and Holme-Kim models demonstrates successful incorporation of statistically significant homophilic patterns. In our experiments, these variants preserved their characteristic properties - power-law distributions for both models and clustering coefficients for Holme-Kim. The extended Holme-Kim model is particularly valuable for social network research, combining scale-free topology, high clustering, and homophilic attachment. The framework provides a systematic method for incorporating arbitrary bias functions into network models, advancing our ability to study complex social systems computationally.",

We design an online experiment on an Italian sample (N=597 trustor-dictators) where subjects play a trust game followed by an allocation game with punishment options, a sequence designed to elicit genuine emotional reactions upon learning whether their counterpart defected. We elicit beliefs under incentive compatibility and measure emotional responses using the\nPANAS scale. We apply the belief-dependent model of anger by Battigalli et al. (2019b) to derive our predictions.\nIn our data, defection triggers a strongly negative emotional reaction, with anger being the dominant response. Anger correlates with elicited beliefs about trustworthiness among subjects who best respond to their expectations, and anger in turn predicts punishment. Female trustors hold higher trustworthiness expectations toward female trustees than toward male ones, while no analogous pattern emerges for male trustors. Defection by a female trustee triggers a stronger anger response in female trustors, in line with the larger expectation gap. Punishment follows a cross-gender pattern, consistent with in-group bias. Overall, our results suggest that gender bias in punitive behavior emerges both from expectation-driven frustration and from residual preference-based differences.",

Positioned as one key solution to issues related to ageing societies, these socially interactive, physically moving robots will likely be used in many public and private contexts. Emerging technologies like these are known to be prone to criminal exploitation before regulatory and governance frameworks adapt. To support anticipatory governance, this study uses expert elicitation to identify and assess plausible future crime and security risks associated with large-scale social robot deployment, alongside potential countermeasures. Over two days, 21 expert stakeholders identified and prioritised 21 distinct crime threats and 17 countermeasures according to anticipated risk severity and implementation potential. The highest-risk threats concerned the exploitation of social robots’ social features for fraud and social engineering, using them to spread hate, extremism, or disinformation, and their facilitation of harassment, stalking, or coercive control. The most promising countermeasures included robot registration or identity markers, anticipatory risk assessment practices, and cybersecurity measures. The findings contribute to futures-oriented debates on human–robot relations and inform research and policy agendas aimed at pre-empting harmful social robot–enabled outcomes.",

          "authors": "Helder Ferreira do Vale",
          "abstract": "Brazil’s rapid digital transition promised broader civic participation but instead deepened polarization, disinformation, and democratic erosion. This article examines how these dynamics produced a distinctive model of digital regulation, shaped not by legislatures or bureaucracies but by judicial activism. Interpreted through the framework of digital constitutionalism, Brazil’s regulatory trajectory reveals an attempt to reassert rights, trust, and institutional balance in the face of platform power and algorithmic manipulation. By analyzing the Marco Civil da Internet, the General Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LGPD), the failed “Fake News Bill” (PL 2630), the “AI Bill,” the interventions of the Superior Electoral Court, and ongoing debates on AI legislation, the article shows how crisis-driven governance reshaped the country’s digital governance. The analysis is based on a five-pillar framework that is used to explain the Brazilian digital regulatory model. This model indicates that Brazil has developed its own traits of “digital constitutionalism” provided that the country’s regulations are reliant on a strong judicial activism that not only guarantees rights, but help to preserve democratic values, and maintain national sovereignty in the face of Big Techs. However, this experience illustrates both the risks of judicial overreach and the potential of constitutional principles to guide democratic resilience in the digital age. The article contributes to comparative debates by positioning Brazil as a Global South test case for rights-based digital governance.",

          "abstract": "Climate institutions, including climate laws and advisory bodies, have proliferated globally. But do they matter? Existing work either analyses quantitatively how these institutions correlate with policy outcomes, like stringency or emissions reductions, or qualitatively examines a single type of institution. Neither strand provides tools to systematically analyse the effects of these institutions on the policymaking process itself. We therefore propose the Climate Institutions Analysis Framework (CIAF), which traces how institutions' formal functions interact with country-specific contextual variables to address 'strategic challenges'. Comparing climate institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia, we show that they support agenda-setting, increase transparency, signal commitment, and hold governments accountable. Notably, similarly designed institutions can produce divergent effects across countries due to variation in context. By conceptualising a new class of effects and their mechanisms, our framework contributes to debates about policy sequencing amid climate backlash and to comparative analysis of meso-level institutions.",

Methods: We conducted a scoping literature review to provide an overview of the crime and security threats related to social robots, and potential countermeasures. Results: We identified 18 distinct crime threats and 17 possible countermeasures described across 388 academic and non-academic articles from any discipline. The crime threats ranged from fraud and trespassing, to espionage and abuse towards robots. Countermeasure themes included establishing social robot rights and many technological adaptations.

          "abstract": "Humans are a social species, relying on a complex network of long-term relationships and cooperation to tackle ecological problems such as obtaining resources, safety and procreation. This rich sociality is as demanding as it is rewarding; while affiliation and status are intrinsically valuable, securing these benefits requires significant cognitive effort, material investment, compromise, and vigilance. Common views of cultural evolution and innovations often frame social interactions either as a vehicle to transmit knowledge across generations, or as a cooperation problem to be solved. I propose that culture evolves to directly address the challenges and costs inherent in social relationships. Cultural innovations help facilitate social interactions by making them more predictable and regular, and promoting independence and flexibility. Predictability can be achieved through centralized social events and experiences, such as rituals and stories, and through institutions and norms. Independence is promoted by technologies that enable individuals to carry out tasks on their own, and by substituting some of the benefits associated with social relationships. In all cases cultural innovations success can be evaluated by the way they meet the needs and offset the costs of social interactions. This view can explain the adaptive interactions between cultural innovations and social relationships.",

To cope with this, sustainability scientists have borrowed concepts from neighboring disciplines, used causal expressions that have confusing meaning, or abstained from using causal language altogether. We argue for using causal language as it is useful for prediction, manipulation, explanatory understanding and responsibility attribution. However, traditional views on causality have limitations dealing with causal complexity. We spell out the challenge of formulating useful concepts. We argue that it is important to recognize the role of everyday causal cognition and its limitations, to distinguish the different ways in which sustainability scholars talk about complexity and to clarify the causal meaning of complexity concepts, like non-linearity, adaptive capacity,  and feedback. Finally, we propose the concept of causal configuration to make explicit the causal meaning of complexity-related concepts.",

          "abstract": "Childfreeness has often been examined through the lens of decision-making in early adulthood or as a potential source of regret in later life. Less attention has been paid to how childfreeness is experienced and lived in midlife, particularly among women who often remain biologically fertile but increasingly encounter social assumptions of finality. This qualitative study explores how women over forty make sense of childfreeness as a lived identity. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, in-depth interviews were conducted with twelve childfree women aged 40-55 years old. Three group experiential themes were constructed that captured a development shift in which childfreeness becomes settled and no longer subject to internal negotiation. Participants described childfreeness as grounded in values of freedom, responsibility and ethical self-knowledge, alongside a conscious refusal of motherhood understood as irreversible responsibility. Rather than rejecting care or generativity, women articulated alternative forms of care and future-oriented planning that challenged pronatalist assumptions equating womanhood, care and generativity with motherhood. The findings highlight midlife as a critical yet under-researched period in life trajectories of childfree adults, offering important insights into gendered ageing, moral responsibility and the plurality of meaningful adult life trajectories beyond parenthood.",

We find that the Labour Party has consistently expressed more positive sentiment towards immigration compared to the Conservative party since the early 1960s, and that these positions further diverged in the early 1980s. The last 15 years have seen more negative rhetoric across all major parties, with immigration discussed among Conservative and Reform UK MPs in the most negative terms since 1923.

A custom‐built trading simulator was used (N = 88; 1,320 incentivized trials),\nand behavior was analyzed using linear mixed‐effects models.\nThe results reveal a robust self‐serving bias expressed through two distinct processes.\nResponsibility attribution was high for gains but declined sharply after losses, while\nperceived algorithm influence increased following failures, indicating retrospective\ninflation of the algorithm’s role. Regret exhibited a structural asymmetry: loss‐related\nregret was strongly dispositional, whereas gain‐related regret was situational. These\npatterns suggest that negative outcomes activate stable self‐evaluative tendencies,\nwhile positive outcomes elicit more context‐dependent responses.\nCrucially, restoring decision autonomy significantly reduced emotional distress after\nlosses. Participants who chose to ignore the algorithm experienced lower regret,\nindicating that agency serves as a psychological buffer that protects self‐image more\neffectively than compliance with external advice.

Across waves, respondents’ self-assessments of their personal economic situation show little change, and average satisfaction remains low. Concern about rising prices remains consistently high across social groups.\n• Attitudes toward the war in Ukraine remain polarized, and support coexists with negotiation preferences.Nearly half of respondents express support for the war, while a comparable share favors initiating peace negotiations. Notably, a substantial minority of those who declare support for the war also support starting negotiations.\n• Personal exposure to the war is widespread and politically consequential. Many respondents report personal connections to the war through participation or losses among close contacts. Such exposure is strongly associated with both support for continued military action and expectations about the war’s duration.\n• Fraud is the most common crime reported, trust in law enforcement remains moderate. Most respondents report no direct experience of crime in recent years. Among those who have, fraud is the most common form of crime. However, reporting varies by age, gender, region. Willingness to seek police assistance depends strongly on prior experience with law enforcement.\n• Media consumption continues to shift toward Telegram amid declining trust in news. Reliance on several traditional and online news sources has declined, while Telegram has continued to grow as a key source of political information. Across platforms, respondents report declining trust in news and political information.\nTaken together, the results of Wave 5 portray a society characterized by persistent economic anxiety, polarized war-related attitudes, evolving information habits, and complex patterns of vulnerability and social interaction.",

          "abstract": "While a growing body of research documents that women with high socio-economic status (SES) are more likely to give birth following medically assisted reproduction (MAR), fewer studies have investigated the processes that lead to this overrepresentation. In this study, we contribute to the literature on socio-economic gradients in MAR by providing a multi-stage analysis of social gradients across almost two decades. Specifically, we depict trends in annual education and income gradients in the take-up of MAR treatment, the probability of a MAR treatment leading to a live birth, and the prevalence of MAR involvement in births. We use Danish administrative data covering all births and MAR treatments among women aged 25–45 residing in Denmark from 2006–2023. We employ linear probability models adjusted for age groups, partnership status, and relationship duration, and stratify them by parity, treatment type, and clinic type. We document persistent social gradients in all three stages of the MAR process across parity and treatment type. Gradients in treatment take-up were substantially larger at private than at publicly funded clinics, indicating that financial barriers play a substantial role in access. However, the educational gradient in treatment success persisted at similar levels across both public and private clinics and over time, suggesting that nonpecuniary resources also contribute to SES differences in MAR outcomes. The results were robust across alternative specifications: using income as the SES measure, pooling treatments across types, excluding migrants, and estimating unadjusted models. These gradients persisted in the high-income, low-inequality, and heavily subsidized context of Denmark.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing online offender mobility. Drawing on multidisciplinary insights, we extend two established criminological models for studying offline offending—the geometry of crime and crime journeys—by adapting their core concepts to cyberspace and developing a topology in which the cyber place is defined and becomes the unit of analysis. Just as offenders travel before, during, and after committing crime offline, we argue they also undertake trips before, during, and after committing cybercrime, and that like offline journeys these cybercrime journeys comprise identifiable and measurable components. We further distinguish between human journeys (what offenders perceive) and data journeys (what happens to the information they transmit). We explicitly demonstrate how concepts from the geometry of crime and crime journeys translate from offline to online crime and mobility. The proposed approach enables the systematic formulation of research questions and the measurement of behavioral patterns, facilitating the generation and accumulation of knowledge on cybercrime offending. The paper illustrates the framework’s theoretical relevance within environmental criminology and its practical application for cybercrime analysis through concrete examples, including an empirical human journey into web hacking as a proof-of-concept.",

          "abstract": "This paper deepens the \"Equilibrium Theory Endogenizing Imbalances\" based on asset dynamics, as presented in the previous study (Kitamura, 2025), by incorporating concepts from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The objective is to bridge to a qualitative theory of development, encompassing issues such as the sustainability of economic growth and the creation of innovation. While the previous work proposed a model where imbalances are perpetuated through asset preference and capital diffusion, this study extends the framework into a model where \"effective asset potential\"—defined as the asset level divided by the rate of return on assets—acts as the driving force behind capital flows. It demonstrates a mechanism in which the capital efficiency of each nation significantly determines its economic trajectory.\nConsequently, this paper reveals that individual economies exist under a tension between \"subjective equilibrium\" aimed at utility maximization, and the \"pressure of entropy increase\" inherent in asset dynamics. Through observations using multilateral data, the global economy has polarized into \"self-organizing economies\" that concentrate and accumulate capital, and \"diffusive economies\" that primarily disperse and dissipate capital. This paper presents a novel perspective that views the global economy as a \"dissipative structure\" maintained through the interdependence of these distinct phases.\nBased on this analysis, the paper argues that for an economic system to remain sustainable, it is essential to maintain the gradient of asset potential within the system properly by eliminating \"stagnation\" through innovation and redistribution policies. Ultimately, this paper proposes that what economics terms \"equilibrium\" is equivalent to \"thermal death\" in physics; therefore, the goal of economics should be the avoidance rather than the realization of such a state, making the perspective of \"entropy management\".",

          "abstract": "Organization redesign often raises a central question: Where are managers needed? A potential substitute for formal supervision by managers is interpersonal cultural alignment, which can ease coordination between colleagues. Yet prior research suggests cultural alignment may also complement formal structure. We theorize that the balance depends on coordinative complexity: Whether culturally aligned individuals benefit from common supervision hinges on how broadly they depend on others to get work done. Cultural alignment can function as a substitute for formal structure when coordinative complexity is low and as a complement when coordinative complexity is high. Focusing on one of the most tangible and consequential forms of cultural alignment – the degree to which individuals are linguistically aligned with their peers in everyday communications – we make predictions about which pairs of colleagues organizational designers will tend to bring together under, versus separate from, a shared supervisor. Using archival data from a design firm, we find support for our theory, with especially strong effects when colleagues are highly visible to their senior managers.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Rosche",
          "abstract": "Coalition research increasingly emphasizes party-level explanations of coalition outcomes. However, this work does not account for the complex multilevel structure between parties and governments: many parties participate in multiple governments and governments often comprise multiple parties. In this paper, I show that this crisscrossing structure creates dependencies among observations both across and within governments. If ignored, these dependencies produce downward-biased uncertainty estimates that cluster-robust standard errors fail to fully correct. To address this issue, I then introduce a model that extends the Multiple Membership Multilevel Model to represent the multilevel structure of coalition government data. The model accounts for party-level dependencies across governments through party-specific effects in each coalition they join, and for dependencies within governments by representing the total party effect on a government as a weighted sum of its members’ contributions. By allowing party weights to vary with covariates describing their interrelationships, the model enables researchers to examine the interdependent nature of coalition outcomes. I validate the model through simulation and an empirical application to coalition government survival, showing that ignoring party-level dependencies can produce misleading conclusions at all levels of analysis. The model is estimated via Bayesian MCMC and implemented in the accompanying R package ‘bml’.",

This has resulted in a sprawling scholarly \nliterature, reflecting equally diverging practical implementations across jurisdictions. This article \nseeks out greater conceptual clarity through a systematic literature review of 117 academic journal \narticles covering a broad span of academic disciplines. In doing so, we approach credibility as a \n“fuzzy concept,” characterised by vague definitional boundaries, and highly context dependent. On \nthis basis, we firstly develop a guiding taxonomy to unpack this fuzziness. Second, our analysis \nreveals a fundamental conceptual fragmentation between those who focus on credibility as a feature \nof the claimant’s testimony, and those approaching credibility as a more personal trait. We show how \nthis rift can be seen to form along three dominating clusters, each pointing to reliance on different \nindicators. Finally, we draw together insights from across disciplines showing how continued reliance \non specific indicators is not only scientifically and legally flawed, but also casts doubt on whether \nnational asylum systems are capable of producing fair and coherent outcomes.",

Despite decades of research, this central question in political economy remains\nunsettled. We advance this debate in two ways: by examining the effects of both positive and negative\nmacroeconomic environments simultaneously, and by focusing on their cumulative impact over\nindividuals’ lifetimes. We address this question by examining how lifetime exposure to periods of\nunusually high and low economic growth shapes political and economic attitudes in Latin America.\nWe combine annual GDP per capita data from the Maddison Project (1896–2022) with nearly 700,000\nindividual responses from Latinobarómetro and LAPOP (1995–2021) to construct life-course measures\nof positive and negative periods for respondents in 18 countries. Our identification strategy compares\ncohorts within country–year using models with country, survey-year, age, cohort, and survey fixed effects.\nRepeated positive macroeconomic periods systematically shift individuals toward the right on a\nleft–right scale and improve subjective economic evaluations. In contrast, repeated negative periods\ndo not produce a consistent leftward shift; instead, they increase economic insecurity, dissatisfaction\nwith democratic performance, and anti-elite sentiment. Support for democracy as a principle remains\nstable. We confirm the generalizability of our main findings by replicating our analyses in 104 countries\nusing the Integrated Values Survey (1980-2022).",

Autistic children may find pubertal changes harder to navigate, due to sensitives surrounding sensory experiences, and difficulty with change. Our prospectively registered mixed methods systematic review (Registration: PROSPERO2023 CRD42023446750) aimed to synthesise research on Autism and puberty.\nMethods\nIncluded studies focused on puberty in Autistic people (including self-identifying) and those supporting them. Searches were limited to English language sources from 2013 - July 2023. We searched: Medline, APA PsycINFO, and CINAHL (all via EBSCOhost), and Web of Science (via Clarivate). Studies were subjected to Convergent Integrated synthesis (Joanna Briggs Institute). Quality assessments were undertaken using Joanna Briggs Institute tools.\nResults\n3,546 unique records were identified, and 61 items were included in the review. Most papers were high quality. We identified five themes. First, many studies compared Autistic and non-Autistic people, but few differences were identified, with puberty characterised as a universal experience. Second, parents felt unprepared for their child’s puberty, and uncertain of their future. Third, additional education in areas of puberty and sex were identified as needed for Autistic people, and those caring for them. Fourth, breaking norms was explored at length; with many parents worrying their child was not normal in behaviour and development. Finally described were physical changes of puberty and challenges these bring, specifically difficulties around menarche and menstruation. Limitations of studies included a lack of diversity (ethnicity; few fathers) and restricted consideration of confounding factors and author impact on research. \nDiscussion \nCo-developed interventions are required, to facilitate understanding consent, navigating pubertal changes, and learning skills. The synthesised research did not focus on comfort and wellbeing, but more so on normality, or perceived lack of, of Autistic young people. Future research should prioritise topics of importance to Autistic people, and should seek consent from Autistic participants.",

          "authors": "Lucas Paulo da Silva",
          "abstract": "Measuring media ideology is essential for researching media bias, media effects, and various important topics in political science, communication, and other social sciences. However, given journalistic norms of objectivity and the complexity of ideology, measuring media ideology accurately is uniquely challenging. Large language models (LLMs) have become valuable tools in this endeavor. Based on media communication theories, I argue that media ideology is expressed via different cues -- the topic, argument, framing, criticism, and sources of the media content -- and that LLMs often miss these. Standard methods of LLM classification also offer little control, flexibility, and data granularity to researchers. Drawing on insights about computational and quantitative measurement methodologies, I introduce the \"Multi-Cue Classification\" (MQ-Class) approach. With MQ-Class, an LLM classifies the different ideological cues separately and researchers then apply pre-specified weights and thresholds to combine them into one label per text. I compare standard LLM and MQ-Class methods using two example tasks -- classifying the economic and cultural ideologies of a novel sample of online media articles. Across multiple tests, MQ-Class is more accurate and puts researchers \"back in the driver's seat.\" I conclude by discussing how MQ-Class could be implemented for other classification tasks and data.",

          "abstract": "Stress process theories, which are foundational in sociology, posit that subjective stress causes emotional and behavioral problems. Though the link between stress and mental health is well-established, claims that stress causes criminal behavior remain contentious despite widespread acceptance in criminology. We test both pathways using two-wave panel data from Bangladesh (n=978 observations; 489 participants) and between-person and within-person estimation. Between-person analysis confirms established patterns: those reporting more stress also report more negative emotions and criminal intentions. However, within-person analysis, which adjusts for time-invariant confounding by design, reveals a striking asymmetry. Changes in stress reliably predict changes in negative emotions but not criminal intentions. Although residents of disadvantaged urban communities report more stress, within-person effects on crime remain near-zero. These findings validate sociological stress process theories for mental health outcomes while raising questions about criminological claims that stress causes crime. The between/within divergence suggests that stress-crime correlations in prior research may largely reflect selection into stressful circumstances rather than causal effects of stress on criminal intentions. Methodologically, results demonstrate how between-person correlations can systematically mislead about causal processes.",

This article presents Social-RAG, a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture designed to support scalable qualitative inquiry over large text corpora while preserving evidence traceability, auditability, and researcher control. Our empirical basis consists of messages from public Telegram groups and channels, organized into two thematic subsets: vaccine-related discourse and debates surrounding Brazil’s Lei Rouanet cultural funding policy. We detail key design decisions, including a “one post = one chunk” indexing strategy, semantic retrieval over vector embeddings with efficient ANN search, an Adaptive-K dynamic cutoff for context selection, MMR re-ranking for diversity, and structured analytical instructions that constrain generation to retrieved evidence. We evaluate system behavior using two complementary question blocks, hermeneutic (narrative) and factual, and compare outputs across three language models with distinct deployment profiles (a local open-weight model, a cloud open-weight model, and a commercial closed model), using an LLM-as-judge protocol with explicit qualitative criteria. Results show consistent behavior across both thematic corpora and highlight a key trade-off: the two larger/closed models perform similarly and robustly in both narrative and factual tasks when evidential discipline is maintained, whereas the smaller local model remains useful for exploratory narrative synthesis but is less reliable for strict factual extraction and attribution. We conclude by discussing methodological implications, limitations, and future directions, with a focus on scalability and extensibility to new data types and analytical problems.",

          "abstract": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) is widely promoted as a catalyst for agricultural transformation in developing countries, yet empirical evidence on its efficiency effects remains limited and mixed. This study examines the association between foreign direct investment and coffee production efficiency in Uganda, with particular attention to regional heterogeneity and policy context. Using a panel of five coffee-producing regions over the period 1995–2024, we estimate technical efficiency scores through stochastic frontier analysis and subsequently analyze their relationship with FDI exposure using fixed-effects panel regressions.\nThe results indicate that foreign direct investment is positively and significantly associated with coffee production efficiency, reflecting improvements in the use of existing inputs rather than expansion of cultivated area. On average, a one percent increase in FDI inflows is associated with an approximately 0.07–0.09 percent increase in production efficiency. However, these efficiency gains are unevenly distributed across regions, with stronger effects observed in relatively mature coffee-producing areas. Complementary factors including technology adoption, infrastructure, capital formation, and governance quality are also positively associated with efficiency, conditioning the magnitude of investment-related gains. In addition, the relationship between FDI and efficiency strengthens following the implementation of Uganda’s National Coffee Policy, highlighting the role of institutional reforms.\nThe findings suggest that while foreign investment can support efficiency-enhancing growth in smallholder-based agricultural systems, its benefits are neither automatic nor uniformly distributed. Effective investment strategies therefore require complementary public investments and institutional frameworks to promote inclusive and regionally balanced agricultural development.",

Indigenous religious and spiritual traditions, in particular, have had significant impacts on popular belief in the paranormal and supernatural.  For example, Indigenous phenomena such as skinwalkers and wendigos have become objects of paranormal research and investigation by non-Indigenous people in recent years. While it is common practice for non-Indigenous people to group these and similar phenomena under the banners of cryptids or mythical beings, in many Indigenous communities, such phenomena are seen as spirit beings who are able to move between the natural and supernatural worlds, realms, and/or dimensions, often at will and with purpose or reason. \n\tPennsylvania has a long and rich Indigenous presence and history, in particular with communities connected to the Lenape (Delaware), Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), and Saawanooki (Shawnee) nations.  Paranormal and supernatural phenomena connected to these and other Indigenous peoples are still thriving today throughout the Commonwealth.  In particular, there are four Indigenous phenomena of religious and spiritual significance – Bigfoot, Little People, Thunderbirds, and the Machtando.  \n\tIn this paper, we discuss the Indigenous origins and histories of these four phenomena, as well as the roles they play in contemporary paranormal and supernatural traditions in Pennsylvania.  Additionally, while detailing these specific phenomena associated with Pennsylvania, we hope to provide non-Indigenous researchers of the paranormal and supernatural the tools to respectfully and accurately incorporate Indigenous oral traditions into their interpretations of anomalous phenomena.",

Singapore’s Temasek global SWF investments added $472,605 per capita over the analysis period ($22,505/Year) and 14.42% to domestic savings share of GDP (2003-2023). As expected, Australia’s smaller SWF had no significant effect on GDP. These synthetic control analysis estimates are robust to in-place and time placebos and negative control outcomes.

As a key source of revenue in some communities, paranormal tourism’s success often requires reformation of community identities and paranormal mythologies. Atchison, Kansas provides an example of this phenomenon by basing much of its economic development on paranormal tourism. Drawing on five years of experiences leading paranormal investigations at the Sallie House, Atchison’s primary haunted attraction, we argue that community folklore contributes greatly to paranormal belief and engagement with such attractions. Synthesizing participant observation and survey responses, we examined changes in beliefs based on visitor’s time in the Sallie House. Changes in perceptions of paranormal phenomena bordered on significance with participants more likely to believe in ghosts after the investigation, while prior understandings of the paranormal were stronger drivers of belief and engagement.  Atchison’s success as a paranormal tourism destination is tied to their identity as a popular location to experience paranormal phenomena at several intensities and costs, thus allowing people of all levels of interest and budgets to participate. The Sallie House represents a microcosm of Atchison’s paranormal tourist environment with options for engagement at multiple levels, all drawing upon a rich, and ever-growing folklore.",

Rather than treating polarisation as mere attitudinal divergence, we frame it as the symbolic organization of political antagonism. Our model identifies three interrelated symbolic dimensions: divergence on contested issues conceptualized as signifiers; the consistency of these divergent issues, enabling chains of signification held together by “linking signifiers” that mark group identity; and the mutual constitution of opposing semiotic chains and identities. We add a fourth, social dimension by distinguishing symbolic from social boundaries and outline the various ways in which they interact. This framework offers a sociological theory of polarisation attentive to meaning-making, affect, boundary formation, co-constitution, and the conditional relationship between cultural and social differentiation.",

Despite various proposed solutions, including climate services and co-production, this gap remains unbridged. \nHere, we present a systematic sectoral analysis grounded in behavioral theory, exploring where and how climate information could support decision-making. Drawing on the COM-B framework for behavior (B) change, we examine the capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M) necessary for climate information to inform decision-making, focusing on two climate-sensitive sectors in Germany---agriculture and forestry---and on decadal predictions as an example.\nThrough expert focus groups (N = 24 participants), we identify key adaptation decisions for the coming decade and analyze current decision strategies and contexts. Our findings reveal that the demand for decadal predictions is negatively impacted by knowledge gaps, lack of opportunity, and limited motivation. Instead, decision-makers often rely on strategies such as past experience and heuristics like worst-case planning that do not require precise information, but may represent smart strategies for uncertain environments.\nThe true demand for future climate information remains masked, blocked, or unexpressed when decision-makers lack the capabilities, opportunities, or motivation to recognize, act on, or articulate it; when current decision strategies suffice, there simply is no demand. By using the COM-B framework as a behavioral lens to systematically understand the demand side, our approach offers generalizable insights that may help bridge the gap between supply and demand, design effective interventions, and guide the allocation of resources in climate research and policy.",

Since the phenomenon of CSR captures broader scope organizations frequently strive to gain more understandability of this concept while providing benefits of CSR to their stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to examine how Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) awareness and perceived CSR value affect customer loyalty of two dominant supermarket players in a high-density urban commercial hub in Sri Lanka. Social exchange theory is implemented as the theoretical framework of this study. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach – Adopting an explanatory research design, cross-sectional data from 108 respondents were collected in 2019 using multi-stage non-probability sampling method incorporating purposive sampling followed by quota sampling. Responses were gathered using a self-administered survey questionnaire. To test the formulated hypotheses based on independent and dependent variables, multiple linear regression analysis was performed with the aid of SPSS 25.0 version. \n\nFindings – The findings reveal that the level of CSR awareness has a positive, yet modest and significant impact on supermarket customer loyalty. Whereas, perceived value of CSR indicates a positive, stronger and significant effect on customer loyalty in the supermarket sector. Consequently, perceived value of CSR exerts a stronger positive influence on supermarket customer loyalty rather than CSR awareness.\n\nImplications - This study contributes to the literature by deconstructing the CSR-loyalty nexus. Consequently, the conclusions made from the results will be helpful to managers and employees in modern retail stores to determine the effectiveness of currently implemented CSR projects towards customers and what components should be prioritized in their CSR efforts to make customers loyal. Further it will provide useful insights to the managers in supermarkets in developing effective CSR strategy as enhancing customer loyalty.\n\nKeywords: Corporate social responsibility (CSR), CSR awareness, Customer loyalty, Perceived value, Supermarkets",

          "authors": "Anthony Calacino; Melanie Sauter",
          "abstract": "When is environmental activism most dangerous? We argue that elections create windows of strategic restraint driven by international reputational concerns. Environmental defenders threaten agricultural rents, making them targets for violence by landowners, firms, and criminal networks operating with political protection. However, elections concentrate foreign media attention. Political elites respond by temporarily withdrawing protection from violent actors, particularly in countries dependent on agricultural exports to demanding markets like the European Union. Analyzing global patterns of environmental defender killings, we demonstrate that violence systematically decreases during election periods, with effects concentrated in countries with high agricultural export dependence. We also show that this pattern is strongest for regular, scheduled elections, and that international media attention spikes during elections. Our findings reveal how international economic integration creates cyclical rather than sustained protection for vulnerable activists, which highlights both the power and limits of transnational accountability mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "The definition of health behaviours and the activities they encompass continues to evolve. While behaviours such as alcohol use, smoking and physical activity are widely recognised in public health research, newer forms of behaviour, including social media use, have increasingly entered health discourse. Arts engagement has more recently emerged in public health discourse as a potential health-relevant behaviour with implications for health and wellbeing, yet little is known about how it co-occurs with other health behaviours across populations and contexts. This study examined how arts engagement as a health behaviour clusters with other health behaviours, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and social media use, and across countries. We analysed data from the Global Flourishing Study, comprising 123,847 adults from 22 countries and territories, using latent profile analysis. Four health behaviour profiles were identified: Low risk, At risk, Mixed, and Disengaged, with arts engagement tending to co-occur with other health-promoting behaviours. These clusters were also observed (broadly) in the country-specific sample. Some country differences in the distribution of health behaviours within clusters were found and the proportion of the clusters also varied across country. Exploring predictors of the identified clusters revealed clear social inequalities in health behaviour patterns, with the strength of the gradients differing by country income level. These findings suggest that arts engagement is a behaviour distinct from other health behaviours, yet one that frequently co-occurs alongside other low-risk behaviours. Moreover, the observed social disparities in health behaviour clusters within and across countries highlight the importance of adopting a social-ecological perspective in health research and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Two fatal disasters and several near misses experienced by Boeing manufactured airplanes in recent\ntimes have undermined public trust in the manufacturer as well as the regulator (Federal Aviation\nAuthority; henceforth FAA). In response, the FAA has promised stricter oversight to improve\nsafety. This study maintains that stricter FAA oversight alone is unlikely to address safety concerns\nas the regulatory governance structure is flawed. The current structure focuses on the bounded\nrationality problem of effective oversight stemming from concerns such as the lack of FAA’s\nexpertise while glossing over opportunism problems. In other words, the regulatory governance\nstructure puts too much trust in Boeing. To address this flaw, this study offers five design\nprinciples that consider both the bounded rationality and the opportunism problems. These\nprinciples can be extended to other industry contexts where self-regulation is prevalent.",

          "authors": "Justin Kollar",
          "abstract": "The so-called AI boom is part of an infrastructure-led industrial strategy, converting speculative computing demand into bankable fossil generation, transmission expansion, and water- and land-intensive industrial sites. This article bridges digital infrastructure studies and the new state capitalism literature by theorizing compute as a socially produced resource whose availability depends on territorial governance. I argue that the buildout is being assembled through a fossil–AI nexus, a fossil–finance–platform coalition that produces powered land: an emergent asset form whose value derives from positionality in a constrained energy system that secures deliverable 'firm' power through revenue guarantees, deliverability rights, and cost-allocation arrangements. Drawing on a review of major gas-to-data centre co-location projects and a comparative analysis of PJM and ERCOT, I identify three recurring de-risking channels that convert uncertain load forecasts into durable, carbon-intensive infrastructure: revenue certainty, delivery certainty, and cost shifting. I show how 'reliability,' alongside security and competitiveness framings, compresses timelines, translates engineering criteria into bankability, and narrows public contestation. I also show how opacity, or 'blackboxing,' stabilizes powered land by restricting access to contractual and cost-allocation terms, while relocating politics to transparency disputes and siting conflicts over where data centres go and who pays for the buildout.",

          "authors": "Elena Cama; Bianca Fileborn",
          "abstract": "This paper reports on pilot data from online surveys among 97 passengers of taxi and rideshare services in Victoria, Australia about their experiences of sexual harassment and interpersonal violence. Survey findings reveal that 58% of the sample had experienced harassment or interpersonal violence in either a taxi or rideshare service; 47% reported that they had at least one harmful experience in a taxi and 30% in a rideshare service. The most common behaviours reportedly experienced were a driver or other passenger staring or leering, unwanted attempts to flirt, unwanted comments about their physical appearance, offensive sexual comments, unwanted attempts to establish a romantic or sexual relationship, offensive or degrading comments about gender, and unwanted sexual requests. Overall, women were more likely than men to report harmful experiences. Engagement in reporting mechanisms was low, but participant’s likelihood of reporting to taxi and rideshare companies and to the police in future remained high. This is the first study of its kind in Australia and provides important insights into the nature and impacts of these experiences. The authors call for further research to better understand safety and interpersonal violence in the taxi and rideshare industry at the national and international level.",

Further, the volatility of digital asset and risk exposure affects the growth of financial market. Hence, the regulatory authorities also regularly monitor and incorporate the necessary transformation and transmission of the respective monetary policies. \nThe impact of Digital Asset, either Private or Public, on the money flow is to be examined. Considering the above, this paper intends to examine the on monetary policy implications for digital assets in general and CBDCs in particular.",

          "abstract": "This research utilizes computational and network analysis methods to examine strategic management scholarship in public relations from 2012 to 2022, revealing how research within this paradigm has evolved with an increased focus over the past decade on non-traditional organizational contexts as well as internal communication and organizational listening. Although criticism of the strategic management paradigm has sought to expose its limitations, this research found a robust, inclusive, and expanding body of knowledge regarding strategic public relations management and a greater understanding of the evolving middle-range theories that constitute its perspective. This research reinforces the centrality and importance of the strategic management paradigm to broader public relations scholarship, and presents an expanded conception of its influence across traditionally disparate epistemologies of public relations research.",
