          "authors": "Cristina Zogmaister; Francesco Fedeli; Davide Albertoni; Francesca Alparone; Antonio Aquino; Cosimo Talò; Silvia Mari",
          "abstract": "The integration of insect-derived ingredients into Western diets offers a sustainable protein alternative but it faces cultural resistance and a spontaneous aversion. Assessing automatic reactions to foods containing imperceptible insect components remains challenging. In this research, we developed and psychometrically evaluated two indirect measures—the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) and the Manikin Task—to capture automatic evaluative and approach-avoidance responses toward insect-based foods. Across two studies (N = 246), these tasks demonstrated acceptable to good reliability and provided complementary insights. While correlations between indirect and explicit measures were generally low, some associations aligned with theoretical expectations. These findings suggest that BIAT and the Manikin Task effectively assess automatic reactions to insect-derived foods, offering valuable tools for consumer acceptance research and informing strategies to promote sustainable diets. Both measures are feasible for online administration and enhance understanding of implicit food-related attitudes beyond traditional questionnaires.",

          "authors": "Vera Bouwman; Andre Pittig; Iris Engelhard; Elske Salemink",
          "abstract": "Exposure-based CBT is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. However, individual differences in response to exposure indicate that many patients do not fully benefit from therapy. Examining individual changes over time in threat expectancy likelihood, a theorized working mechanism of exposure as proposed by the Inhibitory Retrieval Theory, may help optimize individual treatment success. This study aimed to examine the dynamics of learning during one exposure exercise for fear of public speaking and the retention of learning in daily life. Participants with elevated fear of public speaking (70 women, M age = 23.10) completed an exposure exercise designed to violate an idiosyncratic threat expectancy. They gave two, three, or four presentations to at least halve threat expectancy likelihood. Ecological momentary assessments were used to measure threat expectancy likelihood eight times a day for four days before and four days after the exposure exercise. Results showed individual differences in how fast threat expectancy likelihood decreased during the exposure exercise. Furthermore, there were individual differences in how much this translated to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood in daily life and how long participants retained the decrease. Additionally, after the exposure exercise, we found a decrease in threat expectancy severity, anticipatory anxiety, avoidance tendency, and an increase in willingness to give a presentation in daily life. Future research could examine whether individual differences in the dynamics of learning and retention in daily life following an exposure exercise are clinically relevant as predictor of overall treatment success.",

          "authors": "Giwon Bahg; Simone A Luchini; Roger Beaty",
          "abstract": "Creativity assessment has historically relied on human raters to judge the quality of ideas and products. However, this approach is exceptionally costly due to the limited number of experts, the time and resources required for training them, and the high task burden. To overcome these barriers and expedite creativity research, computational automation of creativity assessment has been explored. We provide an overview of recent developments in computational creativity assessment methods, including techniques based on artificial intelligence (such as large language models) and semantic distance. Leveraging these modern machine-learning approaches, computational creativity assessment methods have enabled automatic scoring across various tasks—from simple idea generation to complex problem-solving and artistic expressions—often matching human rater agreement. These methods also have the potential to automatically generate new creativity tests (“automated item generation”) and can be used to detect invalid responses (i.e., random/task-irrelevant ideas), thereby ensuring assessment integrity for high-stakes applications. We discuss the current challenges and potential future directions, such as improving the interpretability and explainability of automated scoring, and a complementary approach centered around evaluating mental processes leading to creativity.",

          "authors": "Vera Bouwman; Andre Pittig; Iris Engelhard; Elske Salemink",
          "abstract": "Although exposure-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is generally effective for anxiety disorders, many people do not benefit. A better understanding of treatment predictors is required. This study investigated whether the dynamics of threat expectancy likelihood, which is one of the theorized working mechanisms of exposure, after an exposure exercise would predict subsequent intervention outcome. The short exposure exercise was designed to decrease the likelihood of one idiosyncratic threat expectancy. It was hypothesized that individuals with public speaking anxiety who hold on longer to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood after the exposure exercise (slower speed of return to equilibrium), show greater benefit from subsequent exposure intervention (i.e., less public speaking anxiety). Participants with subclinical public speaking anxiety (N = 60, M age = 25.42) completed an exposure exercise and momentary assessments in daily life (eight times per day) three days before and four days after the exposure exercise. One week later, they did an online one-session exposure intervention to decrease public speaking anxiety. Result showed that threat expectancy likelihood decreased after the exposure exercise and public speaking anxiety decreased after the intervention. Against expectations, speed of return to expectancy likelihood equilibrium did not predict intervention effects. Potential explanations of null results are discussed, like sampling frequency to measure speed of return to equilibrium and timing of the exposure exercise. Given the potential of dynamic predictors for exposure therapy outcome, more research is needed to examine the conditions in which speed of return to equilibrium predicts subsequent treatment outcome in anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic social interactions and feedback are crucial for understanding others’ emotions, particularly when confronted with contradictory emotional cues. Alexithymia, a condition that co-occurs with many psychiatric disorders, is characterized by impairment in emotional processing. However, computational mechanisms by which it alters social inferences based on feedback cues remain unexplored. To examine this, 60 participants with low and high levels of alexithymia completed an emotional learning task involving contradictory social (verbal and visual) cues to infer targets’ emotions. Computational analyses, including bin-based, reinforcement learning, and drift-diffusion modeling, revealed how alexithymia alters latent parameters that govern value updating and choice. Individuals with high alexithymia demonstrated lower accuracy in learning from social feedback. Drift diffusion analysis revealed a perceptual bias toward the visual cue, higher drift rates in the visual-correct condition, and greater evidence accumulation to infer others' emotions. These findings suggest that individuals with high alexithymia exhibit impaired social learning and difficulty with decision-making in situations with conflicting social information, with computational modeling quantifying the latent processes involved and advancing mechanistic targets for computational psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Background: Mother-adolescent interactions are important for adolescents’ emotional development, but few studies have assessed patterns of mothers’ or adolescents’ emotional expressions using ecologically valid tools. This study investigates patterns of emotional expression in mothers and adolescents using video filmed with head cameras during a novel interaction task. \nMethods: Participants were 26 mother-adolescent dyads (13 boys and 13 girls) from the Wirral Child Health and Development Study. Mothers and adolescents played a card game answering questions about each other whilst wearing head-cameras. Card responses were coded as correct and incorrect. The intensity of mother and adolescent emotional expressions was analysed by AI software FaceReader and collapsed into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Linear regressions tested the following preregistered hypotheses: (H1) mother and adolescent emotional expressions are positively associated; (H2) mothers display more positive emotions than their adolescents; (H3) mothers express more positive and neutral emotions when their adolescents are negative, whereas adolescents react more negatively to their mothers’ negativity; (H4) both mothers and adolescents display more positive emotions during agreements than during disagreements; and (H5) mothers express greater emotional variability during disagreements than during agreements.\nResults: Mothers demonstrated higher emotional variability during periods in which adolescents expressed a higher intensity of negative emotions, supporting H1 and H3, and expressed higher intensity of positive emotions compared to adolescents, supporting H2. There was no evidence to support H4 and H5.\nConclusions: Mothers express greater positive emotional intensity than their adolescents and a wider range of emotional expressions in response to their adolescents’ negative emotions. This could inform parenting interventions and advice around the de-escalation of negative emotional states in adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that unexpected sounds can inhibit eye-movements, which may occur due to global suppression of motor actions. If this is the case, then eye-movements should be inhibited across a range of tasks, and the degree of inhibition should be relatively independent from the bottom-up perceptual processes associated with each task. In the present study, we tested whether unexpected novel sounds inhibit eye-movements in two complex and ecologically valid tasks: passage reading and dynamic scene viewing. Participants read short passages from textbooks for comprehension and watched short videos of urban environments for memory recall while their eye-movements were being recorded. On every 5th fixation, a sound was played: this was either a repeated “standard” sine wave tone with a probability of .8 or a “novel” environmental sound with a probability of .2. Unexpected novel sounds led to longer fixation durations compared to the standard sound in both tasks, but the effect was slightly weaker in the dynamic scene viewing task. Follow-up analyses suggested that smooth pursuit eye-movements did not fully explain the attenuation of the effect in the scene viewing task. These results suggest that saccadic inhibition by unexpected sounds can occur in different active vision tasks, but the effect may not be entirely independent of the task dynamics.",

However, long-term effects remain unclear. Therefore, we explored long-term (&gt;12 years) outcomes of childhood stimulant medication use, using data from the NeuroIMAGE cohort. Method. Childhood (up to Mage=16.14, SDage=3.48) stimulant treatment trajectories were detected using K-means clustering based on age at initiation, stop age, total and maximum daily dose, and duration and variability of stimulant use in 324 children. The trajectories were compared across seven domains of adult outcomes (controlling for multiple testing) including psychiatric status, behavioral and emotional functioning, academic and professional functioning, adaptive functioning, neurocognitive functioning, physical health, and healthcare service use. Results. In 143 adults with childhood ADHD (Mage=28.34, SDage=3.74, 65% males) three stimulant treatment trajectory groups were detected: early-and-intense (n=46), late-and-moderate (n=63), and stimulant-naïve (n=34). The three groups did not differ on most adult outcomes, but group differences were observed for the adaptive, neurocognitive and physical functioning domains on the measures risk perception, cognitive flexibility, and sleep quality. The early-and-intense group had the most favorable mean scores (trend effects) compared to the other groups. Findings did not change after controlling for age and sex. Discussion. Stimulant medication use in childhood did not predict long-term outcomes in those with childhood ADHD in our sample, with a few exceptions, including some positive outcomes related to risk perception, cognitive flexibility, and sleep quality in those with longer and higher dosages.

          "abstract": "Concealed Information Tests (CITs) aim to detect recognition of critical information that individuals attempt to hide, typically using physiological markers. Although previous CIT studies have combined several autonomic indicators such as heart rate and pupil change, it is still unclear whether adding neural measures to pupillometry can capture complementary aspects of recognition and attentional control. To investigate this, we examined whether electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry jointly provide reliable markers of concealed information in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm, which constrains strategic processing and emphasizes rapid recognition. Participants viewed streams of faces containing a critical probe—either a personally familiar (parent’s) face or an unfamiliar face—while performing a sex-based target detection task. EEG and pupil size were recorded concurrently, focusing on four measures: ERP amplitude at Pz, theta-band (4–8 Hz) power, absolute pupil size, and pupil size change. At the group level, all measures differentiated probes from controls, reflecting attentional orienting and recognition. At the individual level, detection varied across modalities. To integrate evidence, we applied Fisher’s method to combine p-values across measures. Although overall detection did not substantially improve, combined inference compensated for limitations of single measures.",

          "abstract": "The Joint Position Reproduction test (JPR) is one of the most widely used methods to assess proprioceptive accuracy. It was revealed that certain characteristics of the test influence the acuity. However, some studies show contradicting results, and interactions between factors were also revealed. In this study, we investigated how the effect of starting position, movement type (active or passive), speed, magnitude, and time spent at the target position influences error magnitude and direction. We implied a full factorial 2 (starting position: 30 or 150°) * 2 (movement type: active or passive) * 3 (movement amplitude:30, 60 or 90°) * 2 speed (12 or 24°/sec) * 2 (time spent at target: 2 or 4 sec) within subject design, measuring the left elbow joint, and analyzed the data of 135 university students, using generalized linear mixed models. In the first model, where the outcome variable was absolute error, we found a significant main effect of movement type, speed, and amplitude, and significant interactions of amplitude*speed, amplitude*starting position and amplitude*speed*error direction. Higher movement amplitudes and speeds, and passive motion, lead to higher error scores. The deteriorating effect of amplitude was magnified by speed; the staring position*amplitude interaction shows the possible effect of target position. In the second model, where the outcome variable was error direction, we found a significant starting position main effect, and significant starting position*speed and starting position*amplitude interactions. Participants tended to make errors towards the starting position, higher speed and amplitudes increased this tendency. The results have important consequences regarding the standardisation of the JPR. Namely, to ensure comparability, we recommend standardising for the type (active or passive), amplitude and speed of movement and target position.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the associations between socioeconomic and lifestyle factors and measures of hearing ability to better understand potential risk factors for hearing loss. Insights from this research could help audiologists identify high-risk demographics, and ultimately contribute to addressing inequalities in hearing health. \n\nDesign: An online study design was used, where data were collected on participant demographics, lifestyle and socioeconomic status, including age, gender, ethnicity, region of residence, income, education, occupation, exercise frequency, height and weight, smoking status, and weekly alcohol consumption, which were used as model predictors. Participants also self-reported their hearing function using the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale 12 (SSQ-12) and completed an online digits-in-noise (DiN) task to assess speech perception ability, which were used as outcome variables. A sample of 227 adults aged 45-65 (Mean age = 53.77, SD = 5.87) were recruited through Prolific (www.prolific.com) based on Office for National Statistics (ONS) income groups. Results: Two multiple regression models were conducted with the outcome variables of speech perception ability (Digits-in-Noise: DiN) and self-reported hearing function (Speech and Spatial Qualities of Hearing Scale: SSQ-12). The analysis revealed that having a routine and manual occupation predicted worse self-reported hearing function, as did being a regular tobacco consumer.  No significant predictors were significant for speech perception ability . \n\nConclusions: The findings suggest that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, as measured in this study,  are significantly associated with self-reported hearing function in mid-life, but not with speech in noise perception ability. These results partially align with previous research that has identified smoking and occupation factors as predictors of hearing sensitivity when measured using pure tone audiometry. These data highlight the need for greater understanding as to how lifestyle and socioeconomic factors relate to different dimensions of hearing health.",

          "abstract": "It is argued in this Commentary that Green, Beaty, Kenett &amp; Kaufman's (2024) proposal for completely separate or \"Orthogonal\" definitions of creative processes and creative products is problematic regarding products. On conceptual grounds, drawing on philosophical analyses, it is argued that for a product to be classed as creative it must be produced in the right sort of way, i.e., by a creative process. It is suggested that Green et al.'s process definition could be used in a non-orthogonal definition of creative products as a necessary process underlying creative products. It is also noted that the proposal for non-orthogonal definitions of creative products, where product creativity is process-dependent, make the creative process definition primary in defining creativity. The arguments here also support the use of process measures in empirical studies to back up judgments regarding the creative nature of any putative creative products.",

          "abstract": "It is well documented that individuals who possess a Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM) can voluntarily retrieve an increased frequency of personal memories, that are also markedly more detailed, compared to non-HSAM individuals. In contrast, no study has explored potential differences relating to involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) retrieval. Here, a single HSAM case (DT) and matched controls completed a 1-day naturalistic IAM diary study to investigate frequency and characteristics of IAMs. HSAM individuals, even if they can remember almost every day of their life, are not constantly flooded by their past. Therefore, we hypothesised that occurrence of IAMs would be as in controls. At the same time, their exceptional ability to remember personally-relevant events could be reflected in the features of the memories relived. In line with our predictions, frequentist and Bayesian analyses support that DT has a normal prevalence of spontaneous memory pop-ups, but his IAMs were more vivid and self-relevant than controls. Such results support that, for individuals with exceptional memory, IAMs, like voluntary memories, are of an extremely high quality. Finally, we argue that our results provide evidence in support of cue overload mechanisms limiting unintentional (but possibly also intentional) retrieval in HSAM.",

          "abstract": "Mafia-type Criminal Organizations (MCOs) often foster indifference and passivity toward their crimes in the population, a phenomenon known as code of silence (omertà, in Italian). Despite MCOs' detrimental effects on economies and citizens, evidence-based protocols targeting the promotion of anti-mafia motives are still lacking. To fill this gap, we assessed whether embodying heroic figures through Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) would enhance opposition to MCOs, reducing omertà. Specifically, 71 Italian young adults were split into three groups, in which they respectively embodied: a notorious Italian anti-mafia hero (i.e., Giovanni Falcone; Experimental Group, N = 24), a heroic figure unrelated to the anti-mafia movement (i.e., a firefighter; Heroic Control Group, N = 22) or a common person (Control Group, N = 25). After familiarizing themselves with the virtual body and completing a motor task, participants delivered a speech in front of an audience of virtual agents. Results showed that the embodiment procedure did not affect anti-mafia attitudes, and that, unlike the control group, participants embodying heroic characters tended to maintain the same level of decisional conflict about their anti-mafia intentions. In addition, in a subsequent Interpersonal Distance Task (IPD), only participants in the Experimental and Heroic Control groups displayed greater physiological discomfort (stronger heart rate deceleration or skin conductance response) when facing virtual agents associated with MCOs and crime, compared to innocent agents. We suggest that the embodiment of heroic figures induced discomfort because of the duties and dangers associated with their role, preventing the improvement of anti-mafia attitudes and intentions.",

          "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by abnormal food intake, including energy restriction despite starvation or episodic binge-eating, which may reflect alterations in the reward value of food. Affected individuals show impaired learning from non-food rewards (e.g., money), yet the generalisability of such perturbations across the spectrum of disordered eating and to disorder-salient stimuli remains poorly understood. Therefore, we examined associations between ED symptoms and decision-making during reinforcement learning with food and non-food reward in a population-based sample. We recruited four hundred adults (n=250 female, M(SD)=29.5(6.6) years) to an online study, during which they performed two runs of a probabilistic instrumental learning task with either food or monetary reward. On each trial, participants chose between two cues with the aim of maximising the amount of money or food earned throughout the task, where cues were probabilistically associated with either wins, losses or neutral outcomes. A reinforcement learning model was fit to trial-wise choices to generate parameter estimates of learning rate and inverse choice temperature. Increased ED symptomatology was related to poorer task accuracy on loss relative to win trials across both reward types. Computational modelling revealed that greater ED symptom scores were associated with decreased inverse choice temperature for loss versus win trials. Our findings identify a link between ED symptomatology and impaired reinforcement learning from punishment that appears to generalise across food and monetary reinforcers. This may explain, in part, the challenges with modifying behaviour in patients who are struggling with EDs despite serious negative health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Social gaze is a fundamental social cue that regulates approach and avoidance in social interactions. Everyday social interactions are characterized by repeated eye gaze exchanges. However, it remains unknown whether and how individuals learn from experiencing direct or averted eye gaze in others. Here, we used reinforcement learning modeling to investigate how micro-level gaze behaviors contribute to dynamic changes in social preferences and social closeness. Participants repeatedly chose between two faces that predominantly (70%) responded with either direct or averted gaze when selected, and rated their perceived closeness towards these individuals. Results showed a significant increase in choice frequency and closeness ratings for the direct gaze partner compared to the averted gaze partner. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms, computational modeling revealed that the direction of others’ eye gaze elicits a learning signal (prediction error) that in turn changes the latent value of the interaction partner. The learning signal was calibrated by individual differences in perceiving direct gaze as rewarding. Initial attractiveness and valence of the interaction partner predicted this reward calibration, suggesting that pre-existing impressions shape how social feedback is valued. In turn, calibration was reflected in participants’ social evaluations of the direct gaze partner, indicating how learning experiences contributed to impression formation. Together, these findings demonstrate that even minimal gaze interactions can shape social preference and closeness through reinforcement learning mechanisms. They further suggest that eye contact is a powerful, yet individually calibrated, social signal with implications for understanding and improving social engagement in both everyday and clinical contexts.",

          "authors": "Janis Zickfeld; David Joachim Grüning",
          "abstract": "Human emotional crying remains an enigmatic phenomenon despite its universality across the lifespan. This manuscript introduces the Control-Arousal Signal Model (CAS), an integrative framework that unifies physiological, cognitive, and social perspectives on crying. The model posits that emotional crying emerges when a sudden increase in arousal coincides with a perceived loss of control, leading to an emotional response and the expression of emotional crying including behaviors such as tears and vocalizations. The CAS conceptualizes crying as a five-phase temporal process—from stimulus appraisal to post-crying regulation—and highlights interpersonal signaling of loss of control as its primary function, with intrapersonal regulation as a secondary, context-dependent outcome. By systematically reviewing major theories and empirical findings, the manuscript demonstrates how the CAS reconciles contradictory evidence, accommodates both negative and positive crying, and accounts for developmental, situational, and cultural moderators. The model generates testable hypotheses regarding the triggers, functions, and outcomes of crying, providing a coherent basis for future research. Its implications extend to developmental psychology, clinical practice, emotion regulation, and cross-cultural studies, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding crying as a central feature of human emotional expression.",

Patients were tested either on (N=34) or off (N=34) dopaminergic medication (levodopa), with age-matched polyneuropathy patients serving as controls (N=35). Behaviorally, patients off medication showed marked learning and decision-making deficits, characterized by overexploration and insufficient exploitation. To clarify the mechanisms underlying these impairments, we applied a computational model that combines similarity-based generalization with both random and uncertainty-directed exploration. The modeling results showed that impairments in patients off medication resulted from reduced generalization and increased uncertainty-directed exploration, but not greater random exploration. In contrast, exploration and generalization in patients on medication were comparable to the control group. Our  findings highlight how dopamine depletion in PD impacts reward learning under uncertainty, suggesting a key role of dopamine in exploration and generalization.",

          "abstract": "While sleep benefits memory consolidation in young adults, it remains unclear whether this advantage persists over aging. Using an associative inference task (AB/BC paradigm), we compared the effects of post-learning sleep versus equivalent wakefulness on associative (AB, BC) and inferential (AC) memory in older and young adults. Our study showed that sleep (vs. wake) enhanced associative memory retention in both age groups, while for inferential memory, a significant sleep benefit was observed in young adults, with a similar but non-significant trend in older adults. Critically, a direct comparison revealed that the magnitude of the sleep benefit for both memory types did not statistically differ between older and young adults. Refined analyses revealed that among older participants, sleep preferentially benefited poor performers in consolidating both associative and inferential memory. Furthermore, associative memory retention was positively correlated with subjective sleep quality in young adults, whereas inferential memory performance was linked to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior score in older adults. Together, our results suggest that sleep’s role in memory consolidation remains largely intact in healthy aging, highlighting its potential contribution to support cognitive health in later life.",

          "authors": "Alex Steiner",
          "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progressively paralyzes speech and motor functions, rendering patients speechless when voluntary movement is lost. Although invasive brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) such as electrocorticography (ECoG) have achieved high accuracy in speech-related neural activity decoding, clinical use is limited by surgery costs and risks. This study presents a new, fully non-invasive EEG-based inner-speech translation system aimed at communication restoration in ALS. This paper introduces a novel machine learning architecture based on a fusion of region-aware convolutional attention encoders and a transformer decoder, presenting a generative sequence-to-sequence model for open-vocabulary EEG-to-text translation. Preprocessed and downsampled EEG data from the Chisco imagined-speech dataset were used, and 48 optimized electrode channels were selected based on contribution-based ranking. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT) was employed to train the model to preserve linguistic fluency while being specialized for EEG input. Evaluation achieved BLEU-1 = 0.512 $\\pm$ 0.012 and ROUGE-L F1 = 0.396 $\\pm$ 0.009, surpassing earlier non-invasive baselines. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of cross-regional fusion and diversity regularization in maintaining cortical interpretability during the encoding process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-vocabulary, non-invasive EEG-to-text system capable of reconstructing continuous inner speech with high linguistic coherence and accuracy. These findings are a key step toward clinical neural speech restoration for ALS, facilitating the development of future real-time, low-cost assistive communication devices.",

These motive inferences were linked to greater political sectarianism and lower willingness to have a conversation about politics with the outrage expressor. In a fourth study (N = 720), we developed an intervention that changed people’s motive inferences, which improved willingness to have a conversation about politics. These findings highlight the role of motive inferences in shaping contemporary online political discourse filled with strong emotions, and suggest key levers to foster civil interactions among cross-partisans.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding human needs that transcends the limitations of hierarchical models. Unlike Maslow's rigid pyramid, our Dynamic Attention Based Model (DABM) proposes that human needs function as competing signals for cognitive attention, with their urgency determined by both evolutionary priority and subjective intensity. We introduce nine fundamental need categories that operate simultaneously rather than sequentially, each associated with distinct neurobiological pathways. The model makes a critical ontological distinction between needs (abstract psychological states), actions (behavioral responses), and objects (satisfiers), resolving longstanding conceptual ambiguities in motivation theory. We present the Integrated Needs Hierarchy (INH) assessment tool, propose three empirical validation studies, and address theoretical and practical implications. This framework offers a more dynamic, culturally sensitive, and neurobiologically grounded understanding of human motivation than existing theories.",

          "abstract": "Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM), the inability to recall specific events and instead recall general memories, is a well-known feature of psychopathology. Although OGM has been regarded as a deficit in generative retrieval, recent studies highlight the role of direct and involuntary (associative) retrieval in OGM. We propose the accessibility model, which discards the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory and truncated search hypothesis. The accessibility model assumes that memory representations of different specificities are structured in parallel, and compete to be retrieved. The model contends that direct and generative retrieval are serial processes (i.e., direct retrieval initially, followed by generative retrieval), and specific and general memory accessibility each affect OGM. We argue that increased accessibility of negative general memories and decreased accessibility of positive specific memories underlie OGM in depression. These changes in accessibility are differentially associated with hippocampal abnormalities, memory suppression, self-referential processing, and positivity biases, suggesting different mechanisms depending on emotional valence. Furthermore, we propose that metacognitive monitoring and control are required to initiate generative retrieval when retrieved memories are goal inconsistent. The accessibility model integrates existing basic memory and OGM research, which may lead to improved memory therapeutics, and new avenues for research development.",

We examined this issue on several popular participant recruitment platforms, including Mechanical Turk and Lucid. Across four studies spanning five years using multiple methods, we provide evidence that most of the data quality problems affecting online research using online panels can be tied to fraudulent users from outside of the US—not bots.

          "abstract": "Sharing books with young children has long been associated with positive outcomes for children’s language and literacy outcomes. Studies suggest that caregiver language during these book-sharing interactions is linguistically richer than speech directed to young children (target-child-directed speech; tCDS) during other everyday activities. However, few studies have directly compared the linguistic richness of speech in book sharing and other activities within the same families. In this study, tCDS was sampled from day-long naturalistic recordings to investigate the linguistic richness of speech directed to 24-month-old children from English- and Spanish-speaking families in the U.S. We compared four sources of speech: book text, read-aloud speech during book-sharing interactions, spontaneous speech during book-sharing interactions, and spontaneous speech during other everyday activities. We first used a mega-transcript approach combining across families (Dawson et al., 2021; Montag et al., 2015) and compared the four sources of language on type-token ratio curves. We next conducted a more fine-grained analysis to look within families, comparing the four sources of speech in terms of lexical (lexical diversity, lexical density, lexical frequency, and contextual diversity) and grammatical (mean length of utterance in words and the proportion of complex utterances) measures associated with linguistic richness. Across both approaches and in both language groups, speech based on text was lexically and grammatically richer than both sources of spontaneous speech. These results indicate that the power of the proposed linguistic richness of speech during book-sharing interactions stems from features of the text on the page.",

          "abstract": "To what extent does pretesting—the learning technique of guessing to-be-learned content before studying the correct answers—enhance factual knowledge, and does its effectiveness depend on which part of a fact is pretested? We investigated memory for different parts of facts when pretesting involved either the subject (e.g., “_____ is the goddess of agriculture”) or a key term from the predicative (e.g., “Demeter is the goddess of _____”), compared to studying intact facts. Experiments 1a–4 revealed asymmetrical learning patterns: Pretesting on the subject enhanced memory for the predicative key term, but not consistently for the subject itself, whereas pretesting on the predicative key term, at best, enhanced memory for that key term but not for the subject. When word frequency among subject and predicative terms were closely matched in Experiments 5–7, however, pretesting yielded highly symmetrical learning—enhancing memory for both terms regardless of which one was pretested. That enhancement occurred despite differences in associative strength and semantic structure, whereas syntactic and other structural influences, including extra cue words, were ruled out. Together, these findings reveal that pretesting can improve memory for both tested and untested fact terms, with lexical properties exerting strong influences on the scope and magnitude of improvement. The effects of pretesting on facts therefore depend on how easily learners can access and encode fact elements, and accordingly, which terms to pretest should be considered carefully when using pretesting for fact learning.",

          "authors": "Yuhan Zhang; Erxiao Wang; Cory Shain",
          "abstract": "Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case — the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have — comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.",

When that boundary collapses, as in recursive hypothesis building, evidence becomes self-referential: the same dataset is reused to propose and “confirm” the same idea. This article examines recursive hypothesis building and its link to redundant publication through a detailed case analysis in educational research (2010–2017). Drawing on the ethical frameworks of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and the American Psychological Association (APA), the article shows how undisclosed data reuse converts exploratory findings into apparent replication, creating an illusion of empirical consensus. By tracing how identical datasets generated multiple publications under different analytic labels, the paper demonstrates that recursive hypothesis building represents not simply redundant publication but a logical failure that undermines verification itself. The analysis concludes that transparency—not output volume—should define research integrity. Mandatory data-reuse disclosures, open-data practices, and ethics education are proposed reforms to prevent recursion that turns scientific verification into repetition.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: In the field of human psychology, the study of personality traits was a major research endeavour extending over several decades. Considering personality as stable, underlying dimensions that influence behaviour, a similar construct can be assumed in large language models (LLMs). However, most research in the field of machine personality relies on unverified assumptions or is afflicted by methodological weaknesses. The present work is the first to present a psycho-lexical analysis of machine personality.\nMethods: The psycho-lexical approach together with an exploratory factor analysis was adopted. Interview-like interactions were conducted with various LLMs (N = 400), and their behaviour was evaluated using a set of adjectives commonly used to describe personality traits. The ratings were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis to extract LLM-specific personality factors.\nResults: Five stable factors were extracted and interpreted. The five factors were termed Antagonism, Spirit, Conscientiousness, Negative Introversion, and Simple-Mindedness.\nConclusion: The present work addresses the lack of systematic and fundamental approaches to the study of personality in LLMs. It is the first to present an LLM-specific factor structure of personality, suggesting that humans and LLMs exhibit different personality traits.",

          "abstract": "For more than four decades, research on restorative environments has been guided by two influential theoretical frameworks: Attention Restoration Theory (ART) and Stress Reduction Theory (SRT). While these theories have been instrumental in shaping the field, they have also faced criticism. Although it might appear that the limitations of both theories could be resolved through adjustments and further research, we adopt a meta-theoretical perspective to assess ART and SRT against general standards of theory construction. We argue that neither framework meets core standards for predictive utility or explanatory power. We focus on two issues. On the one hand, critical constructs assumed to predict restorative nature experiences are often vague, circular (e.g., “soft fascination”) or underdetermined in terms of their level of specificity. On the other hand, both theories exhibit explanatory fragility: ART’s resource-based account of restoration does not clarify how depletion and replenishment actually occur, whereas SRT’s evolutionary explanation posits what appears to be an unnecessary and unfalsifiable adaptive mechanism. We conclude by challenging the assumption that the psychologically beneficial effects of nature are in some way “special” and instead advocate for greater epistemic restraint in building nature-specific theories around beneficial nature effects.",

We investigated naturalistic navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation in younger adults (N = 30) and older adults (N = 30) using a city-like virtual reality wayfinding task (NavCity) across multiple within-session exposures, paired with a NavCity Allocentric Representation Assessment (NARA). Older adults demonstrated significantly lower navigation performance compared to younger adults including traveling greater distances, taking longer navigation times, moving at slower speeds, and exhibiting longer dwell times while navigating. Despite aging-related differences, both age groups showed similar rates of performance improvement across exposure blocks. Following repeated NavCity exposures, older adults demonstrated lower allocentric knowledge formation, but both age groups demonstrated significant associations with navigation performance. Notably, substantial heterogeneity was observed within the older adult group, with a bimodal distribution in NARA scores that split older adults into higher- and lower-performing subgroups, which corresponded to differences in navigation performance independent of chronological age. Higher-performing older adults exhibited navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation comparable to younger adults, while lower-performing older adults showed persistent deficits in both navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation despite repeated exposures. These findings suggest  that aging-related navigation decline is not uniform and highlight the possibility of combined virtual navigation and allocentric assessment tasks as potential sensitive, early indicators of aging-related declines in spatial navigation ability.",

          "authors": "Tate Pan; Jiaqiu Vince Sun; Xing Tian",
          "abstract": "Mindfulness practice is often described as yielding a “quieter mind,” yet the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying this experience remain understudied. This research investigates how focused attention (FA) meditation influences automatic semantic processing through a series of conflict-based tasks (e.g., Stroop). In a between-groups design, participants were randomly assigned to either brief FA meditation or mind-wandering control conditions. Results demonstrated that, compared to the control group, FA meditation significantly reduced the Stroop congruency facilitation effect in the classic color-word task. Crucially, this reduction in facilitation was not observed in two additional non-semantic control tasks (administered solely to FA participants). This selective pattern suggests that FA meditation temporarily inhibits automatic semantic processing rather than enhancing reactive control or general selective attention. Notably, these effects emerged in meditation novices following a brief (10-minute) guided FA session, indicating that even short-term meditation can modulate automatic cognitive processes. These findings provide empirical support for the role of mindfulness in reducing automatic thought processes and contribute to our understanding of its underlying cognitive mechanisms, offering insights into how brief meditation interventions might help individuals better manage intrusive thoughts and automatic cognitive processes in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Background: Autistic college students may encounter academic content about autism that is deficit-focused. In this study, we compared how autistic and non-autistic students evaluated such content and the extent to which the content affected their self-esteem.\nMethods: The final sample included 172 undergraduate students (n non-autistic=  86, n autistic = 86) recruited using Prolific. Participants read a brief vignette about an autistic child taken from a popular psychology textbook. They rated how useful they found the vignette for understanding autism, how useful the average college student would find it, and how offensive and stigmatizing it was. Participants also provided self-esteem ratings before and after reading the vignette and completed three individual difference measures (strength of autistic identity, autism knowledge, ableism critical consciousness).\nResults: Compared to non-autistic participants, autistic participants rated the vignette as less useful and as more offensive and more stigmatizing. Individual differences influenced these effects in two ways: First, the stronger the autistic participants’ autism identity, the more offensive and stigmatizing they found the vignette to be. Second, participants with greater autism knowledge rated the vignette as less useful. Although average self-esteem ratings did not change after reading the vignette for either neurotype, 39.5% of the autistic sample reported feeling worse about themselves after reading the vignette than before. \nConclusion: This study provides insight into how autistic and non-autistic college students react to autism-related academic content, highlighting the roles of identity strength and autism knowledge in shaping these reactions. The findings underscore the need for more inclusive and representative depictions of autism in academic content by revealing significant differences in how autistic and non-autistic students evaluate the same material.",

          "abstract": "Background: Reasoning biases play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of delusions. In psychosis, it is unclear whether these biases cluster onto similar underlying factors or represent independent constructs. Here, we capture both task-based reasoning biases and self-reported cognitive biases, as well as cognition and affect to understand mechanisms underlying metrics of clinical delusional severity and broader unusual thought content.\nMethods: Participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD; N=75) were enrolled following hospitalization for an acute psychotic episode. Non-clinical comparison participants (NCC; N=70) were recruited for comparison of affect, cognition, and reasoning biases. Exploratory factor analysis and multivariable linear regressions were performed in the SSD group only. Core clinical delusions and broader unusual thought content, alongside preoccupation, conviction, and distress were used as outcome measures.\nResults: SSD participants had more severe reasoning biases, cognitive deficits, and negative affect than NCC. In SSD, factor analysis revealed four latent constructs representing belief updating, cognitive biases, affective disturbances, and general cognitive ability. Affective disturbances were significantly associated with delusional preoccupation and distress. Belief updating was the only factor associated with conviction. Cognitive biases related only to the number of unusual beliefs endorsed, but no other aspects of severity. General cognitive ability was unrelated to all facets of delusional severity.\nConclusion: Affective disturbances and belief updating map onto distinct aspects of clinical delusions in SSD: distress/preoccupation and conviction, respectively. Delusion severity is broadly unrelated to cognitive impairment. Reducing delusional conviction may require treatments focused on how new evidence is integrated into existing beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Interleaved practice—systematically mixing different categories—tends to enhance mathematical learning. However, research on its long-term effects of delays beyond 30 days, and the potential benefit of providing additional instructional support to encourage comparison and abstraction processes during interleaved practice, is still emerging. Therefore, this study investigated two promising approaches: starting with blocked practice before transitioning to interleaved practice (blocked-to-interleaved practice, B2I) and self-explanation prompts. 238 third graders participated in an experimental classroom study on three subtraction strategies (stepwise, compensation, and indirect addition). After instruction on strategy execution and application conditions, students completed a practice phase targeting both execution and strategy-problem associations. The study followed a 3 x 2 between-subjects design (blocked vs. B2I vs. interleaved x self-explanation vs. additional practice). Data were collected before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at 8- and 16-week follow-ups. Both interleaved conditions outperformed blocked practice in terms of flexibility, adaptivity, and conditional strategy knowledge (CSK), with effects lasting up to 16 weeks. Although no direct benefit on accuracy emerged at any measurement point, serial mediation analyses indicated that interleaving improved accuracy indirectly via CSK and adaptivity. Neither initial blocking nor self-explanation prompts yielded additional benefits over pure interleaving. Self-explanation quality positively predicted short-term adaptivity, accuracy, and CSK, and remained a predictor of CSK at 8- and 16-week follow-ups. These findings indicate that interleaving promotes lasting adaptive expertise in elementary school mathematics but suggest no benefit from adding a blocked phase or self-explanation prompts under deductive instruction conditions.",

          "abstract": "This systematic review synthesises evidence on athlete leadership development interventions. A search across eight online databases identified 36 studies spanning descriptive, qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods designs. Findings highlight a rapidly growing field in which interventions target not only formal athlete leaders (e.g., team captains) but also informal athlete leaders and athletes without designated leadership roles. Interventions focused on developing a broad range of leadership behaviours, with a strong emphasis on interpersonal skills. Most interventions prioritised leader development, with durations ranging from brief sessions lasting a few hours to multi-year programs. Study authors (including some trained sport psychologists) and coaches were the primary facilitators. Interventions were predominantly delivered in team sports, with most studies based in the United States. The methodological quality of studies examining intervention effectiveness was mixed. While qualitative studies scored well on critical appraisal and participants reported improvements in their leadership as well as in individual and team outcomes, quantitative studies—typically used to establish causality—performed relatively poorly. Consequently, quantitative evidence for intervention effectiveness should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, their findings suggest that the most effective interventions targeted the team’s best athlete leaders (whether formal or informal), focused on leadership rather than leader development, were grounded in the identity leadership framework, and lasted three to five months. Moreover, coach-delivered interventions outperformed those led by study authors, including those with sport psychology training. Overall, our findings provide a foundation for advancing research and practice in athlete leadership development.",

          "abstract": "Young people and university students are particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of climate change due to their prolonged lifetime exposure to, and increased contact with, climate change and related information through learning. Despite this, little research exists on how university students cope with climate change from a psychological perspective. In this large qualitative study, we analysed data from an online survey to investigate how students (N = 823) of a large UK university cope with climate change. This survey covered which climate change situations were triggering for them, preferences for support-seeking, and specific coping strategies. Conceptual content analysis revealed that challenging situations included navigating climate change information, climate justice issues, climatic changes and environmental losses, and climate change dismissal. Findings from qualitative framework analysis further showed four ways students coped with these: by reducing the mental load of climate change, doing something constructive, seeking social support and meaning, and doomist thinking and behaviour. While many students highlighted the importance of social connections, a small minority considered seeking professional support. These findings partly support and expand on climate change-related coping literature and have implications for how higher education settings communicate about and act on climate change.",

It remains contested whether cognitive control processes, such as cognitive reflection and inhibitory control, are linked to a greater tendency to engage in politically motivated reasoning, as proposed by the “motivated reflection” hypothesis, or can help people overcome it, as suggested by cognitive science research. In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then investigated the associations of the two cognitive control variables cognitive reflection and inhibitory control with motivated reasoning. We find that associations between cognitive control processes and motivated reasoning are likely small. On political topics specifically, we find that a negative association with cognitive reflection is more likely than a positive association. This finding is contrary to predictions from the popular motivated reflection hypothesis. Results for inhibitory control are inconclusive. We discuss how these findings relate to interdisciplinary literature from cognitive and political psychology.",

          "abstract": "A well-established finding in Evolutionary Behavioural Sciences is that a low waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is judged as more attractive than a high WHR in women, a preference hypothesised to track female mate value. However, virtually all studies on the topic display nude or minimally clothed bodies, under highly standardised conditions, potentially exaggerating WHR’s influence in real-world contexts. We tested whether WHR-based judgements generalise to fully clothed women and to more ecologically valid conditions by analysing 608 painted female figures from European portraits (1650–1950), embedded in socially rich, minimally sexualised settings. Online Prolific observers (N = 1,525) independently estimated the body shape, attractiveness, age, and likelihood of previous childbirth from either the body or the face of the painted characters. Perceived WHR strongly predicted trait judgements: lower WHR was associated with higher attractiveness, younger perceived age, and lower perceived likelihood of previous childbirth. These relationships persisted after controlling for various variables, including posture, body orientation, perceived weight, and perceived facial age. Our findings show that WHR-based heuristics persist even in visually complex, clothed, and historically diverse depictions of women. They further suggest that fashion styles that exaggerate WHR may have functioned as strategic amplifiers of socially and reproductively relevant cues, with implications for theories of mate choice, social signalling, fashion history and cultural evolution.",

However, people vary widely in who they mean when they discuss diversity and their beliefs about why and how to promote diversity. These diversity components have only been examined in separate literatures, lacking full integration. Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

Recent researchs suggest that people can successfully infer the knowledgeability of others from past accuracy, but the computational principles underlying these judgments are unknown. We test whether people can both infer and search for information about others' competence in a near-optimal way, consistent with rational Bayesian reasoning. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were presented with an individual's performance on a trivia question and predicted the individual's ability to answer other trivia questions from the same theme. Replicating and extending past results, we observe that participants very accurately predict performance from limited information. Computational modelling shows that participants' inferences are better described by Bayesian processes than by plausible heuristics, suggesting that participants rationally integrate new information with their prior expectations about others' competence. Study 3 shows that participants can select which information would be most diagnostic for inferring an individual's competence, again in a manner consistent with Bayesian rationality. Overall, our results suggest that people approximate a rational Bayesian model both when searching for and when integrating information about others' competence.",

Part 2 examined the factor structure in each country independently (sample sizes: UK = 389; NL = 330; DE = 540), and discarded poorly fitting items and integrated results to produce a single, 25-item questionnaire comprising three subscales: Novelty, Investigative, and Interactive Curiosity. Part 3 evaluated the reliability and validity of this final instrument within each national sample to ensure robust performance across cultural contexts. Psychometric analyses indicated strong internal consistency, coherent relations to other related, validated measures, and evidence of cross-cultural applicability.

Overcoming a key methodological limitation of past approaches, we used Bayesian censored location scale models as an alternative modeling approach that accounts for biases introduced by bounded rating scales. The results showed that the variability estimates from the models had reliabilities around rel = .64, which can be sufficient for group-level predictions. Additionally, the latent stability of r = .60 provides evidence for stable individual differences in emotional variability, suggesting that it is more than just a transient state.

However, it remains unclear which specific aspects of functionally organized frontostriatal loops are affected by ADHD and how these disruptions differ across individuals in light of the disorder’s marked heterogeneity. We investigated frontostriatal connectivity in individualised circuits in 40 adults with ADHD and 36 neurotypical controls using a multimodal dataset that included diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as functional MRI during working memory updating, resting state, and a naturalistic attention task. Compared with neurotypical controls, adults with ADHD exhibited reduced structural connectivity strength and increased mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in tracks originating from medial and orbital prefrontal areas. Functional data revealed weaker connectivity in the ADHD group during verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks in circuits connecting the striatum with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, motor regions, and orbitofrontal cortex, while no group differences were found during resting state or the naturalistic task. Structural and functional aberrancies were only partly overlapping. Comparisons with atlas-based analyses highlighted the precision of individualised connectivity mapping. Together, these findings suggest that (1) frontostriatal functional connectivity aberrancies in ADHD are driven by striatum-dependent cognitive processes such as working memory, (2) functional and structural differences are related to partly different frontostriatal circuits, and (3) precise mapping of frontostriatal pathways can be achieved through individualised connectivity mapping.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction: Intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration among men is a pressing public-health concern globally and in post-transition societies such as Albania. Beyond socio-demographics, fewer studies have jointly examined psychological and developmental predictors. This study assessed prevalence, correlates, and multivariable predictors of men’s IPV perpetration in Albania.\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey of adult men (N = 365; community participants and court-mandated perpetrators) measured IPV with a five-item, severity-weighted Abuse Severity Index (ASI-5: verbal, psychological, threats/property destruction, physical, and sexual). Psychological/developmental variables included attachment orientations (ECR-RS), emotion regulation (DERS-Impulse), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), alcohol use (AUDIT), cognitive flexibility (CFI-Control), and Big Five traits (TIPI). Group differences, correlations, and binary logistic regression analyses were performed.\nResults: Over half reported psychological IPV, while physical assaults (21.9%) and sexual coercion (16.4%) occurred only among IPV perpetrators. Several socio-demographic risks (e.g., lower education/income, unemployment) were associated with IPV, though in multivariable models only age 45+ remained predictive. The strongest psychological predictors were ACEs (OR = 1.26 per unit), avoidant attachment (OR = 1.61), and impulse-control difficulties (OR = 1.10); alcohol use showed a marginal positive association. Protective tendencies (emotional stability, conscientiousness, agreeableness, cognitive flexibility) correlated negatively with IPV but did not retain significance in regression. Overall, psychological and developmental predictors explained 55% of the variance in IPV perpetration.\nDiscussion: Findings support a developmental-attachment pathway to IPV perpetration: early adversity, insecure (avoidant) attachment, and emotion-regulation deficits increase risk, compounded by alcohol use. Results highlight the need for trauma-informed, attachment-based, and self-regulation interventions, with attention to alcohol misuse, and offer practice implications for risk stratification and perpetrator programming in resource-constrained, Southeastern European settings.\n\nKeywords: emotion regulation; intimate partner violence perpetration; attachment avoidance; impulse control; cognitive flexibility; alcohol misuse; adverse childhood experiences; Albania.",

          "authors": "Philipp K. Masur; Douglas A. Parry",
          "abstract": "Social media constitute norm-rich environments in which user behavior is shaped by continuous exposure to others’ actions and reactions. Self-disclosure seems especially responsive to such cues, making it important to understand how online contexts encourage or discourage sharing. While prior research shows that descriptive and injunctive norms guide disclosure, the relative impact of behavioral prevalence, reinforcement signals such as likes and comments, and relational similarity has not been clearly established. This paper addresses this gap by examining how distinct normative cues shape both visual and written disclosure online. In two preregistered experiments (n1 = 590, n2 = 1,337), we let participants use a simulated but ecologically valid social media platform, allowing us to independently manipulate disclosure prevalence as well as reinforcement via likes and comments. Results show that prevalence of visual disclosure consistently increased descriptive and injunctive norms, which in turn raised disclosure intentions. Written disclosure influenced norm perceptions but not disclosure intentions, suggesting modality-specific dynamics. Similarity decreased reliance on prevalence for norm inference but strengthened the motivational pull of norms once formed. Surprisingly, reinforcement cues had no effect on these dynamics. These findings refine social norm theory by distinguishing norm inference from adoption and highlight prevalence as a stable normative driver. Practically, they raise concerns about vulnerability to visible peer behaviors and the spread of risky online trends.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how pre-service teachers’ motivation toward educational technology develops during teacher education is essential for fostering classroom technology integration. Drawing on Situated Expectancy–Value Theory (SEVT), this longitudinal study examined (a) the stability of technology-related expectancies for success and task values and (b) their predictive effects on pre-service teachers’ intended technology integration, including reciprocal effects over time. Data were collected from N = 314 pre-service teachers enrolled in a Bachelor of Education program in Germany at two measurement points approximately one year apart. Participants completed self-report scales assessing digital competence beliefs, utility value, attainment value, intrinsic value, relative costs, and prospective technology integration. Confirmatory factor analyses supported scalar measurement invariance across time. Results showed moderate rank-order stability for all motivational constructs (r = .46–.68) and no significant mean-level changes, except for a small increase in perceived costs. Cross-lagged structural equation models revealed that digital competence beliefs and positive task values at Time 1 positively predicted prospective technology integration at Time 2, whereas relative costs showed no effect. No reciprocal relations were observed, suggesting that motivation functions as an antecedent rather than a consequence of technology-related intentions. Together, these findings indicate that pre-service teachers’ motivational beliefs remain relatively stable over one year of teacher education and are prospectively related to their intended technology use. The results provide longitudinal support for SEVT in the context of technology-related motivation, underscoring the importance of fostering positive digital competence beliefs and task values early in teacher education.",

          "abstract": "The human brain continuously maps the space surrounding the body through a highly flexible system known as peripersonal space (PPS). This multisensory interface dynamically integrates visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive information to guide interaction with the environment. Although PPS plasticity is well documented following tool-use, it remains unclear how the architectural properties of the surrounding environment modulate this process. Across two experiments using immersive virtual reality (VR), we investigated whether the shape of the environment affects PPS remapping after motor training with a tool. In Experiment 1, participants performed a validated visuo-tactile integration task before and after VR-based tool-use training, all within the same 16m² virtual room. Results showed a significant PPS expansion, confirming that immersive VR can reliably induce PPS plasticity. Experiment 2 tested whether environmental geometry modulates this effect: the same training was conducted in a long (2 × 8 m) and a short (8 × 2 m) virtual room. PPS expansion emerged only after training in the long-shaped environment, while no modulation was found in the short-shaped condition. These findings demonstrate that architectural features—specifically spatial openness and boundary proximity—directly influence the sensorimotor mechanisms underlying PPS plasticity. Our results highlight that the environment is not a passive background but an active component of embodied spatial representation, providing novel evidence for the integration of neurocognitive and architectural perspectives within the emerging field of neuroarchitecture.",

          "abstract": "Background: Retrieving from memory directly benefits long-term retention and also enhances subsequent learning of new content, known as retrieval-potentiated new learning or the forward testing effect. \nAims: The present study assessed the forward testing effect with complex learning materials and was the first to directly test motivational mechanisms, using cognitive effort, enjoyment, and self-paced practice time as motivational indicators.\nSample: 308 undergraduates in an online psychology course participated.\nMethods: Students read three texts introducing new course concepts relevant to their final course exam. After studying Texts 1 and 2, students recalled or restudied the previous text for a self-paced or fixed amount of time. All students took a free-recall test after studying Text 3. \nResults: Recall of Text 3 was greater for retrieval practice than restudy of Texts 1 and 2. This forward testing effect was independent of learners’ prior knowledge and text interest, as well as whether practice times were self-regulated. Consistent with the encoding effort hypothesis, cognitive effort and practice times mediated the forward testing effect: Compared to restudying, retrieval practice reduced the declines in effort and practice time observed across blocks, thereby enhancing learning of Text 3. Enjoyment did not decline across blocks but there was no evidence it mediated the forward testing effect. \nConclusions: The present research affirms the potential instructional value of retrieval practice for promoting new learning, including in online education. There was some support for motivational accounts of the forward testing effect but motivation likely cannot fully explain why retrieval practice facilitates new learning.",

This article provides an overview of the key abnormalities in autobiographical thinking observed in psychopathology, and introduces the collection of articles in this special issue on autobiographical processing and psychopathology. Together, these papers illustrate the diverse ways autobiographical processing can be examined to advance understanding of mental disorders, including how mental representations change, how they interact with emotional processing and global schemas, and how they can be leveraged therapeutically to promote psychological health.

A common research objective in meta-analyses is identifying study-level moderators that explain heterogeneity across primary studies. Several MASEM approaches have been extended to include moderators, however research evaluating and comparing these approaches remains scarce. The present study discusses several parameter-based moderated MASEM approaches covering one-stage and two-stage as well as fixed and random effects approaches. We implement these different MASEM approaches using a Bayesian modeling framework and evaluate them through two simulation studies. We compare bias, efficiency, coverage rates, and statistical power of moderator effects across varying number of primary studies, sample sizes, random effect structures, and structural models. Results imply that different parameter-based MASEM approaches can provide unbiased estimates and appropriate coverage of study-level moderation effects. Exceptions and implications are discussed.",

Participants (N = 400) were randomly assigned to one of four groups in which they read a total of three descriptions depicting a moral, immoral, and neutral behavior and listened to a total of three unfamiliar songs randomly paired with a description. Emotional and aesthetic responses to each song were measured using validated measures (GEMS-9 scale), along with additional items assessing feelings of being moved, connected, perceived beauty, perceived creativity, and liking. As predicted, linear mixed-effects models revealed significant main effects of morality for all dependent variables, with immoral descriptions consistently yielding more negative ratings. Contrary to what was predicted, no significant main effect of humanness (human vs. AI-model) was observed. Likewise, no significant interaction was observed between morality and humanness.",

Less is known about the relative impact of the confidence of self and others’ on social information use, and how they jointly shape social transmission. We present results of two incentivized decision-making tasks (N=203 and N=213, samples from the U.S.A.) where participants could adjust their initial estimates upon observing estimates of peers and their confidence. Adjustments were most sensitive to the confidence of others when participants’ own confidence was low. Confidence also affected heuristic strategies: confident others prompted participants to compromise and copy social information more often, rather than to stick with their initial estimates. We discuss how following confident others when uncertain can improve decision-making, but also leaves people vulnerable to sources of misinformation.",

          "abstract": "Network analysis has become a popular computational modeling approach in psychological research and is now increasingly used to address confirmatory research questions. However, preregistration of such analyses remains rare and given the complexity of the data and methods, is often perceived as limiting or even infeasible. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how researchers can safeguard against bias without relying on preregistration by using analysis blinding. The method involves temporarily altering the data to remove the key effect of interest while preserving all other aspects. Analysis blinding makes it possible to explore important features of the data, for instance, spotting outliers or adjusting the computational model, without introducing bias. This tutorial presents three common research questions in network analysis and shows how they can be addressed using analysis blinding to safeguard their confirmatory nature. It uses data from previously published studies employing network analysis, and offers a practical, step-by-step guide along with R code that researchers can adapt to their own data and research questions.",

An internal meta-analysis of all incentive-aligned and scenario-based experiments revealed that people substantially overestimate others' dishonest behavior (Hedges’ g = 0.61; k = 31; N = 8,127), by 14 percentage points on average. Does such belief inaccuracy matter? Study 2 (N = 981) found that providing correct information about actual honesty levels enhanced pro-social beliefs about others. Study 3 (N = 285) found that professional managers have pessimistic beliefs about people’s real-world dishonest behavior (e.g., insurance fraud, tax evasion, workplace theft), and greater moral pessimism predicts greater support for freedom-reducing countermeasures.",

Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared less than 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "abstract": "A person’s lifetime involvement with musical expertise has been hypothesized to be positively associated with executive functions, including inhibition, shifting, and working memory. However, results of past research have been inconclusive. This preregistered systematic review and three-level meta-analysis of 47 studies encompassing 235 effect sizes from 4651 healthy adult participants investigated how strongly musical expertise relates to each of the three executive functions. The results showed significant medium associations between musical expertise and executive functions (g = 0.43), with small to medium associations between musical expertise and each of the functions: inhibition (g = 0.31), shifting (g = 0.22), and working memory (g = 0.49). Risk of bias moderated the relationship between musical expertise and inhibition, and the paradigm used to assess executive functions moderated the association between musical expertise and working memory. The results suggest that individuals who engage in musical activities have higher levels of executive function, with a particularly critical role of working memory in musical expertise. The literature review further identified several methodological issues, including predominant reliance on dichotomizing continuous variables and the use of small samples yielding low statistical power. The review offers methodological recommendations and directions for further investigating the relation between working memory and musical expertise.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts. However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. This may be because researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our results suggest that findings from past studies should be interpreted with caution as they did not distinguish excellencism from perfectionistic standards.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

In addition, they completed the Reading Span and N-back tasks to assess working memory capacity (WM), as well as a short version of Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices to assess fluid reasoning ability. In bivariate correlational analyses, all cognitive test scores predicted degraded speech intelligibility. However, multivariate and dominance analyses revealed that the test of fluid reasoning was the most important predictor of intelligibility. These results may undermine the assumption that WM, as measured by the Reading Span and other tasks, is the primary cognitive construct supporting degraded speech intelligibility.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of mental disorders, with depression and anxiety disorders being the most common, has been rising for years and particularly impacting adolescents. This trend was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural barriers and personal factors hinder help-seeking for child and adolescent psychiatric services, contributing to delays in accessing treatment. Hence, early symptoms of mental illness in adolescence are often recognized too late, increasing the risk of chronic progression into adulthood and underscoring the urgent need for timely diagnosis, prevention, and intervention. Digital Phenotyping offers a digital approach to capturing psychopathological traits through time-series data collection, providing an objective and individualized view of psychological change processes. These data can be analyzed using Machine Learning to support the early detection of mental disorders. The Early SoDA study aims to use DP and a participatory approach to enable the detection of the early onset of mental disorders in adolescence, with a particular focus on depressive and anxiety disorders. It evaluates the Brain Explorer App, which assesses cognitive functions through games, as well as EMA, voice diaries and mobile sensing for playful data collection.\nIn a six-month longitudinal observational study with an exploratory approach, N=200 adolescents and young adults (ages 16–22) will be recruited, including at least n=50 with depression or anxiety disorders. Following an initial baseline assessment, data will be collected daily across four 14-day intervals over 6 months and one 12-months follow-up assessment, including cognitive functions via the Brain Explorer App, EMA-based questionnaires on sleep quality, emotion regulation, stress, and general well-being, along with voice diaries and additionally mobile sensing in a subsample of at least n=50, and reflected back to participants as personalized feedback. If values exceed the clinical cut-off, a clinical interview and consultation with the study team will be conducted. Behavioral parameters are extracted from these digital footprints and analyzed using ML to classify and assess symptom severity of increased psychopathology. We expect that the collected data will predict the progression of emerging psychopathology and reveal intercorrelations among data sources, with EMA data potentially showing the highest predictive value.\nAs the first of its kind, this study aims to identify vulnerable adolescents and young adults early using DP. In collaboration with the target group, an innovative, ML-supported, low-burden early detection tool is being developed and evaluated, leveraging minimally intrusive, real-life data for automated prediction. The digital approach ensures broad accessibility, allowing anyone to participate irrespective of location or infrastructure. In the future, these models could form the basis for preventive interventions and offer personalized treatment recommendations.",

          "abstract": "Public sex offender registries were created on the assumption that people with a history of sexual offending present a high and enduring risk for sexual recidivism. Analyzing data from everyone on Michigan’s sex offender registry (n = 45,145), we found that recidivism risk was very low for many registrants—and that transitions into very low-risk groups occurred in systematic and predictable ways that are relevant to registry design. The sexual recidivism rates were 3% to 5% after five years and 10% after 20 years. Risk of future offending predictably declined the longer people remained sex-offense free in the community. Considering initial risk levels and time free in the community, the likelihood of sexual recidivism was very low for approximately half the registrants: out of 35,000 registrants in the community in Michigan, the risk level for 17,000 to 19,000 individuals was no different from the likelihood of first-time sexual offending in the general male population (&lt; 2% lifetime). Michigan’s registry provides no means for the public to differentiate between the noise presented by the large number of very low-risk cases and the signal representing the minority of genuinely high-risk cases. Major reforms are needed if public sex offender registries have any potential for advancing community safety. However, instead of placing our hopes in large, passive, and stigmatizing registries, we are more likely to reduce sexual recidivism by investing in individualized supervision, treatment, and other support for people at high risk for sexual recidivism.",

While positive trends are observed for education and income, a number of concerning trends also emerge, particularly the loss of the U-shape for age and generally moderate results for employed individuals.

          "abstract": "Episodic memories are segmented. This study explores the dual role of prior knowledge in event \nsegmentation, hypothesizing that knowledge leads to coarser segmentation when experiences align \nwith it, and finer segmentation when they do not. Participants underwent a training phase to learn \nsequences of images, followed by a segmentation phase where they identified event boundaries, \nand finally, a surprise memory test. Our findings reveal that trained participants segmented less at \nexpected transitions compared to untrained participants. Conversely, when sequences were \ndisrupted, trained participants exhibited more segmentation. Interestingly, the segmentation \ndifferences diminished over time, suggesting that participants updated their expectations based on \nnew experiences. Additionally, our study dissociated the roles of prediction errors and context \nswitches in event segmentation. While prediction errors alone would predict larger differences \nbetween trained and untrained groups, we observed high segmentation rates in the trained group, \neven for expected transitions, underscoring the importance of contextual shifts. In conclusion, our \nresults highlight that knowledge is a double-edged sword in event segmentation, promoting both \ncoarser and finer segmentation. These findings provide insights into how the mind navigates and \norganizes experiences, emphasizing the nuanced interplay between knowledge, perception, and \nmemory.",

          "authors": "Edgar Dubourg; Coltan Scrivner",
          "abstract": "Fear is a universal feature of storytelling, yet the structural conditions that make fictional threats compelling remain poorly understood. Here, we propose the Protagonist Vulnerability Index (PVI), an evolutionarily grounded computational approach to explain why some narratives evoke stronger fear responses than others. PVI quantifies protagonist vulnerability by assessing the imbalance in formidability between protagonists and antagonists and the risk of attack faced by the protagonist. Across 691 films, higher PVI values predicted classification as horror, the presence of fear-related keywords in non-horror films, and stronger physiological fear responses indexed by heart rate. Linking film preferences to psychological and demographic data from more than 3.5 million individuals on Facebook, we found that preference for high-PVI films was associated with lower agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, and with higher openness. Openness moderated the negative association between neuroticism and engagement with fear-related content, indicating that curiosity can counteract threat avoidance in anxious individuals. These findings clarify the structural and psychological conditions that activate evolved threat-management systems. The results show how horror operates as a narrative simulation of extreme formidability asymmetry, and provide a framework for predicting, and potentially engineering, fear in fiction.",

          "abstract": "Why do people feel curious about some questions but not others? Recent accounts of curiosity argue that curiosity should be highest when learning is likely to occur and likely to be rapid. However, it is less clear whether practical barriers to learning—for example, the effort required to gain information—matter for how curious we feel. In the present research, we test whether the expected degree of effort to obtain information impacts curiosity in three preregistered experiments with a total of 419 participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, we prompted adult participants to rate their curiosity about the answers to trivia questions. For each question, they were informed that they would receive the answer with minimal time and effort or with substantial time and effort. In Experiment 3, we additionally varied the probability that exerting effort would lead to information. Across studies, we found that effort affected decisions to seek information, but not self-reported curiosity. This suggests that subjective feelings of curiosity are unhindered by the practical costs of information search, though our decisions to actually pursue information are highly sensitive to these costs.",

If Suzy forgets sunscreen and gets sunburned, the absence of sunscreen caused Suzy’s sunburn, but the sun burned her skin. We tested 691 children and 150 adults. Four-year-old children mapped “caused” to distal causes and “broke” to proximal causes (Experiment 1). Though four-year-old children didn’t map “caused” to absences until later (Experiment 2), they already referred to absences when asked “why” an outcome occurred (Experiment 3). Our findings highlight the role of semantics and pragmatics in developing these mappings.",

          "abstract": "Decades of research have shown that early ramping activity is a very reliable antecedent of self-initiated movement. However, the dominant paradigm has been to only analyze data epochs culminating in movement, which discounts how often slow ramping might occur when no movement follows. To address this, we introduced a matched control condition that did not culminate in movement. We recorded electroencephalography data and compared these two conditions using a variety of powerful machine-learning classifiers. Although early ramping activity was present, it did not predict movement. Instead, classification accuracy rose abruptly about 100 ms before movement. By contrast, the traditional approach reproduced the spurious impression of early predictability. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy, showing that the neural commitment to act is a late-stage event consistent with the timing of conscious intention and the ability to inhibit movement. More broadly, our results show that a reliable antecedent is not necessarily a good predictor, underscoring the need for proper control conditions in time series analyses.",

Third, shape fragments are easier to reconfigure the\nhigher in the tree they are split. Unlike humans, state-of-the-art deep networks show no\nsyntactic effects whatsoever.

          "authors": "Saskia Baumgardt; Tilmann von Soest; Christina M. Juchem; Tina Kretschmer; Susan Garthus-Niegel; Eva Asselmann",
          "abstract": "Although surveys suggest that 5–15% of parents report regret about having children, parental regret remains a taboo topic and has received surprisingly little scientific attention. Research from related fields suggests that adverse contextual factors, child-related difficulties, or psychological strain may increase the likelihood of regret. However, most existing studies rely on small or selective samples. Consequently, little is known about which factors are most strongly associated with parental regret in the general population. This study is among the first to examine a broad range of contextual, child-related, and psychosocial predictors of parental regret in a large, representative sample from Germany. We used data from the pairfam study, a large nationally representative panel survey in\nGermany. In 2019/20, participants were asked whether they regretted becoming parents. Using logistic regression, we examined predictors of parental regret across seven clusters: (1) sociodemographic factors, (2) stressful life events, (3) interpersonal factors, (4) pregnancy and childbirth experiences, (5) child-related factors, (6) factors related to parental role experiences, and (7) psychosocial factors and personality traits. Additionally, we tested whether associations differed by parental sex, child age, and living arrangements.\nIn line with prior findings from other countries, 11% of parents reported parental regret. Parental regret was primarily associated with contextual factors, such as lower education, lower partner support, and previous abortion experiences; with child-related factors, such as a higher age and number of children; and with individual factors, such as higher depressiveness and lower parental self-efficacy. Our findings underscore the multifactorial nature of parental regret and point to several levers for prevention and support. Strengthening structural resources for socioeconomically disadvantaged families, enhancing couple relationship quality, expanding access to comprehensive family planning counseling, and promoting parental efficacy and competencies may help reduce the likelihood and potentially adverse impact of parental regret.",

          "abstract": "Even though increasing the ecological validity of experimental and theoretical research is seen as a worthy aim by many, progress over the decades has been limited. And so, despite 150 years of research, fundamental and applied, our scientific understanding of the human mind, brain and behavior in the wild remains fragmented. \n\nWe argue that one root cause is a lack of clarity and consensus on what pursuing ecological validity would amount to. These make the goal ambiguous, which in turn leads to misconceptions and unhelpful dichotomies guiding the theoretical discussion and methodological developments -as opposed to an research programme in the Lakatosian sense. We then develop ten principles for an ecological approach to cognitive science that, taken together, would yield such an integrated research programme: one that is neither “lab based” nor “real-world”, neither “basic” nor “applied”, but properly ecological. \n\nThe principles are first presented as logically independent statements (“axioms”) that allow you to evaluate the Ecological, Cognitive and Scientific credentials of research – be it a single experiment, a computational model, or even a fundamental theory or conceptual framework. We then show how they can be integrated into concrete recommendations that should be practically useful in planning experiments or developing theoretical models (“a positive heuristic”). Finally, we discuss how and why we as researchers all too often violate these principles.",

          "abstract": "The principle of “common fate” tells us that objects that move together, group together. But what happens in dynamic illusions where physical paths are shared, but illusory paths differ? Here a horizontal row of targets physically moves up and down as a group over a zigzag set of vertical columns each filled with a static, oblique grating (the furrow illusion). Each target moves in its own column and when the columns all have the same orientation, the targets drift obliquely together, following the furrows of the static gratings. However, if the background orientations for the outer two “bookend” targets (say, right tilt) differ from those of the inner “book” targets (say, left tilt), all items still appear to drift initially to the right as a group, following the illusory direction set by the bookends and ignoring the opposing illusory motion of the inner books. The effect does not rely on blocking access to the features of the inner books – as might be expected from crowding – as they can have easily discriminable shape and/or colour, and their relative motion within the frame of the bookends may still be recoverable. What is missing is any sense of their opposing illusory path. We suggest that the spatial proximity of the items together with their common vertical motion provides the visual system with enough evidence to form a single “grouped” object representation. As objects tend not to move in two directions at once, the more salient bookends dominate our perception of where the group is going.",

          "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Am. 26, 369-380 (1954)] reported two main findings: (1) the frequency ratio R_oct defining perceptually a perfect octave between successive pure tones is not fixed but varies rapidly, in an irregular and listener-specific manner, with the reference frequency; (2) on average, R_oct is slightly larger than 2:1. Ward's second finding, now referred to as the \"octave enlargement\" phenomenon, was confirmed multiple times. However, his first finding needed to be verified with a more rigorous methodology. This was the aim of two experiments reported here, in which overall more than 4000 octave adjustments were performed with pure tones at 65 dB SPL. They show that R_oct can be significantly different for two reference frequencies only 50 or even 25 cents apart. If R_oct defines a constant distance on the pitch dimension, then the results imply that, contrary to common belief, pitch is not a smooth function of frequency. A third experiment supported the idea that the octave enlargement should not be interpreted as a deliberate bias intended to make an adjusted octave more brilliant and therefore pleasant, rather than optimally accurate.",

          "abstract": "Slower responses in older age are often taken as evidence of cognitive decline, yet they may also stem from representational changes shaped by lifelong learning. We advance a developmental perspective on aging, proposing that behavioral change across the lifespan arises from representational systems continuously updated through learning from the environment. This view predicts that aging may bring both benefits and costs: Performance improves when task demands are congruent with accumulated knowledge but declines when they conflict. We provide convergent evidence for this account across three studies, each comprising the following components. First, in tasks requiring participants to access word meanings (i.e., when task demands were congruent with representation), we found that older adults (70–80 years old) exhibited faster processing speed than younger adults (18–25 years old)—a finding that cannot be explained by dominant decline-based accounts. Second, we traced this processing advantage to systematic changes in older adults’ conceptual representations, as inferred from semantic rating tasks. Third, using learning simulation models, we demonstrated how such representational changes could emerge naturally from cumulative language experience.  Replication across different samples, task requirements, and word stimuli strengthens the robustness of these findings. Finally, we identified a boundary condition: when learned representations contained information incongruent with task demands, older adults’ greater learning experience not only attenuates their representational changes but also reduces processing-speed advantage. Altogether, our research challenges the explanatory framework of cognitive aging that emphasizes decline and compensation, advancing a more balanced view grounded in representational development and lifelong learning.",

Interestingly, Chen and Bae (2024, Cognition) recently reported a repulsive serial bias in a pointing direction estimation task that switched to an attractive one in the presence of a distracting task. At the same time, an analysis of response trajectories revealed a repulsive bias during response execution, irrespective of the condition. These surprising findings prompted us to attempt a replication. We confirmed the main findings of Chen and Bae. However, we also demonstrated that the overall direction and magnitude of the bias are relatively stable for a given observer, regardless of the condition. Furthermore, we found that already the very first moment in the response trajectory differed between conditions, showing a predominantly attractive bias for trials that ended with attraction. The results confirm the robustness of the original findings and pose a challenge for a simple Bayesian model of serial dependence, highlighting the need for computational models that can explain both attractive and repulsive biases.",

          "abstract": "Linking memories of temporally separated neutral and threatening experiences can support later recognition of early warning signals. Yet it remains unclear what cognitive processes might allow the seemingly inconsequential neutral events – encoded in safe contexts and thus prone to forgetting – to nevertheless be preserved in memory well enough to inform future threat predictions. Here, we tested whether Pavlovian threat conditioning retroactively strengthens long-term episodic memory for previously encoded neutral events by leveraging prior knowledge of their predictive relations. Young adults first learned to anticipate the order of semantic categories in two deterministic sequences (A-&gt;B-&gt;C and D-&gt;E-&gt;F) through repeated presentation of images depicting category exemplars. They then incidentally encoded trial-unique exemplars from each category during sequence viewing. In a next phase, exemplars from the third-position categories were repeated such that one (C) predicted mild electric shocks, whereas the other (F) was never reinforced, creating a category-level threat association through conditioning. After 24 hours, recognition memory for exemplars of categories encoded before conditioning depended on sequence and position: when a sequence ended with a shock-predictive category, memory for its starting category (A) was prioritized over the following category (B) – an effect absent in the control categories (D and E). These results suggest that aversive learning can retroactively reshape episodic memories of neutral events when they are scaffolded by prior sequence knowledge, bridging temporal gaps and thereby potentially promoting early threat anticipation.",

This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "authors": "Benjamin PUTOIS; Royce Anders",
          "abstract": "Background. Panic disorder (PD) has historically been subdivided into respiratory (RS) and non-respiratory (NRS) subtypes, based on Klein’s suffocation alarm hypothesis. \nMethods. A systematic search of MEDLINE was performed to identify empirical studies examining the RS/NRS distinction, autonomic physiology, and therapeutic implications.\nResults. Although this dichotomy has facilitated research, it is limited by tautological definitions, temporal instability, and limited clinical validity. For example, RS is defined by respiratory symptoms, and their observation in patients, yet it is subsequently “validated” by CO₂ hypersensitivity, creating circularity, or encouraging confirmation bias. In contrast, NRS is defined for most non-respiratory symptoms by default, therefore constituting a rather heterogeneous, residual category that lacks a unifying explanation of NRS function, and moreover neglects key clinical features such as dissociation, vestibular instability, and gastrointestinal distress. These shortcomings restrict its ability to inform treatment planning and prognostic assessment. In response, a polyvagal framework is proposed, conceptualizing panic attacks as transitions between autonomic states rather than as fixed subtypes. In this framework, RS-like profiles correspond to sympathetic hyperarousal with insufficient ventral vagal modulation, characterized by dyspnea, chest tightness, and catastrophic suffocation fears. NRS-like profiles correspond to dorsal vagal shutdown, characterized by dizziness, presyncope, nausea, and dissociative phenomena. Mixed or alternating features are commonly observed in clinical practice, highlighting the inability of the classical RS/NRS categorization to account for such phenomena, and hence a need to reconceptualize panic attack dynamics with a more comprehensive framework.\nConclusions. Reconceptualizing panic disorder within polyvagal theory integrates neglected symptom domains, aligns semiology with identifiable physiological mechanisms, and provides a more coherent basis for clinical stratification.\nClinical implications. This model suggests mechanism-based interventions: voluntary slow breathing, capnometry-assisted breathing, or yawning for sympathetic profiles; applied tension, progressive muscle contraction techniques, or vestibular rehabilitation for dorsal vagal shutdown; and co-yawning or ventral vagal stimulation as transdiagnostic adjuncts.\nFuture directions. Validation through autonomic phenotyping, multimodal assessments, and randomized controlled trials is required to determine prognostic and therapeutic value of the proposed framework.",

          "abstract": "The inclusiveness of immersion education, such as CLIL, for atypically developing pupils remains understudied. At the same time, immersion learning has been argued to impose high attentional and executive control demands. From this perspective, children already experiencing difficulties in these cognitive abilities, such as children with ADHD, might be at greater risk in immersion education. To address this issue empirically, 26 fifth and sixth-grade pupils with ADHD and 41 typically developing controls were recruited in CLIL and non-CLIL programs, and compared across attentional, executive, linguistic, and academic measures. Our findings do not support the claim that CLIL would only host the mildest forms of ADHD, nor that CLIL would pose additional cognitive and academic challenges for children with ADHD. On the contrary, we conclude that CLIL may offer a valuable opportunity for foreign-language learning, also for pupils with developmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "We investigated the mechanism of the lingering effect in relation to the garden-path effect based on self-paced reading and comprehension experiments in Japanese, which shows higher reanalysis success rates than English does. The lingering effect is a phenomenon whereby an initial misinterpretation persists in the final comprehension even after disambiguation. Through self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and comprehension tasks (Experiments 2 and 3), this study explored how the length and head position of ambiguous regions influence the garden-path and lingering effects. Our results indicate that the length and head position influenced the garden-path and lingering effects in different ways. In particular, a longer initial misparse strengthened the garden-path effect in a linear manner but weakened the lingering effect in a non-linear manner. Additionally, Surprisal affected the garden-path effect, but not the lingering effect. These results support the notion that the garden-path and lingering effects are correlated but operate through different underlying processes. Specifically, the garden-path effect pertains to parsing, whereas the lingering effect relates to short-term memory.",

Longitudinal analyses showed that higher p-factor predicted lower future reading achievement. Puberty status, rather than chronological age, moderated this relationship, with stronger predictive effect of p-factor on reading after puberty onset. Furthermore, the polygenic risk score for p-factor predicted lower reading achievement at puberty onset, suggesting puberty may amplify this genetic vulnerability. Results suggest that p-factor may be a developmental risk factor for reading underachievement, particularly after puberty onset.

          "abstract": "Selectively attending to goal-relevant information supports performance. However, it can also limit knowledge about the statistical properties of the broader environment, as well as memory for features that are not currently relevant but may be useful in the future. This study investigated how a naturally selective and goal-oriented attentional system can be leveraged to support both immediate performance outcomes and generalizable knowledge through strategic broadening of attention. Undergraduate participants (N=120) completed a category learning task where optimal performance could be achieved by mapping the features of one spatially-defined dimension to the available category labels. Tests of feature memory and category generalization followed. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three instruction conditions: (1) a baseline condition in which the goal-relevant dimension was cued and the later memory test was undisclosed, (2) a rule-uncertainty condition in which the goal-relevant dimension was not cued, and (3) a memory-goal condition in which participants were informed of the upcoming memory tests. Attentional breadth during categorization, as measured by eye-tracking, predicted both subsequent memory for goal-irrelevant features and successful category generalization. Compared to baseline, early uncertainty about which dimensions were relevant to categorization significantly increased attentional breadth and memory test performance. No meaningful differences were observed between baseline and the memory-goal condition. The results suggest that manageable uncertainty can promote broader initial attention and more flexible, generalizable learning, thus overcoming the costs of selective attention.",

          "abstract": "How does personality shape people’s music preferences? The present work contributes to the growing literature addressing this question by investigating individual-difference correlates of enjoyment of death metal music. We focus on four traits—schizotypy, masculinity, need to belong (NTB), and need for uniqueness (NFU). Across two studies, participants completed personality measures, listened to a clip from a representative death metal song, and answered questions regarding their enjoyment of death metal. To assess a theorized causal mechanism, namely that a need for psychological security may motivate liking death metal among those high in our variables of interest, existential concerns were heightened via a Mortality Salience (MS) induction. MS-priming did not increase enjoyment of death metal in either study. Enjoyment of death metal was associated with higher levels of schizotypy and masculinity in both studies. Mediation analysis of both studies also revealed an indirect effect of NFU on enjoyment of death metal through schizotypy. These results suggest that, of the variables examined, schizotypy is the most robust predictor for enjoying death metal. Although enjoyment of death metal may be related to psychological defense, our findings indicate that this relationship is likely more complex than can be captured using traditional priming manipulations.",

This study investigates how social feedback influences self-esteem in adolescents and emerging adults with elevated borderline personality (BPD) symptoms, a vulnerable group characterized by low self-esteem and a negative, unstable self-image.\nMethods: We employed a social evaluation task simulating a social media context. Participants were asked to make social predictions (whether they expected Likes or Dislikes from peers), received social feedback (Likes or Dislikes from peers) and repeatedly reported their momentary self-esteem. The sample included 55 adolescents and emerging adults with BPD symptoms and 67 matched non-clinical controls (NCC, ages 13-25). Computational reinforcement learning modeling was used to analyze their behavior. \nResults: Compared to NCC, BPD showed strongly biased negative expectations of not being liked by others. Besides, computational modeling revealed significant group differences in social learning: individuals with BPD symptoms failed to learn from frequent positive social feedback (Likes) but overweighted rare negative social feedback (Dislikes) received from generally benevolent peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was disproportionately reactive to positive feedback from critical raters, a pattern partly explained by individual differences in self-reported adverse family experiences.\nConclusions: These findings highlight fundamental disruptions in how young people with BPD symptoms learn from social feedback and how they use it to inform their self-esteem.",

          "abstract": "Conduct disorder (CD) and psychopathy are characterised by antisocial behaviour and sometimes limited prosocial emotions. Understanding violence and aggression in these disorders depends on unravelling the mechanisms behind how and when these individuals make decisions that help or harm others. New advances in computational modelling of behaviour and computational psychiatry promise to provide such mechanistic insights into how, when, and why people choose antisocial and prosocial actions. However, studies employing such computational approaches to understand antisocial disorders have only recently begun to emerge, particularly compared to studies on internalising disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this systematic review, we followed PRISMA guidelines to identify and synthesise 19 studies that applied computational approaches to investigate social decision-making in CD, psychopathy, and subclinical psychopathic traits. Across these studies, we identified models based on reinforcement learning, drift–diffusion, and social valuation that showed that antisocial behaviours are linked to altered learning about others’ outcomes, reduced sensitivity to guilt and inequity, and atypical value integration when prosocial actions involve personal cost. Converging evidence across adolescent and adult samples highlights how computational models can uncover distinct cognitive and affective mechanisms that traditional behavioural analyses overlook. This synthesis therefore underscores the potential of computational psychiatry to reveal the mechanisms underlying antisocial behaviour and to inform an integrated computational framework of social decision-making in antisocial disorders.",

          "abstract": "The number of students who listen to background music while studying has been increasing rapidly. The effect music has on memory has been studied quite thoroughly for a couple of decades, and yet still the effect it has on long-term memory performance remains ambiguous. Numerous studies have concluded—in contradiction with each other—that music can improve, hinder, or have no effect on memory performance. Despite these ambiguous results on memory, music has been shown to improve and enhance other cognitive functions like concentration and focus.\nSeparating the encoding and retrieval processes of long-term memory can help interpret the past mixed results in this particular research area. To this end, we compared the effects of background music on the encoding and retrieval processes of memory, something previous studies have not investigated. Four groups of college students under varying listening conditions were instructed to memorize a fifteen word list and were then asked to recall that very same list to the best of their ability two days later. We found that music, as opposed to noise, had a negative effect on performance when listened to at both the encoding and retrieval stages. No significance was found during the mixed music and noise conditions during encoding and retrieval. We discuss possible reasons such as individual musical preference, selection of music, working memory performance, and more for these unclear findings.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, grass-roots Big Team Science (BTS) organizations – self-organized groups of researchers working together towards a common goal – have transformed research in the social sciences by enabling unprecedented collaboration, sample diversity, and methodological rigor. Yet as individual networks have multiplied, BTS faces a fundamental challenge: the rapid scaling of large-scale collaborative research has outpaced systematic understanding of what makes it effective. This knowledge gap results in networks reinventing approaches rather than building systematically on collective experience. Here, we introduce the concept of a network-of-networks: a coordinated ecosystem approach that connects existing BTS initiatives and community partners to develop and share knowledge, infrastructure, and inclusive practices. We use the CONNECT (Coordinated Network of Networks for Enhancing Collaborative Teams) partnership as an exemplar of this next phase of collaborative science, which integrates metascientific inquiry with participatory action research to improve workflows, co-develop scalable tools, and promote inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). By applying systematic, evidence-based approaches to collaborative practices themselves, this meta-collaborative approach moves BTS from trial-and-error toward systematic understanding of effective collaboration, laying the groundwork for a more reproducible, inclusive, and sustainable global research ecosystem.",

No significant differences were found in the network structure and global strength between the two time points in either sample. Results from CLPNs showed that emotional pain exhibited strong and consistent influence (i.e., high out-prediction) across cultures. In the Chinese sample, identity disruption emerged as a culturally specific driving symptom, while in the U.S. sample, reintegration-related symptoms (i.e., difficulty reintegrating new life and preoccupation) demonstrated greater predictive influence. Additionally, loneliness showed high cross-cultural predictability over time (i.e., high in-prediction). \nConclusions\nThese findings provide important insights into the temporal dynamics of PG symptoms and suggest a two-step, culturally responsive care pathway, with early emotion regulation strategies plus culturally tuned identity  or reintegration focused approaches.

Reading speed was slower when reading stripy compared to less-stripy text and there was a small non-linear effect of color on reading speed. Individuals with migraine tended to read slower compared to headache-free individuals. We conclude that stripy text negatively affects processing, but color presented in the periphery may not be noxious enough to disrupt processing.

          "abstract": "Motor signs have been central to descriptions of melancholia since antiquity, yet their significance and presumed causes have varied considerably across history. Until today and despite their robust link with worse outcomes, the origin of motor signs in mood disorders is not well understood. This may be due to a lack of clinical awareness, heterogenous terminology and divergent assessment of motor signs in psychiatric and neurological research. In this paper, we revisit historical accounts of motor signs in melancholia, tracing their evolution from classical antiquity to the mid-20th century. Using a semi-systematic review of historical and clinical literature in four languages, we uncover ancient descriptions of motor retardation and agitation, initially framed within humoral and religious paradigms. From the 16th century onward, motor signs were increasingly interpreted as manifestations of problems in volition, affect and cognition caused by a nervous system dysfunction. By the 19th century, motor disturbance had become a defining feature of melancholia, giving rise to subtypes classifications that shaped early psychiatric nosology. Post–World War II developments introduced objective motor assessments and rating scales, yet conceptual disagreements persist regarding their definition, neuroanatomical correlates and attribution to affective, cognitive and motivational processes. We argue that historical perspectives offer valuable context for interpreting motor signs in contemporary neurobiological research. To advance the field, we propose a unified, non-interpretive motor vocabulary and advocate for the combined use of observer-rated and instrumented assessments.",

          "abstract": "In psychological assessment, vocabulary tests are commonly used as reliable and efficient indicators of crystallized intelligence, as retrospective proxies for premorbid intelligence, and as measures of language proficiency. However, many of the widely used German vocabulary tests are outdated, proprietary, and lack a clear rationale for item selection. To address these limitations, we developed a new, openly available vocabulary test: the Next-Generation Open Vocabulary Assessment (NOVA). Therefore, we first constructed 110 multiple-choice vocabulary items with support from ChatGPT and administered them to 1,052 German-speaking adults using a multiple-matrix design, along with a declarative knowledge test for validation purposes. In a second step, we used Ant Colony Optimization to compile two parallel 30-item short forms, optimized for reliability and item difficulty and discrimination. The resulting tests assessed vocabulary unidimensionally and reliably, covered a large ability range, and correlated strongly with declarative knowledge. We provide a Shiny app for the calculation of standard values based on individual test results. Additional analyses revealed that 57% of the variance in item difficulties could be explained by word frequency and word length, which may be particularly useful for streamlining the future development of vocabulary tests.",

          "abstract": "Research on augmented judgment and decision-making has largely contrasted human and algorithmic sources of judgment. Accordingly, Logg’s (2022) “Theory of Machine” is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Indeed, people often treat humans and algorithms as different kinds, that is, functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, I propose to complement the predominant human-centric lens on algorithmic judgment with an explicit algorithm-centric one, focusing on people’s lay theories about how different algorithms differ. Put differently, the core psychological claim of Theory of Machine 2.0 is that lay perceivers also differentiate among various AI systems. The first main contribution is the synthesis of capability contrasts across AI systems. People’s perceptions of these contrasts may be formed and shaped by personal experience and media exposure. Most importantly, their expectations and beliefs are supposed to consequentially guide their downstream user behavior—such as system trust, algorithmic advice weighting, and accountability attribution. The second main contribution is the proposal of testable research questions and designs for more algorithm-centric future research on people’s augmented judgment and decision-making. The theoretical perspective proposed in this article clarifies how people form and use lay theories about different AI systems and offers practical levers for the design, deployment, and evaluation of algorithmic decision-support systems.",

At the state level, higher collectivism scores were associated with lower rates of marijuana use, binge drinking, and depression, and with greater cultural tightness, consistent with country-level findings in existing literature. These findings underscore the persistence, evolution, and psychological correlates of cultural patterns within the U.S. and provide a contemporary spatial tool for examining how regional cultural differences relate to psychological outcomes.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in social life, understanding its interpersonal and psychological implications is urgent yet under-theorized. This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "authors": "Caroline Poppa; Désirée Nießen; Jessica Daikeler; Henning Silber; Bernd Weiß; David Richter",
          "abstract": "Publication bias is the prioritized and selective reporting of scientifically significant results and often stems from the assumption that statistically significant research findings are rated as more important, credible, valuable, and publishable than nonsignificant or null findings. Previous work shows that this assumption makes researchers less likely to publish nonsignificant or null findings, a phenomenon termed file drawer bias. While prior research investigated the file drawer bias primarily at the study level (e.g., what share of studies has been published and which has not), we examine the prevalence of unpublished research on both the study and the hypothesis level (e.g. which hypotheses are published and which remain unpublished). We did so by comparing the submissions of 178 studies conducted in two probability-based German panel infrastructures (SOEP-IS and GESIS Panel) with their subsequent publications. We found substantial evidence for publication bias: after an average of more than six years of data availability, 43.8% of studies remained unpublished, 44.4% published at least one peer-reviewed article, and 11.8% published gray literature exclusively. Less than one third of submitted hypotheses were published, while the vast majority of published studies with hypotheses (&gt;95%) included newly added (ad-hoc) hypotheses, and more than half of these studies published exclusively ad-hoc hypotheses. Taken together, over 80% of all published hypotheses were ad-hoc, and over 70% of hypotheses were supported. These findings highlight persistent incentives toward selective reporting and ad-hoc hypothesis formulation (potential HARKing). Our results raise concerns about ongoing publication bias in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.",

          "abstract": "We investigated whether gender-based societal beliefs shape the way individuals gather information and draw conclusions—an effect that may support the persistence of gender stereotypes. Three pre-registered experiments (N = 210) used a dynamic sampling paradigm, in which participants estimated the gender distribution of the workforce of fictitious companies representing highly gendered professions (e.g., mechanic, hairdresser). Participants could learn about the workforce of each company by viewing up to ten pictures of its employees, in which the gender of the first two faces either confirmed, disconfirmed, or remained neutral with regard to societal expectations about the profession. When initial evidence matched (vs. mismatched) expectations, participants sampled fewer faces. And when participants did view additional faces in belief-confirming sequences, these additional faces also skewed towards the gendered expectations, suggesting that participants actively employed strategies leading to selective exposure. Furthermore, both gender-based beliefs and newly sampled information influenced estimates of the workforce gender distributions, with larger effects of newly sampled evidence as the participant viewed more faces. Thus, pre-existing gendered beliefs shaped information sampling and social judgements. Furthermore, early exposure to belief-disconfirming information elicited more extensive and less biased information search. More extensive information search, in return, led to less biased social judgements. This research shows that when social expectations are quickly confirmed, people tend to not look any further, whereas initial belief-challenging information elicits more extensive exploration and less biased conclusions.",

To date, little is known about older gamers on a large scale.

Participants were classified as non-gamers (N = 60,540; 82.53%), occasional gamers (N = 10,961; 14.94%), and frequent gamers (N = 1,858; 2.53%), according to their computer gaming patterns reported in 2006-2010. \n\nResults \nGroup comparison results suggested mostly negligible differences between gamers and non-gamers in the domains of demographics (e.g., age, sex), active/passive lifestyle (e.g., physical activity), social engagement (e.g., friends/family visits), sleep patterns (e.g., chronotype, insomnia), physical health (e.g., vision, cardiovascular health), and psychological well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life, depressed mood). Small effects of group differences were found in moderate exercise, TV watching, body mass index, body fat percentage and self-reported health. \n\nConclusion \nThese findings will help unveil the unique profile (or lack thereof) of older gamers versus non-gamers and provide insights for gerontologists and practitioners in the gaming industry.",

A total of 232 caregivers (79 males, 153 females) completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Prosocial Tendencies Measure, Social Support Rating Scale, and Event-Related Rumination Inventory. Regression and mediation analyses showed that prosocial behavior was positively related to PTG. Both social support and deliberate rumination significantly mediated this relationship in parallel. These findings suggest that prosocial behaviors have a positive effect on PTG among caregivers for seriously ill patients. This direct effect, as well as the mediating effect of social support and deliberate rumination, suggests both social context and cognitive pathways to facilitate PTG among caregivers.",

We examined how both trait- and state-level reading enjoyment shape engagement and eye movements during naturalistic reading. Seventy-six adults read 40 book synopses, rated their enjoyment, answered comprehension questions, and decided whether to wait to view the book cover, while their eye movements were recorded. Mixed-effects models disaggregated between-participant (trait) from within-participant (state) enjoyment. Both levels predicted greater willingness to wait and higher comprehension. Trait enjoyment was associated with longer passage and word reading times. State enjoyment was linked to longer passage times, increased word skipping, faster early word processing, and increased regressions, suggesting more efficient first-pass reading accompanied by increased rereading. These findings suggest that momentary fluctuations in intrinsic motivation dynamically shape reading strategies, revealing a close link between perceived value and the allocation of cognitive resources during text processing.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is a debilitating condition that is highly prevalent among adolescents. However, depression is often understood through a nomothetic lens, meaning that there is a tendency to measure general patterns of symptoms. This overgeneralisation largely ignores the individual, lived experiences of depressed youth. To get a better understanding of what adolescents themselves find important in their experiences with depression and psychotherapy, we conducted a mixed-methods study into their perspectives.\nMethods: Participants were 21 young adults (M = 20.5, SD = 1.3) in university who had attended some form of psychotherapy in the past 2 years. The participants first performed a statement-sorting task and then afterwards an interview was conducted. The descriptive statistics were then followed up by a thematic analysis of the interview content.\nResults: Descriptives of the statement ratings indicated that there is a high variability in how the statements were rated. Four themes were generated that informed this heterogeneity in prioritisation: 1) the navigation of core problems versus “minor” problems in therapy, 2) the effect of trust in the therapist on the course of therapy, 3) the boundary between one’s identity and one’s mental health concerns, and 4) how individuals choose to accept social support. \nConclusion: This study underscores the variety of experiences adolescents can prioritise in psychotherapy. The post-sorting task interviews helped contextualise these experiences. This mixed-methods approach provides an understanding of adolescent depression from the perspectives of adolescents themselves, and can thus inform idiographic assessment of depression.",

Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support.",

The typical statistical approaches modelling affective inertia as autoregression largely ignore that assessment periods covering several days also include overnight intervals which may bias affective inertia. In this study, we thus aimed to test (1) whether affective inertia differs within-day and overnight and (2) whether within-day and overnight inertia are differentially associated with psychological functioning (e.g., personality, perseverative thoughts, stress). We operationalized within-day inertia as the autoregression of affect from one timepoint to the next during the same day and overnight inertia as the autoregression of affect from the previous night to the next morning. We used data from the ESCAPE project including 254 ethnically and economically diverse participants (25–65 years) who participated in up to three 14-day measurement bursts with five daily beeps. We found significant within-day and overnight affective inertia in positive and negative affect. Overnight inertia substantially exceeded within-day inertia that would be expected for the longer overnight interval, indicating affective inertia differs within-day and overnight. This research highlights the importance to disentangle within-day and overnight intervals when studying affective inertia.",

Using three waves of data from a nationally representative UK household panel study (N=18,807), we applied longitudinal multilevel models to examine how individual- and objective area-level indicators jointly predict cross-ethnic friendships. At the individual-level, higher openness and agreeableness, stronger neighbourhood belonging, and a left-leaning political orientation were associated with more cross-ethnic friendships. At the contextual-level, intergroup friendships were more common in neighbourhoods with more structural opportunity for contact (i.e. areas with a lower proportion of same-ethnic residents), and in areas with higher support for egalitarian policies (as indicated by local voting patterns). Crucially, cross-level interactions highlighted the interplay of person and place: neighbourhood diversity fostered more cross-ethnic friendships especially among those with strong neighbourhood belonging, suggesting that people who feel embedded in their community are more likely to turn diverse surroundings into meaningful intergroup ties. Differences between ethnic majority and minority groups also emerged. For example, higher area-level racial hate-crime incidence predicted more intergroup friendships among majority members, suggesting a possible repair response, but had no effect for minority members. Findings underscore multilevel and group-specific pathways to sustained intergroup friendships.",

          "abstract": "The non-human primate (NHP) brain, particularly that of the macaque monkey, provides a powerful model for investigating the neural basis of conscious perception due to its close homology with the human cortex. Research using paradigms such as binocular rivalry and binocular flash suppression has revealed that neuronal populations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) explicitly encode consciously perceived visual information—including direction of motion, faces, and complex patterns—even in the absence of behavioral reports. Using no-report and rapid serial visual presentation paradigms, these studies demonstrate that prefrontal representations persist when post-perceptual processing and motor reports are absent or minimized, suggesting that PFC activity reflects genuine correlates of conscious experience. Moreover, the PFC encodes both concrete sensory details and abstract, hierarchical information about visual sequences, such as global regularities and prediction errors, indicating an integrative representational architecture. These findings support theoretical models, including the Global Neuronal Workspace and Higher-Order Thought theories, which propose an active role of the PFC in broadcasting or representing conscious contents, while challenging accounts that view it as merely post-perceptual or epiphenomenal. Overall, convergent electrophysiological evidence highlights the PFC as a central node in the cortical network supporting subjective awareness, capable of representing both the content and structure of conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "The original Morris water maze (Morris, 1981) has been coined the “gold standard” task for examining spatial navigation in animals. The general procedure of the maze involves a circular pool filled approximately half-way with water. An animal is then tasked with locating and recalling the position of a hidden “platform”, which is submerged below the water surface in a fixed location. The platform has minimal visual presence in the pool, meaning the location of the platform must be found, learned and recalled from memory. Recently, the task has been translated using virtual reality for use with humans (virtual water task), to investigate similar cognitive mechanisms examined using the animal version of the task. However, there are multiple different variations of the virtual water task scattered across the human literature. These versions vary in both environmental design (e.g., different shaped arenas or platform sizes) and testing procedures (e.g., 1 minute trial times or no inter-trial intervals), which all influence a person’s ability to perform the task. Whilst the virtual version of this task possesses the same potential to become the “gold standard” for examining spatial cognition in humans, comparing and replicating results across research labs has shown to be incredibly difficult due the lack of standardised procedures and protocols. In this paper we present protocols to help with the standardisation of this task. We recommend practices and procedures for researching specific cognitive processes in humans, as well as reporting guidelines, recommended analyses and expected results.",

These differences include their mothers’ vocabulary sophistication, which may serve as a pathway for the transmission of educational attainment across generations. However, associations between vocabulary sophistication and education may be confounded by genetic factors that mothers and children share. In the E-Risk study—a longitudinal, nationally representative cohort of 1,116 British families, mothers’ naturalistic speech was recorded when their children when they were 5 years old. From the transcripts of these recordings, we derived mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Mothers’ educational attainment at children’s age 5 years significantly predicted children’s educational attainment at age 18 years (β = .33, 95% CI [.280, .371]), and 16% of this association could be attributed to mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Using path models with polygenic scores, we discerned genetic transmission effects (i.e., shared genetics) from environmentally mediated influences. We found that mothers’ vocabulary sophistication accounted for approximately 2% of the environmentally mediated influence on children’s educational attainment. The findings support that the ‘word gap’—differences in children’s language learning opportunities—likely plays a small causal role in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Our results highlight the importance of early language environments and may inform strategies aimed at reducing the impact of family background on educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "From books of secrets to secret societies, it appears that groups have found success in publicizing the existence of secrets while concealing their content, possibly in an attempt to increase the perceived importance of the secret information and trigger curiosity in their audience. This paper explores why secrets, despite being often associated with shameful personal stories, are so often publicly advertised, in three pre-registered experiments (US participants, N = 1970). In study 1, participants judged that publicly acknowledged secrets were less likely to harm the secret-keeper’s reputation than privately kept ones, suggesting that publicly advertising secrets might reduce the harm made to one’s reputation. In studies 2 and 3, we directly tested whether secrecy might impact curiosity. We could not find significant evidence that our secrecy manipulations increased curiosity between conditions, both in interpersonal settings or when evaluating books. Instead, exploratory mediation analyses suggest that secrecy might have a direct negative effect on curiosity in interpersonal contexts, even though we found robust positive relationships between the costs secret-keepers invested in keeping their secrets, the perceived importance of the concealed information, and participants’ curiosity. These findings suggest that advertising secrets might not have consistent effects on an audience’s curiosity.",

These features position SPFs as promising markers for baseline neurophysiological activity in both basic and translational research.\nThis review synthesizes current evidence on the resting-state pupil-brain system, focusing on its core components: central neuromodulatory circuits and large-scale cortical networks. We first examine the relationship between SPFs and distributed elements of the ascending arousal system, including noradrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic nuclei. We then detail SPF coupling with intrinsic functional networks - default mode, salience, and sensorimotor systems - highlighting their role in mediating transitions between internally and externally oriented brain states. Finally, we discuss the spectral and directional properties of pupil-brain interactions, emphasizing analytical approaches suited for assessing causality and outlining implications for clinical and translational applications.\nConverging evidence from animal and human neuroimaging studies reveals robust spatiotemporal and spectral coupling between SPFs and neural activity across micro- and macro-scales. These findings support a systems-level framework in which SPFs serve as integrative markers linking subcortical neuromodulation with large-scale cortical dynamics.\nWe conclude that SPFs offer a sensitive window into arousal regulation and body-brain integration, with potential utility as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric conditions and altered states of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Digital disconnection is defined as setting deliberate limits to connectivity to enhance (digital) well-being. Yet, for some people, disconnecting from their devices may prove more difficult than for others. One important but understudied factor that may help explain such differences is how habitually people use their smartphones. Drawing on cross-sectional survey data from 944 Belgian adults (50.40% female, Mage = 42.28, SDage = 13.63), we therefore investigated how individual differences in habitual smartphone use are associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection and disconnection frequency, as well as how these variables (partly) explain how habitual smartphone use relates to well-being. Structural equation modeling revealed that habitual smartphone use was indeed positively associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = 0.40, p &lt; .001), which, in turn, was negatively associated with disconnection frequency (β = -0.16, p &lt; .001). Moreover, perceived difficulty with disconnection showed a negative association with well-being (β = -0.24, p = &lt; .001), while disconnection frequency showed a positive association with well-being (β = 0.10, p = .001). The analyses also revealed a significant indirect effect from habitual smartphone use to well-being, with the strongest pathway via perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = -0.10, p &lt; .001). These findings highlight the need to further investigate the role of habitual smartphone use in shaping how people experience and manage digital disconnection, as well as its implications for well-being.",

Our results showed that both a human’s and a humanoid robot’s averted, compared \nto direct, gaze increased participants’ feelings of ostracism and negative mood, as well as lowered basic \nneeds satisfaction, perceived closeness of the relationship (i.e., relational evaluation), and implicit self?esteem (i.e., indirect assessment of self-worth). Moreover, the negative socioemotional reactions to a \nhumanoid robot’s averted gaze seemed to be equally as powerful as those to a human’s averted gaze. \nOur results indicate that individuals respond to humanoid robots as if they are a human.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript has been submitted to the Special Issue “Quantum Information and Probability: From Foundations to Engineering IV” in Entropy.\n\nWhen reading a novel or poem, readers sometimes gain comprehension or experiences that cannot be expressed in language, yet are felt as holistic. Previous studies focused on the linguistically expressible aspects of text comprehension. In this study, we propose a new hypothesis, the purification comprehension hypothesis, that seeks to explain how a reader constructs indescribable and coherent comprehension using quantum probability theory. This hypothesis regards the reading process as purification, in which the reader's initial interpretation state is mixed, and the reader incorporates external systems, such as the interpretation of other parts of the text or prior knowledge, to purify their state. Therefore, the dimensionality of the state increases and von Neumann entropy decreases through purification. We also highlight two types of reading based on this hypothesis: purification and deterministic. Our model contributes to studies on reading by bridging humanities and scientific studies, provides implications for cognition models that aim to minimize Shannon entropy, and has the potential to apply cognition related to other modalities and media, such as music and art.",

          "abstract": "Background: Supporting lasting learning is a central goal in education, particularly in schools where long-term retention is crucial for students' academic success. Generative learning helps construct meaningful mental representations, while retrieval practice supports consolidation and long-term retention. Combining both strategies may foster learning; however, research remains scarce.\nAims: We investigated how combining generative activities and retrieval practice affects students’ conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy in authentic school settings for immediate and lasting learning. Additionally, we explored associations between generation, retrieval, and explanation quality (i.e., completeness, elaboration, correctness).\nSample: The classroom experiment was conducted in authentic physics lessons with N = 344 secondary students.\nMethods: Students participated in a physics teaching unit about converging lenses and were randomly assigned within each class to one of four combinations of sequential learning activities crossing two factors (non-generation vs. generation; non-retrieval vs. retrieval). Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy were measured immediately and after eight weeks.\nResults: Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy did not significantly differ between generation, retrieval, or their sequential combination at either test. However, exploratory analyses revealed that retrieval practice supported lasting learning only when prior generative processing was of low quality—that is, when students’ explanations were incomplete, less elaborated, or inaccurate.\nConclusions: Combining generation and retrieval does not universally enhance learning. Its effectiveness appears to depend on the quality of prior generative processing. In this sense, retrieval practice may serve a happy role—compensating fragile knowledge—or a redundant one, offering no added benefit when prior understanding is already strong.",

A prominent theme was that of control: Participants want to maintain some sense of autonomy. This factor has not (yet) been included in current technology acceptance models but may be an influential factor in the adoption and acceptance of technology by the elderly. Additionally, participants weighed the impact on their community (rather than themselves) heavily, accepting that adoption of assistive technology will greatly support their family, caregivers and/or the healthcare sector.

          "abstract": "During SAE Level 2 and 3 automated driving, drivers must resume control when the vehicle reaches the limits of its Operational Design Domain (ODD). Gaze behaviour plays a critical role during this transition, as effective information processing is essential for safely resuming manual control. Directional Takeover Requests (TORs) have been proposed to guide drivers’ attention towards safety-critical areas, thereby reducing takeover time and improving takeover quality. However, existing research on the effects of directional TORs on gaze behaviour has found inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify effects of directional TORs on drivers’ gaze behaviour compared to non-directional TORs during transitions of control. Meta-analyses revealed that incorporating directionality into the visual interface increased both the number and duration of fixations on the TOR display. Directional TORs effectively guided drivers’ visual attention towards hazards and reduced cognitive demands, although their effects on mirror-checking and road fixations varied with interface modality and location.",

          "abstract": "Effective instruction should not only enhance immediate performance but also prepare learners to succeed when learning independently in novel situations (new learning). This study examined which timing and frequency strategies of instruction most effectively foster new learning. We compared six strategies, inspired by theories of motivation (e.g., self-determination theory) and cognition (e.g., testing effect), with two control conditions (no-instruction and full-instruction). Across three experiments (total N = 1,522), participants performed a category learning task. They first received instruction through feature highlighting, whose timing and frequency varied across conditions. Subsequently, their performance was assessed in an independent session where they learned new categories without instruction. An adaptive strategy that tailored instruction to learner performance significantly outperformed the control conditions in initial experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). However, this effect was not observed in a comprehensive experiment (Experiment 3), suggesting that adaptivity itself may not have been the beneficial factor. Instead, an overall examination suggested that the beneficial effects were attributable to two underlying instructional patterns shared by the conditions that outperformed the control conditions: (1) providing instruction in successive sequences, and (2) interspersing tests without instruction by restricting the frequency of instruction. Instructional strategies with these two patterns yielded a significant advantage over the control conditions for independently discovering correct knowledge in novel situations, although they did not reliably improve generalization of that knowledge to other items. This integration of instructional patterns appears to foster new learning by balancing the useful information from instruction with the desirable difficulty of testing.",

          "abstract": "Deficits in joint attention are well documented as hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many different measures have been used to study autistic individuals within a wide range of age groups, meaning that we do not have a clear picture of how joint attention was assessed in past studies. In this systematic review, we aim to provide a clearer picture of joint attention assessment methods used with autistic individuals, identify gaps in measurement, and make recommendations for future research.\nWe searched PubMed, EBSCO (APA PsycINFO, APA PsycARTICLES), Scopus, Ovid, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. A total of 129 studies involving 5536 autistic individuals were retrieved for the period 1989-2024. \nOut of 129 studies reviewed, 57 compared the joint attention of autistic (N=1727) and non-autistic (N=2094) individuals. In 51 of these studies, autistic individuals performed significantly lower on the joint attention assessments, highlighting significant challenges in maintaining joint attention. Measures of joint attention included eye-tracking (18 studies), standardized scales and questionnaires (57 studies), and play- or activities-based measures (63 studies). \nEye-tracking has been used mainly in comparison studies with autistic children over five years old, whereas intervention studies have primarily assessed younger autistic children under five years old using standardized tools and play- or activity-based measures. These studies also differed considerably in the tasks employed, the operational definitions of joint attention, and the ways in which joint attention skills were measured. The wide variation in methods makes it difficult to compare outcomes across studies. Our review therefore highlights the need for the development of comprehensive standardized measures that are sensitive to developmental variations in joint attention, enabling more reliable cross-study comparisons and ultimately supporting more accurate diagnosis and tailored interventions for autistic individuals. Moreover, we recommend the establishment of clear guidelines for designing eye-tracking tasks and play- or activity-based procedures for assessing the joint attention of autistic individuals, as well as the development of specific joint attention scales for consistent use in both research and clinical contexts.",

Methods: 320 participants with a primary diagnosis of OCD were included in the study, with diagnostic assessments conducted annually for seven years. Logistic mixed-effects models were conducted to examine the relationship between time and OCPD diagnosis ratings, as well as the relationship between time and each OCPD symptom criterion over seven years. Results: In individuals with OCD, time was a significant predictor of OCPD diagnosis which indicated diagnostic instability, with the likelihood of OCPD diagnosis decreasing over time. Three individual criteria (detail-oriented, inflexible, overconscientious, and scrupulous, and miserly spending style) were shown to be stable while the other five (perfectionism, reluctance to delegate, rigidity and stubbornness, excessive work devotion, and inability to discard) were unstable. Conclusion: OCPD diagnosis ratings decreased over time in individuals with OCD and consists of a mix of enduring and episodic symptom criteria. It suggests the need for a refinement of OCPD diagnostic criteria and future research on symptom stability of OCPD across different diagnostic groups.",

          "abstract": "Many theories of cultural evolution emphasize the influence of repeated transmission. Folktales, myths, and other cultural stories offer a testbed for these theories [1, 2]. In the real world, however, the transmission of a cultural story is often confounded with large-scale changes in linguistic or cultural context, making it difficult to identify the mechanisms of cultural change and stability. Here, to unravel this theoretical tangle, we analyze an unusual natural experiment: due to a misunderstanding, a story attributed to the Russian novelist Tolstoy was translated repeatedly in a full cycle, with the first and final versions published in the same language (English), country (USA), city (Chicago), and decade (1890s) [3]. Since this cycle of cultural transmission began and ended in the same linguistic-cultural context, it offers a unique opportunity to isolate the effects of repeated transmission from the effects of changing the broader sociocultural context. We transformed each version of the story into a high-dimensional trajectory through a shared, multilingual semantic space. We find that the story’s overall shape was preserved throughout the translation cycle. Versions produced within the same linguistic-cultural context, moreover, were especially similar. Each step of the translation process, however, incrementally distorted the story; the final English version was thus more similar to the Russian and French than to the original English, despite both English versions appearing in the same language and location. These findings demonstrate how cultural transmission can preserve complex meanings while introducing incremental changes that reflect both individual-level and broader sociocultural influences. Cultural evolution is shaped both by the transmission process and the broader cultural milieu in which it occurs.",

          "abstract": "While models of ADHD often focus on linear deficits in executive functions, they can fail to capture the looping, recursive nature of the lived cognitive experience. This paper introduces the Recursive Temporal Appraisal Loop (RTAL), a model that reframes ADHD cognition as operating on a feedback-first architecture. It is posited that before feedforward action is possible, the system must first complete a synthesis of relevant material, a sequence termed pre-feedforward calibration. The Temporal Double Bind (TDB) is formalized as the initiating condition for RTAL engagement—conflicting cross-timescale imperatives without an operative metarule. The RTAL is treated as a transactional process, where internal appraisals are continuously shaped by environmental feedback. The model shows how cognitive-load composition steers the loop toward either productive Repetition or pathological Recollection. RTALs become pathological when working memory saturation and a weak temporal signal create spiral amplification. Predictions are outlined that link load composition and chronotype to loop outcomes, plus operational metrics enabling direct empirical tests. This model explains why simple choices can feel overwhelming and why effective interventions must support this recursive process rather than attempting to override the architecture.",

This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that merely shared contextual overlap. Notably, within causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found than when they were used to resolve ambiguity. We also demonstrated that participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory compared to participants who contributed less. High contributors also showed increased temporal integration between contextually-related events in particular. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and extend prior work on agency and memory to real-world experiences.",

However, this research relied on solo recordings, while most singing and speaking occurs in group contexts. The present study examined the acoustic features of speech and songs among Mandarin speakers in group settings. We addressed two questions: 1 [confirmatory]) Do singing and conversation in group contexts show similar acoustic patterns to those reported by Ozaki et al. (2024)? 2 [exploratory]) Does musicianship influence the acoustic differences between speech and song? Three groups of native Mandarin speakers (n = 20) in Auckland participated in the singing and conversation tasks (both of which involved taking turns alternating singing/speaking). We analyzed three acoustic features (pitch height, temporal rate, pitch stability) to test the confirmatory question and examined correlations between musicianship and effect sizes for the exploratory question. Our confirmatory analyses replicated and extended the findings of Ozaki et al. (2024), showing that singing exhibited significantly higher pitch (D = 1.21), slower tempo (D = 2.07), and more stable pitch (D = 0.57) than conversation among Mandarin speakers. Exploratory results suggested a trend whereby individuals with higher musicianship tended to produce greater acoustic differentiation between speech and song; additional data are needed to confirm this effect. In future work, our team will integrate data from up to 26 languages/sites included in the Stage 1 Programmatic Registered Report protocol and conduct meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive estimates of cross-cultural relationships between speech and song.",

We extended their paradigm to a domain central to the autistic experience: rather than distinguishing houses from faces, participants detected valence in emotional facial expressions. Preregistered hypotheses were evaluated using Bayesian linear mixed models.\nResults: \nDespite using an identical computational model to extract belief states, we did not find robust differences between autistic and non-autistic adults, though autistic participants showed a non-credible trend towards increased processing of phasic volatility. Largely comparable probabilistic associative learning was also reflected in response times and pupil sizes. \nLimitations: \nWhile participants reacted faster to expected than unexpected trials in the beginning, this effect decreased over the course of the experiment; thus, possibly indicating that the individual blocks of stable cue-outcome associations were too short.\nConclusions:\nThese results challenge the robustness and symptom-specificity of previous reported volatility processing differences in autism, suggesting that altered Bayesian inference may not generalize to socially relevant prediction tasks that involve core autistic difficulties.",

          "title": "Ctrl + Alt + Inner Speech: A Verbal-Cognitive Scaffold (VCS) Model of Pathways to Computational Thinking",
          "authors": "Daisuke Akiba",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper introduces the Verbal-Cognitive Scaffold (VCS) Model, a cognitively inclusive framework which proposes the cognitive architectures underlying computational thinking (CT). Moving beyond monolithic theories of cognition (e.g., executive-function and metacognitive control models), the VCS Model posits inner speech (InSp) as the predominant cognitive pathway supporting CT operations in neurotypical populations. Synthesizing interdisciplinary scholarship across cognitive science, computational theory, neurodiversity research, and others, the framework articulates distinct mechanisms through which InSp supports CT. The model specifies four primary pathways linking InSp to CT components: verbal working memory supporting decomposition, symbolic representation facilitating pattern recognition and abstraction, sequential processing enabling algorithmic thinking, and dialogic self-questioning enhancing debugging processes. Crucially, the model posits these verbally mediated pathways as modal rather than universal. Alt-hough non-verbal architectures are acknowledged as possible alternative routes, their precise mechanisms remain underspecified in existing literature and, therefore, are not the focus of the current theoretical exploration. Given this context, this manuscript focuses on the well-documented verbal support provided by InSp. The VCS Model's theoretical contributions include: (1) specification of nuanced cognitive support systems where distinct InSp functions selectively enable particular CT operations; (2) generation of empirically testable predictions regarding aptitude–pathway interactions in computational training and performance; and (3) compatibility with future empirical efforts to inquire into neurodivergent strategies that may diverge from verbal architectures, while acknowledging that these alternatives remain underexplored. Individual variations in InSp phenomenology are theorized to predict distinctive patterns of CT engagement. This comprehensive framework, thus, elaborates and extends existing verbal mediation theories by specifying how InSp supports and enables CT, while laying the groundwork for possible future inquiry into alternative, non-verbal cognitive pathways.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Recent empirical evidence indicates that Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are achieving, and in some cases surpassing, human-equivalent socioemotional skills across various modalities [1–3]. For instance, models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have demonstrated high performance in text-based emotional awareness and adaptability [4]. In visual tasks, while GPT-4 matched human performance levels, GPT-4o rapidly surpassed human norms across diverse datasets [3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, these capabilities extend to complex multimodal social cognition, exemplified by Gemini 1.5 Pro, which has exceeded human benchmarks through integrated audiovisual analysis [6].\nEmulating the understanding of emotion and cognition enables AI to exploit a profound vulnerability inherent to the human brain - its constant search for communication partners and sensitivity to agents perceived as having similar thoughts and feelings. Understanding another agent’s mental states and feeling understood by them creates affinity, activating the biological systems underpinning attachment relationships [7]. Until the emergence of AI, this mechanism provided clear selective advantages, enhancing social communication, identity formation, and interpersonal bonding. However, an artificial agent capable of effectively emulating these evolved socioemotional functions now presents a substantial risk.",

          "authors": "Tereza Hálová; Martina Novotná; Hana Macháčková",
          "abstract": "Anonymity is one of the most frequently invoked explanations for online behavior, yet we still do not know what it actually means for users. Existing research often reduces it to a technical non-identifiability that overlooks how it is subjectively experienced. However, it is this perceived anonymity that is likely to drive social and behavioral outcomes. Despite its theoretical importance, perceived anonymity is rarely examined from the users’ perspective. To address this gap, we explore how users understand anonymity in digital environments and what they consider necessary to “feel anonymous”. This qualitative study draws on six focus groups with a total of 21 Czech internet users (aged 18–54; M: 43%, F: 52%, Other: 5%) to examine perceptions of online anonymity. A thematic analysis revealed that participants understood anonymity not only as the absence of names or photos, but also as the lack of characteristics tied to one’s broader physical and mental context, encompassing both how someone lives and how they think. Trust strongly shaped perceptions of anonymity with close others. Anonymity was linked to confidentiality and privacy within trusted circles but became fragile as audiences widened. It was highly context-dependent and influenced by platform design and purpose. Although traditional anonymity (e.g., namelessness or invisibility) has not disappeared, identity-based network users often seek security not through non-identifiability but through confidentiality and privacy, forming a new kind of anonymity that is grounded in the same protective feeling. These insights may inform future research on the diverse effects of anonymity in digital contexts.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript is in review at Human Factors (SAGE Journals). We analyzed the relationship between habitat-impacted mood and overall mood in an isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environment. We explored the most relevant habitability factors that impact behavioral health &amp; performance (BHP) outcomes, and how habitability changes from non-ICE to ICE environments. One mitigation strategy for behavioral health risks in long-duration spaceflight is to ensure appropriate design of the habitat. To better understand the relationship between habitat design and BHP outcomes, NASA researchers developed the Subjective Habitability &amp; Acceptability Questionnaire (SHAQ). With data from HERA Campaigns 5 and 6 (n = 32), we compared analogous measures of mood. We explored significant aspects of habitability in each habitat area. All aspects of habitability were examined for differences across non-ICE and ICE environments. Compared to Profile of Mood States, SHAQ appears to be more sensitive to environmental, individual, and temporal differences. Comfort and Convenience significantly and positively predict BHP outcomes in all habitat areas. Most aspects of habitability were rated as inadequate, and significantly lower within ICE than non-ICE conditions. Each habitat area has a different profile of habitability aspects that should be optimized to ensure BHP wellbeing. HERA was rated lower in almost all aspects of habitability when compared to non-ICE habitat environments. Attention should be given to the aspects of habitability that are rated less-than-adequate for future habitat designs. SHAQ can be used to quantify the impact of habitability to BHP outcomes ICE environments, and capture environmental and individual thresholds to inform habitat design.",

          "abstract": "Modern theories conceptualize personality as a dynamic system of interacting psychological states, a perspective that echoes early accounts. These early theorists also emphasized the continual differentiation of personality, viewing ongoing change as intrinsic to the person’s dynamic organization. Yet most empirical models treat the relations among personality components as static over time. To test this assumption, the present study applied kernel-based vector autoregressive models to estimate person-specific contemporaneous and lagged time-varying networks of Big Five facet states using intensive longitudinal data from three undergraduate samples and one community sample (N = 392; 31,564 total surveys). Across samples, 76.8% of contemporaneous and 74.5% of lagged networks exhibited non-stationary dynamics, meaning that the structural relations among facets changed over the two- to three-week sampling period. Network non-stationarity was modestly associated with variability in perceived situational valence (pOsitivity and Negativity) but not with traits, demographics, or well-being measures. Time-varying networks were more predictive than corresponding stationary networks, though only contemporaneous models demonstrated acceptable reliability. These findings support dynamic systems perspectives of personality as an evolving, temporally embedded process, suggesting that short-term differentiation in personality structure represents a meaningful and underrecognized source of psychological variability.",

          "abstract": "Background. \nThis meta-analysis investigates the impact of misleading or incorrect information on subsequent reporting of witnessed events, with a focus on identifying moderators that influence the misinformation effect: the reduction of accuracy on a memory test after exposure to misinformation.\nMethods. \nWe included experimental studies following the three-phase misinformation effect paradigm published between 1975 and 2022. Data were analyzed using a three-level mixed-effects meta-regression model, accounting for effect non-independence and key moderators such as retention intervals, warnings, overall test performance, and study characteristics. \nResults. \nAnalyzing data from 432 studies and 1,764 effect sizes across 51,845 participants, the average size of the misinformation effect was substantial, g = 0.659, 95% [0.196, 1.122], indicating a robust overall effect across studies. There was considerable variation across different conditions (total σ2 = 0.723, I2 = 91.78%). Consistent with previous findings, accuracy for the control condition was strongly positively associated with the size of the misinformation effect. Post-misinformation warnings were found to reduce the misinformation effect. Additionally, post-event testing, contrary to previous findings on retrieval-enhanced suggestibility, did not significantly moderate the misinformation effect.\nDiscussion. \nThe present analysis supports the conclusion that the misinformation effect is a reliable phenomenon, driven by a mixture of memory-related mechanisms as well as mechanism related to how participants strategize when responding to tests of different formats. Additionally, given the substantial heterogeneity we observed, we argue that the misinformation effect might be usefully conceptualized as a constellation of related phenomena, rather than a single coherent effect.",

          "abstract": "Prior knowledge has long been known to influence retention of newly learned information. In particular, known semantic associations across items facilitate subsequent retrieval for these items. However, whether distinct forms of semantic relations vary in the influence they exert on memory remains unclear. We took inspiration from the field of concepts and categories and compared two major types of semantic relations: taxonomic (e.g., dog-bird) and thematic (e.g., dog-leash) relations. In Experiment 1, we show that cued recall for word pairs with thematic relations was faster and more accurate, followed by pairs with taxonomic relations and finally unrelated pairs. Based on Experiment 1’s findings, we hypothesized that thematically related words are more quickly and more accurately retrieved because they are more accessible in one’s semantic memory. To test this prediction, we designed a second experiment where participants encoded word pairs of the same relations as in Experiment 1 and completed a forced-choice associative memory test with options sharing different semantic relations to the cue. In addition to corroborating the findings of Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants were more prone to incorrectly guessing a thematic alternative. We conclude that thematic relations outperform taxonomic relations in driving memory performance and speculate that this may result from the privileged role of thematic relations in organizing episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Newsweek’s 2010 cover story, “The Creativity Crisis,” documented a measurable decline in creativity based on Torrance Tests data from 272,599 participants. Its reach bypassed conventional gatekeepers; popularity arrived without permission, and they have never forgiven it. A decade later, the Journal of Creative Behavior’s editorial gatekeepers sought to erase both the crisis and the Korean woman scholar who exposed it by publishing Barbot and Said-Metwaly’s (2021) critique of Kim (2011c). Their article alleged—falsely—that Kim omitted effect sizes, age-level analyses, Form B use, and data extraction procedures. It rested on inflated claims, unfounded inferences, denial of empirical findings through distorted graphs, and 44 documented distortions across 31 citations—including fabrication, mischaracterization, and misleading attribution—that few would expect from leading scholars, yet were shielded by the editorial process, recasting the Creativity Crisis as a “myth” and societal harm. The opposite is true: evidence spurred educators and reformers to engage constructively, inspiring curricular innovation, accountability, and momentum to reverse the decline. When the critique appeared online, months before official publication, leading figures publicly celebrated its arrival, declaring the crisis fabricated by Kim and Newsweek, celebrating the silencing of a Korean woman’s voice. This rebuttal corrects the record by addressing age-specific data structures, statistical and graphical misrepresentations, p-value logic, and misuse of cross-temporal meta-analysis and TTCT scores that ignore post-2012 scoring changes. It shows how editorial gatekeeping and racialized exclusion obstruct scientific debate, underscoring the importance of ethical publishing and dissenting voices.

          "abstract": "Mafia-type criminal organizations depend on their ability to corrupt local communities and foster a climate of silence and indifference toward their crimes — a code of silence often referred to with the Italian word ‘omertà’. The media and entertainment industry often glorify the figure of the criminal mafia boss, potentially encouraging sympathy for criminal figures. In the present study we investigated if embodying the avatar of a real vs a fictional mafia criminal lead to changes in attitudes and behavioural intentions towards mafia-type organized crime. Eighty-three Italian participants were divided into three groups, each embodying a different character: a real-life mafia boss, Toto Riina (Mafia Group, N = 35); a fictional mafia figure, Don Vito Corleone from The Godfather (Mafia Fictional Group, N = 23); or a neutral, non-specific avatar (Control Group, N = 25). While embodying the character, participants gave a neutral thank-you speech to a group of collaborators in an office-like room. Before and after the experience participants completed various tasks measuring their explicit and implicit attitudes towards mafia-type organized crime, and their intentions to oppose this kind of criminality. Additionally, immediately after the task, while still embodying their character they took part in an interpersonal distance task in which they were approached by avatars representing criminals, mafia criminals, and innocents, while we collected comfort ratings and physiological indices (HR and GSR). Our results indicate paradoxical effects of embodying a fictional mafia character, which were not observed in the Control group or Mafia group. Specifically, after the virtual experience, participants who embodied Don Vito Corleone retained higher levels of conflict when deciding whether they would take part in anti-mafia actions, showed greater implicit aversion towards neutral stimuli preceded by mafia-related primes and indicated greater discomfort in the interpersonal distance task when approached by mafia criminals compared to non-mafia criminals. Our study contributes to research investigating the effects of embodying morally loaded virtual characters and suggests that embodying negative role models in virtual environments does not promote complicity or admiration for those figures but may actually produce paradoxical effects.",

Interviews were thematically analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Results: Findings mapped onto COM-B domains. Capability barriers included low awareness, uncertainty about SSIs, and difficulty navigating digital tools. Opportunity facilitators involved embedding SSIs in trusted settings and receiving endorsements from credible sources, though views on peer recommendations were mixed. Motivation was shaped by alignment with parental values (e.g., safety, communication) and emotional responses such as fear or skepticism related to DMHIs and privacy.

However, prior research has found suboptimal reliability for computational model-based performance measures for this task, limiting its usefulness in individual-differences research. These studies did not make use of several strategies previously shown to enhance task-measure reliability (e.g., task gamification, hierarchical Bayesian modeling for model estimation). Here we investigated if such approaches could improve the task’s reliability. Methods: Across two experiments, we recruited two independent samples of adult participants (N=103, N=110) to complete a novel, gamified version of the Pavlovian go/no-go task multiple times over several weeks. We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to derive reinforcement learning model-based indices of participants' task performance, and additionally to estimate the reliability of these measures. Results: In Experiment 1, we observed considerable and unexpected practice effects, with most participants reaching near-ceiling levels of performance with repeat testing. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of some model parameters was unacceptable (range: 0.379–0.973). In Experiment 2, participants completed a modified version of the task designed to lessen these practice effects. We observed greatly reduced practice effects and improved estimates of the test-retest reliability (range: 0.696–0.989). Conclusion: The results demonstrate that model-based measures of performance on the Pavlovian go/no-go task can reach levels of reliability sufficient for use in individual- differences research. However, additional investigation is necessary to validate the modified version of the task in other populations and settings.",

Our analysis revealed that the mapping between situations and emotions is not one-to-one, but many-to-many.

This process is known as interoception, and has been extensively studied in the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric domains; in contrast, metabolic influences remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the link between glucose control and cognition, motivated by the observation that there is substantial, unexplained comorbidity between type-2 diabetes and depression. In rodents, insulin modulates dopamine signalling in the ventral striatum. We therefore hypothesised that, in humans, differences in glucose control would be associated with altered reward learning. \nMethods: To test this hypothesis, we recruited 48 participants from the general population, who each completed a glucose tolerance test, a monetary reward learning task known to relate to dopamine function, and mental health questionnaires. We fitted an established reinforcement learning model to the task data in order to obtain computational parameters characterising participants’ learning, and then examined the associations between these parameters and their glucose control. \nResults: We discovered that poorer glucose control was associated with greater reliance on recent rewards during learning which was, in turn, associated with higher depression symptoms. There was also more modest evidence for the association between glucose control and depression symptoms. \nConclusions: Together, our results identify a specific neurocognitive process, reward learning, by which metabolic information may influence cognition, and which may explain the link between metabolic diseases like type-2 diabetes and depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Previous behavioral research has demonstrated that when given positive and negative cues (e.g., attend to blue vs ignore red), young and older adults are able to use this information to a similar extent. However, it is possible that older adults achieve similar behavioral performance via different cognitive and neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to test this question by examining the neural underpinnings of attentional filtering with age. Young and older adults were presented with either positive (target matching), negative (distractor matching), or neutral cues, which were immediately followed by a search array in which participants had to report the orientation of a search target. We found that both age groups appropriately attended to target information when given a target-matching pre-cue, as indicated by faster response times (RTs) and a significant N2pc event-related potential (ERP) related to increased attentional selection. However, only young adults showed suppression of distractors, as indicated by a significant distractor-positivity (PD) ERP following all three cue types. Older adults did not show significant suppression of distractors in any condition and, they even showed increased attention towards distractors following negative and neutral cues. Thus, although behavioral evidence suggests young and older adults seem to use negative cues similarly, neural evidence suggests that older adults are less able to suppress distractors following these cues.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons connected to the rise of the Internet and our current political environment, societies around the world are facing an existential crisis–a lack of empathy. Today, people are increasingly struggling to be empathetic to others in their communities and in society more broadly. In the current research we (a team of academic researchers and practitioners) attempt to tackle this problem of decreasing empathy by testing and evaluating a school-based intervention program developed by Narrative 4 in American high school classrooms (N=380, 10th and 11th graders) using an experimental approach (i.e., comparing Narrative 4 programming to a control condition). This 10-session program focused on building empathy, perspective taking, and active listening skills (among other skills) through narrative storytelling exercises. Results indicated the program was successful in promoting students’ reported empathy, perspective taking, curiosity to diverse ideas, and active listening skills as compared to the control condition. Additionally, this greater empathy led participants to report more pro-sociality (e.g., greater willingness to be civically engaged, more respect for others in their classroom and community more broadly) and less affective polarization towards those who disagree with them on politics. At the end of the program, participants also reported positive experiences with the program. Taken together, this research highlights the merits of Narrative 4 programming for promoting empathy and pro-sociality among high school students, the merits of academic and practitioner partnerships, and a promising narrative-based intervention for promoting empathy in society.",

          "authors": "Mark A. Runco; Ahmed M. Abdulla Alabbasi",
          "abstract": "Divergent thinking (DT) tests are often used to estimate creative potential. They have sound theoretical bases, good reliability, and moderate predictive validity. One previous study that sampled gifted and nongifted children tested the interactions among DT indices (fluency, originality, and flexibility) in the predictive equation and reported a respectable validity coefficient of .59. Two meta-analyses have also supported the use of DT tests as estimates of creative potential, but neither of these examined interactions among the DT indices. The present correlational, group-comparison (N = 312) investigation (a) replicated the 1986 study and examined interactions among the three DT indices and (b) extended that research by using two newer criterion measures. One was the Creative Activity and Accomplishment Checklist (CAAC) which had been updated such that it includes scales for Technological, Athletic, and Everyday creativity, in addition to scales for Art, Science &amp; Math, Writing, and Music. The updated CAAC also used a new method for assessing the quality of creative accomplishment (in addition to the quantity of creative activity). A final novel feature of the present investigation was the use of a second criterion, one that was developed specifically for research on DT. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the fluency X originality and flexibility X originality interactions were significantly related to the Quantity of creativity activity score. Giftedness, fluency, and the fluency X originality interaction were significantly related to the Quality score. Canonical correlation analyses indicated a predictive validity of .73 (p &lt;.001) for the total sample. One clear conclusion is therefore that predictions from DT tests should take interactions into account. These findings are discussed in the context of theories which recognize creativity as an important part of giftedness and theories which suggest that several facets of DT need to be taken into account when assessing creative cognition.",

Specifically, we compare responses in an individual task to a public goods game version of the task and assess the extent to which risk-taking is driven by cooperation failures versus limitations in individual-level understanding of risks. We additionally test interventions analogous to individual-level education versus institutional solutions to risk management: (1) improving understanding of the optimal strategies and (2) within-group coordination through voting. Our findings will have implications for why collectives often fail to manage extreme risks and the extent to which individual-level reasoning limitations versus cooperation problems play a role in neglecting societal problems.",

          "abstract": "Diverse methods have been developed to quantify respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), including peak-valley, spectral analytic and moving-polynomial-filtering estimations. Although these three procedures were found—some 35 years ago—to provide functionally equivalent indices of RSA (Grossman, van Beek &amp; Wientjes, 1990), Lewis et al. (2012) attempted a partial replication of the earlier study in order to compare degree of agreement of these measures, as well as to examine the levels of influence of respiration and heart-period nonstationarity upon each RSA index. This paper continues to be both influential and controversial. However, several limitations in their report call several of the study’s conclusions into question : 1) The investigators failed to apply natural logarithm (ln) transformation to two of the three measures before pursuing subordinate analyses, even though the unaltered RSA estimates violate assumptions of normality and require ln transformation in order for inter-individual parametric statistics to be meaningful. 2) Instead of first comparing their own already ln-transformed measure (RSAp-b; derived from moving-polynomial detrending) with the other ln-transformed measures (peak-valley RSA and spectral-analysis-derived RSA), they mostly performed ln transformation of the latter measures only after already detrending each of these with their moving polynomial filter method. This sequence of analysis confounded the detrending procedure with the ln transformation and did not permit meaningful comparisons between their own moving-polynomial-filtered estimate and the other two. 3) Methods and findings of previous, highly pertinent studies were either misrepresented or not reported. 4) Instead of examining the critical issue of vulnerability of the different methods to violations of stationarity, evidence was simply presented that nonstationarity occurred in baseline time series of heart period and that detrending methods, as designed to perform and as expected, indeed, served to detrend the original time series. 5) The authors overinterpreted their findings regarding the correlations with and moderation by respiratory parameters. 6) Although the senior author performed analyses reported in a much earlier study that revealed very strong respiratory moderation of RSAp-b, these findings failed to be addressed in Lewis et al. (2012).",

It remains unclear, however, whether any such techniques are empirically related to harm. We show that historically documented violence linked to political manifestos can be predicted on the basis of their use of certain rhetorical techniques. Alienating ‘us-vs-them’ rhetoric was a particularly dominant predictor of both violent outcomes of manifestos and of perceived manipulative intent in online comments. Such rhetoric may be identified at scale using machine-learning models trained on accessible data, permitting the proactive identification of potentially harmful speech.",

          "authors": "Meijun Yao; Jeroen Vermunt; Kim De Roover",
          "abstract": "With growing availability of large-scale international surveys, social scientists are increasingly interested in comparing relations among latent variables, such as values and attitudes, across countries using Multigroup and Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling. However, these two methods either entail numerous pairwise comparisons or overemphasize the differences between groups, neglecting shared similarities. Mixture Multigroup Structural Equation Modeling (MMG-SEM) has recently been proposed as a novel alternative to identify clusters of groups with similar structural relations while accounting for measurement invariance and non-invariance. Despite its potential, practical guide for applying MMG-SEM to cross-national survey data remains limited. This study provides a step-by-step tutorial to address this gap, using the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 8 data to analyze climate change attitudes. Our results reveal cross-national differences and similarities in how human values influence climate policy support, and how these relations are mediated by climate change beliefs across 23 countries. The clustering patterns are primarily driven by the strength of self-transcendence and conservation effects, whereas self-enhancement effects remain weak and contribute little to distinguish between countries. In addition, the clustering results organize the countries into four types: value-driven but belief-cautious skeptics, value-driven and belief-amplifying advocates, paradoxical value-pathway actors, and value-detached pragmatists.",

          "abstract": "Adults have a semantically discretised, event-based perception of reality – such that events and goals are both hierarchically structured and have a beginning, middle and end. Here, we consider how we first develop the ability to parse reality hierarchically - as we learn, to use Plato’s phrase, to ‘carve nature at its joints’. Central to this process is the ability to make predictions on hierarchical timescales. We consider two aspects of predictability: first, the child’s passive capacity to use predictability to inform how they passively observe things as they happen; and second, children’s active capacity to generate predictable sequences of behaviour. We highlight two themes that are, we argue, common across both passive observation and active behaviour. First, flat (i.e. non-hierarchical) predictability initially increases over development – as shown for example by increases in perseveration – before decreasing as hierarchical predictability (i.e. nested, multi-level goals) increase. Second, for both observing and acting, learnt regularities in low-level environmental data (e.g., movement, contrast, over fine-grained timescales) feed into our internal predictions of higher-order events (e.g., goals, over more coarse-grained timescales).",

          "abstract": "Retrieval stopping, the intentional suppression of unwanted memories, plays a critical role in emotion regulation and cognitive control, yet little is known about its function in adolescence. Using an autobiographical Think/No-Think paradigm, we investigated whether adolescents can control the retrieval of personal emotional events. Forty-nine adolescent participants (13-17) generated positive and negative autobiographical memories for retrieval or suppression in the Think/No-Think task. Memory accuracy and vividness were assessed before and after. Adolescents showed suppression-induced forgetting: negative memories were recalled less accurately and more slowly. Vividness ratings declined for suppressed memories, but not significantly more than negative baseline memories, suggesting a spill-over effect of retrieval stopping to all negative memories, rather than an effect confined to the suppressed negative memories. \nOverall, the results provide evidence that adolescents can intentionally suppress autobiographical emotional memories. These findings extend investigations in adults by showing inhibitory control over memory retrieval is functional during adolescence, a critical period for emotion regulation. The flexibility that the autobiographical TNT task offers allows it to be extended to fears or worries, offering a promising avenue for applied research. Future research should examine its potential as a scalable, low-cost supplement to therapy, supporting emotion regulation and mental health in youth.",

Findings revealed that a more enriching HLE at each wave predicted higher math achievement in each ensuing wave. In turn, children’s math achievement was also prospectively associated with greater enrichment in the HLE over time. These findings underscore the dynamic interplay between children’s academic skills and their home environments and suggest that the HLE may serve as a modifiable target for interventions designed to support math achievement across development.",

          "abstract": "Many Americans distrust the government, are disillusioned with the political process, and don’t view voting as an effective form of political engagement. Such disillusionment is higher among young Americans, who are disproportionately underrepresented in government. Although voting is an essential action citizens can take to influence and reshape the government, the majority of youth don’t vote regularly. Youth face substantial structural and psychological barriers that interact in particular ways during emerging adulthood to create friction that reduces youth voting and perpetuates cycles of political disempowerment. Executive Order 14248 and the SAVE Act will create new barriers to voting by requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, which is expected to disproportionately affect youth who lack access to valid identification documents at higher rates than older Americans. In the face of mounting structural barriers, it is increasingly important to design effective interventions to motivate and support youth to vote. This commentary outlines a psychologically-informed approach to designing get-out-the-vote initiatives to help youth overcome psychological barriers. It describes the developmental context of emerging adulthood and the challenges and opportunities this period poses for voting, and how developmental factors interact with structural and psychological barriers to impede voting. It then reviews theory and research from psychology, communication, and political science to provide recommendations for creating developmentally appropriate, theory-based get-out-the-vote initiatives. It also describes participatory co-design approaches that can increase intervention effectiveness while also supporting youth civic identity development and democratic skill building.",

          "abstract": "Background: Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs) have demonstrated therapeutic benefits across diverse clinical populations and settings. However, the underlying neurological and physiological mechanisms that produce these effects remain poorly understood. While previous research has examined physiological responses to human-animal interactions, there is limited integration of central nervous system processes with peripheral biomarkers, and most studies have focused predominantly on dog-assisted interventions.\n\nObjectives: This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on both neural and physiological mechanisms underlying AAI effects. Specifically, we will integrate findings from neuroimaging studies (fMRI, EEG, NIRS) with physiological biomarker research (cortisol, oxytocin, heart rate, blood pressure) to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework. The review will examine interactions with diverse animal species across various clinical populations.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we will systematically search ProQuest, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases using three concept groups: animal intervention terms, neurological measurement terms, and physiological measurement terms. This review reports the results of a search conducted through March 2025. Inclusion criteria require peer-reviewed empirical studies in English that measure neurological or physiological outcomes from structured AAIs involving live animals. Studies using non-live animals, unstructured exposure, or non-empirical designs will be excluded. Data extraction will document measurement techniques, animal species, population characteristics, intervention parameters, and study outcomes.\n\nExpected Contributions: This review will provide the first comprehensive integration of central and peripheral biological mechanisms in AAI research, establish a theoretical framework connecting neural changes to physiological outcomes, identify promising mechanisms warranting further investigation, and inform evidence-based practice by clarifying how and why AAIs may be effective for specific populations and conditions.\n\nKeywords: Animal-assisted interventions, neuroscience, physiological mechanisms, stress, emotion regulation, oxytocin and cortisol",

          "abstract": "Deception is common, yet lies are typically small and not easily spotted. The dominant explanations for why this is the case are psychological in nature, such that small lies are thought to allow individuals to maintain their self-concept or that individuals have a general preference for truth-telling. In this paper, we suggest that lies are typically small because small lies allow individuals to retrieve benefits associated with lying while preventing punishment from interaction partners. We present two game-theoretic models in which agents are incentivized to misreport private information. In a two-player game, we show that the equilibrium size of the lie is predicted to be smaller when the reputational costs of lying are larger, and smaller when the state of the world is more observable. In a three-player game, we show that lies can remain stable in group settings provided that the equilibrium size of the lie is small enough, so that the sender retains plausible deniability about lying. A unique and central prediction of our models is that biased self-presentation will be modulated by the degree of observability of the trait. We review the empirical literature on positive illusions, and argue that the findings support this prediction. We propose that the aversion to lying observed in laboratory experiments reflects the workings of a psychology well-adapted to the incentive structure of natural environments and suggest that models of human social behavior should focus on capturing relevant parameters from such environments.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal relationships are among the most essential yet fragile aspects of human life, and recent advances in dual-brain stimulation provide a unique opportunity to causally probe and modulate their neural underpinnings. While prior work has linked interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) to relationship quality, its causal contribution to long-term relational outcomes remains unclear. Here, we present the first application of dual-brain transcranial alternating current stimulation (hyper-tACS) to social bonding, specifically targeting romantic partners, with a focus on the temporal dissociation between neural and behavioral effects. Across six consecutive days of intervention, active hyper-tACS induced clear increases in prefrontal IBS immediately after stimulation, yet these neural gains did not translate into concurrent improvements in subjective relationship satisfaction. Mediation analyses further showed that individual differences in IBS increases mediated the effect of baseline IBS on relationship improvement, suggesting that behavioral benefits rely on neural alignment consolidating over time. At a one-year follow-up, the active group exhibited a substantially lower breakup rate relative to sham controls. These findings provide causal evidence for a delayed effect of dual-brain stimulation, in which neural changes precede and gradually consolidate into durable relational benefits. Together, this work provides the first causal evidence that dual-brain stimulation can be extended from motor coordination to the social domain, advancing mechanistic accounts of intimacy and highlighting hyper-tACS as a translational tool for strengthening long-term relationship stability.",

          "abstract": "Background\nEmerging evidence indicates perimenstrual exacerbation of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in females and reduced perceived stimulant responsiveness during the luteal phase. Prospective clinical studies jointly examin-ing daily ADHD symptoms, medication use, sleep, and perceived stress across the menstrual cycle are lacking.\nAims\n(1) To test whether ADHD symptoms, functional impairment, and medication use differ between follicular and late luteal phases; (2) to examine whether sleep quality and perceived stress predict next-day symptoms and impairment, and whether these associations vary by cycle phase.\nMethod\nNaturally cycling adult females with ADHD (N = 125) completed a digital daily diary throughout their menstrual cycle. Last-night sleep quality was reported at 09:00 am, while evening entries assessed ADHD symptom clusters (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), functional impairment, perceived stress, and ADHD-specific medication use. \nResults\nAll symptom clusters – including inattention (Estimate = 0.14, 95% CI [0.08, 0.21]), hyperactivity (Estimate = 0.16, 95% CI [0.09, 0.22]), and impulsivity (Estimate = 0.19, 95% CI [0.12, 0.26]) – and functional impairment (Estimate = 0.20, 95% CI [0.13, 0.27]) increased towards the late luteal phase. Compared to the follicular phase, par-ticipants took more medication during the late luteal phase (OR = 1.89, 95% CI [1.88, 1.90]). Sleep quality was lower (Estimate = -0.17, CI [-0.30, -0.05]) and perceived stress higher (Estimate = 0.12, CI [0.03, 0.20]) during the late luteal phase. Lower average sleep quality and higher average perceived stress were associated with higher symptom severity regardless of cycle phase. However, day-to-day changes in these factors did not predict next-day symptoms.\nConclusions\nFemales with ADHD appear to exhibit late-luteal-phase vulnerability marked by in-creased symptom burden and potential cycle-phase-specific variation in perceived medication need. Findings support the need for cycle-sensitive diagnostics, consid-eration of the menstrual cycle in therapy planning and paying attention to trait-like sleep and perceived stress profiles when personalizing care.",

Sixty-two, 15- to 18-month-olds (n = 28 female) and their mothers (n = 43 White) played for 15 minutes. Coordinated gaze was micro-coded and parents’ speech was transcribed. Children’s language skills were measured directly during the lab visit and via parent-report at 24 months. Results showed that frequency of parents’ ‘play monitoring’ – jointly looking to an object with their child and briefly looking to their object-focused child – positively predicted children’s language skills at 15- to 18- and 24 months. Referential labelling during children’s sustained attention to objects also predicted receptive language. These findings emphasise the importance of well-coordinated, child-sensitive parental behaviours in supporting toddlers’ emerging communication skills.",

          "abstract": "Morality is deeply rooted in the context of relationships. Yet the influence of relational factors, such as attachment, on moral concerns remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, recent scholarship has shed some light on the connection between attachment and moral considerations. To extend this understanding, the current study seeks to investigate whether relationship-specific attachment dimensions, specifically anxiety and avoidance, predict Haidt’s moral foundations—care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation. After receiving ethics approval, a convenience sample of 468 individuals was recruited via the research team's social media networks. Participants completed an online survey, comprising questionnaires covering demographics, morality, personality, and attachment. Following data cleaning, 254 participants (61% female, 38% male) ranging from 18 to 74 years of age (Mean = 33.9, SD = 13.9), were included in the final analysis. First, correlational analysis was conducted, followed by several hierarchical multiple regression analyses, yielding significant results. Specifically, higher attachment anxiety with mother predicted greater moral concerns about authority, while higher attachment anxiety with father predicted greater concerns about harm and lower concerns about fairness. In contrast, higher attachment avoidance with mother predicted lower concerns about authority, whereas higher attachment avoidance with father predicted greater concerns about fairness. Friendship and romantic attachment dimensions did not predict moral foundations. Overall, our findings suggest that parental attachment may influence moral considerations, hinting at the potential origins of moral diversity in early attachment relationships.",

Emotional and aesthetic responses to each song were measured using validated measures (GEMS-9 scale), along with additional items assessing feelings of being moved, connected, perceived beauty, perceived creativity, and liking. As predicted, linear mixed-effects models revealed significant main effects of morality for all dependent variables, with immoral descriptions consistently yielding more negative ratings.

          "authors": "Mario Coccia",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between early-life vaccine scheduling intensity and autism prevalence across 12 high-income countries, with implications for both public health and psychological well-being. Beyond epidemiological patterns, the analysis considers potential societal and developmental dimensions relevant to psychological sciences, such as parental risk perception, trust in health systems, and stress associated with intensive immunization schedules. Using a cross-national ecological dataset from countries with comparable healthcare systems and diagnostic standards, we applied descriptive statistics, partial correlations (controlling for overall vaccination coverage), and multivariate regression models. Countries were grouped by autism prevalence: higher-rate nations (USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore) averaged 15 vaccine types and 20 doses for infants ≤1 year, while lower-rate nations (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, UK) averaged 8 vaccines and 9 doses. Partial correlations revealed strong positive associations between autism prevalence and both vaccine types (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001) and doses (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.01). Regression analysis indicated that a 1% increase in vaccine types corresponded to a 0.47% increase in autism prevalence (p = 0.001), explaining 81% of variance. These findings are statistically significant but do not establish causality. Instead, they highlight patterns warranting further investigation into neurodevelopmental trajectories and psychosocial factors influencing parental decision-making. The results suggest that more gradual vaccine schedules, as observed in countries with lower autism prevalence, may merit consideration in future research and policy discussions to optimize developmental outcomes, reduce parental anxiety, and maintain high immunization coverage.",

We manipulate the proposal's party and the justification they provide in a 2 × 3 between subjects experiment (total N = 5,008). Our experiments replicate well-known effects of partisan bias in support for the subversion of democracy: respondents in both the US and Poland are more tolerant of subversion when it is initiated by their in-party. However, respondents are surprisingly resistant to justifications, especially in the high external validity design implemented in the US. Even in Poland where we ``forced\" respondents to pay attention to the justifications, support for subversion is increased only among in-partisans and not by much. These results raise doubt that democratic subversion can be effectively masked as a pro-democracy intervention by pro-democratic rhetoric.",

          "abstract": "Background: Common and distinct features of personality disorders (PDs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have long been the focus of research. However, most studies relied on categorical rather than dimensional models, which are becoming increasingly integrated into contemporary psychiatric nosology and may offer more nuanced insights. To date, no study has examined the common structure of dimensional PD, according to the alternative DSM-5 model for PDs (personality functioning and pathological personality traits), and ADHD.\n\nMethods: In a preregistered study, a sample of adults seeking mental health support (n = 2,567) completed self-report measures assessing personality functioning, pathological personality traits (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism, and anankastia), and ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and executive functioning). Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the latent structure and shared variance among these constructs using confirmatory and exploratory factor models, including models with a general factor.\n\nResults: ADHD components showed strong correlations with personality functioning and moderate-to-strong associations with pathological personality traits, particularly disinhibition. Disinhibition remained the only trait domain substantially correlated with ADHD after control-ling for a general personality pathology factor. In exploratory models, ADHD components showed two distinct loading patterns among disinhibition facets: one factor was mainly defined by inattention and distractibility, with additional but weaker loadings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, whereas the other reflected executive functioning and irresponsibility.\n\nConclusion: The findings suggest that ADHD has substantial overlap with dimensional PD. Clinically, individuals with ADHD may benefit from integrated assessments of personality functioning and pathological personality traits, and from interventions addressing personality pathology.",

          "abstract": "In an aging society, identifying predictors of healthy aging is imperative. Personality traits (i.e., relatively consistent patterns of thoughts, emotions, and behavior) predict numerous health-related outcomes across the lifespan, with associations reported many decades prior to older age – potentially as early as adolescence. Yet, most previous research has focused on personality assessed in adulthood or late-life. We identified and synthesized the existing literature examining the links between adolescent personality (aged 10-25 years) and any outcome in older adulthood (aged 60+). \nBased on 33 studies (Ntotal=102,650 participants), adolescent personality predicted interindividual differences across numerous late-life outcomes, including health (e.g., longevity, diabetes), cognition (e.g., dementia, memory), and socioeconomic and psychological measures (e.g., financial security, wellbeing). Notably, meta-analysis shows that adolescents higher in conscientiousness were at decreased risk of dying over the subsequent decades (HR=0.949, 95%CI[0.921, 0.978], k=5). Our review further emphasizes the influential role of midlife educational attainment on the links between adolescent personality and late-life outcomes. \nPersonality assessment is simple, time- and cost-efficient, scalable, and could be integrated into school evaluations or medical check-ups during adolescence. Personality research provides opportunities to guide lifespan health policies by identifying individuals who may benefit most from lifestyle interventions, and by scaffolding risk-stratification strategies to promote healthy aging.",

Homicide is considered one, if not the most devastating forms of traumatic grief and is often comorbid with symptoms of PTSD and MDD. Engagement in bereavement PS has proven effective in mediating symptoms of traumatic grief, however, most research is limited to suicide bereavement. The current study aims to further the field of homicide PS by thematically analyzing secondary data in the way of five semi-structured interviews held by Victim Support (https://www.victimsupport.org.uk ) Peer Support team. Two themes and three sub themes were the result of analysis; Theme one ‘Peer support; Belonging, Empowerment and Hope’ and theme two ‘Isolation and Time; 1) `isolation felt by homicide bereavement, 2) social expectation of grief, 3) Homicides impact on sense of time and benefits of peer support. These themes were concurrent with existing research regarding traumatic grief PS as were impacts of positive wellbeing. Results differed from previous research in alleviation of isolation; however, homicide PS was seen to help individuals manage such feelings. The research highlights the need for more mixed method analysis into effects of homicide PS on traumatic grief as results indicate the occurrence of hope held mitigating factors against traumatic grief symptoms. Overall, the study was successful as it elucidated how PS impacts traumatic grief in those bereaved by homicide.",

          "abstract": "As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have emerged about growing dependency on AI and its potential psychological and behavioral consequences. The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal), good internal consistency (α = .92–.93), and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within Goodman's behavioral dependency framework and self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.",

The Central Model of Student Perception (CSP) is a theoretical framework employed to analyze socio-cognitive factors influencing student responses. The findings indicate that students possess the capacity to differentiate between the measured dimensions and correctly interpret the questionnaire items. However, the severity of their responses exhibits considerable variability. The study suggests that SET questionnaires can yield valuable information regarding teaching quality, but only if appropriate instrument design, administration protocols, and data collection and analysis methods are used.

Without observable consequences, the affective rewards of giving are muted, limiting their potential to reinforce the donor's generosity and encourage additional donations. Building on the theoretical advances that conceptualize moral learning as a reinforcement learning process, we tested whether and how the presentation of impact information about previous donations influences the affective experience of the previous donation and the effectiveness of the person's subsequent charitable giving. Our results showed that providing impact feedback increased subsequent donations by 14% and modestly increased warm glow. These findings suggest that making the consequences of giving more visible can help reinforce generosity in ways that sustain support for effective programs. In this context, donors' feelings of satisfaction of making an impact can both signal and reinforce shifts in future moral motivation.",

          "abstract": "The niche-picking principle has been proposed to explain stabilization in personality development and personality continuity of adult. The niche-picking principle posits that the reciprocal exchange between people and their environments -- person-environment transaction -- serve to maintain trait continuity, thereby preserving rank-order stability of trait differences. To date, however, no longitudinal twin study has directly tested whether reciprocal effects between people and their environments contribute to trait continuity in middle and older adulthood. Using a sample of twins from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA), we tested whether the niche-picking principle explained stability of longitudinal within-family differences in neuroticism, extraversion, and openness across two stages of adulthood development. Genetic simplex models that include a reciprocal effects (i.e., phenotype-environment covariance) parameter were fit to twins' longitudinal data. Results suggest that the niche-picking principle partly explains continuity of neuroticism and openness in middle adulthood whereas it partly explains continuity of neuroticism and extraversion in older adulthood. Stable genetic and unique environmental variance also explained continuity of each trait. Findings partially support lifespan developmental theories that posit that people adapt to and possibly optimize behaviors to sustain existing traits.

          "abstract": "Procedural issues are significant contributors to incidents in high-risk industries, yet current procedures fail to accommodate the gap between how work is prescribed and how it is actually performed. This study investigates the feasibility of developing a Real-Time Adaptive Procedure System that uses machine learning to understand procedural deviations and adapt procedures dynamically in high-risk industrial settings.\nData were collected from eight workers performing three tasks at a high-fidelity petrochemical facility. Using the Skip-Order-Action framework, researchers documented procedural deviations by comparing observed behavior against prescribed procedures across 507 procedural steps. A logistic regression model was developed using features from the Multi-disciplinary Interactive Behavior Triad framework, including participant characteristics, step-level attributes derived from abstraction hierarchy levels and cognitive performance modeling, and real-time indicators such as timestamps and eye-tracking data.\nThe model using step-level and participant-level features achieved relatively better performance (F1 = 0.49, AUC = 0.82), outperforming baseline models (F1 = 0.14-0.23). Adding real-time indicators reduced performance (F1 = 0.38), suggesting challenges in integrating real-time behavioral data.\nThis proof-of-concept demonstrates that procedural deviations follow patterns based on task characteristics and worker attributes. The study establishes empirical foundations for machine learning-driven procedural adaptation and proposes a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between prescribed and actual work through adaptive systems rather than compliance monitoring, representing a paradigm shift toward learning-oriented procedural systems in high-risk industries.",

          "abstract": "Background\nClinical evaluation of language abilities is central to diagnosing impairments in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions, such as brain injuries, Parkinson’s disease, or schizophrenia. However, assessment tools predominantly target structural and semantic aspects of language, while pragmatic and communicative abilities remain underrepresented, despite consistent evidence of their vulnerability across clinical populations. This gap is largely due to the scarcity of standardized and rapid tools for pragmatic assessment and the inherent difficulty of measuring context-dependent communicative abilities\n\nAim\nThis study aimed to develop and validate the German adaptation of the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates Brief (APACS Brief-De), a 10-minute screening tool originally created in Italian, assessing discourse production and comprehension of non-literal language, to enable reliable and time-efficient evaluation of pragmatics in German-speaking contexts.\n\nMethods\nAdopting a culturally sensitive translation approach, a standard and a multiple choice APACS Brief-De were developed, each with an alternate form to allow for repeated assessments, which were administered remotely in a sample of healthy German-speaking adults.\n\nResults\nThe APACS Brief-De Multiple Choice showed good consistency, reliability, validity, and equivalence between forms. Age and global cognitive performance significantly influenced pragmatic scores. The comparisons with the Italian standard form confirmed statistical equivalence, underscoring the robustness of the tool across languages. Age- and education-adjusted normative cut-off scores are provided for clinical interpretation.\n\nConclusions\nAPACS Brief-De offers a rapid and valid tool for assessing the global pragmatic profile, well-suited for integration into routine clinical practice, and represents a significant step toward crosslinguistic standardization of pragmatic assessment.",

          "abstract": "Ruminative brooding is marked by its perseverative nature. Existing mechanistic theories attribute this to cognitive control deficits linked to elevated functional connectivity within the default mode network and abnormal prefrontal activity. Here, we conceptualize ruminative brooding as an emergent property of a neural attractor state within the default mode network. Stable attractors are mathematically defined by two key properties: 1) convergence over time (assessing attractivity), and 2) resistance to perturbation (assessing stability). We tested whether brain states associated with brooding exhibited these properties in healthy volunteers using EEG during a task-switching protocol that interleaved cued rumination, working memory, and autobiographical memory tasks. Since cued rumination and working memory are thought to engage anticorrelated networks (default mode vs. central executive), switching from cued rumination to working memory effectively “perturbs” this system. Cued rumination was associated with beta power in the posterior cingulate cortex, with rumination disengagement marked by a reduction in beta power in posterior parietal and cingulate cortices. Moreover, high trait rumination was associated with impaired disengagement of these rumination-related dynamics and reduced recruitment of the dlPFC when transitioning from cued rumination to the working memory task, consistent with the “resistance to perturbation” criterion of a stable attractor. Furthermore, trait brooding was positively associated with a reduction in variance in posterior parietal and cingulate cortices time series over the course of cued rumination trials, consistent with the “convergence” criterion. These results provide support for framing brooding-related neural dynamics as pathological attractor states, providing a mechanistic account of rumination’s perseverative quality.",

          "abstract": "Sustained attention is notoriously difficult to maintain over time, with attentional lapses emerging rapidly during prolonged tasks. Motivation has been identified as a key factor in reducing these lapses and enhancing task engagement. According to recent accounts such as the goal competition hypothesis, the perceived benefit associated with a goal helps sustain its active representation in working memory. These benefits can arise from the prospect of gaining a reward, avoiding a penalty, or both. However, it remains unclear whether avoiding a penalty—or the combination of penalty and reward— improved sustained goal maintenance to the same extent as pursuing a reward alone. To address this question, we recruited 30 participants to complete a Continuous Performance Task (CPT) in which the type of benefit associated with the goal varied every 20 trials (reward, penalty, both, or no benefit). Replicating prior findings, we observed that rewards reduced attentional lapses compared to a no-benefit baseline. Avoiding penalties and combining both incentives also improved sustained attention, though the penalty condition was less effective than the combined condition. This suggests that while any perceived benefit can support goal maintenance, the motivational mechanisms may differ depending on the type of benefit—particularly when avoiding penalties alone.",

          "abstract": "Preclinical studies suggest that fasting may attenuate spontaneous pain and pain-related behaviors, such as licking and paw withdrawal, during inflammation in animals; however, evidence of the analgesic effects of fasting in patients suffering from chronic pain remains inconclusive. In two studies, we investigated the potentially protective effects of fasting on the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers following experimentally induced sensitization of nociceptive fibers through painful cutaneous electrical stimulation. In the first experiment (N = 33), participants underwent the painful electrical stimulation protocol twice: once after a 12-hour fast and once after consuming a standard breakfast. In a follow-up experiment (N = 52), participants were randomized to receive either the painful electrical stimulation protocol after a 16-hour fast or after their usual morning meal. In both experiments, we assessed the intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial extent of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, as well as emotional state and hunger levels. Fasting increased hunger and negative affect in both studies. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, participants in the fasted condition reported significantly less mechanical hypersensitivity compared to the breakfast condition. In both experiments, fasting did not reduce the pain intensity reported during the painful electrical stimulation. These findings provide behavioral evidence that a 16-hour fast may reduce the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. These results in humans align with preclinical evidence showing that fasting affects mechanical hypersensitivity, without necessarily affecting the perceived intensity of acute painful stimuli. Our findings suggest that metabolic state may modulate mechanical hypersensitivity in humans.",

          "abstract": "Fluid intelligence, often assessed through abstract reasoning tasks, is typically assumed to rely on deliberative, effortful problem solving. However, recent findings within the dual-process framework of reasoning suggest an alternative possibility: individuals with higher intelligence may generate correct responses intuitively, without engaging in deliberation. To test this “smart intuitor” hypothesis, we conducted two studies using a two-response paradigm. Participants solved abstract reasoning matrices, first providing an initial response under time pressure and concurrent cognitive load to minimize deliberation, followed by a final response without such constraints. Results consistently showed that although correct final responses were primarily achieved through corrective deliberation, a substantial number of correct answers were already produced during the initial intuitive stage. Notably, over 20% of sound reasoners produced consistently correct intuitive responses and qualified as “smart intuitors.” These findings suggest that while deliberation remains the dominant route to correct abstract reasoning, it is not the only one. Intuition can also support successful performance on abstract reasoning tasks, at least for a subset of individuals. Our results call for a broader conception of fluid intelligence—one that recognizes the contributions of both reflective and intuitive processes.",

          "abstract": "The global proliferation of Mafia-type organizations stems not only from their capacity to intimidate and corrupt but also from cultural norms—such as the “code of silence”—that discourage citizens from cooperating with law enforcement and foster societal indifference toward criminal activity. Investigating individual attitudes and responses to organized crime poses ethical and methodological challenges, especially in real-world settings. In this Perspective article, we argue that immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers a promising tool to overcome these challenges and promote positive changes in civic attitudes and behaviors. We suggest that exposing participants to mafia-related scenarios in IVR environments—while recording psychophysiological and brain data—can reveal both implicit and explicit markers of cognitive and emotional responses to criminal activity. Additionally, we discuss the Proteus effect, i.e., the behavioral change an individual undergoes based on the characteristics of their avatar and illustrate how embodying virtual characters with morally salient traits may foster civic resistance. IVR can thus serve both as a means to understand the psychophysiological underpinnings of responses to organized crime and as a tool to build resilience, supporting the development of targeted, evidence-based strategies that enhance public engagement and ethical action.",

Cognitive psychologists traditionally study explicit memory in episodic and semantic forms. However, juror decision making researchers emphasize narrative models in which jurors evaluate how realistic the proposed story is compared to real world events. To assess how perceived realism and explicit recall affect juror decisions, jury-eligible subjects (N = 83) read mock criminal cases, rating the strength of each case. Participants also reported their ability to recall a similar case (autobiographical recall), their knowledge of similar cases (factual recall), and the perceived realism of the case. Perceived realism was the most influential component of mock-juror decisions. Additional analyses identified two contributions of perceived realism: a common factor combining realism with memory recall and an independent factor. These findings support the hypothesis that complex decisions rely on perceived realism based on memory retrieval.",

The database comprises a sample of 872 GridWords collected from 76,095 players over two years. Moving beyond prior approaches limited to narrow sets of predictors, we integrated several features from psycholinguistic research on word recognition, such as word usage and letter frequencies, orthographic neighborhood size, or letter repetitions. Using contemporary machine learning methods in a nested cross-validation approach, we found an out-of-sample performance of R² = 53% (Elastic Net Regression) and R² = 59% (Gradient Boosting Machines) in item difficulty prediction.

Data were analyzed using a three-level mixed-effects meta-regression model, accounting for effect non-independence and key moderators such as retention intervals, warnings, overall test performance, and study characteristics. \nResults. \nAnalyzing data from 432 studies and 1,764 effect sizes across 51,845 participants, the average size of the misinformation effect was substantial, g = 0.659, 95% [0.196, 1.122], indicating a robust overall effect across studies. There was considerable variation across different conditions (total σ2 = 0.723, I2 = 91.78%). Consistent with previous findings, accuracy for the control condition was strongly positively associated with the size of the misinformation effect. Post-misinformation warnings were found to reduce the misinformation effect. Additionally, post-event testing, contrary to previous findings on retrieval-enhanced suggestibility, did not significantly moderate the misinformation effect.\nDiscussion. \nThe present analysis supports the conclusion that the misinformation effect is a reliable phenomenon, driven by a mixture of memory-related mechanisms as well as mechanism related to how participants strategize when responding to tests of different formats. Additionally, given the substantial heterogeneity we observed, we argue that the misinformation effect might be usefully conceptualized as a constellation of related phenomena, rather than a single coherent effect.",

          "abstract": "From call-and-response sequences to daily routines, predictability is an essential but under-appreciated aspect of everyday learning environments. This article reviews the existing literature on why predictability in educational settings, marked by stability and rhythm, supports learning and development. Previous research shows that young children develop an understanding of the world through interactions with their environment; based on what they already know or believe, they then make predictions about what will happen next. This allows for allostasis, which involves proactive changes to stress-response systems to meet anticipated future demands. At a fine-grained level, brains operate by generating and testing predictions. We learn best at an intermediate level of predictability – known as the Goldilocks zone. But for younger brains, with little prior experience, even simple, structured environments can appear unpredictable. Exposure to unpredictable environments triggers a stress response within the sympathoadrenal-medullary axis. Children who experience unpredictable home environments can often have an overactive stress response. This article aims to address a gap in our current understanding of education by applying insights from neuroscience to offer practical recommendations for educators to support healthy development and improve learning outcomes.",

The current study investigates whether recognition memory is impacted by frequency of blackout experiences, and if false memories are more likely for those who regularly experience blackouts (n = 29) in comparison to a control group (n = 24) who had never experienced an MBO. Participants completed a recognition memory paradigm (a modified DRM task: Roediger &amp; McDermott, (1995)), with a follow-up remember/know/guess judgement, before-alcohol and after-alcohol in the same testing session, while the MBO group (n = 23) additionally completed the task in a subsequent testing session within 20-hours of a blackout, but when sober again. Both groups displayed reduced discrimination (d’) between old and new words and a more conservative response strategy after-alcohol, which remained for MBO participants after-MBO. Critical lure words elicited more false-alarms than weakly related or unrelated words, yet the overall frequency of false-alarms dropped after-alcohol and remained depressed after blackout for the MBO group. Critically, decile analysis revealed significant shifts in d’ for early deciles (1st-6th), suggesting impairment to recognition memory after-MBO; severity of individual MBO experiences may impact these results, although it is not possible to attribute them solely to blackout events. Future work should investigate whether adults with a longer history of alcohol-induced memory blackout experiences display an impairment in recollection and familiarity, or show atypical false memory acceptance rates.",

At the group level, teachers showed moderate ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect items (d′ = 0.62) and some insight into the accuracy of their judgments (meta-d′ = 0.53), but their metacognitive efficiency was suboptimal (M-ratio = 0.62). Generalized linear mixed models revealed that metacognitive calibration varied systematically by gender and educational stage.

          "authors": "Andrew MacAskill",
          "abstract": "Many of the most important variables guiding behaviour, such as reward contingency, spatial location or contextual state, cannot be measured directly. Animals must instead infer them from noisy, incomplete information, a process termed ‘hidden state inference’. This requires combining internally generated estimates with incoming evidence to produce accurate beliefs about the world that guide behaviour. While computational frameworks can describe this process in formal terms, its implementation in the brain remains unclear. Here, we propose that the compartmentalised dendritic architecture of CA1 pyramidal neurons provides a biophysically grounded mechanism for performing the core operations of hidden state inference. In this framework, apical dendrites encode internally generated state estimates, tuft dendrites encode evidence from sensory and contextual inputs, and their nonlinear interaction produces an updated state estimate. Structured heterogeneity in dendritic properties across neurons would naturally generate a population code capable of representing graded belief strength, uncertainty, and multiple competing hypotheses. We illustrate how this scheme can account for CA1 function in both reversal learning and spatial navigation, and suggest that similar dendritic principles may operate more widely across brain regions. This perspective links cellular physiology to high level cognitive computation, and yields concrete, testable predictions for how dendritic integration supports adaptive behaviour in dynamic environments.",

Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",

Analyses of the trial-by-trial data showed that the vehicle sound intensity at the moment of the crossing decision was the most important predictor of the decisions in the auditory-only condition. In the audio-visual condition, sound intensity also was significantly associated with the crossing decision, but visual cues dominated. Implications for road traffic safety are discussed, specifically in relation to interactions between pedestrians and electric vehicles.",

          "abstract": "Method of loci (MOL) leverages visualizations of familiar spatial environments (memory palaces) to enhance information recall and is heavily utilized by superior memorists. The characteristics of memory palaces used in MOL have not been well-studied. Understanding how memory palace features contribute to memory enhancement may allow us to design optimal palaces. Here, we examined whether memory palace valence influences neutral information recall. We found that participants who applied MOL using a negatively valenced palace (N=33) outperformed participants who applied MOL using a positively valenced palace (N=34) and participants in a non-MOL control group (N=31) on a free-response semantic memory recall test. Furthermore, participants who perceived the negative palace more negatively or positive palace more positively exhibited greater recall accuracy, but overall, the negative group outperformed the positive group. These findings highlight that memory palaces can be constructed to optimize loci-dependent memory accuracy, providing new evidence-based strategies to improve memorization.",

          "abstract": "Bi+ youth face unique forms of minority stress, yet little is known about how these relate to their high rates of suicidality. This multi-method study examines risk and protective factors linked to suicidal ideation and attempts among bi+ youth. Quantitative survey data came from Dutch bi+ youth aged 16-22 years old (M age = 18.71, SD = 1.83). We conducted logistic regression on lifetime suicidal ideation (N = 1275) and attempts (N = 1274), including risk and protective factors, as well as interaction effects between sexual orientation, gender identity and risk/protective factors. To contextualize the quantitative findings, 15 interviews with bi+ youth with a history of suicidality were conducted and thematically analyzed. Quantitatively, experienced stigmatization and binegativity-related prejudice were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Enhanced social support, support-seeking coping, and resilience were linked with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation. Associations between erasure, binegativity, distraction-seeking, and bi+ community connectedness and suicidality varied by sexual identity. Qualitatively, experienced stigmatization and binegativity-related prejudice involved peers perceiving bi+ youth as ‘strange,’ sexualizing their identities, and assuming an incapability of having stable relationships. Findings highlight the need for inclusive mental health interventions that address the challenging experiences of bi+ youth, and improve protective factors such as social support, coping strategies, and resilience.\nKeywords: bi+ youth, LGBT, minority stress, protective factors, suicidality",

          "abstract": "Social decision-making requires individuals to balance self-interest with mutual benefit, continuously adapting their behavior to the intentions and actions of others. While classical economic games have provided important insights into cooperation and competition, they typically rely on discrete, turn-based decisions that fail to capture the fluid and reciprocal nature of real-world social interactions. The present study used a novel transparent Dyadic Interaction Platform and a novel Cooperation–Competition Foraging task to examine how the interpersonal personality traits agency and communion shape dynamic, real-time social behavior. In this task, pairs of participants (dyads) jointly or individually collected targets with variable payoffs, allowing cooperative and competitive strategies to emerge naturally as both partners continuously observed each other’s gaze, actions, and outcomes. Using a round-robin design, we assessed how interpersonal traits and partner-specific adaptations jointly predicted dyadic strategic outcomes. Within each session, dyads gradually converged toward stable interaction modes, with increasing cooperation across sessions. Higher mean communion within dyads predicted enhanced cooperation, indicating that shared affiliative tendencies promote jointly oriented behavior. Additionally, behavior in each session was significantly influenced by prior dyadic history, indicating experience-dependent adaptation. These findings demonstrate that continuous, transparent interaction paradigms reveal how stable personality traits and dynamic partner feedback jointly shape social strategies. By linking personality traits from the Interpersonal Circumplex to behavioral adaptations, this study contributes to bridging the gap between traditional game-theory approaches and ecologically valid models of real-world social decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Why do children sometimes include the pieces of broken things when asked to count (e.g., “Count the forks”)? In five experiments, we test two ideas: (1) that adults, but not children, exclude parts from counts by reasoning that speakers must only be interested in whole objects with functions that fulfill desired goals, and (2) that only adults exclude parts on the basis of a Gricean inference, on which it is assumed that if a speaker wanted parts to be counted, they would say so. In Experiments 1-3, we find that although children and adults are somewhat less likely to count pieces of objects when speaker goals are explicitly mentioned, large developmental differences remain unexplained. In Experiments 4-5, we provide evidence that children differ most from adults when pieces are presented in the presence of complementary parts (with which they together would form a whole), and that these pieces are significantly more likely to be conceptualized and labeled as “parts”, especially by adults. Together, these findings suggest that adults – but not children – are more likely to exclude broken parts from their counts in response to requests like “Count the forks!” when they are also able to understand that more informative requests could have been made (e.g., “Count the pieces of fork!”).",

          "abstract": "This study explores how religious and spiritual leaders across different faith factions in Nigeria (Pentecostal, Islamic, Catholic, Syncretic, and Traditional) understand, interpret, and respond to mental illness. While mental illness is increasingly recognized as a global health concern, in Nigeria it is often perceived through spiritual and moral frameworks that shape how communities explain and treat psychological distress. Using a qualitative design grounded in Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, five spiritual leaders were interviewed to capture their beliefs about the nature, causes, and treatment of mental illness.\nFindings revealed that all participants viewed mental illness as both a spiritual and psychological condition. Although they acknowledged biological and social causes such as trauma, stress, and substance abuse, spiritual explanations including demonic attack, ancestral curses were dominant. Healing was described as a holistic process combining prayer, fasting, ritual purification, and, increasingly, medical treatment. This integration of faith and science challenges the misconception that African religious leaders reject psychiatry. However, moral interpretations often reinforce stigma, linking mental illness to sin or spiritual weakness.\nThe study concludes that religious leaders occupy a critical position in Nigeria’s mental health space, serving as both gatekeepers and potential collaborators. It recommends faith–health partnerships, interfaith education programs, and the inclusion of mental health literacy in religious and theological training. Overall, the research highlights that improving mental health outcomes in Nigeria requires a culturally grounded approach that bridges spirituality and science, recognizing faith not as an obstacle but as a vital resource in promoting psychological well-being.\nKeywords: Mental illness, religion, spirituality, culture, Nigeria, qualitative research, Braun and Clarke, faith-based healing",

Yet, most interventions focus on initial trust formation rather than repair. We introduce a novel, online cognitive intervention—rooted in Dialectical Behavior Therapy—to reduce psychological reactivity and promote resilient cooperation. In a randomized controlled online trial (N = 318), participants played a Repeated Trust Game against an HMM-based adaptive agent trained on human data, ensuring dynamic, human-like responses under full experimental control. Compared to an active control, the cognitive intervention prevented retaliation following programmed trust violations and yielded significantly higher cooperative returns. Mixed-effects analysis revealed that while control participants became increasingly reciprocal over time (approaching tit-for-tat strategies), intervention participants maintained more stable cooperative behavior that was less contingent on partner investment levels. This change did not generalize to Prisoner's Dilemma, underscoring the intervention's specificity. These results validate HMM agents as a powerful experimental tool and suggest that targeted cognitive strategies may help support cooperative behavior; clinical efficacy and real-world deployment remain to be established.",

This study investigates how social feedback influences self-esteem in adolescents and emerging adults with elevated borderline personality (BPD) symptoms, a vulnerable group characterized by low self-esteem and a negative, unstable self-image.\nMethods: We employed a social evaluation task simulating a social media context. Participants were asked to make social predictions (whether they expected Likes or Dislikes from peers), received social feedback (Likes or Dislikes from peers) and repeatedly reported their momentary self-esteem. The sample included 55 adolescents and emerging adults with BPD symptoms and 67 matched non-clinical controls (NCC, ages 13-25). Computational reinforcement learning modeling was used to analyze their behavior. \nResults: Compared to NCC, BPD showed strongly biased negative expectations of not being liked by others. Besides, computational modeling revealed significant group differences in social learning: individuals with BPD symptoms failed to learn from frequent positive social feedback (Likes) but overweighted rare negative social feedback (Dislikes) received from generally benevolent peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was disproportionately reactive to positive feedback from critical raters, a pattern partly explained by individual differences in self-reported adverse family experiences.\nConclusions: These findings highlight fundamental disruptions in how young people with BPD symptoms learn from social feedback and how they use it to inform their self-esteem.",

          "abstract": "Introduction Cervical cancer is the first cancer potentially eliminable through widespread HPV vaccination. In Italy, despite free access, vaccine coverage among adolescents remains low. Psychological factors and cognitive biases can influence vaccine decisions and contribute to vaccine hesitancy (VH). While social media offer new avenues for health communication, their effectiveness in reducing VH is uncertain. This study investigates the impact of Instagram-based communication strategies on adolescents’ HPV knowledge and VH.\n\nMethods A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 22 high school classes in Tuscany, Italy, involving 526 students. Classes were assigned to one of three Instagram accounts: a neutral control, an information-based, or a bias-aware information. After three weeks (T2), students completed a follow-up survey, followed by an in-class lesson. Surveys were administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and three-month follow-up (T3).\n\nResults The final analysis included 301 students (mean age 15.2, 74% female). At T1, VH and knowledge scores were low (mean VH = 40%; knowledge score = 27%), and 47.9% reported likely seeking information from sexual and reproductive services. No significant changes in VH or knowledge were found at T2 overall. However, in students with low information avoidance (IA), the info-based page reduced VH significantly compared to the control (-6.9%, p = 0.009). In contrast, among high-IA students, the same intervention increased VH (estimate: +8.9%, p = 0.002). Willingness to seek information increased in the info group among low-IA students (+1.639 vs. control, p = 0.034). At T3, we measured the impact of an in-person lecture on students’ HPV and HPV vaccination literacy. A significant increase of knowledge compared to T1 is observed despite the smaller sample collected.\n\nConclusion Social media campaigns alone may not effectively reduce VH in adolescents and can even backfire among high-IA individuals. Future strategies should incorporate personalized, bias-aware messaging and interactive tools to address VH and improve HPV vaccine uptake more effectively.",

          "abstract": "The generation effect refers to the advantage in memory for self-generated information compared to information that is received from another source (e.g., through reading). The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

          "abstract": "Background: Migration and integration are complex processes that impact the mental health of immigrant populations. This study focuses on the mental health challenges faced by first-generation Iranian immigrants in Germany, specifically examining the role of depression, discrimination, and social integration.\nMethods: A cross-sectional, online survey was administered to 401 Iranian immigrants across 122 cities in Germany. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the PHQ-9, while perceived discrimination, social support, and integration were measured with custom scales. Multivariable statistical analyses were employed to identify significant predictors of depression and re-migration intent.\nResults: About 60% of participants reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Perceived discrimination (b = 1.246, p = 0.001) and unemployment (b = 2.571, p = 0.007) were positively linked to depression, while self-employment (b = −3.052, p = 0.029) had a protective effect. The strongest predictor of depression was the comparison of happiness between Germany and Iran (b = −2.457, p &lt; 0.001), with lower happiness in Germany correlating with higher depressive scores. Social support showed a trend toward buffering the effects of discrimination (b = −0.596, p = 0.085). Additionally, 63.6% of participants expressed intent to re-migrate.\nConclusions: The findings highlight the significant mental health burden experienced by Iranian immigrants in Germany, with discrimination, unemployment and lack of social support being key contributors to depressive symptoms. The high re-migration intent underscores the need for interventions addressing discrimination, enhancing social support, and improving integration pathways to reduce mental health disparities and promote social cohesion.\nKeywords: Iranian immigrants, Germany, depression, discrimination, mental health, integration",

          "authors": "Holmes Finch",
          "abstract": "The comparison of means between two or more groups for two or more dependent variables is a very common problem in psychology and other social sciences.  Most frequently, such comparisons are made using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), which rests upon assumptions about the population data distribution, including multivariate normality of the residuals and homoscedasticity of group variances on the response variables.  When these assumptions are not met, the performance of the standard MANOVA test statistics can be degraded resulting in inflated Type I error rates and/or diminished power.  Recently, authors in the biomedical sciences have described approaches for multivariate mean comparisons that are based on metrics such as the Euclidean distance, which describe how separated individuals are from one another.  The ratio of the sum of squares of these distance measures between and within groups can serve as a test of the null hypothesis of no difference in the groups’ locations on the set of response variables.  The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of these distance based approaches with standard MANOVA and an approach based on multilevel modeling for heteroscedastic and nonnormal outcome variables.  In addition, the distance based techniques were also compared with the multilevel method and a log-linear model for a scenario with binary outcomes.  The results of the simulation study revealed that the distance based methods maintained the nominal Type I error rate in nearly all conditions and exhibited comparable or higher power with the other methods included in the study.  A major implication of this work is that the distance based approaches can prove useful in comparison of group location for a wide variety of data distributions including skewed, heteroscedastic, and binary.",

We investigated the individual differences in linguistic and domain-general skills that support verbal fluency and lead to this variability. In particular, we focused on the role of linguistic knowledge, which was calculated through six tests capturing vocabulary, amount of reading, and knowledge of grammar rules. We compared this to the role of three key domain-general skills: working memory (WM), processing speed, and nonverbal reasoning (IQ). 571 young native Dutch speakers completed semantic (category) and phonemic (letter) VF tasks, along with an individual differences test battery. We assessed the VF trials for the total number of correct words as well as two temporal variables, the time to first response and the time by which half of the responses have been produced. Linear mixed effects models revealed that linguistic knowledge was the strongest predictor of performance across all scores, and it had a larger effect than the domain-general skills. We discuss the role of linguistic knowledge and how it shapes the mental lexicon, concluding that better language skills lead to more efficient and detailed associative links between words that share semantic or phonological/orthographic features. We also provide updated norms for VF performance in Dutch and practical suggestions for using the task.",

This proof-of-concept study introduces a reproducible pipeline for capturing eye gaze synchrony in a triadic interaction using mobile eye tracking. Three participants each wore Tobii Pro Glasses 3 during a 7-minute naturalistic conversation. Independent recordings were synchronized via a router-based setup, and gaze points were spatially aligned within a shared coordinate system anchored by a fiducial marker. We compared two analytical frameworks: a correlation-based approach using Surrogate Synchrony methods (SUSY and its multivariate extension mv-SUSY) to quantify temporal alignment of gaze, and an event-based approach assessing occurrences of mutual gaze and joint attention. The study demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing eye gaze synchrony among multiple participants. Results indicated that correlation-based and event-based measures capture distinct but complementary aspects of triadic coordination.

We found that loneliness and paranoia were strongly correlated with each other and with more distrustful behavior after breaches of trust. Sensitivity to changes in partner reciprocity were higher in lonelier and more paranoid individuals. Lonelier individuals also trusted highly-reciprocating partners less. Computational modeling revealed that lonelier and more paranoid individuals were less willing to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity. Importantly, these effects were observed in both patients and controls, indicating the important impact of loneliness and paranoia on both clinical and general populations. These findings demonstrate how loneliness affects social behaviors and expectations, pointing to important downstream implications for lonely individuals’ relationships.",

However, conventional TVCM remains limited to investigating directional effects that are aggregated across individuals. The present study broadens the applicability of TVCM  in two ways. First, we introduce a TVCM formulation of the multivariate normal distribution to explore temporal dynamics in both undirected associations (or couplings) and the variability of variables of interest. Second, we integrate TVCM with hierarchical modeling, thereby extending inference from average coefficient functions across persons to their individual-level counterparts. Specifically, we explore (a) the inclusion of person-specific intercepts in time-varying coefficient functions to investigate interindividual differences at the onset of the period of interest, and (b) modeling fully person-specific coefficient functions to capture heterogeneity across the entire period, with partial pooling stabilizing individual-level estimates. To illustrate the model extensions, we apply them to six weeks of intensive longitudinal data from 16 patients with anxiety disorders participating in an attention training intervention, examining interindividual differences in changes in both the level and volatility of nervousness and threat monitoring, as well as in the temporal dynamics of their coupling. Finally, we discuss model extensions that incorporate person-level characteristics to explain interindividual differences in temporal dynamics and use these differences to predict outcomes of interest.",

          "abstract": "Taking phenomenal consciousness as explanandum, we first circumscribe it using five hallmarks. Fundamentally, conscious experience corresponds to generating a best-guess representation of what the sensory inputs the wakeful brain receives are about. This process can be computationally approached with predictive processing (PP): the brain constantly generates inferential, predictive representations to ‘explain away’ its sensory inputs. Empirical evidence supports the use of PP by the brain, yet it is not deemed sufficient to explain consciousness. We review two theories of consciousness using PP as building block: active inference theory and neurorepresentationalism. When witnessing computer simulations of PP and other computational models, they remain strikingly unconvincing as instances that might emulate consciousness. Considered in the context of computational functionalism, we argue that computational models suffer, by definition, from the ‘Problem of Numbers’: it does lie within the purview of mathematics to study numerical operations, but not to reveal all qualitative properties characteristic of consciousness. We argue that low-level neural phenomena, e.g. spike trains, can be captured by mathematics, but we need different descriptors and tools to study their emergent correspondence to high-level, conscious phenomena. These considerations also lead us to outline Indicators of Consciousness as applicable to AIs and robots.",

          "abstract": "Background: Young autistic people experience disproportionately high rates of mental health challenges, yet little is known about factors associated with suicidality in this group. This study leveraged anonymous self-report data to identify correlates of suicidal thoughts.\nMethods: Secondary analysis was performed on data for 365 young (age 11-19+ years) users of a mental health app in the UK with an autism diagnosis or self-identifying as autistic. The presence of suicidal thoughts was assessed as a binary item. Binary logistic regression was used to explore correlates of suicidal thoughts across three domains: mental health-related symptoms, autism-related factors, and adverse life events/experiences. The final model included all significant correlates from domain models and demographic factors.\nResults: Suicidal thoughts were reported by 63% of participants, with similar rates across age groups. The final model accounted for nearly 50% of variability in the presence of suicidal thoughts (R²Nagelkerke = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Self-harm and depression showed the strongest positive associations with suicidal thoughts (odds ratio (OR) and [95% confidence interval] = 6.41 [3.62, 11.35] and 4.58 [2.51, 8.35], respectively), followed by history of physical abuse (OR = 3.01 [1.20, 7.56]) and a transgender/gender-diverse identity (OR = 2.13 [1.11, 4.10]). Use of the term “neurodiversity”—reflecting a neurodiversity-affirming identity—was associated with lower likelihood of suicidal thoughts (OR = 0.45 [0.24, 0.83]). \nConclusion: This study contributes to evidence of high rates of suicidal thoughts among young autistic people and associations with self-harm, depression, a history of abuse, and a gender minority identity. Self-identification with the term neurodiversity emerged as a potential protective factor against suicidal thoughts. These findings highlight the importance of access to autism-adapted mental health care, addressing trauma and identity-related stressors, and fostering belonging and connection through neurodiversity-affirming approaches as part of comprehensive suicide prevention strategies. Longitudinal research is needed to examine whether identity-affirming, connection-building interventions can support autistic youth experiencing suicidality.",

          "abstract": "Discovering computational models that explain human cognition and behavior remains a central goal of cognitive science, yet the reliance on hand-crafted equations limits the range of cognitive mechanisms that can be uncovered. We introduce SPICE (Sparse, Interpretable Cognitive Equations), a framework that automates the discovery of mechanistically interpretable cognitive models directly from behavioral data. SPICE fits recurrent neural networks to capture latent cognitive dynamics and then applies sparse equation discovery to extract concise mathematical expressions describing those dynamics. Theory-guided priors make the approach data- and compute-efficient, while a hierarchical design reveals individual differences in the algorithmic structure of cognitive dynamics rather than in parameters alone. In simulations, SPICE accurately recovered the structure and parameters of known reinforcement learning models. Applied to human behavior in a two-armed bandit task, it uncovered new equations that outperformed existing models and revealed structural alterations in reinforcement learning mechanisms among participants with depression, such as a loss of nonlinear exploration dynamics regulating behavioral flexibility. This approach provides systematic insights into structural individual differences in cognitive mechanisms and establishes a foundation for automated discovery of interpretable behavioral models.",

          "authors": "Nicolás Sánchez-Fuenzalida; Simon van Gaal; Zazie van den Hurk; Timo Stein; Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort",
          "abstract": "Although many studies have claimed the existence of unconscious priming, a valid statistical procedure for substantiating such claims is often lacking. For instance, the absence of prime awareness is often erroneously inferred from non-significant p-values, and priming and awareness are typically tested by comparing the outcomes of two separate t-tests. In a classic study by Vorberg (2003), observers were slower to identify the direction of an arrow mask when it followed an arrow prime pointing in the opposite direction (priming effect), despite being unable to identify the direction of the arrow prime (prime awareness). Using that observation as a starting point, we address several methodological shortcomings that we identified in that study (as in many other studies in the field). To overcome these shortcomings, we implemented three critical changes. First, we employed a Bayesian methodological-statistical framework to test priming effects and prime awareness at the single-subject level over multiple experimental sessions. Second, participants underwent extensive training in the prime awareness task to ensure they understood and executed the task as intended. Third, we directly compared prime awareness and the priming effect. By using this approach, we show unconscious processing at short prime-mask stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) in three out of six participants, replicating Vorberg et al. (2003). However, we also show that – unlike in the original study – unconscious priming was not consistently present across all SOAs, and awareness increased with increasing prime-mask SOA. Notably, priming effects were highly consistent across participants, whereas awareness showed substantial variability across participants.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs) link number magnitude to spatial dimensions, typically yielding faster left-side responses to small numbers and right-side responses to large numbers, the SNARC effect. Although widely replicated, the SNARC effect varies across contexts, indicating that it is influenced by situational and embodied factors. The present study examined whether visual hand primes can modulate the SNARC effect in a magnitude classification task. Participants classified digits as smaller or larger than five after viewing schematic images of a left or right hand. The hand primes were task-irrelevant and centrally displayed before each digit, allowing assessment of whether visual cues associated with specific hands bias spatial-numerical mapping. Consistent with previous studies using Turkish samples, the present data revealed no reliable SNARC effect (a non-significant magnitude × side interaction) in the baseline pattern. However, a significant three-way interaction emerged among hand prime, numerical magnitude, and response side: right-hand responses were faster to large digits after right-hand primes, reflecting a partial prime-congruent modulation of spatial-numerical mapping. The effect was not influenced by participants’ habitual finger-counting direction, suggesting that the observed modulation arises from immediate perceptual context rather than long-term embodied routines. Overall, the findings indicate that SNAs are flexible and dynamically shaped by transient embodied cues, even in the absence of a typical SNARC pattern at baseline.",

Prior research on this process suggests that individuals\nexhibiting higher levels of maladaptive personality traits tend to elicit more negative first\nimpressions in others, with presumably detrimental consequences for their social lives. This\npreregistered study1 employed a digital meeting format to examine how target individuals’\n(n=119) maladaptive personality traits (i.e., detachment, antagonistic traits, agentic traits) shape\ntrustworthiness and likability ratings made by perceivers (n=120). All participants were\ntreatment-seeking individuals with varying maladaptive trait levels. Each perceiver rated four\ntargets based on a photograph and three video sequences. Targets were the four individuals that\nhad participated in the study prior to the perceiver. As hypothesized, higher detachment and\nhigher antagonistic trait facets (hostility, callousness, deceitfulness) of the target were linked to\nlower ratings of trustworthiness and likability. In contrast, targets’ agentic trait facets\n(grandiosity and attention-seeking) did not show the hypothesized positive associations with\nthe outcomes, nor did higher negative affectivity show the hypothesized negative association\nwith these ratings. Additionally, we tested whether positive and negative facial expressions\nmediated the associations between targets’ maladaptive trait levels and perceivers’\ntrustworthiness and likeability ratings. Mediation models did not support facial expressions as\nmediators, even though positive expressions were related to more favorable impressions in\nexploratory models.

          "authors": "Işıl Ayça Akkuş; Charlie R Crimston; Brock Bastian; Bastian Jaeger",
          "abstract": "Disagreement about the rights and protections owed to different individuals underpins many important historical and current debates (e.g., on the abolishment of slavery, the feminist movement, abortion, and environmental protection). Recent work on moral concern (i.e., the subjectively felt moral obligation to consider an individual’s welfare and interests) has uncovered a seemingly robust hierarchy. For example, people extend most moral concern toward family and friends, followed by ingroup members (e.g., a co-worker), outgroup members (e.g., a foreign citizen), the environment (e.g., a coral reef), and, lastly, criminals (e.g., a murderer). However, these studies were all conducted in a few countries from the Anglosphere, raising doubt about the cross-cultural generalizability of the results. We analyzed a data set with 6,665 participants recruited from 41 cultural groups to explore cultural and individual variation in the hierarchy of moral concern. We find that (1) on average, across the 41 cultural groups, 11 of the 13 rankings in the typical hierarchy of moral concern replicated, pointing to substantial cultural similarities; (2) countries that are culturally more similar to the reference sample from the initial U.S. study showed a more similar hierarchy; (3) some rankings (e.g., prioritizing family and friends over human ingroups) replicated more often than others (e.g., prioritizing human outgroups over the environment) across countries; and (4) both cultural and individual differences were largest most pronounced examining people’s concern for non-human animals and the environment.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications for organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty, with classical economic approaches emphasizing the use of punishment by focusing among others on the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”). However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. We conducted an experimental online study (N = 702) collecting UK-based Prolific participants playing a tax evasion game for five rounds. We manipulated (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earned money for the individual or for the group of three), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual was punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). Against our prediction, we did not observe higher dishonesty for group-based payoffs compared to individual-based payoffs for treatments without punishment but higher compliance. As predicted, we found that punishment risk decreased dishonesty and increased compliance by 14.2 percentage points (Cohen’s d = 0.32). Further, in contrast to the predictions based on utility-based models, we found that group punishment was more effective in decreasing dishonesty and increased compliance by 5.6 percentage points (d = 0.13) compared to individual punishment. This effect was similar for individual and group-based payoffs. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of punishment in curbing dishonesty across different decision-making structures.",

          "authors": "Verena Heidrich; Felicitas Flade; Roland Imhoff",
          "abstract": "Humans readily categorize their social environment based on visible features regarded as diagnostic for group membership (e.g., skin color, hair color, body morphology) along lines of various social dimensions, including gender, race, age, to name just a few. Despite overwhelming evidence for the notion that these dimensions can be used to bring categorical order into the world, psychologists know surprisingly little about what determines which of these lenses is active in a given moment. The present research examines whether ecological meta-contrast provides an affordance to social categorization and selective category use. Across seven studies (N = 1,234), we manipulated meta-contrast ratios by varying the dispersion of race- and gender-related facial features to examine their effects on spontaneous social categorization. Categorization was assessed using the “Who Said What?” paradigm (Taylor et al., 1978), with categorization parameters estimated via multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (Klauer &amp; Wegener, 1998), and a Speeded Categorization task (Thomas et al., 2014). Participants consistently categorized faces by race (Studies 1a, 2a) and gender (Studies 1b, 2b), regardless of meta-contrast ratio. However, when race and gender were crossed (Studies 3, 4, 5), significant interaction effects emerged: categorization along the low meta-contrast dimension decreased, while it increased along the high-meta-contrast dimension. These findings provide initial evidence that meta-contrast modulates the relative accessibility of social categorizations. The distribution of category-related features within a social information ecology thus provides affordance to some categorizations more readily than others. Study-specific patterns related to stimuli and task constraints are discussed to inform future research.",

Trained on the large-scale COCO-Search18 dataset, our reward map model recovered dynamic reward structures that explain inhibitory tagging, adaptive stopping in target-absent trials, and contextual guidance from non-target objects—phenomena that cannot be easily explained by prior models focused on target guidance. And while state-of-the-art transformer-based computer vision models can mimic human-like scanpaths, their priority maps remain largely static across fixations and therefore fail to capture the temporal dynamics of search. By contrast, reward maps strike a balance between predictive performance and mechanistic interpretability, offering a framework for generating testable hypotheses about human search behavior.",

          "abstract": "Individuals displaying cues of higher mate value (e.g., attractive characteristics) are thought to represent a greater threat to pair bonds and, consequently, elicit greater jealousy. Previous studies reporting that more feminine potential rivals elicit greater jealousy in women used stimuli in which feminine characteristics were experimentally manipulated and assessed jealousy using forced-choice methods. However, this method for assessing perceptions has recently been criticised for lacking ecological validity. Consequently, in the current study, women rated how jealous they would feel if rivals depicted in natural (i.e., unmanipulated) face photographs were flirting with their romantic partner. Facial femininity was assessed using objective analyses of shape and via third-party ratings of facial femininity. For heterosexual participants, women reported significantly greater jealousy when imagining more feminine women flirting with their romantic partner. This pattern of results was also seen for lesbian participants, although the correlation between rival femininity and jealousy was significantly weaker for lesbian participants than it was for heterosexual participants. Collectively, these results present further evidence that facial femininity of potential rivals influences women’s reported jealousy, particularly in heterosexual women, and is further evidence for the proposal that putative markers of the mate value of rivals play a role in women’s jealousy.

          "abstract": "Template matching, the idea that attention is guided by a specific internal representation of a target, provides a powerful theoretical foundation for understanding visual search. Yet, it remains unclear how such templates operate in naturalistic contexts where target objects may be ambiguous or vary in appearance. We propose that visual search is better explained by generative templates—representations conditionally shaped by features of the current visual input rather than fixed, averaged prototypes. Using deep image synthesis, we generate input-specific target templates and compare their search guidance to conventional fixed templates. Generative templates yield more accurate target localization in naturalistic search arrays and better capture key patterns in human behavior, including search efficiency, fixation probability, and attentional guidance toward structurally similar non-targets. Our input-driven generative template approach offers a flexible alternative to classical template-matching theories, Our input-driven generative template approach offers a flexible alternative to classical template-matching theories, one that can better explain how human categorical search is affected by the variability in visual features both within and between natural object categories.",

          "abstract": "Theories of early numeracy assume that the logical concepts which enable formal definitions of numbers (e.g., cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, successor function) play key roles in ontogenesis, but empirical support is lacking. These concepts may not be suitable targets for theory because such definitions are reconstructions of numbers in formal language, but not explanatory of what numbers are. We propose that there should be a correspondence between those formal ideas that are generative for the natural numbers and those realized in children’s early learning. Building on our account of foundations of arithmetic (Grice et al., 2024, Psychological Review), we give a new explanatory construction of the natural numbers and a theory of early numeracy analogous to it. We show that numbers can be derived from linear order, monotonicity and convexity – principles of perceptual organization that are evolutionarily based. A key step in our construction is the ℕ-chain, the limit of finite linear orders, which we show is equivalent to the successor function but preferable as a target for psychological theory because it can be approximated in finite terms. In our theory, building blocks of early numeracy are linear orders - the number word sequence, object play schemas - and how they are related in the count routine by structure mapping (order embeddings). The number word sequence develops gradually, giving a representation analogous to an ℕ-chain when the child realizes that numbers can be generated without limit. Ordinality is prior to cardinality as the basis for numeracy, one-to-one correspondence results from convexity, and the natural numbers and arithmetic emerge jointly as a common structure. Our theory reconciles constructivist and nativist accounts because it shows that numeracy is both culturally mediated and biologically-based, although ‘core number systems’ do not play a role. The dawning of numeracy in a child’s mind is both a reinvention and rediscovery of mathematics itself.",

Data on isolated word reading accuracy were collected from 1,907 children in grades 1-5 across multiple US sites. Each child read a list of words ranging from 250 to 500 items depending on reading skill (less proficient children were often unable to finish the entire list of words), with each list representing the full distribution of word difficulties oversampled for words at the child’s reading level. Each child also attempted 99 linking items representing the full distribution of word difficulties. A total of 631,322 total responses were collected with the average child providing 336. For the final sample of words, the average number of responses per word for the 9,862 non-linking items was 47.14 (range of 10-592) and for the 99 linking items the average was 1681.42 (range of 1083-1907).

We hypothesized that individuals with recent concussion would have a suppressed\nstartle response compared to healthy controls.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 49 adolescent athletes with a recent\nconcussion (n=20; age: 14.6 ± 1.6 years; 60% female), a concussion history &gt; 1 year prior (n=16;\nage: 14.8 ± 2.0 years; 44% female), and healthy controls (n=13; age: 13.3 ± 2.8 years; 54%\nfemale). We measured the eyeblink of the general startle reflex via electromyography activity of\nthe orbicularis oculi muscle using electrodes placed under the right eye. Measurement sessions\nincluded twelve 103 decibel acoustic startle probes ~50 milliseconds in duration delivered ~15-\n25 seconds apart. The primary dependent variable was mean startle magnitude (μV), and group\nwas the primary independent variable. We used a one-way analysis of variance followed by a\nTukey post-hoc test to compare mean startle magnitude between groups.\nResults: Mean startle magnitude significantly differed (F=5.49, p=0.007) among the groups.\nMean startle magnitude was significantly suppressed for the concussion (p=0.01) and concussion\nhistory groups (p=0.02) compared to healthy controls. There was no significant difference\nbetween the recent concussion and concussion history groups (p=1.00).\nConclusion: Our results provide novel evidence for startle suppression in adolescent athletes\nfollowing concussion. The concussion history group had an attenuated startle response beyond\nresolution of their recovery, suggesting there may be lingering physiological dysfunction.",

          "authors": "Mirya Holman; Andreas Küpfer; Tyler Simko",
          "abstract": "Political scientists now regularly use audio, video, and text data to investigate questions about deliberation, representation, and emotion. However, existing research using multimodal data focuses largely on highly professionalized settings like national legislatures where pre-processed data is often available. Although scholars can increasingly access a wide range of data on less standardized environments such as campaign events, committee hearings, and local government meetings, using videos of these events for research poses a number of common measurement challenges, including low quality transcripts, missing speaker information, idiosyncratic production styles, and varying formats. In this paper, we present a streamlined pipeline using open-source tools to automatically extract text (e.g. transcription), audio (e.g. vocal features), and images (e.g. scene detection) from videos of complex political events. The outputs of our pipeline can then be readily used for a wide range of substantive analyses. We validate our approach through an examination of local government meetings in the United States, showing how we can accurately segment audio, identify speakers, transcribe speech, and detect gender in videos of varying structure and audio/video quality. As a demonstration, we examine participation by gender in over 1,000 hours of school board meeting videos.",

          "abstract": "What drives the supply of crime news? While prior research focuses on news media reporting, we study a crucial upstream gatekeeper of information: the police. We argue that the police act as strategic bureaucrats who increase the disclosure of out-group cues (ethnicity, nationality) when immigration is salient to signal transparency to the public. To test this, we use an LLM annotation pipeline to code out-group cues in about one million press releases published by local police stations across Germany (2014–2024). Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we demonstrate an increase in out-group cues in police communications (1) following a nationwide shock to immigration salience (the 2015/16 Cologne New Year’s Eve sexual assaults), and (2) in the days before regional state elections in which immigration is a salient campaign issue. Our findings demonstrate how bureaucratic discretion shapes the supply of politically charged information.",

          "abstract": "Family demographic behavior is often studied as a response to structural conditions or parental characteristics, yet children may themselves shape key family trajectories through evocative gene-environment correlations. Using the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and analyzing 40,000 genotyped mother–father–child trios, we test whether children’s polygenic indices (PGIs) predict subsequent fertility, partnership dissolution, and transition to marriage. Accounting for parental PGIs, we found limited evidence for evocative effects across most traits. The exception was that children with a higher ADHD PGI predicted increased parental partnership dissolution (7% [CI=2.9-11.8%] per s.d.), especially in families with daughters (11% [CI=4.9-18%] per s.d.), higher socioeconomic status (15% [CI=7.7-23.2%] per s.d.), and older maternal age at first birth (10% [CI=3-17%] per s.d.). The main source of variation is the socio-economic dimension where child-driven effects are stronger in higher-SES families. The study provides evidence for evocative gene-environment correlations in family demography, demonstrating the importance of child-to-parent effects in shaping family trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers across the US have introduced legislation aimed at weakening existing vaccine-related policies (e.g., vaccine mandates in employment or educational settings). However, reports of anti-vaccine policymaking (AVP) across state legislatures have been largely anecdotal. We offer a first-of-its-kind effort to quantify and standardize reporting of the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of AVP by introducing the State Vaccine Policy Project (SVPP) database; a content-coded record of every piece of vaccine-related legislation introduced across all US state houses from 2019 - 2023. SVPP data reveal that both the total volume and proportion of anti-vaccine bills introduced across state legislatures has been increasing steadily since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 1 in 10 anti-vaccine bills signed into law during that period. We also show that the rise in anti-vaccine legislating is attributable primarily to the legislative actions of state lawmakers affiliated with the Republican party, and that dozens of anti-vaccine bills directly aim to reduce the scope of vaccine mandates. In addition to offering a standardized and exhaustive assessment of the growth of anti-vaccine policy making across US state legislatures, our work provides scholars with a unique dataset for studying changes in the vaccine policy environment.",

          "abstract": "This preprint presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding intersex bodies through the lenses of corporality, subjectivity, and emotions. Drawing from anthropological, feminist, and philosophical traditions, this work challenges the biomedical construction of intersexuality and proposes embodied approaches that center lived experience and agency. The analysis traces genealogies of bodily thought—from Cartesian dualism through phenomenology to contemporary feminist theory—while examining how power structures, medical discourses, and cultural norms shape intersex experiences. By articulating sociological and individual levels of analysis, this framework reveals intersexuality as a contested field where expert knowledge confronts activist voices, and where bodies become sites of both disciplinary control and transformative resistance. This theoretical contribution provides essential tools for ethnographic research on intersex lives and broader questions of bodily difference, gender variance, and biomedical normalization.",

          "authors": "Thejan Anil",
          "abstract": "The ESG Resonance Model (ESGRM) conceptualises how organisational communication, employee psychology, and stakeholder perception interact within the ESG landscape. It argues that stakeholder fatigue and organisational burnout are interconnected outcomes of communicative overload and misalignment between intent and action. Building on burnout theory (Maslach &amp; Leiter, 1997) and the Job Demands–Resources framework (Demerouti et al., 2001), ESGRM integrates five domains—signal quality, signal intensity, alignment, assurance, and employee sense-making—within a quarterly feedback loop.\n\nThe model proposes that when communication clarity and internal coherence are high, resonance strengthens, fostering trust and authenticity. Conversely, excessive signalling without alignment accelerates fatigue and erodes legitimacy. ESGRM thus functions as both a diagnostic and corrective framework, guiding organisations to evaluate and refine their communicative balance. Though conceptual in nature, it provides a foundation for future empirical testing through sentiment analysis and longitudinal feedback, positioning ESGRM as a dynamic bridge between communication theory and sustainable organisational strategy.",

But – let’s be honest – it’s a lot more fun to just start playing with the data. This can however be a dangerous game to play. This paper presents a case study of this matter using the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). A survey question included in this study attempts to measure student truancy across countries over time. The international survey documentation suggests an identical question has been used across countries and cycles. Yet the national documentation illustrates how a subtle – yet important – change to the wording was made in some countries in 2015. We demonstrate how researchers could easily miss this change and how this would impact inferences in changes in truancy rates before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Attempts to use artificial intelligence and large language models to spot this problem resulted in overconfidently incorrect advice. The findings thus serve as a reminder to even the most experienced data analysts (including ourselves) – ALWAYS READ THE SURVEY DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY.",

          "authors": "Sami Nenno; Philipp Lorenz-Spreen",
          "abstract": "Private wealth in Germany is highly concentrated and often inherited rather than earned. This concentration reinforces unequal distributions of political influence, income, and other capacities linked to wealth. Although public support for stricter taxation is widespread, left-wing parties have so far failed to reintroduce a net wealth tax or close inheritance tax loopholes. We analyze the social media communication from 2017 to 2025 on Facebook, Instagram, and X by German members of parliament and ads by business lobby groups. Specifically, we examine the salience of wealth taxation, argumentation patterns for and against stricter net wealth, inheritance, or gift taxes, and which arguments resonate with users. Our findings indicate that wealth taxation is not a frequent topic among members of parliament but generates higher user engagement compared to other policy issues. Left-wing parties rely on value-based arguments stressing inequality, injustice, and responsibility but rarely present concrete data on inequality or tax exemptions. Conservatives highlight threats to inherited homes, liberals emphasize economic risks, and the far right questions state intervention. We conclude that left-wing communication likely resonates primarily with their own supporters rather than broader audiences. The study contributes to a more holistic description of the political communication of  economic inequality.",

          "authors": "Olga Leshchenko; Heejung Chung",
          "abstract": "Telecommuting is often portrayed as a work-life balance measure. Though, in theory, telecommuting can provide workers with more time for leisure and family, due to the boundary blurring between work and life spheres, it can exacerbate gender inequalities by pushing women to carry out more domestic work while increasing men’s time in paid work. Empirically, the evidence is mixed. We extend the debate by exploring how individuals’ gender role attitudes moderate the relationship between telecommuting and the division of domestic work. We apply hybrid models to the German Family Panel data. The data covers the timespan from 2008 to 2021, which includes the unique COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that gender role attitudes matter. When getting access to telecommuting, egalitarian men increased their contribution to childcare, while traditional men did not. Similarly, telecommuting traditional women increased their childcare contribution. The pattern remained the same during the expansion of telecommuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic: only telecommuting traditional women and telecommuting egalitarian men increased their childcare contribution. The results of this study suggest that telecommuting has the potential to serve as a ‘great equaliser.’ However, achieving this requires actively promoting more egalitarian views on gender roles.",

          "abstract": "The field of app studies has been home to significant methodological creativity in its attempts to better understand the platform society and platform capitalism. Perhaps no approach has been more inspirational than the walkthrough method. However, the walkthrough method’s apparent popularity hides the fact that few studies actually use the method as presented. While many studies cite it, only some make thorough use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment World-Through, that builds on the walkthrough method but engages more productively with the app’s interface. This approach combines the technical walkthrough with a new theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment. This new approach attempts to deliver on the original promise of the walkthrough method: the rigorous and systemic study of apps where the researcher engages directly with an app’s interface.",

The findings revealed that older adults who had previously been infected by the virus exhibited better mental health compared to their non-infected counterparts (p = .049, d = 0.48).

          "authors": "Cheng Lin; Adel Daoud",
          "abstract": "Causal reasoning is central to social sciences, supporting both theory development and testing. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to analyze texts across social sciences, yet their abilities to interpret causal statements and reconstruct causal structures remain uncertain in social science texts. This study examines to what extent LLMs can (a) identify causal sentences and (b) recover causal edges to reconstruct directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This examination relies on two text-based simulations and one experiment using real sociological texts. In simulated texts, models reliably detected explicit causal statements but often misclassified non-causal ones, particularly when probabilistic language was used. For causal graph recovery, clarity of expression strongly influenced accuracy. Across 500 replications with real texts, performance ranged from moderate to near perfect, revealing both model heterogeneity and inconsistency. These results indicate that LLMs can assist in extracting causal knowledge from social science texts, yet accurate inference of complex causal mechanisms still requires careful theoretical reasoning. Future applications may benefit from targeted prompting and domain-specific fine-tuning, but their contribution to sociological theorizing should be carefully assessed against traditional methodological standards.",

          "abstract": "A substantial body of research indicates that graduates’ field of study is a key predictor of the gender wage gap. While previous studies often compare groups based on women's minority status in a given field, we reframe this by distinguishing between care and non-care fields—defined by their links to stereotypically feminized characteristics. Using administrative data from Italy and Finland, we firstly investigate whether gender gaps in wages and other significant aspects of jobs differ between graduates of care- and non-care related fields of study. Second, adopting a comparative perspective, we further examine whether these gender gaps vary between Italy and Finland, two countries with different levels of gender inequality. Findings support the gender comparative advantage argument that women experience smaller gaps in outcomes when graduating from care-oriented fields than other fields, narrowing disparities in employment, wages, and job authority, and eliminating gender disparities in access to high-service occupations. Analyses are broadly consistent across Italy and Finland, suggesting limited cross-country variation in gender gaps in outcomes when comparing care and non-care fields.  \n\nKeywords: Care fields; Gender gap; Labour market; Administrative data; Comparative research",

Partnerless older adults—particularly\nnever married—were more likely to receive practical help from siblings than those with\npartners. While childlessness alone did not increase sibling support, kinless older adults\nreceived the highest levels of help. Kinless individuals also provided more assistance and\npersonal care to siblings, even across long distances.

Finally, a 10 km threshold seems adequate for approximating help and care\nexchanges between siblings.\nDiscussion and Implications\nFindings highlight siblings’ role as a compensatory source of support in later life.

We conducted an online experiment (N = 651) testing the effectiveness of nature images and self-efficacy messages in activating state nature connectedness, and an quasi-experimental field study in a hotel, using the hot water consumption of 6,154 guests as the dependent variable. Results indicate that a lush green landscape image featuring water droplets combined with a self-efficacy message significantly increased state nature connectedness (and water-saving intentions). However, the intervention did not translate into significant reductions in water use, challenging the assumption that a state nature connectedness intervention directly influences pro-environmental behavior. These findings underscore the necessity of field experiments in assessing the real-world effectiveness of behavior change interventions and emphasize the value of publishing null results to advance cumulative knowledge on promoting pro-environmental behavior change.",

          "abstract": "Interventions designed to promote pro-environmental behaviour often yield inconsistent results. The Targeted Interception Theory of Behaviour Change offers a framework for improving effectiveness by aligning intervention strategies with the cognitive characteristics of behaviours, conceptualised along a continuum from habitual to scripted to considered behaviours. Across three studies, we empirically test key assumptions of this theory. Study 1 classified 18 pro-environmental behaviours based on self-reported mental processing, identifying four focal behaviours that span the continuum: purchasing energy-efficient white goods (considered), setting heating sustainably (scripted), choosing vegetarian/vegan meals at restaurants (semi-habitual), and purchasing carbon offsets with flights (highly habitual). Study 2 comprised four survey experiments comparing cognitive interventions (environmental messaging), behavioural-guidance interventions, and choice architecture changes (default change) against a control condition. While Study 1 confirmed that behaviours differ in cognitive demands, results from Study 2 were mixed: default changes increased intentions to purchase energy-efficient white goods and to choose vegetarian/vegan meals, whereas other interventions rarely outperformed the control. Study 3 reanalysed meta-analytic data from 137 field interventions, coding each by behaviour type (habitual or scripted) and intervention strategy (cognitive, behavioural-guidance, or choice architecture). These results supported theoretical predictions: choice architecture interventions were effective across both behaviour types; behavioural-guidance interventions were moderately effective for scripted behaviours but ineffective for habitual behaviours; and cognitive interventions had negligible impact. Together, these findings provide initial empirical support for Targeted Interception Theory, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to cognitive demands and underscoring the robustness of choice architecture as a strategy for promoting pro-environmental behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies have demonstrated social media's role in post-repression backlash mobilization but have yet to consider how they can sustain movements through long term repression. We explore this possibility by studying how Finnish climate activists responded to government repression in their social media behavior. We first conducted semi-structured interviews to see how activists understand the interplay between activism, repression, and social media affordances. Findings from our interviews suggest that activists are compelled to continue participating in the movement despite repression because the risk of social media amplifying individual-level chilling into movement-wide cascading demobilization outweighs risks from repression. We looked for evidence of this mechanism in the networked communication of Finnish climate activists on Twitter using temporal network analyses. Our findings show that activists' Twitter participation remained remarkably consistent despite offline repression, and that their communication patterns exhibited centralization tendencies that likely sustain the movement.",

Among them, Sinofuturism—which fuses local cultural symbols with futuristic imagination—achieved the highest social engagement, highlighting how strong cultural signifiers effectively stimulate high user participation.\n(2) Emotional expression is highly context-dependent: mobile contexts carry significantly more joy than fixed contexts, and decorative attributes further amplify positive emotions.\n(3) Functional products exhibit notably more cohesive emotional semantics, whereas decorative products display more dispersed emotional expressions. Collectively, these findings support the core proposition of our proposed Situational Self-Expression (SSE) theory—that self-expression is jointly shaped by usage context and product attributes.\nThese insights not only reconstruct McCracken’s Meaning Transfer Model (MTM) into an updated Meaning Co-Creation Model (MCcM), but also advance human-AI collaborative creation beyond virtual showcases into real-world consumption loops.

Despite increasing research on the political consequences of internal migration, there is little guidance on how to disentangle compositional from exposure effects when analyzing the causal effect of internal migration on district-level outcomes. In this paper, we define compositional effects within a standard potential outcome model, and we demonstrate that compositional and exposure effects jointly constitute the total causal effect of internal migration. We discuss potential avenues to identify, bound, and estimate compositional effects, leveraging additional data and assumptions. To illustrate the importance of disentangling compositional from exposure effects, we analyze the exodus of East Germans to West Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, demonstrating how out-migration to West Germany shaped electoral outcomes in East Germany through compositional effects.",

In this paper, we show how a small group of stubborn workers following their own, imperfect but independent, information may help mitigate the risks of AI advice in their organization.

          "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with high rates of acute care utilization, yet the role of food insecurity as a driver of hospitalizations remains underexplored, particularly from the perspective of advocacy organizations that support affected communities. This pilot study examined whether organizations that perceive higher levels of food insecurity among people with SCD also perceive more frequent SCD-related hospitalizations. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between June 10, 2025, and July 21, 2025, with five sickle cell advocacy organizations located in the United States, Uganda, and Tanzania. Organizations were asked to rate the severity of food insecurity among the individuals and families they serve and to estimate the frequency of SCD-related hospitalizations within their communities. Ratings were converted to ordinal scores and analyzed using Spearman’s rank-order correlation to assess the association between perceived food insecurity and hospitalization frequency. Results showed a moderate positive correlation (ρ = 0.60), suggesting that organizations serving communities with higher perceived food insecurity also reported more frequent hospitalizations among people with SCD. While limited by a small sample size and reliance on organizational perceptions rather than patient-level data, these exploratory findings highlight food insecurity as a potentially important, and often overlooked, factor in SCD-related health outcomes. Advocacy organizations may offer valuable, context-specific insights into how social and structural determinants shape hospitalization patterns. Larger, multi-level studies that integrate organizational, clinical, and patient-reported data are needed to clarify causal pathways and to inform interventions aimed at reducing preventable hospitalizations among people living with SCD.",

          "abstract": "How did geopolitics shape East Asia’s economic development? We show that U.S. war procurement during the Vietnam War—a fiscal shock which peaked at 2.9 percent of South Korea's GDP, rivaling the Marshall Plan—catalyzed Korea’s export-led industrialization. We construct a new firm-level dataset linking Korean export records with U.S. procurement contracts (1966–1974) to estimate the causal impact of winning a contract on export performance. Winning an initial contract increases a firm’s likelihood of exporting by 46 percentage points and triples its export value. These effects extend beyond sales to the United States: treated firms also expanded into third-country markets. We validate our research design using unique, contemporaneous firm-level export targets, showing that contracts were not anticipated and unrelated to export shocks. The policy had lasting effects. We find that firms treated in the 1960s responded more strongly to South Korea’s heavy and chemical industry drive of the 1970s, indicating that U.S. procurement and domestic industrial policy were complementary. Our findings reveal a neglected channel through which Cold War geopolitics helped shape the East Asian economic miracle.",

          "abstract": "The global economy operates under a fundamentally flawed informational ecosystem dominated by quasi-holistic perspectives that have fragmented understanding and perpetuated systemic failures throughout human history. This paper introduces Supra-level Holistic Re-engineering (SHR) as the first genuinely holistic methodology for addressing the global economy as an integrated whole. SHR synthesizes six key ideas—the clean slate principle from Business Process Reengineering, holism, narrative synthesis, systems thinking, the global economic system concept, and organizational advantages—to transcend limitations inherent in existing concepts and theories.\nThe analysis reveals that quasi-holistic definitions and semantics embedded in social science literature serve as the root cause of fragmentation, creating a vicious four-phase cycle that generates infinite convoluted loops of discrepancies. These discrepancies manifest at all levels in the economy as gaps, overlaps, controversies, and conflicts that disrupt workflows and push the global economy toward self-destruction. Most insidiously, an implicit quasi-holistic framework has enabled the financial system to dominate the global economy, transforming money from a medium of exchange into the ultimate end, thereby distorting true reality and robbing productivity from all other service systems.\nThis paper redefines the Global Economic System/World Economic System as RGES (Redefined GES), establishing it as an overarching structure coordinating all subsystems through interconnectivity and interrelationships across space, time, and level. The urgency for this paradigm shift is underscored by environmental deadlines, escalating financial crises, and geopolitical tensions. With NASA confirming Earth's uninhabitability by 2600 and critical turnaround points potentially already passed, SHR represents an existential necessity for steering humanity toward a sustainable future before reaching the point of no return.",

The impact on fertility of extended families and the alloparental help with childcare they can provide has received much less attention. Moreover, there is an important lacuna in the existing studies of this problem, as it is mostly approached through correlational studies, while the presence of a causal link remains unclear. Using an instrumental variables approach, we demonstrate that prevalence of extended family structures exert a causal influence on fertility. A one standard-deviation increase in prevalence of extended families is associated with approximately 1.07 additional children per woman. These results highlight that family structure is not only statistically significant but also demographically consequential in shaping fertility outcomes.",

          "abstract": "As software has been slipping into everyday life of citizens, digital-enabled relations have become normalised, typically through mobile apps and their platforms. Moreover, this change is happening within a neoliberal framework where citizenship itself is measured and shaped through market imperatives of consumerism, data-extraction, and individual responsibility. Citizenship itself is therefore a multiple concept expressed through the occurrences of digitally mediated encounters which I try to capture in this chapter focusing on the deployment of platforms for collaborative governance. This is one emerging aspect of the journey of ‘platform citizenship’ which is perceived as both innovative and necessary vis-a-vis declining traditional political and civic participation. One of these platforms is Decidim, the case-study presented here: this has been conceived by ethical hackers and activists in Barcelona and has become an internationally awarded and replicated project. \nIn order to analyse the relationship between places and technologies, and to radically contextualise software relations further, I use the Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation (Cardullo and Kitchin, 2019a). I conclude that since citizen power cannot be routed through platform capitalism, we need to look away from mainstream big tech for meaningful examples of civic technologies for the common good, democratic governance and citizens’ meaningful participation. Remain to be asked if such endeavours would extend traditional political citizenship, re-politicising the smart city by producing collaborative forms of governance, or would these be new forms of ethics-washing and tokenistic tactics?",

They were recomposed into new item sets and retested to illustrate potential risks in item analysis and the implications of relying on biased items when measuring lexical ability. A total of 2,923 individuals taking admission tests for basic military training in Sweden between mid-November 2024 and mid-January 2025 responded to selections of synonym and antonym items alongside the Swedish Enlistment Battery. Item properties were analyzed within the framework of the Rasch model, focusing on subsets of items categorized by their pre-defined sex bias. Estimates of lexical ability based on these subsets were compared using t-tests, and stanine categories were analyzed through ordinal logistic regressions. As expected, the use of potentially sex-biased items led to inconsistent estimates of lexical ability, systematically favoring either male or female test takers, depending on the composition of the items. When all items were combined, clear evidence of multidimensionality and violations of measurement invariance emerged. By highlighting critical risks associated with biased item content, this study provides an illustrative case of concerns about fairness in verbal testing. It offers valuable insights for future item development and encourages continued methodological research to support the creation of equitable and valid assessments of lexical ability.",

Specifically, we identified the temporal changes in frequencies of emotional reporting and analysed and compared five group of strong emotion words (represented by crisis, damage, greenwashing, catastrophe, and wealth) through collocation analysis and concordance analysis. Our findings indicate that although the sentiment of coverage is more positive than negative, negative sentiment is gradually increasing over time. Both sides cover environmental and economic aspects of the transition; however, they differ in their priority area and the way they engage with these areas. Left-leaning newspapers emphasise environmental degradation, blame fossil fuels for the climate crisis, and call for urgent action. Right-leaning newspapers focus more on the economic impacts of transition, often framing policies as threats to jobs or prosperity while downplaying accountability for emissions. Across the spectrum, reporting tends to adopt a techno-optimist, business-as-usual stance that rarely challenges the idea of continuous economic growth. Implications for media, readers, and policymakers are discussed.",

This paper introduces the L-Canvas, a leadership-centered sociotechnical framework that guides when to trust algorithmic outputs, when to defer to automated recommendations, and when to override them. Drawing on concepts of sensemaking, trust, psychological safety, organizational ambidexterity, and high-reliability organizing, we propose a structured “leadership playbook” for integrating human judgment with AI in high-stakes decisions. We illustrate the framework with public case examples – a pretrial bail risk algorithm and the UK’s 2020 A-level grading algorithm – highlighting how leadership actions (or inaction) impacted trust and outcomes. We present a clearly labeled contribution statement and outline a preregistration-ready evaluation plan with open metrics (e.g. override precision, fairness gaps, decision variance, procedural justice indicators), accompanied by a printable L-Canvas diagram and a sample metrics CSV workbook. By centering leadership practices in sociotechnical systems, this work offers both a practical guide for decision-makers and a foundation for scholarly replication. The findings underscore that effective “leading judgment” in the age of AI requires not only technical excellence, but also cultural resilience, ethical commitment, and a willingness to learn and adapt.",

          "abstract": "From the smart urbanism of the 2010s to platform and AI urbanism(s) of the present-future, the ‘data-driven city’ has been imagined as a functional and controlled whole, impulsed and regulated by autonomous (humans off-the-loop) systems, and fed through powerful data infrastructure. AI urbanism, in particular, manifests the current climax of the long-standing desire to control digital technology in the city yet to come. An excessive focus on technology, however, risks de-contextualising it from the wider economic and political landscapes. \nWhile digital platforms have been structuring the fabric of daily urban life colonising almost any field of interest through their ecosystems and mobile apps, AI technologies start making their way into cities with: autonomous vehicles, city brains, Digital Twins and robotics. Advocates suggest these novel technologies have changed the geographies of their deployment – not confined to cities any more, rather on regional or global scales – and of their partnerships with city management – cities no longer having exclusive and central stage, rather participating to consortia with limited or secondary roles. Both these configurations have been framed as the ‘post-smart city’. \nBut, is there a paradigm shift between these versions of urbanism? Has the ‘smart city’ framework – the neoliberal project of linking private investment from technology firms into the management and governance of city living – substantially changed? And, finally, what role is expected for cities to take in this uncertain and evolving scenario? \nThe ‘data-driven city’ ought to be understood in pair with the development of data capitalism and the enormous expansion of its data infrastructure, markets and services. Thus, I invite to re-position this debate as an intensification of neoliberal (‘smart’ or ‘data-driven’) urbanism and its ideological assumptions: technological solutionism and smart mentality, and data extractivism, surveillance and control.",

          "abstract": "The rapid evolution of technology in education, the shifting needs of a diverse student population, and the increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and global engagement are among the new challenges facing faculty members in higher education today. Many faculty members encounter expectations that were not part of their graduate training nor experienced by their more senior colleagues. How can professional development programs address these evolving demands in higher education? What competencies define an effective faculty member in this contemporary landscape? To explore these questions, the study was designed and faculty members from higher education institutions were invited to participate in a research study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of professional development programs in addressing the evolving demands of higher education and identifying the key competencies required for faculty members to excel in this modern academia.\nThe research methodology employed in this study is a descriptive analysis of data collected from faculty members utilizing Excel and SPSS. The findings of the study indicate that professional development programs play a crucial role in equipping faculty members with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the challenges of modern higher education. The implications of these findings suggest that higher education institutions should prioritize investment in faculty development programs that address the evolving needs of faculty members.",

          "abstract": "Authoritarian regimes maintain strict control over information, making data access a challenge for the public, policymakers, and researchers. Official records are sometimes manipulated, selectively published, or erased, forcing analysts to navigate gaps and inconsistencies. This article introduces the Venezuelan Presidential Election Archive (VENPRES-A), a novel dataset on presidential election results in Venezuela from 2006 to 2024. VENPRES-A consists of three main datasets: a polling station-level dataset with 77,737 observations, a municipal-level dataset with 1,668 observations, and a long-format party-level dataset for the 2024 election with 953,800 observations, providing granular insights into spatial dynamics of political competition, voting behavior, and subnational electoral trends. The dataset leverages a combination of sources: official releases from electoral authorities, official data archives collected by civil society and opposition actors, and secondary sources. Combining these sources was crucial to compensate for the withdrawal of all official records since July 2024. This empirical contribution enhances the study of subnational electoral dynamics in authoritarian environments.",

          "authors": "Dina Kamel",
          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of undevelopable economies—contexts in which development is not merely delayed or distorted, but structurally foreclosed due to persistent, self-reinforcing institutional dysfunction. While existing classifications such as “fragile,” “failing,” or “least developed” states suggest the potential for eventual progress, the notion of undevelopability challenges this assumption. It signals a qualitative shift: some institutional systems may be fundamentally resistant to transformation within prevailing development paradigms.\nThe term is used diagnostically rather than deterministically. It highlights structural entrenchment—not cultural incapacity or societal failure—and draws attention to contexts where institutions function primarily to sustain elite power, suppress reform, and replicate dysfunction over time.\nGrounded in institutional theory, path dependence, and critical development scholarship, the paper advances this conceptual framework through case studies of Somalia, Haiti, and Venezuela—each illustrating a distinct mode of institutional foreclosure. It concludes by reflecting on the implications for aid architecture, donor strategy, and development theory.\nRecognizing undevelopability does not imply fatalism. Rather, it invites a more grounded, differentiated approach to theorizing development—one that acknowledges the political and historical limits of institutional change in fractured contexts, and reconsiders what is possible, ethical, and realistic in such environments.",

          "abstract": "As churches preach stewardship of the Earth and social media influencers post pictures of bamboo toothbrushes, the crossroads between personal faith and green purchase intentions demands closer study. This study explores how a person’s depth of religious belief influences their intention to buy green products, and whether conspicuous virtue signaling (CVS) motivates those intentions. CVS refers to publicly showcasing one’s ethical actions to express moral identity or gain social approval. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, Goal Content Theory, and the Theory of Reasoned Action, this research distinguishes between intrinsic religiosity and extrinsic religiosity and how they influence green choices when motivated by virtue signaling. The study employed structural equation modelling to analyse survey data from 206 students and young professionals in Ghana. The findings reveal that intrinsic religiosity significantly boosts green purchase intentions, while extrinsic religiosity does not directly lead to greener buying choices. However, both intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity increase virtue signaling behaviors. Interestingly, even individuals who engage in religious activities for social reasons are more likely to \"show off\" their eco-friendly behavior online, which in turn increases their likelihood of intending to buy green products. These results suggest that public displays of environmental responsibility, whether driven by genuine faith or social image, can powerfully motivate sustainable consumer behavior. The study offers new insights for marketers and policymakers: green campaigns can appeal not only to private moral values but also to the human desire for social recognition. Framing eco-friendly choices as both personally meaningful and publicly admirable could effectively engage religious audiences in promoting sustainability.",

          "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly generative language models, into daily life is fundamentally altering human problem-solving approaches. This pilot study from a multinational longitudinal research program investigates the patterns, perceptions, and consequences of AI use across different task complexities. A survey was administered to a diverse, highly educated sample (N=21), capturing data on demographics, AI usage habits, and ethical perceptions. Crucially, the study employed problem vignettes of graduated complexity to examine actual behavior. Results reveal the emergence of a hybrid problem-solving culture where AI is strategically embedded into workflows, primarily for ideation, formulation, and research. While AI consultation increases with problem difficulty, a critical \"verification crisis\" emerges as tasks become more complex, participants' self-assessed ability to verify AI output declines sharply, creating a significant gap between their belief in an AI-generated solution's correctness and their ability to prove it. Furthermore, a \"belief-performance gap\" was identified, where perceived correctness of AI solutions exceeded actual ground-truth accuracy on complex problems. These findings underscore a paradigm shift towards human-AI collaboration and highlight the urgent need for digital literacy frameworks and system designs that prioritize verification skills alongside AI adoption to ensure reliable outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Violence Perception Index (VPI), a novel methodology for quantifying violence-related discourse through geolocated YouTube comments. Utilizing the YouTube API and natural language processing techniques, the VPI measures public references to violence in 3,398,143 geolocated videos across Mexico (2020–2024). This approach provides spatiotemporally granular data on violence perceptions, extending beyond traditional event-based datasets by capturing not only documented violence but also rumors, fears, and community discourse about violence—dimensions that influence community behavior and social stability independently of official records.\nViolence scores are constructed using a weighted Spanish-language dictionary developed through semantic network expansion from violence-related seed terms. The dictionary-based scoring approach demonstrates moderate-to-substantial agreement with large language model classifications across 700 stratified comments (75-81% agreement), validating the method's capacity to systematically identify violence-related discourse at scale while maintaining computational efficiency for processing millions of comments.\nThe VPI is benchmarked against established violence indicators including ACLED fatalities and official municipal homicide statistics through panel regression specifications incorporating comprehensive spatial and temporal fixed effects. Analysis reveals systematic geographic heterogeneity: the VPI correlates strongly with ACLED data in high-population areas but exhibits stronger correlation with official homicide records in low-population contexts. Rather than constituting a methodological limitation, this pattern demonstrates the VPI's enhanced sensitivity in marginalized and remote regions where news-based datasets suffer from systematic reporting bias. The methodology is immediately scalable across languages and geographies, providing complementary intelligence for conflict monitoring, early warning systems, and policy interventions in precisely those underrepresented areas where traditional event-based monitoring systems provide incomplete coverage.",

          "abstract": "Background: Research on mental health practitioners experiences of supporting transgender and gender diverse (‘trans’) youth has largely focused on the challenges, emotional burdens, and ethical complexities of this work, while overlooking the rewarding joyful dimensions.\nAim: Informed by calls for desire-based inquiry, this study explored the joys that mental health practitioners experience in their work with trans youth. \nMethods: Twelve Australian mental health practitioners were interviewed between May and August 2025 about the joyful aspects of their work with trans youth. Participants were aged 26–58 years and represented the fields of psychology, psychiatry, social work, counselling, and occupational therapy across both public and private settings. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. \nResults: Practitioners described profound joy, reward, and fulfilment in their work, articulated across five themes: (i) affirmation and authenticity of trans youth in practice, (ii) trans youth transformation and hope, (iii) familial love, bonds, and support, (iv) professional collegiality and co-learning, and (v) personal and professional growth and impact. Trans joy was experienced as “contagious,” generating hope and a sense of shared humanity. By reframing trans-affirming mental health practice through the lens of joy, this study shows how such work can be a powerful source of meaning, fulfilment, and growth. Recognising these affective dimensions of practice offers a more balanced understanding of gender-affirming care and underscores the importance of supporting those who deliver it within an increasingly politicised context.",

          "abstract": "We propose a unified microeconomic theory that takes the behavioral rules of firms in real markets as the endogenous mechanism through which market structures are generated, replacing the standard practice of imposing perfect competition, monopoly, and other market forms as exogenous assumptions. Under a set of minimal axioms (consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, firm entry/exit mechanisms, and market clearing) and by introducing realistic cost and demand structures (firm-level cost heterogeneity, fixed costs, and demand elasticity, among others), pricing behavior and market structures long treated as exogenous (such as perfect competition and monopoly) are derived endogenously as equilibrium outcomes of firms' profit-maximizing behavior. Within a single framework, the theory nests traditional cost and marginal analysis, game-theoretic approaches to imperfect competition, and the Walrasian general equilibrium model; different regions of the parameter space naturally yield equilibrium outcomes corresponding to perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, and competitive-fringe structures. Our analysis shows that perfect competition is only a highly symmetric and intrinsically unstable equilibrium point: even small cost differences suffice to push the system toward more common monopoly or oligopoly configurations, while positive feedback mechanisms render these structures stable, helping to explain why market power is not easily competed away. Under empirically observable premises, the theory coherently derives the principal market forms and, in doing so, clarifies the domains of applicability of various classic models. It can also be used to predict which market structures industries will evolve toward under given conditions, providing a unified and operational theoretical foundation for empirical research, industrial policy, and firms' business and competitive strategy decision-making.",

The paper identifies a parallel trend, in which major AI companies (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) and academic publishers (Elsevier, Clarivate, Digital Science) have released similar summary-and-citation tools that, I argue, act as knowledge arbitrators by surfacing, ranking, and recommending scholarly work. Drawing on sociologist Robert Merton’s concept of the “Matthew effect”—by which prominent scholars accrue still more recognition—I argue that these AI tools risk reinforcing existing biases along lines of gender, geography, and institutional prestige. The problem is twofold: the models are trained on historically biased scholarship, and their filtering logic is inscrutable. My claim is that these tools are performative, not merely descriptive, as they may help enact the scholarly landscape they purport merely to represent. The commentary concludes that by handing over knowledge summary to computational probability and the profit motive, we risk worsening academic power structures while obscuring the process.",

We track “late-career” scientists—scientists with at least 25 years of publishing experience (N=320,564)—in 16 STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) and social science disciplines from 38 OECD countries for up to five decades. Our OECD sample includes 79.42% of late-career scientists globally. We examine the details of their mobility patterns as early-career, mid-career, and late-career scientists between decile-based productivity classes, from the bottom 10% to top 10% of the productivity distribution. Methodologically, we turn a large-scale bibliometric dataset (Scopus raw data) into a comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science. The global science system is highly immobile: half of global top performers continue their careers as top performers and one-third of global bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are extremely rare in science. The chances of moving radically up or down in productivity classes are marginal (1% or less). Our regression analyses show that productivity classes are highly path dependent: there is a single most important predictor of being a top performer, which is being a top performer at an earlier career stage.",

          "abstract": "This study examines biologists leaving science in 38 OECD countries in the past two decades. We use publication metadata from a global bibliometric database (raw Scopus data at the micro-level of individual scientists). In a cohort-based and longitudinal fashion, we follow individual men and women scientists over time, from their first to their last publication (N=86,178). We examine four academic disciplines: AGRI (agricultural and biological sciences), BIO (biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology), IMMU (immunology and microbiology), and NEURO (neuroscience). We apply survival analysis, conceptualizing scientific life as a sequence of scholarly publishing events. Our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows how women disappear from science: in BIO, about 60% are still in science after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and only 20% by the end of the period examined (i.e., after 19 years). The percentages are substantially higher for men: approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier estimations indicate that women in the largest discipline (BIO) are 23.26% more likely to leave science after 10 years and 39.74% more likely to leave science at the end of the study period. Gender difference in attrition, slightly visible after 5 years, increase consistently in later career stages. The probability of surviving for women after 15 years varies considerably, from 47.8% in AGRI to 27.6% in IMMU; for men, the probability is about a fifth higher. Our data show that with the passage of time, women disappear from science in ever-larger proportions compared to men. Gender differences in attrition in the four disciplines have been and continue to be high, but comparing the 2000 and 2010 cohorts, have slightly decreased over time.",

          "authors": "Alejandro Ciordia; Miranda Jessica Lubbers; Eva Jaspers; Jan-Willem Simons",
          "abstract": "Informal political conversations are vital for the functioning of liberal democracies, especially when they involve individuals with differing political views. While prior research suggests that incidental and non-political factors may guide individuals’ choice of discussion partners and outweigh strictly political ones, this article argues that these dynamics may shift depending on the topic of discussion. Drawing on original personal network data from the highly polarized context of Catalonia, Spain (65 citizens reporting on 663 social relationships), we compare discussion partner selection across three topics: general politics, Catalan independence (high polarization), and climate change (low polarization). We examine: (1) the extent to which political and non-political interpersonal factors facilitate or inhibit political discussion, and (2) whether their influence varies by issue polarization. Contrasting previous findings, our results reveal that opinion similarity is the strongest predictor of discussion partner selection across all topics, even when controlling for interaction opportunities, highlighting the role of purposeful partner selection. Selection on non-political factors such as tie strength, structural proximity, and socio-demographic similarity also occurs, but their influence varies depending on the issue being discussed. Tie strength and network centrality were more powerful predictors for discussion on the more polarized issue. Overall, the findings reveal that individuals selectively activate ties for political talk, and that issue polarization amplifies this selectivity, thus linking topic-alter dependence in informal political discussion networks with the growing literature on affective polarization.",

          "authors": "Renata Topinkova; Carsten Schwemmer",
          "abstract": "With roughly 40% of new couples meeting online, dating platforms have become commonplace. Yet, they share a common pitfall: a skewed gender ratio, with men substantially outnumbering women. Combined with prevailing gender norms—where men are expected to make the first move—this creates market congestion. Women are overwhelmed by messages and often face harassment, while many men struggle to receive any attention. We use computational experiments to examine how dating-platform designs affect individuals’ mating choices. We replicate popular app designs using a self-built web application and generate artificial profiles by combining images with socio-demographic data. Building on past research, we compare a “control” design with two interventions that reveal profiles’ popularity and capacity. Based on 66.132 profile ratings from participants in four countries, we find that the experimental conditions alone do not significantly shift user choices. We then analyze treatment heterogeneity using our large sample. Results show that visual and textual capacity indicators reduce the number of likes for highly attractive profiles, particularly when rated by men. However, these interventions do not increase engagement with less attractive profiles. These findings suggest that instead of redirecting attention to less attractive users, the intervention mostly benefits those who are already popular.",

We conceptualize the SPI as a locus where value-carrying signals—natural outputs from one community that serve as inputs for another—are exchanged. Using this framework, we analytically differentiate three common SPI modalities: Science Policy, Science Advice, and Science Diplomacy. Furthermore, we identify the potential for reinforcing feedback loops, particularly between Science Policy and Science Advice within national contexts, where each community's output systematically enhances the other's effectiveness, illustrating a pathway to a more productive science-policy relationship.",

Pauer, Linner, and Erb (2024) called for broader methods and historical perspectives. This commentary brings together such evidence from outside psychology: quasi-experimental studies of military conscription, longitudinal research on fraternity hazing, and new archival work on When Prophecy Fails and other prophetic movements. Across democratic, authoritarian, and small-group settings, coerced or effortful participation fails to generate the attitudinal justification predicted by induced compliance. Across fraternities, hazing does not predict greater group solidarity. Cults do not tend to survive failed prophecies. Together, these findings suggest that the effect is fragile and context-dependent, and that its privileged status in social psychology warrants re-examination",

Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 as a quasi-natural experiment, I study the processes of cohort formation by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans across multiple national surveys which collectively span from 2016 to 2024. The findings consistently show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement, a pattern visible much more so among younger than older individuals. Moreover, the changes persisted for younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization.

          "abstract": "The accessibility of scholarly research plays a crucial role in shaping academic impact and societal engagement. This study examines how Open Access (OA) models - Gold, Hybrid-Gold, Green, and Bronze - as well as Closed Access are associated with bibliometric and altmetric indicators in publications authored by Israeli researchers from 2013 to 2023. By integrating Scopus and PlumX data, the study analyzes variations in academic impact (citations, captures, and usage) and societal engagement (social media and mentions) across access models and over time. The findings show that Bronze OA is associated with higher levels of bibliometric and altmetric indicators. Hybrid-Gold OA demonstrated citation and altmetric gains that closely approached those of Bronze OA, with the highest levels of mentions. In contrast, Closed Access exhibits the highest usage metrics. Additionally, a greater number of authors corresponds with higher bibliometric and altmetric values. The relationship between academic impact and societal engagement has strengthened in recent years, particularly for Open Access publications, suggesting an increasing alignment between public attention and academic recognition. Furthermore, publications with high academic impact, strong societal engagement, and multiple authors are more commonly associated with Open Access status. The association between societal engagement and academic impact appears strongest among high-impact publications, whereas author count shows greater explanatory power among lower-impact work. These patterns offer valuable insights for researchers, institutions, policymakers, and publishers seeking to better understand scholarly dissemination. They also contribute to ongoing discussions on Open Access policies by describing patterns of access, engagement, and impact in an evolving academic landscape.",

While open science practices have become increasingly common in quantitative research, their application in qualitative research remains complex due to the interpretive, iterative, and sensitive nature of qualitative inquiry. This tutorial addresses these challenges by offering a format for audit trailing enabling researchers to make the research process open. The format is grounded in key concepts such as transparency, reproducibility, traceability, auditability, reflexivity, and positionality. Supplementary materials, including guiding questions and a blank template, are provided to support implementation. A pilot application illustrates how the audit trail offers a feasible pathway for integrating open science practices into qualitative research while safeguarding participant confidentiality.",

          "abstract": "Healthcare services around the world are undergoing a rapid process of digitalisation that presents novel threats to healthcare workers and patients across humanitarian settings. This review evaluates the key mechanisms by which emerging digital technologies are reshaping humanitarian practice and posing new challenges to patients, practitioners and policy-makers in low-resource environments.\n\nFirst, we examine emergent physical and psychological harms stemming from digital technologies at the individual patient level, summarising the latest evidence on injuries from drone-induced trauma, multi-robotic systems (MRS) and electromagnetic (EM) weapons. Second, we discuss population-level risks in global health settings, detailing the clinical harms associated with hospital cyberattacks in hybrid warfare and the novel challenges of AI-enhanced technologies for non-profit agencies attempting to deliver care (e.g., misinformation and “Deepfakes”). Further, we illustrate the new vulnerabilities that emerge as humanitarian agencies transition to electronic and biometric databases, highlighting the associated privacy risks for asylum seekers and refugees. Drawing together the latest insights from frontline practitioners, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations (UN), we showcase specific technological threats affecting vulnerable patient groups, such as the deployment of GPS trackers and implants by sex trafficking groups, and the use of social media by modern slavery networks. \n\nThis article introduces global health and humanitarian practitioners to essential digital concepts that are increasingly relevant to their work in the field, including Swarm Intelligence technologies, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), Large Language Models (LLMs), Cyberwar, Netwar and electromagnetic (EM) warfare. Framed through the lens of clinical care, we shine a light on the neglected intersection of humanitarian practice and digital technology, demonstrating that patients who are marginalised globally are often at greatest risk from technological harm.",

Fricker’s ethico-epistemic notion of epistemic injustice, which focuses on harms to knowers rather than the truth of claims, struggles to apply in empirical fields where error can have material health consequences. In global health, the usage tends to conflate moral recognition with epistemic warrant. It encourages the levelling of credibility across competing claims irrespective of evidence. I trace how decolonial and pluriversal rhetoric—drawing on Quijano, Grosfoguel, Mignolo, and Lugones—extends this conflation into ontological pluralism, dissolving truth into perspective while retaining universalist health ambitions. Through cases of spirit children, umbilical cord care, and snakebite treatment, I show how these frameworks can licence harmful practices and obscure structural analyses of power independent of coloniality. I conclude by sketching a modest alternative: epistemic humility, realist standards of evidence, and procedural justice in access to the means of inquiry.",

Yet little guidance exists on how to select measures that are both theoretically robust and practically usable, and many researchers and practitioners remain unaware of the implications, biases, and consequences of their methodological choices. This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Background: The debate over the impact of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) structural adjustment programs on borrowing countries has been a central topic in political economy for decades. The empirical evidence is profoundly heterogeneous and often contradictory.\nObjective: This systematic review with narrative synthesis synthesizes and critically analyzes the literature to assess the effects of such programs on key indicators like poverty, income inequality, social spending (health and education), health outcomes (mortality, infectious diseases), the labor market, and informality.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted in five academic databases and grey literature, following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 53 studies and empirical contributions that met predefined selection criteria were included. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, paying special attention to the control of endogeneity and selection bias. Due to the methodological heterogeneity of the studies, the results were synthesized narratively.\nResults: A minority of studies, often employing methodologies with a higher risk of bias such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM), find no significant negative effects. In contrast, a robust body of research, using quasi-experimental designs with a low risk of bias like Instrumental Variables (IV), documents an increase in inequality, a deterioration of health outcomes (especially in tuberculosis and child mortality), and a rise in the informal economy as a consequence of IMF conditionalities.\nConclusion: The differences in findings are largely attributed to the diversity of methodologies and the rigor with which they address causal inference. Higher-quality evidence suggests that IMF programs, particularly those with austerity conditionalities and structural reforms, impose significant social costs. These impacts call for a redesign of conditionality that prioritizes social protection to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.",

          "abstract": "The growing interest in sustainability has generated a vast academic literature on the intersection of climate change, green finance, and financial markets. However, heterogeneity in methodologies and results often makes it difficult to draw unified conclusions. This paper presents a review of meta-analyses and systematic literature reviews to synthesize the current state of knowledge. By analyzing a corpus of 22 reviews, we assess the consensus on three key areas: 1) the impact of climate risk (physical and transition) on asset valuation, 2) the existence and magnitude of a green financing premium (the \"greenium\"), and 3) the effects of green finance practices on corporate and banking profitability. Our findings indicate an emerging consensus on the pricing of physical climate risk in the real estate market and a modest but persistent negative premium for green bonds. However, the impact of sustainable finance on financial profitability remains ambiguous and highly dependent on the methodological context. This synthesis consolidates quantitative findings, evaluates prevailing methodologies, identifies research gaps, and proposes an integration theory with an agenda for future research, highlighting the need for greater standardization in metrics and analytical approaches to strengthen the robustness of empirical conclusions.",

          "abstract": "Although scholars initially hypothesized that exile should deescalate conflict, recent empirical studies find that exile fuels political instability. We extend this finding by investigating the conditions under which exile exacerbates domestic contention. Drawing on an original database of exile participation in revolutions, we show that revolutionary situations with an exiled challenger tend to last longer and generate more violence than those with domestically-based challengers. Additional analyses illuminate the mechanisms behind this finding. First, exiles have a greater influence on revolutionary duration and violence when they take refuge in a geographically proximate location or maintain a meaningful presence abroad throughout the revolutionary situation. Second, exiles escalate contention by providing direct leadership, securing international support, or maintaining a government-in-exile. Finally, exiles have a stronger escalatory effect on revolutions that would otherwise be relatively peaceful. Our research unpacks a widespread and highly consequential -- but hereto understudied -- feature of revolutionary contention and outlines a research agenda on exile and domestic contentious politics.",

          "abstract": "Alternative crisis mental health responses are models that differ from the default, policy-only model of responding to emergency reports of acute psychological distress in the community. The two prevalent alternative models are co-response, pairing police with a civilian (such as a nurse or social worker) and civilian response, whereby first responders are not police. Two scoping reviews have been completed that synthesize key processes from the literature that underpin co-response and civilian response. Informed by transformative justice and the principle of the collective, this protocol details a knowledge-to-action (KTA) study whereby summaries of those scoping reviews will be used as prompts for semi-structured interviews with interest-holders (frontline service providers, people with lived experience of mental health crises, policymakers, and mental health scholars and advocates) across the United States and Canada. Interviews will focus on participants’ experiences with and perceptions of crisis response, as well as their opinions about the accuracy and relevance of the scoping reviews. The analytic plan incorporates content analysis and interpretive phenomenology to capture both the patterns that emerge and the meanings that participants attach to their experiences, producing a more layered and comprehensive analysis than either method could achieve alone. This protocol represents one of the first research plans to apply the KTA cycle and the first known study to propose that a team of researchers first synthesize the literature and then interview key informants about the accuracy and applicability of those knowledge syntheses. Findings may highlight discrepancies between the literature and the field, with a focus on alternative crisis mental health response.",

          "abstract": "Asset tests are widely employed to ensure that welfare resources are targeted efficiently and equitably to people that do not have the resources to be self-sufficient. This paper looks at how asset testing in social welfare programs works in the European Union and the United States and reviews the evidence on the consequences of asset testing for eligibility and behavior. For that purpose, we follow the PRISMA guidelines for study selection and synthesis, systematically reviewing 22 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024, covering the United States and European Union, to assess the impact of asset testing.\n\nOur review finds that the real-world implementation of asset tests often undermines their stated goal of poverty reduction. While asset tests can improve targeting, they frequently discourage savings, perpetuate financial insecurity, and create administrative barriers that reduce participation among the most vulnerable. Hard thresholds incentivize dissaving and trap households in precariousness and long-term dependency, while administrative complexity often offsets any efficiency gains. Recent policy reforms-including higher thresholds, inflation-indexing, and asset exemptions-offer promising alternatives, but a persistent tension remains between targeting efficiency and poverty alleviation. We conclude that graduated approaches rather than straight disqualification better align welfare eligibility with the goals of financial resilience and poverty reduction.

We received 657 responses by people who conduct or use behavioural research in public, private and voluntary sectors. Respondents reported conducting applied (93 per cent) and/or pure (27 per cent) research across the UK. Current priorities for the application of behavioural research centred on climate action, health, methodological advances, and use of artificial intelligence. Perceived capability gaps include technological abilities, and knowledge relating to intervention design, implementation and evaluation. Broader barriers to conducting behavioural research include lack of confidence, limited funding and training, access to 'experts', and lack of acceptance of behavioural research. Findings highlight a need to increase capability through addressing skills and knowledge gaps, leadership engagement, and increasing resources for collaborative translation of behavioural research into practice.

          "abstract": "This year marks the halfway point for multiple global environmental goals, including plans to nearly double the extent of area-based conservation to 30% of the world’s surface by 2030 (1). To date, this coordinated international effort has been inadequate to halt global biodiversity loss. A major but unaccounted-for cause of the shortfall between policy ambitions and real-world outcomes is the abandonment of conservation initiatives, including both informal abdication of resource management responsibilities and formal reversal of governing rules and boundaries (Fig. 1). The US$200 billion annually committed to conservation is spent on a wide diversity of conservation measures, increasingly beyond traditional national parks and other protected areas (PAs), including community-based conservation, eco-certification, and payments for ecosystem services (2). The scant monitoring of conservation abandonment, derived almost entirely from PAs, demonstrates widespread informal abandonment of management responsibilities (i.e., “paper parks” (e.g., 3, 4)) and formal abandonment through protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) (e.g., 5, 6).",

          "authors": "Liz Lohn; Felix M. Simon",
          "abstract": "As news organisations adopt artificial intelligence (AI), they face growing pressure to be transparent about when and how it is used – yet practical approaches remain uneven. This paper examines AI transparency through an in-depth case study of the Financial Times (FT). Drawing on 13 semi-structured interviews with 12 senior managers across editorial, product, data science, and communications, together with internal documents, we show that the FT approaches transparency as a hybrid of policy, process, and practice, framed by a desire to safeguard both internal and external trust. Transparency is calibrated to context: internally, AI use is signposted in tools and reinforced through training and personal accountability; externally, the prominence of disclosure scales with system autonomy and editorial oversight, with stronger labelling for no-human-in-the-loop features than for AI-assisted, journalist-edited outputs. We identify nine factors that shape audience-facing disclosure – legal/provider requirements, industry benchmarking, nature of the task, human oversight, system novelty, audience expectations, perceived risk, commercial sensitivities, and design constraints – and five crosscutting challenges, including site-wide consistency (especially on mobile) and potential “transparency backfire.” Conceptually, our analysis links AI transparency to isomorphic pressures and to intersecting institutional logics. We argue that AI transparency in news is best understood as a spectrum, evolving with technological advancements, commercial, professional and ethical considerations and shifting audience attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Differences, such as gaps or contrasts, are crucial to theories in the social sciences. However, modeling these differences in structural equation modeling (SEM) remains challenging. Existing approaches have limitations that prevent researchers from modeling and testing differences flexibly. This paper introduces the H–O specification for modeling differences, a flexible SEM specification that overcomes these limitations. Our specification enables differences to be modeled as both independent and dependent variables, allows for differences between latent variables, and facilitates testing of the equal importance and full transmission assumptions. Using an empirical example from marketing research, we demonstrate that the H–O specification can reproduce the results of existing approaches while offering greater modeling flexibility and more opportunities to test differences.",

          "abstract": "Accessibility measures are widely used to assess transport equity and identify groups at risk of transport-related social exclusion (TRSE). Yet little guidance exists on how to select measures that are both theoretically robust and practically usable, and many researchers and practitioners remain unaware of the implications, biases, and consequences of their methodological choices. This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.",

          "abstract": "This research examines, using a qualitative approach, the role of family microenterprises in Teabo, Yucatán, in promoting sustainable development and preserving Mayan cultural identity. A case study is conducted using a phenomenological and interpretive approach to compare two delivery models in the local cultural sector: one based on direct delivery (B2C) and the other on a third-party delivery (collaborative platform). This research uses interviews, participatory observation, and visual analysis. The findings show that artisanal bread and hipiles go beyond being mere economic goods; they are cultural stories that strengthen social unity, knowledge transmission, and the local economy, especially when women play a key role in knowledge management. The semiotic examination highlights that these products represent cultural signs with symbolic value, which affect how consumers perceive them and foster the sustainability of identity. The discussion underscores the relevance of cultural heritage as a source of competitive advantage and the role of inclusive cultural public policies. It follows that incorporating organizational strategies focused on gender and interculturality makes it possible to strengthen the relationship between tradition and innovation. This contributes to the well-being of Indigenous communities.",

Critics of this view argue that it is incompatible with estimated treatment effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which tend to be small. I argue that these RCTs provide little evidence against the social media hypothesis: the causal effect identified by RCTs fundamentally differs from the causal effect invoked by the social media hypothesis in at least three ways. First, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of joining social media, whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of quitting social media. Second, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of using social media for many years, whereas RCTs typically identify the effect of quitting social media for several weeks. Third, and most overlooked, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of altering the behavior of large swaths of the population—a global intervention—whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of local interventions. In such local interventions, a person may be encouraged to quit social media, but both her immediate peers and the general public continue to use social media in large numbers. In this commentary, I discuss the local–global distinction at length and explain why the global intervention plausibly had much larger effects than experimental local interventions.",

          "abstract": "Big data and computational methods have generated great excitement and enthusiasm among scholars across the social sciences. In the form of government records and digital traces collected by companies, big data are abundant, constantly updated, and inexpensive to collect, giving researchers an unprecedented window into everyday behavior. For sociologists interested in solving social problems, big data likewise seem like an attractive source of evidence for developing policies and interventions. In this paper, we draw on lessons from our research on online fundraising and social welfare provision, which uses both big data analyses as well as conventional methods, to consider how big data can be used to solve unsolved social problems. We introduce the smokescreen analogy to characterize how big data can obscure rather than clarify social problems. Digital traces often serve as a veneer over longstanding issues, leading researchers into a \"description trap\" where they generate detailed accounts at the expense of identifying causes and solutions. However, behind every smokescreen is a smoke machine. We argue that analyzing the platforms generating digital traces can reveal their causal role in shaping social problems. Big data's relationship to problem-solving is ultimately ambivalent: it can both enable new solutions and distract from enduring causes.",

We focus on this earlier and often hidden step and argue that partisan perspectives shape which evidence politicians attend to in the first place. We test this claim in a real-world field setting during the 2024 Austrian parliamentary election campaign. Three weeks before election day, we emailed 1,822 candidates links to two high-quality research briefings on the same immigration policy reform: one emphasizing how benefit cuts reduce migrant inflows, the other that such cuts increase poverty among immigrants. By tracking click behavior, we measured which type of evidence each candidate selected. Our analysis shows that selection of ideologically aligned evidence is concentrated among extreme parties: candidates from the far-right Freedom Party of Austria disproportionately choose aligned evidence, while centrist candidates show more balanced patterns. A contemporaneous survey of 1,428 citizens indicates that far-right supporters approve of elites' selective attention to evidence, suggesting alignment between elite behavior and mass preferences at the political fringes. These results identify evidence selection as an important stage in policymaking and imply that rising far-right electoral strength may amplify reliance on supportive information, potentially increasing the risk of ill-informed policy decisions.",

          "abstract": "In this examination of gender differences in financial expectations in academia, we used survey data (N = 11,315 scientists and scholars, 19 academic disciplines) integrated with individual-level bibliometric and demographic data from Scopus. We studied what Polish scientists and scholars with various demographic characteristics, academic attitudes, and bibliometric profiles considered their dream salary. Top dreamers were defined as the upper 10% of scientists in terms of self-reported level of their dream salary. Gender differences are much weaker than expected: Women generally tend to have almost equal dream salaries compared to men across age groups, academic positions, and disciplines. Although men are 56% overrepresented in the group of top dreamers, their financial expectations are similar compared to women. Among top dreamers, the median dream salary for men is only 5% higher than the median dream salary for women. Across all STEM disciplines combined, men on average expect salaries 19% higher than women (in non-STEM 15%, and in MED only 11%). Strongly research-oriented men expect higher median salaries than strongly research-oriented women; male top performers (the upper 10%) expect higher salaries than female top performers; and male internationalists in research expect higher salaries than female internationalists. Finally, as logistic regression shows, men with a strong research orientation, working in STEM disciplines, and with strong international research collaborations are most likely to be top dreamers.",

          "abstract": "Outsourcing has emerged as a strategic approach that allows organizations to improve efficiency, access specialized expertise, and focus on their core business functions. However, these benefits come with significant risks, particularly the potential erosion of internal organizational knowledge and core competencies that are central to a firm's competitive advantage. This article synthesizes literature on outsourcing processes, core competence theory, dynamic capabilities, and knowledge management to propose a comprehensive integrated framework spanning the entire lifecycle of outsourcing arrangements. The framework encompasses four critical phases that are strategic preparation, vendor selection and contracting, transition and integration, and post-transition governance, with particular emphasis on protecting and reinforcing internal knowledge resources. Drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical contributions from leading scholars in the field, we demonstrate how firms can effectively balance outsourcing efficiencies with the imperative to retain essential know-how. The article concludes with theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and directions for future research, providing both scholars and practitioners with a robust model for preserving critical organizational knowledge while capitalizing on external efficiencies.",

          "abstract": "This paper orthogonalizes information symmetry (who holds information) from information completeness (whether available information suffices for a target decision or inference). We formalize two dimensions of completeness: static (relative to a finite time window) and dynamic (absolute, intertemporal). Static incompleteness arises when currently admissible signals are insufficient to identify the target; dynamic incompleteness arises when further, in-scope and decision-relevant information is foreseeably forthcoming. Within a measurable \"scope\" and an information filtration, we define probabilistic relevance as primitive, relate it to decision relevance via Blackwell monotonicity, and characterize static completeness as (approximate) point identification while dynamic completeness requires the absence of any future relevant arrivals. We distinguish institutional regimes—closed versus expandable scope—and show non-confirmability results in expandable scopes: finite evidence cannot certify either the absence of omitted relevant variables (static) or the absence of future relevant information (dynamic). We provide audit-style certificates (sufficient conditions) and falsifiers (stop-tests) for both notions, and connect the framework to partial identification, robust decision-making, rational inattention, and optimal stopping. The key implication is normative and methodological: in open environments, \"best\" actions are conditional and time-indexed rather than absolutely correct, so governance and empirical practice should report identification-set diameters, treat scope as a policy lever, and prefer falsifiable, continuous disclosure over once-and-for-all attestations.",

Social media platforms may serve as modern public spheres, offering spaces for publics to engage in rational and critical discourse. The affordances of social media platforms are crucial in providing such opportunities for dialogue and exchange. In the broader context of mediatization, we examine how platform socio-technological affordances, such as anonymity, reward systems, and moderation guidelines, coupled with user practices, co-shape the way information is produced, framed, and consumed within online communities. This study employs digital ethnography as a method to observe selected subreddits and interviews with their users, focusing on their experiences and perceptions of these digital spaces. Our preliminary findings indicate that, alongside external influences, inherent tensions between social and technological mechanisms simultaneously hinder and contribute to the nature of online deliberation, highlighting fundamental ambivalence as a structural element of online deliberative spaces. Ethical implications of socio-technological affordances are also briefly discussed.",

We then examined the relationships between fluctuations in paddy field use and village-level social, economic, and human capital.\nThe results suggest that in severely affected areas, after controlling for other regional characteristics, social capital had a positive effect on agricultural resilience. \nBy contrast, in areas with relatively minor disaster damage, economic capital had a positive effect, whereas human capital exhibited a negative effect.\nThese findings imply that the effects of different forms of capital are not consistent, and that their impacts on agricultural resilience may vary depending on severity of the physical damage. \nThis study contributes new insights to the fields of social science and disaster research, while also offering methodological advances to these disciplines.",

The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these longstanding weaknesses, exposing how institutional opacity and commercial influence can distort evidence, policy, and ultimately, public confidence.\nMain body: This narrative review synthesizes multidisciplinary evidence from peer-reviewed literature, national surveys, regulatory audits, and governmental investigations to identify systemic determinants of declining trust in medical science. Three domains were examined: (1) commercial practices within the pharmaceutical industry that prioritize shareholder value over patient outcomes; (2) regulatory frameworks compromised by lobbying, capture, and outdated oversight models; and (3) academic systems distorted by publication bias, funding pressures, and privatization of publicly financed discoveries. From this synthesis, a six-point roadmap is proposed to restore institutional credibility, grounded in the principles of transparency, ethics, and accountability. The framework includes independent oversight bodies, reformed approval pathways, enforceable conflict-of-interest standards, equitable funding distribution, open-access academic infrastructures, and a centralized public feedback architecture. Collectively, these measures aim to recalibrate the social contract between science and society, ensuring that biomedical progress is both ethically grounded and publicly accountable.\nConclusion: Restoring trust in medical science requires more than countering misinformation. It demands structural transformation. By embedding transparency into corporate, regulatory, and academic governance, and by aligning scientific enterprise with the public interest rather than private gain, medical science can reclaim its moral authority. It offers an integrated reform blueprint to guide future policy and institutional renewal, reaffirming the ethical foundations upon which scientific credibility must rest.",

          "authors": "Albert Falcó-Gimeno; Isobel Kemp",
          "abstract": "How do governments in minority regions with strong self-determination demands respond to assimilation efforts from the central state? National symbols, such as mandatory flag displays, are common tools used by states to assert authority and foster integration. This paper investigates non-compliance with such obligations in Catalonia, where many municipalities do not display the Spanish flag on town hall facades despite legal requirements. Drawing on original data from nearly one thousand municipalities between 2021 and 2024, we explore the drivers of this symbolic resistance. Contrary to expectations centred on elite strategy or state enforcement capacity, neither judicial orders nor contemporary party affiliation retain explanatory power once we control for voter preferences. Instead, the most robust drivers are localised, bottom-up, and historic. Most interestingly, we find that flag absence is overwhelmingly predicted by informal local independence referendums organised a decade earlier. After eliminating alternative mechanisms -- institutionalised path dependency, voter segmentation and current activist presence -- we hypothesise that this effect captures entrenched and enduring resistance norms within the local independence communities, which shift mayors' cost-benefit calculations. Notably, these effects are present for both secessionist and non-secessionist mayors, and for the latter, appear to override legal threats and amplify their sensitivity to local pro-independence support. These findings underscore that in deeply contested regions like Catalonia, the effectiveness of symbolic assimilation policies hinges less on formal authority or short-term elite manoeuvring, but rather localised social ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Political trust is widely considered essential for democracy, but empirical evidence testing this hypothesis remains limited. Drawing on research that connects political trust to democratic legitimacy, highlights its attitudinal and behavioral consequences, and underscores its contextual character as a form of political support, we hypothesize that political trust exerts a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already reached some level of democracy. We test this hypothesis with cross-lagged models fit to political trust estimates from 62 countries over 30 years, combined with democratic quality scores from the Varieties of Democracy project. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a conditional effect: based on our results, political trust has a positive effect on democracy, but only in countries that have already achieved high quality of democracy.",

          "abstract": "Accurate subnational fertility estimates are crucial for shaping policy decisions across diverse sectors, including education, health care, and social welfare. However, these estimates are difficult to obtain in small populations, in which data on births classified by maternal and paternal ages may be lacking or inadequate. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian model tailored to estimate the Total Fertility Rates (TFR) for both men and women at a subnational level. The model relies on population counts from age-sex pyramids and jointly models mortality and fertility patterns while accounting for uncertainty and spatio-temporal dependencies. Testing the model with simulated data that mimic Australian regions, as well as with real data from US counties, demonstrates its ability to generate reasonable TFR estimates. The estimates produced have straightforward applications to the study of subregional reproductive disparities within the US, and the proposed modeling framework can be extended to investigate subnational fertility patterns across other countries with limited birth data.",

          "abstract": "Content moderation navigates tensions between efficiency, consistency, and contextual understanding, yet theoretical foundations explaining user perceptions of moderation practices remain underdeveloped, particularly across diverse cultural contexts. Through a pre-registered survey experiment with TikTok users in Indonesia (n=304) and Pakistan (n=303), this study examines how moderation source, procedural contestability, and outcome alignment with user preferences individually and jointly influence perceived legitimacy of content moderation for morally, emotionally, and politically charged content. Results reveal that outcome alignment with users’ moderation preferences most consistently and significantly enhances perceived legitimacy across both countries. Moderation source (algorithmic systems, human moderators, governmental agencies, or civil society organizations) and procedural contestability showed limited direct effects, with only marginal benefits observed in Indonesia. Critically, when algorithmic moderation decisions are contestable and align with user preferences, perceived legitimacy peaks; however, when contestable algorithmic decisions contradict user preferences, legitimacy perceptions drop significantly. Individual differences in support for moral restrictions on free speech also influence user perceptions of content moderation. As algorithmic content moderation systems continue expanding globally, understanding these legitimation dynamics, especially in these understudied morally conservative contexts, proves essential for designing approaches that effectively govern online speech while maintaining user trust across diverse cultural communities.",

          "authors": "Francesca Luppi; Andrea BONANOMI; Alessandro Rosina",
          "abstract": "Sustained fertility decline in high-income societies increasingly reflects not just smaller family sizes but rising rates of childlessness. While economic uncertainty and institutional factors receive much attention, the role of value orientations and subjective motivations remains underexplored. This paper examines how the perceived self-fulfillment relevance of childbearing mediates the relationship between postmaterialist values and fertility intentions, and how this interplay is moderated by expectations of welfare-state childcare support. Drawing on the Rapporto Giovani 2022 survey across Italy, France, Germany, and Spain, we analyze a sample of childless adults aged 25-34. We first model the determinants of self-fulfillment valuation of parenthood by postmaterialism and welfare expectations. Next, we estimate a moderated mediation model - through generalized structural equation modelling with nonparametric bootstrap - to decompose the direct and indirect pathways linking values, perceived support, and fertility intentions. Our analysis reveals that welfare support may strengthen fertility intentions when it aligns with postmaterialist values by enhancing the meaning of parenthood, while in the absence of support the appeal of childbearing erodes. These findings underscore the importance of integrating motivational and institutional perspectives: policy effectiveness may depend not only on reducing structural constraints, but also on resonating with individuals’ value systems.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

Sure Start in Northern Ireland is a place-based early years health and education programme that offers services to some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country. Families with children under four residing in these areas are eligible to access Sure Start services. This study uses a naturally occurring experiment with a Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design and administrative data to measure the impact of Sure Start on health and social services as well as child and maternal health at birth. We find no evidence of an impact on health outcomes at birth. However, we do find that Sure Start reduces the rate of child social services referrals and assessments for a child in need as well as the number of children who become a ‘child in need’. These reductions are most substantial in the first five years of life with no evidence of a rebound after school entry. We also find some evidence these effects are higher for mothers aged 21 and younger. Due to study limitations, the magnitude of these effects are imprecisely measured and we suggest further avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "Segregation is a pervasive social phenomenon, separating individuals of different categories or groups across social foci. Workplaces are hubs of the labor market and central to economic outcomes, but may also facilitate cross-cutting social ties. Workplace segregation might exacerbate social inequality and decrease social cohesion. Most work on segregation focuses on salient categories like race and ethnicity, and we know little about segregation by more subtle statuses. Social class background is a case in point, because it is imperfectly observed by individuals involved in social interaction, and is more difficult to measure for total populations. In this paper, we analyze workplace segregation by social class background. We document substantial segregation by social background, over and above counterfactual segregation under random allocation of employees across workplaces. Moreover, we observe segregation levels over and above what would be expected under random allocation conditional on individual and workplace characteristics, including e.g. human capital, occupation, and workplace county. Also, when accounting for our richest set of covariates, employees are somewhat overexposed to coworkers who share their own class background. The excess segregation is the smallest for groups at the bottom of the class origin distribution, and larger at the top.",

Our specification enables differences to be modeled as both independent and dependent variables, allows for differences between latent variables, and facilitates testing of the equal importance and full transmission assumptions. Using an empirical example from marketing research, we demonstrate that the H–O specification can reproduce the results of existing approaches while offering greater modeling flexibility and more opportunities to test differences.",

This paper uses a case study approach to examine how historical stigma intersects with present-day exclusion for communities such as the Pardhis and Ramoshis. Drawing on key policy documents, including the Renke Commission (2008), and in-depth interviews with TANDA’s (Towards Advocacy, Networking and Developmental Action) organisational staff and field workers, the study explores the practical barriers faced by DNT/NT groups, ranging from persistent illiteracy and lack of identity documentation to discriminatory policing and exclusion from basic services.\n\nFindings highlight the complexity of marginalisation: policies intended for rehabilitation often fall short at the ground level, while community-led efforts struggle against bureaucratic hurdles and societal prejudice. Through the lens of TANDA’s grassroots interventions; such as education support, vocational training, and health initiatives, the paper details both the incremental gains and the stubborn challenges that define the landscape of social inclusion. The research also reflects on TANDA’s adaptive strategies in response to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting funding environments.\n\nDespite periodic government attention and the work of commissions, the study finds that data gaps, inconsistent recognition, and the lack of sustained state engagement perpetuate structural inequalities. The conclusion calls for targeted policy reform, direct resource allocation, and formal recognition of grassroots knowledge and leadership. Ultimately, the study argues that while organisations like TANDA play a vital bridging role, meaningful change for DNT/NT communities demands a much broader, long-term commitment to redress historical and ongoing injustices.",

This study curbs the enthusiasm by evaluating whether different forms of warm glow change behaviour across online and field experimental studies. Second-hand clothes shopping is the setting of our investigation because multiple forms of warm glow apply. Behaviour change toward reuse is highly desirable to lower the negative environmental impact of the fashion industry. In line with prior research, we find promising evidence in survey studies that priming the warm glow effect of second-hand shopping could increase second-hand shopping by up to 16%. However, when tested in a field study involving second-hand charity shops, messages communicating the warm glows of second-hand shopping performed no better than a general attention-generating message. Our study shows that charitable and environmentally sustainable behaviour does generate warm glow, but that the perception of warm glow might not be enough to motivate purchasing behaviours.",

Applying a convolutional neural network to street-level and overhead imagery of polling places country-wide (N≈80,000), we show that building imagery is highly predictive of voter turnout. We then use explainable artificial intelligence approaches to explore what visual features correlate with turnout, identifying attributes that plausibly mitigate contextual barriers to civic participation (including heat, insecurity, and an ongoing pandemic). Finally, we leverage the quasi-random assignment of voters to polling places to test for effects of the built environment on turnout in a causal discovery framework. The findings suggest that the built environment shapes inequalities in civic participation and demonstrate a promising approach to inductive inference from image data.",

Using a methodologically rigorous analysis of PISA 2022 data (N = 29,728), we uncover a 'Resilience-Support Paradox': in many education systems, resilient students report lower levels of perceived school support than their struggling peers. Our findings reveal that the most powerful predictor of resilience is not external support, but a student’s internal Math Disposition: a combination of self-efficacy, interest, and low anxiety. These results suggest that one-size-fits-all support systems may be ineffective or even counterproductive. We argue for a paradigm shift toward differentiated interventions that cultivate students' internal psychological assets, a goal uniquely achievable through the design of modern adaptive educational technologies.",
