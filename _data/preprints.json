          "authors": "Amy Zhao; Brendan P. Zietsch",
          "abstract": "The stereotype that “men are funnier than women” is culturally pervasive. In a large preregistered online study (n = 966), we asked participants to rate the funniness of 12 jokes delivered by a male or female AI-generated voice (they only rated jokes by one apparent gender). To control for differences in delivery, cadence, and intonation, we used a speech-to-speech transformation to transform jokes spoken by a female into a male version and vice versa. Using a Bayesian analysis, we found strong evidence that the apparent gender of the speaker does not affect the perceived funniness of the joke (BF = 0.023). We found no interaction between the original and apparent voice gender on masculinity ratings, indicating that vocal gender cues were effectively eliminated when voices were transformed to the opposite gender, reinforcing the merit of this gender manipulation method.",

          "authors": "Julia Marshall; Kellen Mermin-Bunnell; Anton Gollwitzer; Jan Retelsdorf; Paul Bloom",
          "abstract": "Third-party intervention is a cornerstone of cooperative societies, yet we know little about how children develop an understanding of this social behavior. The present work generates a cross-cultural and developmental picture of how 6-, 9-, and 12-year-olds (N = 447) across four societies (India, Germany, Uganda, and the United States) reason about third-party intervention. To do so, we measured children’s obligation judgments and unstructured descriptions of third-party intervention. Although some cultural differences emerged, 6-year-olds largely considered bystanders as obligated to respond to wrongdoing regardless of the bystander’s social position. In contrast, 9- and 12-year-olds were more likely to exclusively ascribe this social responsibility to people in positions of authority. Despite these age differences, children of all ages generated role-specific descriptions of third-party intervention, with authority figures intervening in distinct ways from peers. For authority figures, children in India and Uganda described third-party intervention as involving corporal punishment or unspecified “punishment,” whereas children in the USA described such intervention as involving only verbal intervention (i.e., telling someone to stop). For peers, children in all societies described third-party intervention as involving reporting misdeeds to an authority. Collectively, these data show that early conceptualizations of third-party intervention are rooted in shared notions of obligation yet are also subject to cultural and contextual influences.",

          "authors": "Darja Wischerath; Lukasz Piwek; Jonathan Francis Roscoe; Brittany I Davidson",
          "abstract": "The proliferation of conspiracy theories within online communities has tangible offline consequences, both on an individual and collective level. Conspiracy narratives can act as a radicalisation multiplier in such contexts, capitalising on pre-existing beliefs and grievances, and adding urgency to act through a narrative of imminent danger. Several incidents of individual violent extremism have been directly attributed to membership in online extremist communities related to conspiratorial ideologies. Previous research has proposed that belief in conspiracy narratives is driven by unfulfilled psychological needs such as existential threat, epistemic motives, and social motives, and calls have been made to examine conspiracy belief as a form of affective community investment. We conducted a one-month ethnography of conspiracy-related YouTube videos, exploring how conspiracy narratives address grievances and psychological needs. We performed an LDA topic model analysis of 102 videos and 455,738 comments and qualitatively examined 24 videos and 1,200 comments using an abductive approach. We validate and extend existing models of conspiracy beliefs, highlighting how conspiracy narratives address and amplify grievances and psychological needs in both official content and community-generated discourse. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the spread and impact of conspiracy theories in online environments.",

          "abstract": "Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are a valuable tool for assessing eyewitness memory, offering a structured approach to evaluate recall accuracy and susceptibility to misinformation. However, prior research utilising MCQs highlights limitations in calibration and sensitivity, potentially reducing their effectiveness. To address these issues, we here describe and implement a four-stage process to develop a refined set of MCQs. Following a content analysis of qualitative witness statements from a previously used mock crime video, we identified key details across four categories (Action, Object, Person, and Setting). Using these findings, 100 MCQs were developed, tested, and refined to calibrate for difficulty. Additionally, confidence ratings were included to explore their influence on response behaviours. Results found that confidence ratings had no effect on accuracy but potentially provide additional information for the relationship between recall accuracy, confidence ratings, and response patterns. By establishing a clear protocol for MCQ development, we ensure consistency and comparability in future research.  These MCQs will next be used to explore recall accuracy and misinformation susceptibility among young and older adults. \n\nKeywords: Self-Administered Interview, Multiple-choice questions (MCQs), eyewitness memory, question development protocol. accuracy-confidence relationship, investigative interviewing.",

          "abstract": "In this manuscript, concepts, issues and resolutions that call for conscious awareness in research into the unconscious are meticulously revisited. Historical episodes and episodes of controversial experimentation that are formative rallying points for understanding contemporary attitudes to the unconscious in psychological science and the impact of historical controversy to contemporary polarisation are discussed. The theoretical debates, methodological inquiries and contributing resolutions that have stemmed from these controversies are conceptually discoursed and meta-analytically cited. Replicated illustrations that show how purportedly established and well-known, and previously unaddressed methodological biases occur in this area, and how we can resolve these hurdles within the – frequently overlooked – limitations of the current scientific paradigm, are experimentally demonstrated. As a decisive communication of engaging with these themes, concepts, issues and resolutions, the conceptual importance and research merits of a reminding and combined scholarly-theoretical and applied-empirical conscious understanding of the unconscious is encouraged and accentuated.",

          "abstract": "Facial attractiveness is an important human characteristic. It impacts our personal and interpersonal lives from a very young age and throughout our adulthood in most aspects of our experiences, actions and interactions. Evolutionary and sociobiological hypotheses, findings and interpretations have been posited to explain why facial attractiveness is important for human interactions. For example, facial symmetry, averageness and above-average secondary/dimorphic sexual characteristics have been proposed to indicate hormonal and health markers for relational attraction. These traits are considered universal evolutionary important biological markers. Therefore, the hypothesis that attractiveness is processed unconsciously – i.e., subliminally – has been proposed and supported by the vast majority of topical research. In this manuscript, we employ mathematical, statistical, methodological, psychophysical and psychophysiological state-of-the-art advances; we dispute subliminality, and we redefine the roles of consciousness, unconsciousness, and involuntary and automatic responses relating to facial attractiveness. We demonstrate that attraction in response to human faces involves both conscious and unconscious elements, that it is, indeed, automatic and involuntary, and that it can be behaviourally but not experientially inhibited by conscious interference.",

          "authors": "Quinta Seon; Myrna Lashley; Geneviève Sauvé; Martin Lepage; Adèle Hotte-Meunier; Lisa Sarraf; Ethan Draper; Clayton Jeffrey; Caroline Sylvie-Dakoure",
          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) programs can support multiple aspects of well-being and have been developed by marginalized groups for these purposes, but there is still a systemic power imbalance. Marginalized groups have a place in digital well-being and can lead efforts directed towards resources that they desire. To better support these efforts and mobilize knowledge amongst marginalized stakeholders, we performed a scoping review of VR’s use for wellbeing. Taking an equity lens that considers the experiences of intersectional marginalization, we aimed to identify VR programs, their targets, outcomes, and equity-related facilitators and barriers. In May 2023, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases and grey literature for virtual reality and marginalized populations. Eligible research articles since the inception of the databases were those that met our predefined criteria of VR, marginalized populations, and well-being. We included 38 studies and charted preregistered variables using narrative synthesis and descriptive statistics. The populations represented in the included studies were often intersectionally marginalized and observed that VR offered diverse support, such as social support and affirmation, mental and emotional well-being, education and support for disability and physical health, and cultural connections. Overall, most studies reported positive findings, though several noted no effect on at least some outcomes. VR’s flexibility created informal, flexible spaces, with support from peers, and contributed to mental and social well-being. Several factors could challenge marginalized groups’ ability to follow and create pathways to VR well-being programs, such as the lack of free programs, data and program ownership, and intersectional data analyses. This area reflects a growing literature topic, with half of the studies published in 2022 or 2023. Which also means, currently, many studies have limitations like small sample sizes and are lacking mixed-methods or practical significance analyses. Moving forward, researchers could apply more open-access and inclusivity practices in their design and recruitment to widen equitable access to marginalized stakeholders. However, many marginalized populations created VR programs and benefited from them, contributing to a rebalancing of power over wellbeing.",

          "authors": "Natalia Levshina",
          "abstract": "This study addresses a paradox in word order typology. On the one hand, the SOV order has longer dependency distances and therefore higher processing costs compared to verb-medial order. On the other hand, it is the most frequent word order in languages of the world. How come? An analysis of large-scale corpus data in thirty-two languages annotated with Universal Dependencies provides a simple answer: the costly long distances occur more rarely than one would assume because verb-final languages usually have fewer arguments compared to verb-medial languages. A series of Bayesian phylogenetic models shows a negative correlation between the proportion of verb-final clauses in a language and the average number of arguments in a clause, while controlling for argument indexing and high- and low-context culture. A closer examination of argument configurations reveals a positive correlation between proportions of verb-final clauses and proportions of subjectless clauses; as for proportions of objectless clauses, the evidence is less clear. In addition, a quanitative analysis of 150 Universal Dependencies corpora shows that the proportions of verb-final clauses with two overt arguments are low, even in verb-final languages. The study highlights the importance of the token-based, gradient approach to typology, which gives us insights into what kind of structures language users prefer, and what they avoid.",

          "abstract": "Effective impulse control over gratifying stimuli is a crucial skill with significant implications for decision-making across various life domains. While research has traditionally centered on the concept of delayed gratification (DG)- primarily studied in children - its application to adult behavior reveals distinct complexities. This study shifts attention to gratification control (GC), a construct that focuses on how adults navigate competing desires in the context of both immediate and long-term health risks. The Health Risk Behaviors' Gratification Control Inventory (HeRBs GCI), designed to measure GC, comprises 12 items across four domains: alcohol consumption, smoking, drug abuse, and risky sexual practices. Validated with a sample of 442 emerging adults, the HeRBs GCI offers insights into impulse control concerning health risk behaviors. This inventory provides a tool for research and practical interventions aimed at enhancing decision-making and managing health-related risks.",

          "authors": "Sarah Humberg",
          "abstract": "Many psychological theories imply that the degree of congruence between two variables (e.g., self-rated and objectively measured intelligence) is related to some psychological outcome (e.g., life satisfaction). Such congruence hypotheses can be tested with response surface analysis (RSA), in which a second-order polynomial regression model is estimated and suitably interpreted. Whereas several strategies exist for this interpretation, they all contain rationales that diminish the probability of drawing correct conclusions. For example, a frequently applied strategy involves calculating six auxiliary parameters from the estimated regression weights and accepting the congruence hypothesis if they satisfy certain conditions. In testing the conditions, a nonsignificant null-hypothesis test of some parameters is taken as evidence that the parameter is zero. This interpretation is formally inadmissible and adversely affects the probability of making correct decisions about the congruence hypothesis. We address this limitation of the six-parameter strategy and of other RSA-strategies by proposing that statistical equivalence testing (SET) be integrated into RSA. We compare the existing and new RSA-strategies with a simulation study and find that the SET-strategies are sensible alternatives to the existing strategies. We provide code templates for implementing the SET-strategies.",

          "abstract": "Girls and women are disproportionately affected by delayed diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but research on the impact of this is limited. Our study aimed to centre lived experiences of women with late-diagnosed ADHD to increase understanding of the impact of such delays. We employed a mixed methods survey to investigate the perspectives of 28 women with late-diagnosed ADHD. Results starkly demonstrate the criticism and lack of support participants faced from society and medical professionals, illustrating the negative consequences of delayed ADHD diagnosis on quality of life and mental health. Participants commonly reported internalising criticism and described disconcertingly low self-esteem; citing guilt, shame, and negative self-perception due to delayed diagnoses. Participants found diagnosis revelatory, their lives finally making sense; citing healing, improved self-esteem, and life feeling more worth living. The adversities faced from delayed diagnoses were described from early childhood, through adolescence, and adulthood. Participants reflected on ‘what could have been’, and described grieving the lives they could have led if diagnosed earlier. The negative impacts of missed ADHD diagnosis are broad and span life stages. With potential implications for public health policy, this work highlights the importance of increasing girls’ and women’s access to ADHD diagnoses to address avoidable detrimental hardship.",

          "authors": "Doina-Irina Giurgea; Penny M. Pexman; Richard J. Binney",
          "abstract": "Semantic representations arise from a distillation of multiple sources of information, including sensory, motor, affective, interoceptive, linguistic and cognitive experience. Experience of reward is a highly salient aspect of many human activities, and yet its contribution to semantic processing is not well understood. To address this, the present study took a psycholinguistic approach to measuring and evaluating associations with reward as a facet of word meaning. Behavioral and neurophysiological data suggest reward processing involves multiple stages and mechanisms. For instance, systems associated with the experience and anticipation of pleasure in response to a reward appear distinct from motivational processes that underlie pursuit of a stimulus. We sought to collect a novel set of word ratings that capture the full extent of reward-related experience. Initial explorations revealed that reward/pleasure ratings are highly correlated with existing norms of emotional valence. Ratings of association with motivation, however, were only moderately correlated with valence, suggesting they capture distinct semantic information. We therefore conducted a preregistered large-scale study to obtain motivation ratings for 8601 words. Our analyses suggest these ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct from other semantic dimensions, such as concreteness and valence. Moreover, they explain unique variance in participant performance on lexical, semantic, and recognition memory tasks. We combined motivation and emotional valence ratings to provide a composite measure that might approximate a more general ‘reward’ construct. However, this was worse at explaining task performance than the individual variables. We discuss implications of these results for neurocognitive theories of semantics.",

          "abstract": "Background: Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills – also known under labels like soft skills, 21st century skills, or social-emotional skills – are considered key factors for students’ success, well-being, and social relationships, among others. However, literature on the topic relied on different frameworks and questionable measurement methods. Additionally, they usually did not integrate skills into classical self-regulated learning (SRL) frameworks. \nAims: To overcome these limitations, we adopted the new integrative SEB framework and measured SEB skills, along with five SRL factors (academic self-efficacy, SRL strategies, mastery learning goals, growth mindset, and achievement emotions) and three outcomes (i.e., academic achievement, peer acceptance, and life satisfaction).\nSample: Participants were 5,075 Italian high school students (M = 18.23 years old; SD = 0.95). \nResults: Our results show that SEB skills are associated with almost all SRL factors and outcomes, but when considering their specific role (net of other skills and SRL factors), only mediated associations with academic achievement emerge, supporting the hypothesis that SEB skills’ effects on academic outcomes might be mainly mediated by SRL factors, while specific skills (i.e., social engagement, collaboration, and emotional resilience skills) directly influence non-scholastic outcomes. \nConclusions: Our results support the importance of adopting integrative skills frameworks along with SRL frameworks to deeply understand the processes linking skills to outcomes in the student population.",

          "authors": "Martina Dvorakova; Natálie Kikoťová; Josef Urbanec; Antonia Götz; Katerina Chladkova",
          "abstract": "Humans tune in to the native language prosody before they are even born. Prior findings with newborns reported language-specific processing of forward versus backward speech and intonational contours and also indicated language-specific processing of iambic versus trochaic patterns in non-linguistic tone stimuli. The present experiment tested newborns’ processing of temporal rhythm patterns in naturalistic native-language speech. Czech-learning newborns were played naturally recorded well-formed Czech utterances with native Czech rhythm (virtually lacking cues to word-level stress) and with non-native rhythm (prolonged foot-initial syllables), while their hemodynamic activity was recorded. The results showed larger hemodynamic responses to the non-native than to the native rhythm in a late analysis window, attributable to a double-peak response shape in the non-native condition. This finding is discussed in terms of suprisal-induced resonating activity after hearing familiar native speech paired with an unfamiliar rhythm pattern. Further, there was an overall attenuated response to the native rhythm localized in the right frontal region (comprising the Broca's area), evidencing right-lateralized processing of speech rhythm. Traditional language development theories claimed that only coarse between-class rhythm differences between languages are processed at birth. Having demonstrated that newborns differentially process non-native vs. native rhythmic patterns within natural native-langugae speech, even in a language outside of the traditional rhythm classes, the present findings disprove some of the early theories and substantially deepen our understanding of early speech development.",

          "abstract": "This study demonstrates how natural language processing and explainable AI techniques can advance our understanding of personality psychology, using sex differences in language as a case study. By analyzing stream-of-consciousness essays from 2,240 undergraduates using BERT with integrated gradients attribution, we identify distinct linguistic markers that characterize sex-specific trait expression. Our approach illustrates how explainability methods can help to detect systematic variations in language patterns across different trait levels and between males and females. Logistic regression analyses reveal Neuroticism as the strongest predictor of language typical of each sex (OR = 2.11, p ≤ .001), followed by Extraversion and Agreeableness. The model achieves 82.8\\% accuracy in sex classification, and the explainability technique shows that sex differences in language often diminish at extreme trait levels. The study's methodological contribution lies in demonstrating how explainable AI can advance personality assessment by providing interpretable insights into the complex interaction between sex and personality in natural language use. The study also illustrates how explainable AI can advance personality assessment beyond descriptive statistics to provide interpretable insights into complex psychological phenomena, demonstrating a framework for deeper exploration of personality psychology findings.",

We detail an approach to integrating co-created insights into a scientific model using an equitable and power-sharing approach (EPSA) method, exampled during the study design phase of the AFFIRM Relationships project. The EPSA method consist of 3 phases: a preparatory phase (Researcher reflexivity, topic formulation and sensitization); a co-creation phase (knowledge production, analytic phases, summarizing and ethics work) and an insight integration phase. Applying the EPSA method highlighted the important role of researcher reflexivity in preparing to foster a safe environment for open dialogue during co-creation. Transforming scientific research stages into activities that can engage co-researchers (including conducting analysis, critical thinking, and producing overarching themes) underscored an equitable partnership. Whilst the final phase enabled identification of how resulting knowledge was derived, further consideration of how refinement processes can be grounded in lived experience is necessary, particularly during final stages as decision making becomes increasingly led by academic team members.",

          "abstract": "People tend to show greater liking for expressions of sadness when these expressions are described as art. Why does this effect arise? One obvious hypothesis would be that describing something as art makes people more likely to regard it as fictional, and people prefer expressions of sadness that are not real. We contrast this obvious hypothesis with a hypothesis derived from the philosophical literature. On this alternative hypothesis, describing something as art makes people more inclined to appropriate it, i.e., to see it as an expression of their own sadness. Study 1 found that describing the exact same sad text as art (e.g., a monologue) as opposed to not-art (e.g., a diary entry) led to increased liking for the work. Study 2 showed that this effect is not mediated by fictionality. Study 3 showed that the effect is mediated by appropriation. Study 4 looked at the impact of a manipulation of fictionality. Describing a work as fictional did lead to increased liking, but this effect was completely mediated by appropriation. These results provide at least some initial support for the appropriation hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "In the physical world, we efficiently organize objects in space to facilitate finding them when mostly needed. Does this tendency to order the external environment extend to conceptual information that is internally stored in memory? Here we report that when people were asked to retrieve different concepts from memory, they spontaneously directed their gaze to distinct and minimally overlapping portions of their visual space. This effect was replicated across two experiments, and was correlated with retrieval performance. Interestingly, this categorical partitioning, which differentiated the content of the retrieved information, was paired with a temporal partitioning, which reflected the temporal progression of the retrieval experience. These findings reveal a tendency of humans to separately organize their memories during retrieval, disentangling content (the “what”) and time (the “when”) via a spontaneous oculomotor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Computerized versions of paper-and-pencil tests have made children’s behavioral assessments more automatic and precise. The COVID-19 pandemic further demonstrated the need for computerized assessments to be offered online to allow for remote data collection. However, the design and implementation of computerized tests in an online environment comes with various challenges. This article probes the issues, needs and challenges for the development and validation of online assessment of reading and math, and related cognitive abilities. The paper aims to inform researchers about some of the logistical and technical considerations of developing a customized platform for online data collection, including (a) technical considerations, (b) interface design, (c) data management, and (d) validation measures for comparability with paper-and-pencil measures. These issues are illustrated with experiences gleaned from the development of an assessment platform (ACE Kids platform), designed to deliver over 40 tests and questionnaires related to children’s Chinese and English literacy, as well as mathematics abilities. Furthermore, we discuss features that improve the ease of use, clear instructions, and attention retention. This discussion is punctuated by pilot test results, including both qualitative and quantitative data about child usage experience. Finally, we discuss important considerations at the planning, development and data collection stages for a customized assessment platform.",

          "abstract": "The shift from handwriting to digital typing as the dominant form of written communication has led to a decrease in handwriting proficiency. This trend is particularly evident in opaque writing systems, such as Chinese, where speakers increasingly experience “character amnesia”, the inability to (fully) handwrite a character despite being able to recognise it. In this study, we investigated whether prior exposure to a phonetic or semantic radical of a character helps to subsequently alleviate amnesia in handwriting the character. In three online experiments, participants were first exposed to a prime character that shares a phonetic radical, a semantic radical, or no radical with a target character (or, in Experiment 2, exposed to a stand-alone radical); then they handwrote the target character according to a dictation prompt. Participants reported less character amnesia in handwriting the target character if they had previously been exposed to a phonetic or semantic radical, either as part of a prime character or as a stand-alone radical. Furthermore, the priming effect of the semantic radical was similar regardless of whether the prime had a semantic radical with high or low semantic transparency. These findings suggest that character amnesia in Chinese is caused by the incomplete orthographic activation in semantic and phonetic radicals.",

          "abstract": "Lack of access to appropriate clothing sizes can negatively impact body image and self-esteem. This study aimed to assess the relationship between clothing access, body image, and self-esteem. 443 participants (42 male) completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, a clothing access scale, the Body Appreciation Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Eating Attitudes Test, and the Body Esteem Questionnaire. Data analysis focused on women without eating disorder risk, with comparisons made between those at risk of eating disor-ders and between men and women using a matched sub-sample (in BMI, age, and size). Sig-nificant correlations between all variables were found for women, and a regression model indicated that body esteem was a significant predictor, while general self-esteem was not. Those aware of the new Size Law (58%) reported lower clothing access and higher BMI. Women at risk for eating disorders (N=68) had lower body appreciation and both general and body self-esteem. Gender differences revealed that men had higher values for all meas-ured variables. The findings suggest that the lack of clothing size access and the associated societal beauty ideals contribute to body image issues, particularly for women. This study underscores the need to address size discrimination within the fashion industry and high-lights the importance of implementing the Size Law to promote inclusion and gender equity.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale socio-economic panel studies aim to document societal trends and public opinions using representative population samples. Despite the profound impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on public and private life across diverse contexts, these studies have rarely addressed the use and evaluation of AI for individual respondents. Therefore, a standardized assessment instrument is introduced that was designed for the needs of large-scale social surveys. The Artificial Intelligence Experience and Attitude Survey (AIEAS) is a novel self-report instrument measuring awareness, experience, attitude, and usage intention regarding AI in the work, healthcare, and education domains. The scenario-based items describe different AI applications in different contexts and are administered in a planned missingness design to meet the brevity requirements of large-scale studies. A qualitative interview study (N = 30) confirmed the comprehensibility of the items, while a quantitative web-based study (N = 1084) with a German sample demonstrated a satisfactory measurement structure and precision. These findings attest to good psychometric properties of the AIEAS that allow for a multidimensional measurement of AI experiences and evaluations. Integrating the instrument in socio-economic panel studies will support examining societal trends over time to inform the scientific community and policies in different domains.",

          "abstract": "According to counterfactual theories of causal judgment, people judge causation by evaluating the consequences of counterfactual interventions on their representations of the world. What is the format of these representations? Research on causal generalization suggests that people hold `invariant' representations of causal relationships that can be flexibly composed together. We suggest that people can compute counterfactuals on the basis of these invariant representations, and in particular they can imagine `disconnecting' the causal link between two variables. Importantly, this hypothesis implies that causal judgment is supported by richer representations than the Structural Causal Models (SCMs) used in most counterfactual theories. We argue that this gap can explain the shortcomings of existing counterfactual theories, for example why these theories struggle to explain the distinction between `productive’ and non-productive causation. In a series of simple experiments, we find that the consequences of variable-disconnection counterfactuals systematically affect people’s causal judgments, even holding constant the structural causal model describing the situation. Overall, the counterfactual framework might provide a unifying account of human causal judgment, provided we correctly understand the mental representations people use to imagine counterfactual scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Social exclusion is a negative experience in social interaction which can be modulated by the perceived eye gaze. In our Cyberball study, we asked how gaze direction – direct versus averted – affects the processing of social exclusion by using electroencephalogram (EEG) methods. Participants encountered neutral gazes in the inclusion phase (Block1) and then either direct or averted gazes during the exclusion phase (Block2). We measured self-reports on Need-Threat Questionnaires (belonging, control, meaningful existence, self-esteem) and negative mood, along with event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically the P3 component (P300) - an indicator of expectation violation. Findings demonstrated that the P3 amplitude showed differential changes between gaze conditions during the transition from inclusion to exclusion, with direct gaze eliciting stronger neural responses. This difference signals that direct gaze enhances the expected participation, thus sensitizing participants for exclusionary signals. Simultaneously, self-reports indicated that the transition evoked weaker negative emotions in the direct gaze group and stronger negative emotions in the averted gaze group, signalling that direct gaze also serves as an affiliative signal. These results illuminate how gaze directions shape cognitive and emotional reactions to social exclusion. However, further research is necessary to unravel these effects amidst other non-verbal cues and fully comprehend their impact on neural and behavioural responses to social exclusion.",

          "abstract": "Ambulatory assessment has gained widespread popularity among researchers who study the dynamics of everyday experiences and behaviors, such as sleep patterns or emotional states. In this paper, we focus on the challenge that arises when we want to investigate the dynamic relations between variables that were measured at different frequencies. As a running example, we use a sleep quality variable measured once every morning and a mood variable measured multiple times during the day for multiple days. We propose two N=1 models that imply different processes; the first focuses on dynamic relations from day to day between sleep quality and a daily factor of the mood variable, and the second focuses on dynamic relations from one measurement occasion to the next, which prioritizes when the variables affect each other. Additionally, we introduce a combination of these two models and demonstrate their accuracy with a simulation study. An empirical N=1 example of daily sleep quality and momentary self-doubt demonstrates that dynamic relations exist between sleep quality and self-doubt at certain moments in the day and the daily factor of self-doubt. Researchers may adjust the proposed dynamic models to align with their own theories and to accommodate different data or research interests.",

This study aimed to identify key priorities for developing international mental health guidelines tailored to esports, defining their scope and outlining the roles of key stakeholders. Using a modified Delphi approach, an expert panel of 18 professionals specialising in esports and mental health participated in a two-round consensus process. In Round One, qualitative responses identified five key areas of focus, leading to the development of 13 statements on mental health promotion, prevention, and care. In Round Two, panel members rated their agreement and the perceived importance of these statements using a 4-point Likert scale, with statements reaching 80% consensus included in the final recommendations. Of the 13 statements, 12 achieved consensus, emphasising the need for mental health literacy programs, safe and healthy environments, and structured mental health first aid training for coaches and community leaders. The expert panel also highlighted the responsibility of game publishers, tournament organisers, and governing bodies in promoting mental health resources and policies. This study provides a foundation for evidence-based esports mental health guidelines, which can inform future policy development, industry practices, and player support systems.",

          "authors": "Hannah De Laet; Jan R. Wiersema; Annabel. D. Nijhof",
          "abstract": "While prevailing theories suggest social interaction difficulties are inherent to individuals with autism, the theory of the double empathy problem (Milton, 2012) proposes that these difficulties result from a mismatch between neurologically different interaction partners. This theory also predicts less difficulty during interaction between individuals with autism. Existing studies are limited, warranting further investigation. In 2022, adults with autism completed an online mixed-method questionnaire, which included demographic questions, a question regarding language preference, 14 statements (N = 407) comparing various aspects of interaction between individuals with and without autism and six open-ended questions (N = 337). The sample includes adults spanning a range of ages and educational backgrounds. The results from the statements revealed that adults with autism experienced all, except for one, aspects of communication to be better and easier with others who also have autism than with others who do not. The only aspect of communication they did not experience to be better with others with autism was body language. The results from the open-ended questions mainly support the findings from the statements, but also provide additional nuance. Themes highlighted easier interactions between individuals with autism, characterized by mutual understanding and the absence of judgment. Additionally, when they know someone else also has autism, they feel less need to camouflage. However, some interaction difficulties were also noted. In conclusion, the experiences of adults with autism in our study align with the theory of the double empathy problem, however further systematic research is warranted to test this theory.",

          "abstract": "Purpose. Many women want to breastfeed, but experience breastfeeding difficulties (such as latching problems, perceived low milk supply, nipple pain) with associated consequences for poor mental health. The aim of the current study was to investigate mother’s perceptions of how breastfeeding difficulties have impacted their mental health, couched within a behaviour change model, to identify intervention targets.\nMethods. Data were collected in October 2023 via an online cross-sectional survey. Participants provided qualitative open-ended responses to describe how they felt that breastfeeding difficulties may have impacted their mental health (N=1141).  This qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis and themes were mapped deductively on to the COM-B model of behaviour change.\nResults. In general, mothers were highly motivated to breastfeed, but experienced challenges with psychological capability, physical capability, and social opportunity. Analyses resulted in the identification of the following targets for intervention: 1) education around the realities of what to expect when breastfeeding, including breastfeeding difficulties, 2) support for technical challenges and pain management when experiencing breastfeeding difficulties, and 3) education for healthcare professionals, families and wider society on the importance of supporting breastfeeding mothers who are experiencing breastfeeding difficulties.\nConclusion. Interventions targeted at breastfeeding mothers who are experiencing breastfeeding difficulties with associated mental health consequences have the potential to reduce rates of both early breastfeeding cessation and poor maternal mental health in the postnatal period. Here, we extend existing knowledge by identifying potential intervention targets to enable mothers to better cope with the challenges of breastfeeding.",

          "authors": "Nils Jostmann; Eddie Brummelman",
          "abstract": "Positive feedback is often given in an attempt to boost people’s performance. In many cases, however, positive feedback undermines performance. Why? A common explanation is recipients interpret positive feedback as evidence that they are making more progress toward their goal than expected, leading them to coast. Here, we propose an alternative explanation: Receiving positive feedback is a pleasurable experience that decouples the grip of attention from the task, which undermines performance. If so, performance drops after positive feedback could be prevented by delaying the positive feedback until individuals have started preparing for their next task. Doing so may even transform the positive feedback into a motivational reward that allows individuals to utilize the rewarding experience of receiving positive feedback to energize their on-task behavior, thereby improving performance. We tested the decoupling hypothesis in three well-powered experiments (total N = 395), including a preregistered replication. Across experiments, we found that when positive feedback was delivered before participants started preparing for their next task, it impaired subsequent performance. Supporting the decoupling hypothesis, when positive feedback was delivered after participants started preparing for their next task, it did not impair subsequent performance; in fact, it boosted performance. These findings shed new light on the cognitive-affective mechanisms that underlie performance drops after positive feedback and identify unique ways to alleviate them. Also, the findings show that individuals do not invariably coast after positive feedback. This has broad implications for motivation theory and feedback interventions.",

          "abstract": "Facial features transmit emotions but their effect on visual orienting and explicit emotion recognition is debated. Here we examined whether fixating on diagnostic features of emotional expressions — such as eye region for fear and the mouth for happiness — affects saccadic targeting and improves recognition accuracy. Across two pre-registered experiments, participants viewed fearful, happy, and neutral faces for short intervals (50ms or 150ms) while the initial fixation location was manipulated. Although such brief stimulation does not allow for visual exploration, the faces triggered a substantial number of saccades that occurred after stimulus offset. These reflexive saccades were modulated by the emotional expressions indicating a consistent preferential saccadic orienting towards diagnostic features, even with limited exposure. As this effect disappeared for inverted faces, it can be attributed to an extrafoveal processing of facial features instead of an attentional orienting towards physically salient image regions. Participants' recognition accuracy was unaffected by the foveated facial feature, but this observation might also be due to ceiling effects in performance. Collectively, these findings contribute to understanding the attentional mechanisms of feature-based processing in the perception of emotional facial expressions.",

This study investigates how the toucher’s gender and social role influence NCE and psychological ownership. Study 1 revealed that male touchers elicited stronger NCE compared to female touchers, and products touched by stranger customers were more negatively perceived than those touched by store staff. Study 2 demonstrated that psychological ownership was higher for products touched by stranger customers than by store staff, suggesting a close relationship between ownership perceptions and NCE. These findings highlight the interplay of social and psychological factors in shaping consumer disgust. Practical implications include strategies for optimizing product handling in retail and online contexts.

          "abstract": "In the risky-choice framing effect, most people prefer a certain option over a risky one when the options are framed as gains, but this preference is typically reversed when the options are framed as losses. Past research has largely neglected how the size of this effect varies as a function of the probabilities in the risky option. DeKay et al. (2022) recently reported an inverted-U pattern in which the effect is smaller for extreme probabilities (e.g., .01, .99) than for moderate probabilities. This pattern is predicted by some theories but not others. We report a replication of the inverted-U pattern and other results involving varieties of risk comparisons (certain vs. risky, somewhat risky vs. risky, and certain vs. somewhat risky) in a preregistered online experiment (N = 807). Results indicate that the framing effect is significantly smaller but still sizeable at extreme probabilities. An internal meta-analysis (N = 2,518) confirms the reliability of the inverted-U pattern and its moderation by risk comparison. We also assess how well 5 theories (prospect theory, transfer-of-attention-exchange theory, fuzzy-trace theory, fuzzy-trace theory with rounding of extreme probabilities to 0 or 1, and the priority heuristic) account for 7 features of the data. None of these theories accounts for all of the results, though transfer-of-attention-exchange theory edges out prospect theory, which edges out the others. These results highlight the value of assessing an effect’s generalizability over variations in experimental materials.",

Twenty studies met the criteria for inclusion, leading to the identification of 17 distinct interventions for analysis. The promise of the interventions was assessed through their effectiveness, the RE-AIM Framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) dimensions, and risk of bias. The evaluation of interventions’ promise deemed three studies as ‘Quite Promising’, six as ‘Slightly Promising’, and eleven as ‘Not Promising’. All promising interventions somewhat met the RE-AIM dimensions. Variability was observed in TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) characteristics, including Rationale, Intervention provider, Length and frequency of intervention, and Retention. Factors that potentially contribute to the success or limitation of digital mental health interventions among adolescents are discussed. The review underscores the need to enhance the methodological rigor and to evaluate and report the real-world impact of interventions to ensure they benefit a broader demographic of young people.",

          "abstract": "Research on music-evoked autobiographical memories has grown rapidly in recent years, suggesting that music can be an effective stimulus for cueing memories from one’s life. One challenging aspect of this type of research is creating a stimulus set that is effective at cueing autobiographical memories in a wide range of individuals. The present work sought to address this issue by creating a normed stimulus set of popular music and popular movie cues. In addition to this methodological aim, we had an empirical aim to identify differences between autobiographical memories cued by music and movies. Participants (N=248) either listened to excerpts of popular music or viewed clips of popular movies. After each stimulus, participants rated it on several dimensions, including emotional valence, emotional arousal, familiarity, and autobiographical salience. Results indicated that certain songs and movies are autobiographically salient across a wide age range of participants. Additionally, we identified that musical cues show a significantly more pronounced reminiscence bump than movie cues, suggesting that music from the reminiscence bump period of life is more effective at triggering memories. Overall, these data provide an important resource for researchers wishing to use popular media to cue autobiographical memories, as well as indicating differences between memories cued by music and movies.",

          "abstract": "The attraction effect refers to the impact of an asymmetrically dominated irrelevant option (decoy) in shifting preferences towards its dominant option (target), with respect to another, non-dominant alternative (competitor). This context effect has been observed in multiple studies, yet its practical relevance in real-life situations has recently been questioned, since various factors can modulate, nullify, or even reverse the attraction effect. In this study, we investigate the impact of presentation order and presentation modality (simultaneous or sequential) on the elicitation of the effect in a value-based choice task. Previous studies documented the relevance of these variables in modulating the effect, yet they used perceptual discrimination tasks, raising the question of whether these factors would have the same impact on value-based choice. Our findings confirm that spatial proximity between target and decoy is necessary for eliciting attraction effects in value-based choice (as it is in perceptual discrimination) when options are presented simultaneously; however, when options are presented sequentially, temporal proximity is showed to be irrelevant for the attraction effect, which is observed across all presentation orders (contrary to what was reported in previous studies using perceptual discrimination tasks). These results provide further insight on the importance of both visual arrangement, task demands, and cognitive processing in modulating context effects in decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Risperidone is an antipsychotic used to treat behavioural symptoms of dementia such as agitation. Guidance stipulates it be used as a last resort and in these cases there is evidence of benefit, however it carries a number of severe side effects, including stroke. Prescribing data suggest regular use outside of this guidance but the reasons for this are unclear. We currently know very little about the first-hand experiences of people involved in prescribing decisions within care homes. This study aimed to understand perceptions around the risks and benefits of risperidone, preferences on how side effect risks are communicated, and how people feel about being able to better predict these risks. Semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted with care home residents, relatives, and staff. A focus group was conducted with external healthcare professionals. Using framework analysis, five main themes were identified: 1) the interplay between the person and their symptoms; 2) balancing voices in decision making; 3) what happens before prescription?; 4) bringing together information to make the right decision; 5) what happens after prescription?. Care home staff and relatives of people with dementia were generally uncertain of the risks of risperidone, and the potential side effects were often not explained adequately. Person-centred care was preferred by participants, but there is often no alternative to risperidone as a last resort. While it continues to be prescribed, efforts to minimise harm are required. Specifically, improved education around the risks of risperidone is needed. Relatives wish to be involved in the decision-making process alongside care staff, and their involvement should be optimised with the use of a decision-aid.  Accessible dementia-specific guidance on monitoring risperidone after prescription should also be developed.",

          "abstract": "While negative risk-taking behavior in adolescents is a classic topic, extant research has long spent little attention to the positive aspects of adolescents’ development. One topic that started to gain more research focus is prosocial risk-taking behavior – defined as behavior where an individual takes a risk to help someone else. However, validated measures are still limitedly available. The goal of the study is to construct and validate a multifaceted measure to assess prosocial risk-taking in adolescents. A sample of 234 Dutch adolescents (149 girls) aged 14-17 filled in the unvalidated prosocial adolescent risk-taking questionnaire (PAR-Q) to perform an exploratory factor analysis to indicate initial factor structure. A separate data sample of 357 Dutch adolescents (208 girls) aged 14-17 filled in the PAR-Q to confirm this factor structure with a confirmatory factor analysis and additional questionnaires for convergent validity. In this sample, also test-retest reliability was assessed. The final two-factor structure, which represented Social and Material prosocial risk subscales, exhibited acceptable internal consistency and excellent test-retest reliability. The PAR-Q correlated positively with prosocial behaviors and empathy. The PAR-Q is a newly validated measure with good psychometric properties that can be used to gain more information on prosocial risk-taking, behavior in adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Medication adherence is influenced by both psychological and medical factors, including risk communication and numeracy skills. The way side-effect information is presented—whether in a positive or negative frame, and whether numerical data is conveyed in frequencies or percentages—can impact adherence. These effects may be more pronounced for individuals with lower numeracy.\nMaterial and Methods: Participants (N = 332) were asked to read a medication description with varying side-effect information based on experimental conditions. They were randomly assigned to a 3 (frame: positive, negative, combined) x 2 (numerical format: percentages, frequencies) between-subjects design. The study assessed risk perception, medication intention, and emotional responses while considering participants’ numeracy levels. \nResults and Discussion: Framing and numerical format significantly influenced risk perception and medication intention. Negative framing and frequency-based formats resulted in higher risk perception and lower medication intention. Moreover, numeracy interacted with the numerical format: individuals with lower numeracy showed higher medication intention in the percentage format and reported more negative emotions in the frequency format.\nConclusions: The way information is framed and presented numerically plays a significant role in shaping risk perception and medication intention. Negative framing and frequency formats tend to increase perceived risk and decrease medication intention. Tailoring communication based on numeracy levels could improve medication adherence.",

          "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively associated with relationship quality in romantic couples, but few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this association. The current study examines the mediating role of extrinsic emotion regulation (regulating your partner’s emotions) on the associations between EI and relationship quality. Specifically, we studied the mediating effects of three extrinsic regulation strategies involving high engagement with the partner’s emotions (cognitive reframing, receptive listening, and valuing). Heterosexual couples (N = 175) completed three waves of surveys across 14 weeks from August to October 2021. EI, extrinsic emotion regulation strategies, and relationship quality were measured at three time points. Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Models (APIMeMs) were applied to analyse the dyadic data. Results showed that valuing one’s partner was the only significant mediator linking EI to relationship quality. For both men and women, individuals' EI is associated with better relationship quality for themselves and their partners, through their extrinsic emotion regulation behaviours of valuing their partners. These findings underscore the importance of fostering EI and mutual valuing within couples, which relates to healthier and more successful romantic relationships.",

          "abstract": "The literature presents two contrasting accounts on the influence of cognitive reflection (tendency to override intuition by engaging in deliberation or analytical thinking) on susceptibility to misinformation. According to the classical reasoning account, rooted in research on evaluation of mainly soft news (sensational, human-interest stories), cognitive reflection improves truth discernment. According to the motivated reasoning account, rooted in research on argument construction about hard (policy-related) issues, cognitive reflection enhances political bias. We integrate these two accounts by examining how the distinction between soft and hard news interacts with individuals’ reasoning style to shape their capacity for truth discernment and susceptibility to political bias. Initially, we conducted an integrative data analysis (IDA) by synthesizing data from existing misinformation studies and incorporating independent ratings of news items along a hard-soft news dimension. We also conducted two experiments—one in the U.S., one in Greece—where participants viewed soft or hard political news. Across the IDA and experiments, participants higher on cognitive reflection were more prone to political bias, but only when evaluating hard news. Cognitive reflection was associated with improved truth discernment for both soft and hard news in the IDA, but not consistently so in the experiments. The findings reconcile discrepancies in the misinformation literature by demonstrating that cognitive reflection is not a one-size-fits-all solution to misinformation: although it is associated with improvement in truth discernment, it is also linked to exacerbated political bias in the case of hard news. We discuss implications of news softening for what qualifies as misinformation.",

          "abstract": "The influential model of sentence production developed by Bock and Levelt (1994) posits two stages of grammatical encoding: functional processing and positional processing. This model is sometimes referred to as the \"consensus model\" of grammatical encoding, given its wide support within psycholinguistic research. However, most research in the cognitive neuroscience of syntax does not align well with this two-stage consensus model. We will review recent research on the neurobiology of syntax, focusing on lesion-symptom mapping in people with aphasia, and in particular on the agrammatism-paragrammatism distinction. We will illustrate how a two-stage model of grammatical encoding aligns well with this distinction but does not precisely match the processing levels of functional and positional processing proposed by Bock and Levelt. We will illustrate how this consensus model can be revised in order to better accommodate the data. Finally, we will evaluate extant models of syntax and the brain, illustrating their respective adequacy and inadequacy with respect to accounting for these phenomena as well as their poor alignment with the consensus psycholinguistic model. We argue that models which involve two stages of grammatical encoding are more fruitful for pursuing relationships between psycholinguistics, aphasiology, and neuroscience.",

Anecdotal observations\nsuggest that mainstream U.S. audiences respond favorably when high-status perpetrators express\nless atonement, such as telling stories that minimize harm, or place responsibility on the victim.\nHowever, empirically, little is known about how perpetrator status and atonement influence\naudience responses. Informed by system justification theory, this vignette-based experiment\ntested the hypothesis that the more audiences are psychologically invested in an unequal status\nquo (i.e., the greater their system justification beliefs), the more they will favor perpetrators (vs.\nvictims), especially when high-status perpetrators atone less, and low-status perpetrators atone\nmore.

Dependent measures included\nperceived severity of and relative responsibility for the assault, empathy toward perpetrator and\nvictim, and ratings of their likeability and positive personality traits. Hierarchical regression\nanalysis revealed that, instead of the hypothesized interactive effects, there were consistent main\neffects of system justification and atonement across perpetrator status levels.

          "abstract": "Syntactic impairments in aphasia can provide a powerful window into the neurobiology of language. Considerable research has focused on agrammatism in nonfluent aphasia, driving a strong association between frontal brain systems and syntax. However, the syndrome of paragrammatism, typically characterized by grammatical errors in fluent aphasia, has recieved far less attention. Recent work has suggested that paragrammatism is primarily associated with posterior temporal-parietal lesions, converging with functional neuroimaging evidence that these regions support hierarchical syntax. However, the holistic perceptual approaches to paragrammatism used in this work suffer from limited inter-rater reliability as well as conflating factors such as speech rate. To remedy these issues, this study reports a system to classify agrammatic and paragrammatic symptoms at the level of the utterance using an objective coding scheme, building on previous analyses by Matchin et al. (2020). Trained speech-pathology students rated transcriptions of 88 retellings of the story of Cinderella from persons with aphasia alongside transcriptions from 53 age-matched healthy controls. Each utterance was classified by the presence of errors corresponding to functional processing (i.e., hierarchical processing) or positional processing (i.e., linearization), along with non-grammatical errors. We found that patients defined holistically using the perceptual approach as agrammatic or paragrammatic doubly dissociated in rates of functional and positional processing, and that qualitative behavioral variables distinguish healthy speech from agrammatic and paragrammatic samples. We suggest that agrammatism and paragrammatism result from distinct breakdowns in syntactic structure building during speech, resulting from damage to distinct syntactic subsystems of the brain.",

Results indicated that individuals with more (versus less) adverse childhood experiences, particularly those involving maltreatment and victimization, reported more white and big lies, independent of aversive personality traits like narcissism and Machiavellianism. Together, these findings support the dispositional honesty hypothesis, indicating that foundational childhood experience and events can shape or signal deceptive behavior.

However, in assessing cheating interrogations, AI was lie-biased by judging more than three-quarters of interviewees as cheating liars. In assessing interviews where humans perform at rates over 70%, AI performed below chance, and accuracy plummeted to 15.9% with an ecological base-rate.

However, it was associated with lower perceived stress (β = -0.44, p &lt; .001) and fewer depressive symptoms (β = -0.21, p = .041). Autobiographical memory specificity showed no relationship with perceived stress or depressive symptoms. Furthermore, more severe CA (β = 0.21, p = .002) and higher perceived stress (β = 0.56, p &lt; .001) were both associated with more depressive symptoms.\n\nConclusions: These findings point towards a model where friendship support exerts its protective mental health effects possibly through reducing perceived stress in young people with CA, rather than through influencing the specificity of positive or negative autobiographical memories.",

However, individual differences in response to exposure indicate that many patients do not fully benefit from therapy. Examining individual changes over time in threat expectancy likelihood, a theorized working mechanism of exposure as proposed by the Inhibitory Retrieval Theory, may help optimize individual treatment success. This study aimed to examine the dynamics of learning during one exposure exercise for fear of public speaking and the retention of learning in daily life. Participants with elevated fear of public speaking (70 women, M age = 23.10) completed an exposure exercise designed to violate an idiosyncratic threat expectancy. They gave two, three, or four presentations to at least halve threat expectancy likelihood. Ecological momentary assessments were used to measure threat expectancy likelihood eight times a day for four days before and four days after the exposure exercise. Results showed individual differences in how fast threat expectancy likelihood decreased during the exposure exercise. Furthermore, there were individual differences in how much this translated to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood in daily life and how long participants retained the decrease. Additionally, after the exposure exercise, we found a decrease in threat expectancy severity, anticipatory anxiety, avoidance tendency, and an increase in willingness to give a presentation in daily life. Future research could examine whether individual differences in the dynamics of learning and retention in daily life following an exposure exercise are clinically relevant as predictor of overall treatment success.",

Using online and student samples (Ns = 906 and 521), we investigated 81 framing-effect variants created from matched and mismatched pairs of 18 option descriptions (nine in each frame). Description valence or gist explained substantial variation in risk preferences (prospect theory does not predict such variation), but a considerable framing effect remained in our balanced design. Risky-choice framing effects appear to be partly—but not completely—the result of mismatched comparisons.",

          "abstract": "Background: Registered Reports are an emerging publication format, which emphasizes methodological rigor over results. Integrating this format into education allows one to teach research skills when data collection is infeasible.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the implementation of Registered Reports for replication research in an undergraduate psychology methods course.\n\nMethod: A five-week course was conducted where students developed Stage 1 Registered Reports proposing to replicate published findings. The evaluation was conducted by the students through consensus meetings held during a paper-in-a-day workshop, which also served as a collaborative writing activity for this paper.\n\nResults: Registered Reports scaffolded students’ research skills, enhanced motivation, and instilled open science values. Students gained practical insights into reproducible research practices, but worried about the necessary support to continue applying them and expressed concerns about public pre-registration, citing fears of criticism.\n\nConclusion: Registered Reports are valuable for teaching research methods, particularly in courses where data collection is impractical. However, institutional support and curriculum-wide integration are essential to sustain the benefits they provide.\n\nTeaching Implications: Instructors should leverage the full feedback opportunities of Registered Reports and be mindful of the hidden costs of engaging students in open science practices. Paper-in-a-day workshops can be explored as standalone educational activities.",

          "authors": "Aislinn Keogh; Jennifer Culbertson; Simon Kirby",
          "abstract": "Cross-linguistically, lexicons tend to be more phonetically clustered than required by the phonotactics of the language; that is, words within a language are more similar to each other than they need to be. In this study, we investigate how this property evolves under the influence of competing communicative pressures: a production-side pressure to re-use more easily articulated sounds, and a comprehension-side pressure for distinctiveness of wordforms. In an exemplar-based computational model and a communication experiment using a miniature artificial language, we show that natural-language-like levels of clustering emerge from a trade-off between these pressures. With only one pressure at work, the resulting lexicons tend to inhabit an extreme region of the possible design space: production pressures alone give rise to maximally clustered lexicons, while comprehension pressures alone give rise to maximally disperse lexicons. We also test whether clustering emerges more strongly for high-frequency items, but our results lend support only to a weak relationship between frequency and clustering. Overall, this study adds to a growing body of evidence showing that mechanisms operating at the level of individual language users and individual episodes of communication can give rise to emergent structural properties of language.",

Sixty-eight toddlers of diverse ethnic backgrounds (39 females; 338-908 days; 79.4% White) watched videos depicting adult informants expressing emotions towards novel objects.

Eighteen- to 24-month-olds exhibited distinct looking patterns in response to the consistent versus inconsistent informants (Cohen’s d = 0.42), demonstrating greater gaze following toward the emotionally consistent adult.

          "abstract": "Objectives: Parental age at first birth tends to be transmitted across generations, and multifaceted factors are involved in the mechanisms that underlie these intergenerational associations. The current study examined the potential mediating role of emotional and behavioral problems in this process.\nMethods: We investigated intergenerational transmission of age at first birth and the potential mediating role of internalizing and externalizing problems in the Dutch population (N = 2,674), using data from the TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey. Cox regression and mixed models with random slopes were used to examine associations between 1) parental age at first birth and offspring’s age at first childbirth by age 33, 2) parental age at first birth and emotional and behavioral problems in offspring from age 11 to 22, and 3) emotional and behavioral problems from age 11 to 22 and age at first childbirth.\nResults: Our analyses yielded two main findings. First, parental age at first birth predicted the timing of transition to parenthood in the next generation, in both mother-to-child and father-to-child pairs. Second, emotional and behavioral problems in adolescence and young adulthood were not predicted by parental age at first birth, nor did these problems in youth predict their age at first childbirth in adolescence and young adulthood. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that mental health problems do not play a mediating role in the intergenerational associations of parental age at first birth in the Netherlands. Several social and psychosocial factors may have contributed to the null findings in our study population.",

          "authors": "Valeria Becattini; Michael Lifshitz; Mark Miller",
          "abstract": "Meditation practices often involve sustaining attention on the body. Typically, attention is understood to enhance both neural resource allocation and the subjective salience of the attended target. However, in deep meditative states, practitioners sometimes report a dissolution of bodily boundaries, a phenomenon known in Pali as bhaṅga. This presents a paradox: why does focused attention, which typically heightens sensory perception, instead lead to its dissolution? This paper addresses this apparent contradiction by integrating computational, phenomenological, and empirical perspectives on attention, interoception and meditation. We focus on the body-scan technique, as practiced in Theravada Buddhist traditions, and its powerful capacity to produce experiences of the dissolution of bodily boundaries. Working within the Predictive Processing framework, we propose that this \"dissolution\" of bodily boundaries results from the body-scan's impact on attentional processes. We argue that by enhancing the precision of low-level predictions related to somatosensory signals, the body-scan effectively attenuates these signals, thereby diminishing perception of the body’s boundaries. In support of this claim, we first describe the body-scan technique and its phenomenological outcomes. We then introduce key concepts from the predictive processing framework and provide a detailed analysis of attentional processes during the body-scan. We conclude that the attenuation of somatosensory signals during the body-scan not only contributes to the experience of bhaṅga but also suggests a broader potential of this practice for enhancing well-being. With appropriate therapeutic integration, this attentional modulation offers promising applications in addressing conditions characterized by disrupted self-regulation, such as addiction and emotional dysregulation.",

          "authors": "Luianta Verra; Bernhard Spitzer; Nicolas W Schuck; Ondrej Zika",
          "abstract": "Anxiety has been linked to increased generalisation of threat expectations to stimuli that are perceptually similar. Such generalisation can arise either from a failure to distinguish between threatening and non-threatening stimuli (perceptual mechanism) or from the transfer of learned values between stimuli (value-based mechanism). Despite important implications for treatment, how these two mechanisms contribute to generalisation and whether they are differentially impacted by anxiety remains undetermined. Here, we combine a set of novel experimental and computational approaches to dissociate perceptual and value-based contributions to generalisation. Following a thorough perceptual titration, participants (N=140) completed conditioning and generalisation tasks while we varied outcome probability and discriminability. Using computational modelling, we show that commonly reported generalisation patterns for stimuli varying on a perceptual dimension can arise due to perceptual and value-based mechanisms, and that individuals differ in what mechanism drives their behaviour. Further, we show that trait anxiety is associated with stronger generalisation to stimuli that are most dissimilar from the threatening stimulus, where uncertainty about the possibility of aversive outcomes is highest. This is driven by enhanced reliance on value transfer rather than inability to discriminate stimuli as indicated by a better fit of a value generalisation model based on generalisation functions compared to a model of poor perceptual discriminability. These results generate key novel insights into the nature of generalisation and how trait anxiety impacts generalisation at the level of cognitive mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Jacob Feldman",
          "abstract": "The representation of complex phenomena via combinations of simple discrete features is a hallmark of human cognition. But it is not clear exactly how (or whether) discrete features can effectively represent the complex probabilistic fabric of the environment. This paper introduces information-theoretic tools for quantifying the fidelity and efficiency of a featural representation with respect to a probability model. In this framework a feature or combination of features is “faithful” to the extent that knowing the value of the features reduces uncertainty about the true state of the world. In a single dimension, a discrete feature is faithful if the values of the feature correspond isomorphically to distinct classes in the probability model. But in multiple dimensions, the situation is more complicated: the fidelity of each feature depends on the direction in multidimensional feature space in which the feature is projected from the underlying distribution. More interestingly, distributions may be more effectively represented by combinations of projected features—that is, compositionality. For any given distribution, a variety of compositional forms (features and combination rules) are possible, which can be quite different from one another, entailing different degrees of fidelity, different numbers of features, and even different induced regularities. This paper proposes three specific criteria for a compositional representation: fidelity, simplicity, and robustness. The information-theoretic framework introduces a new and potentially useful way to look at the problem of compositionality in human mental representation.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Traditional methods for assessing unilateral spatial neglect (USN) have been criticized for limited ecological relevance, narrow scope, and overly simplistic design. To address this, we introduce a new version of the Executive Performance in Everyday LIving (EPELI) virtual reality task for USN assessment. In the EPELI, participants perform cognitively demanding everyday chores in a home-like environment, while precise behavioral data capturing diverse aspects of USN is recorded.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMethods: Fourteen healthy controls and ten right-sided stroke patients with USN diagnosed in the acute phase (aged 18–75) participated in this pilot study three months post-stroke. At that time, patients were considered to have either mild or “recovered” USN when assessed using traditional methods. EPELI-related eye, head, and hand movements, and task performance (e.g., execution time and the number of subtasks completed) were compared between the groups. Adverse effects, usability, and user experience were also reported.\t\t\t\n\nResults: Compared to healthy controls, USN patients showed a subtle ipsilesional (right-sided) bias in eye movements, made fewer first saccades to the contralesional (left) side, and exhibited reduced head rotations and velocity, though total hand movements were normal. They were also slower at completing subtasks, finished fewer subtasks, and performed fewer actions overall. Adverse effects were negligible, and technical usability was reasonably good.\t\t\t\n\nConclusion: Our findings indicate that the EPELI task, reflecting goal-directed behavior in a natural environment, can detect residual USN symptoms in patients with mild or partially recovered USN three months post-stroke. This underscores the opportunities of ecologically valid methods to assess USN.",

          "abstract": "The cross-lagged panel model with random intercepts (CLPM-RI) is often used to analyze reciprocal relationships, because it separates within-unit dynamics and between-unit differences by modeling unit-specific heterogeneity as a latent variable. Through a simulation study, it is shown that common specifications of the CLPM-RI often produce biased estimates of autoregressive (AR) and cross-lagged (CL) effects due to the initial conditions problem. These biases are often substantial enough to produce inaccurate inferences about the long-term stability of the observed system. An alternative approach suggested by Bollen and Brand (2010) resolves the initial conditions issue by conditioning unit-specific heterogeneity on the first observation and provides more accurate estimates and reliable inferences about system stability compared to the CLPM-RI.",

          "authors": "Pierre Le Denmat; Kobe Desender; Tom Verguts",
          "abstract": "Decision confidence should normatively reflect the posterior probability of making a correct choice, conditional on relevant information. However, how individuals learn to calibrate their sense of confidence to that probability remains unknown. The standard approach to estimate any quantity is to use trial-by trial samples of that quantity to train a function approximator (such as a neural network) based on the prediction errors (quantity minus prediction of the quantity). We tested whether humans learn about confidence using this principle in a perceptual decision-making experiment where participants repeatedly alternated between two manipulated feedback regimes (negative vs positive) every few blocks of trials. As anticipated, confidence ratings tracked feedback, with confidence gradually increasing when participants received overall positive feedback (and thus positive prediction errors), and decreasing when receiving negative feedback (and thus negative prediction errors). These feedback-induced dynamic changes were specific to confidence, as objective performance was unaffected by the manipulation. We propose a single-layer neural network model for confidence which updates the computation of confidence based on trial-level prediction errors, and demonstrate that it provides a good fit to the behavioral data. Taken together, these results show that the computation of confidence is dynamic: humans constantly update how they compute confidence based on prediction errors (feedback minus prediction), in a statistically efficient manner.",

State punishment is a unique type of punishment because it is a special case of third-party punishment, pre-specified to occur after the violation of official rules and policies, carried out by people acting on behalf of a nation or government. State punishment, especially as compared to interpersonal punishment, is regarded as a legitimate form of violence, which communicates not just disapproval, but information about procedures and power. Moreover, state punishment is made possible by state rules, which, unlike norms, are formalized, can be fully articulated, and are perfectly transmissible across generations. We end the paper with implications for the psychology of punishment more broadly, and future directions for better understanding the unique psychology of state punishment.",

While non-pharmacological interventions are first line treatment strategies, in severe cases associated with a risk of harm, antipsychotics may be indicated. A major adverse effect of antipsychotics in dementia is an increased risk of stroke and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone’s mechanism of action has been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) biological pathways.  \nAims:\nTo evaluate the risk of stroke associated with risperidone use across different patient subgroups defined by stroke and CVD history.\nMethod:\nAnonymised primary care data from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) was used to identify individuals diagnosed with dementia after the age of 65 between 2004 and 2023. Risk of stroke over one year was compared between individuals initiating risperidone and propensity score-matched controls.\nResults: \nIn the overall cohort (28,403 Risperidone Users and 136,324 Matched Controls), patients treated with risperidone had an increased risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.37). In the Risperidone User group, the incidence rate (IR) of stoke was substantially higher in those with a prior history of stroke (IR: 222 per 1000 person-years (PY)) and CVD (IR: 94.1 per 1000 PY) than in the overall cohort (IR: 53.3 per 1000 PY). Relative risks related to risperidone were similar across all CVD and stroke subgroup comparisons (HRs between 1.23 and 1.44). \nConclusions:\nPeople with dementia with a prior history of CVD are at a significant increased risk of stroke and risperidone further exacerbates this risk. Moreover, risperidone also increases risk of stroke in patients without a prior history of CVD. This quantification of stroke risk across subgroups with and without history of CVD may help with communication risk and aid more judicious prescribing.",

          "abstract": "Sexual molestation of children has become one of the most emotionally charged crises facing our society. Many states have responded by mandating incarceration and treatment for adults who molest children. The purpose of this study was to explore the cognitive dynamics of molestation and to help provide information needed to guide the development of offender treatment programs. \n\nThe specific cognitive variables included dualistic thinking, sexual-moral restrictiveness, and five dysfunctional adult relationship beliefs. Three groups of 40 adult male subjects were compared on these variables. The child molest offender group was randomly chosen from male inmates age 25 to 65 who were currently incarcerated at the Arizona State Prison, Tucson, for sexually molesting prepubertal female children and whose offenses were nonincestuous. A non-sex offender criminal control group matched for age and education was chosen within the same prison using a stratified random sampling process. A second matched control group, the nonoffender controls' was comprised of men who had never been charged or convicted of a sexual or nonsexual offense. \n\nData were analyzed by multivariate and univariate procedures. Tukey's studentized range test was used for post \n\nhoc analysis. A one-way MANOVA revealed a significant overall difference on a composite of the dependent variables. Univariate analyses indicated significant differences among the three groups on sexual-moral restrictiveness and on adherence to the belief that partners cannot change. Differences in scores on dualism approached significance. \n\nPost hoc pair wise comparisons revealed that (1) criminal controls are significantly less restrictive in their sexual-moral beliefs than the other two groups and (2) the criminal controls adhere significantly more closely to the belief that partners cannot change than do child molest offenders. On the dualism variable, the difference between child molest offender and nonoffender control group means fell just short of significance with the former exhibiting more dualistic thinking. \n\nThe meaning and implications of these findings are discussed in terms of cognitive issues in offender treatment. Recommendations for future research are also included.",

In this study, participants (N = 38) made judgments on the perceptual dominance of a target odour (food or non-food) in an odour mixture under hungry and sated conditions. Our results demonstrate that 1) participants are more sensitive to contamination in food compared to non-food targets and that 2) contaminants in food targets are detected at even lower concentrations when participants are hungry compared to sated. These findings indicate a generalised heightened sensitivity to deviance in food compared to non-food odours, which arises independently of metabolic state and is preserved even when directed attention is experimentally modulated away from the food target. This increased sensitivity to deviance during hunger may indicate a heightened attentiveness to food odour contamination in situations where food intake is likely. This study highlights the vital role of metabolic state as a modulator of olfactory perception, and its role in regulating food intake. \n\nKeywords: Perception, Olfaction, Decision-Making, Contamination Sensitivity, Food Odour, Deviation Tolerance",

          "abstract": "Creativity is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, particularly during childhood, as it plays a key role in supporting cognitive, emotional, and social development. Exploring creativity through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) provides valuable insights into the brain mechanisms underlying this vital cognitive process.\n\nThis study analyzed the power spectrum characteristics and functional connectivity of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric brain activity during creative tasks in 15 Argentine children aged 9 to 12, using a 14-channel EEG system. The Torrance test of creative thinking (TTCT) was used, incorporating one figural and one verbal task. EEG metrics included relative power spectral density (rPSD) across Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands, as well as functional connectivity assessed through coherence analysis across the [1–50] Hz spectrum.\n\nThe results revealed significant increases in rPSD across all frequency bands during creative tasks compared to rest, with no significant differences between figural and verbal tasks. Coherence analysis indicated enhanced intrahemispheric synchronization, particularly in frontotemporal and temporo-occipital regions, alongside reduced interhemispheric frontal coherence. These findings suggest that creativity in children involves a dynamic reorganization of brain activity, characterized by oscillatory activation and region-specific connectivity changes. Furthermore, the study highlights a common neural basis for divergent thinking tasks, contributing to a deeper understanding of the brain mechanisms supporting creativity during childhood development.",

          "abstract": "The human ability to think about thinking (\"theory of mind\") is a fundamental object of study in many disciplines. In recent decades, researchers across these disciplines have converged on a rich computational paradigm for modeling theory of mind, grounded in recursive probabilistic reasoning. However, practitioners often find programming in this paradigm extremely challenging: first, because thinking-about-thinking is confusing for programmers, and second, because models are extremely slow to run. This paper presents memo, a new domain-specific probabilistic programming language that overcomes these challenges: first, by providing specialized syntax and semantics for theory of mind, and second, by taking a unique approach to inference that scales well on modern hardware via array programming. memo enables practitioners to write dramatically faster models with much less code, and has already been adopted by several research groups.",

          "abstract": "Chinese speakers have long suffered from character amnesia in handwriting, failing to handwrite a character despite being able to recognize it. The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying character amnesia remain unclear. The current study employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore brain regions that are associated with character amnesia; in particular, we tested whether character amnesia is associated with deactivation in the fusiform gyrus (FG), the superior parietal gyrus (SPG), or the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which have been shown to respectively associated with the orthographic lexicon, graphemic buffer, and phonology-orthography conversion. In a handwriting-to-dictation task, twenty-three Cantonese-speaking adults handwrote a character according to a dictation prompt and then reported whether they correctly handwrote the character or suffered from character amnesia. fNIRS results showed that, compared to correct handwriting, character amnesia elicited significantly reduced neural activation in the bilateral FG, the SPG, and the SMG. Parametric analyses showed that character frequency and number of strokes positively correlated with activation of the FG and the SPG respectively. Functional connectivity analyses further demonstrated that, compared to correct handwriting, character amnesia was associated with significantly decreased connectivity between the left FG and the left SMG, the right FG and the right SMG, the right FG and the right SPG, the right FG and the left SMG, the right FG and the left SPG, but with increased connectivity between the left SPG and the left SMG. Together, these results suggested that character amnesia is associated with the decayed orthographic representations (in the orthographic lexicon) and failure in phonology-orthography conversion, resulting in reduced orthographic information being retrieved (into the graphemic buffer) for handwriting execution.",

Consequently, written behavioral stimuli are frequently deployed in psychological research in domains such as social cognition, impression formation, and moral psychology.

We collected behaviors from several widely used sets, and then expanded on them by writing hundreds of new behaviors. Ultimately, this yielded a database of 2375 behaviors that is larger, broader in scope, and considerably more diverse than the previous sets that inspired this work. We then recruited a large set of participants (total N = 4792) to evaluate these behaviors across 18 dimensions central to person perception. It is our hope that this resource can support more rigorous, replicable research into the psychological and neural underpinnings of social learning.",

          "abstract": "A metastudy is a set of many tiny studies (microstudies) created from a much larger collection of possibilities. Metastudies can yield many of the benefits of time-consuming replications and meta-analyses, but more efficiently and with greater attention to generalizability and the causal effects of moderators. Statistical precision and power are higher than in studies with the same total sample size but with fewer conditions and more participants per condition. In this article, we describe metastudies and their benefits, demonstrate how to conduct a metastudy using the well-known risky-choice framing effect as an example, and report on the generalizability of that effect. In three metastudies (total N = 2338), the framing effect generalized well across most of the potential moderators tested, as was expected. Surprisingly, however, the effect was up to twice as large when the certain option was replaced with a slightly risky option; prospect theory predicts the opposite and fuzzy-trace theory predicts no difference. Metastudies provide a relatively quick and not-so-painful way to examine an effect’s generalizability, without waiting for a meta-analysis. Both individual labs and multi-lab networks are encouraged to shift from traditional studies to metastudies.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Necka; Titilola Akintola; Qingbao Yu; Carolyn Amir; Olga Oretsky; Lauren Yvette Atlas",
          "abstract": "Clinical trials, laboratory experiments, and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that pain is highly sensitive to expectations, whether based on the psychosocial context surrounding treatment (e.g., placebo analgesia) or transient cues that provide information about painful events (e.g., pain-predictive cues). We asked whether placebo analgesia and pain-predictive cues modulate pain through the same mechanisms or dissociable brain pathways. Forty healthy volunteers rated pain in response to noxious heat during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We crossed pain-predictive cues, which induce expectations for high or low pain on a trial-by-trial basis, with administration of an inert placebo cream or a control cream. Behavioral analyses revealed a significant interaction, such that predictive cues had weaker effects on pain during placebo blocks than control blocks. This interaction was accompanied by interactions in the insula, pons, and other brain regions. We also observed distinct neural substrates when we compared pure cue effects with pure placebo effects, and only predictive cues modulated responses in nociceptive regions and the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS; (Wager et al., 2013). The only regions that were influenced similarly by both types of expectations were the rostral anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that cue-based expectations about stimulus intensity and placebo-based expectations about treatment outcomes are distinct, and that pain researchers should differentiate between sources of expectations. Furthermore, cue-based expectations were associated with more consistent effects than treatment-based expectations, suggesting that clinicians should be particularly mindful of how they present information about impending pain.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data with a large number of timepoints per individual are becoming increasingly common. Such data allow going beyond the classical growth model situation and studying population effects and individual variability not only in trends over time but also in autoregressive effects, cross-lagged effects, and the noise term. Dynamic structural equation models (DSEMs) have become very popular for analyzing intensive longitudinal data. However, when the data contain trends, cycles, or time-varying predictors which have nonlinear effects on the outcome, DSEMs require the practitioner to specify the correct parametric form of the effects, which may be challenging in practice. In this paper we show how to alleviate this issue by introducing regression splines which are able to flexibly learn the underlying function shapes. Our main contribution is thus a building block to the DSEM modeler's toolkit, and we discuss smoothing priors and hierarchical smooth terms using the special cases of two-level lag-1 autoregressive and vector autoregressive models as examples. We illustrate in simulation studies how ignoring nonlinear trends may lead to biased parameter estimates, and then show how to use the proposed framework to model weekly cycles and long-term trends in diary data on alcohol consumption and perceived stress.",

          "authors": "Sarah Oh; Anne Collins",
          "abstract": "Habits are an essential part of everyday decision-making. However, the mechanisms underlying habit formation and expression in humans are difficult to study in the laboratory, owing to a dearth of convenient experimental paradigms that reliably exhibit a key marker of habits – training-induced inflexibility – under ecologically valid conditions. This difficulty is often attributed to the fact that habits are identified in contrast to goal-directed (GD) control, which research participants typically engage strongly in laboratory experiments. To address this gap, we develop a new, short habit learning paradigm that incorporates several features we hypothesized would encourage participants to disengage GD control, enabling habits to exert greater influence over behavior: a hierarchical multi-step trial structure, opportunities for self-correction, and frequent switches between extensively and moderately practiced behaviors. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that overtraining amplifies habitual control, as evidenced by errors biased toward the overtrained context and away from the moderately-trained context at early response times, while later responses remain dominated by GD control. The reliability of this overtraining effect depended on the inclusion of task features designed to dampen GD control. In addition to providing a practical, robust, and flexible tool for studying the cognitive processes underlying habit formation and habitual control, our paradigm moves us beyond the traditional stimulus-response conception of habits, expanding the definition to include more complex, hierarchical behaviors that better reflect naturalistic human habits.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the conditional dependencies among items in Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM), a non-verbal measure of cognitive ability and fluid intelligence, within a sample of school-aged children. To this aim, we applied Bayesian networks (BNs), to data obtained from 255 participants, aged 4 to 11 years. We evaluated a variety of models, starting from the complete independence model and progressing to sequential, data-informed structures. The results highlighted that inter-item dependencies were particularly significant among kindergarten-aged children, suggesting that their problem-solving approaches may be influenced by their previous responses. The Sequential Data-Driven model consistently outperformed traditional human-driven hypothesis models, indicating the presence of complex interrelationships that could challenge the assumption of local independence in psychometric assessments. Cross-validation analyses revealed developmental differences in model fit, with optimal performance in kindergarten and increased variability as children transition to primary school. These findings advocate for the development of refined scoring methodologies that incorporate item interdependencies and prompt further investigation into the cognitive processes underlying these dependencies. Our study has implications for the psychometric validation of cognitive assessments, underscoring the importance of integrating complex item relationships in test design and analysis to enhance measurement accuracy and validity.",

          "authors": "Jarkko Hautala",
          "abstract": "Previous research indicates that readers may construct a location-invariant letter string representation before associating it with a lexical representation. In neural network modeling, this is achieved with a two-stack model in which a hidden layer first learns to map location-specific letter representations into word-centered positions. Then, another stack is trained to map them into lexical representations. However, the model has been validated only in one language (French). In this study, we replicated the model with a Finnish language corpus having substantially more resembling words (KISSAA, KISSAN, KISSAT) and with modern and accessible programming tools. To gain insight into the model’s coding principles, we also trained the model with random letter strings, analyzed the model’s hidden layer activation patterns, and conducted an error analysis. The results indicated that random letter string training leads to superior letter identity and position coding. However, the natural corpus with many close words leads to a more fine-grained mapping from word-centered letter string representations to lexical representations. Finally, bigram coding may emerge in weights connecting hidden to output nodes. We conclude that the one- or two-stack model seems a potent candidate for developing a universal and comprehensive connectionist model of reading.",

Following an overview of divination and the historical background of its scholarly study, Chapter 2 examines various definitions and proposes a working definition that balances common usage with theoretical coherence. Chapter 3 surveys existing theories of divination, including symbolic and functional perspectives, while critiquing their limitations. Chapter 4 argues for the primacy of cognition in divinatory practices, emphasizing the role of universal cognitive mechanisms and culturally specific worldviews in shaping their plausibility and persistence. Expanding on these ideas, Chapter 5 investigates the interplay between individual cognition and societal processes, highlighting socio-cultural factors such as the preferential reporting of successful outcomes that bolster divination’s perceived efficacy. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by summarizing the Element’s key arguments and identifying open questions for future research on the cognitive dimension of divination.",

However, it remains unclear what specific patterns of affective disturbance are shared across different symptom domains. Here we examined correlations between emotional disorder symptom severity (anxiety, depression, hypomania, and anhedonia) and affective reactivity to gain and loss outcomes within a decision-making task with embedded sampling of emotional valence (Experiment 1: N = 329; preregistered replication in Experiment 2: N = 524). Using hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling of emotion self-reports, we found that greater affective reactivity to gains and losses within the task was associated with more severe symptoms of both anxiety and hypomania. This suggest that heightened reactivity to both appetitive and aversive outcomes indexes emotional disorder severity across multiple symptom domains of psychopathology, in line with theoretical frameworks that conceptualize affective disturbance as a generalized risk factor for psychopathology.",

This preregistered review includes 22 studies on wellbeing and mental health indicators in the context of curiosity. Our findings indicate that curiosity predominantly exhibits positive associations with wellbeing outcomes such as life satisfaction and positivism, and a negative association with depression indicators. Additionally, some types of curiosity revealed inconsistent associations with wellbeing, linking positively with mental health indicators and negatively with positive wellbeing measures. We discuss the research gaps, particularly the need to investigate the mixed impacts of different curiosity types and to develop more nuanced frameworks for future research on the relationship between curiosity and wellbeing.",

Although previous studies identified experimental conditions under which humans and non-human animals show increased variable decision-making, we have only a limited understanding of its underlying cognitive mechanisms. Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate the use of three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. Model simulations with a policy-gradient meta-learning algorithm show that agents could respond more optimally in such environments by (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate to allow for faster interactions between reinforcement learning and extinction, or (3) strategically upvalue unchosen actions using a frequency-based memory. After demonstrating the theoretical benefit of each of these strategies, we fitted our model on existing datasets of human-, pigeons- and rat behavior in adversarial environments. We show that, while all three species can engage in highly variable behavior, only humans strategically upvalue unchosen actions as a strategy to achieve variability.",

          "abstract": "Defense attorneys for autistic criminal defendants sometimes argue that difficulties inferring others’ intentions and motivations—often referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM)—considered to characterize autistic people render them vulnerable to exploitation. In this chapter we examine the empirical evidence for such claims. Current evidence derives primarily from studies of autistic and non-autistic adults’ responding in traditional deception detection paradigms and in several novel paradigms used to probe autistic adults’ ability to detect and respond adaptively to others’ criminal intent during interactions. This evidence does not support the perspective that autistic adults are inherently vulnerable to criminal exploitation, although it does indicate that ToM difficulties and low verbal ability are independent risk factors, regardless of autism diagnostic status. Although marked ToM difficulties are more prevalent in autistic adult samples, they are not ubiquitous, thereby highlighting the importance of basing legal defense arguments on measured rather than assumed ToM characteristics. Despite the recent emergence of methodologies for exploring criminal vulnerability, further significant empirical advances will likely depend on the development of paradigms which assess autistic adults’ ability to respond appropriately when confronted with problematic situations that capture the complexities of real-life interactions.",

Rooted in\nSawyer and Norris’s (2013) dialogical approach, our script draws from Deleuze and Guattari’s\nrhizomes, Bakhtin’s carnival grotesque, and Eminem’s rap lyrics to generate a multiplicity of\nvoices—each treated as both collaborator and subject. The result is a collision of high theory and\npopular references that upends academic norms, calling attention to fluid ownership, citation\npractices, and the generative possibilities of mashup culture (Johnson-Eilola &amp; Selber, 2007). By\nforegrounding heteroglossia, we resist linear arguments and instead situate meaning “in the\nmiddle,” revealing how dialogic interplay and collective improvisation shape knowledge. The\ncarnival atmosphere, marked by comic subversions and open-ended acts, challenges rigid\nboundaries between personal memory, scholarly theory, and cultural artifacts. Rather than\nconcluding with definitive statements, the performance encourages ongoing mashups and\nreinterpretations, affirming duoethnography’s commitment to reflexive, relational practice and\ncelebrating the dynamic interplay that keeps research alive and evolving.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools that appear to perform with care and empathy can quickly gain users’ trust.

This paper examines how three GenAI tools, within divergent contexts, mimic credible emotional responsiveness: OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the National Eating Disorder Association’s Tessa, and Luka’s Replika. The analysis uses Hochschild’s (1983) concept of feeling rules to explore how these tools exploit, reinforce, or violate people’s internalised social guidelines around appropriate and credible emotional expression. We also examine how GenAI developers’ own beliefs and intentions can create potential social harms and conflict with users. Results show that while GenAI tools enact compliance with basic feeling rules – e.g., apologising when an error is noticed – this ability alone may not sustain user interest, particularly once the tools’ inability to generate meaningful, accurate information becomes intolerable.",

          "authors": "Amine BENNANI; Said Boujraf; Mohamed Benzagmout; Driss Boussaoud",
          "abstract": "One of the most highly debated issues in psycholinguistics during the last decades is the so-called bilingual cognitive advantage (BICA), i.e. the hypothesis that people with a bilingual experience outperform monolingual speakers on cognitive tasks, presumably attributed to strengthened executive functions. This debate is nowadays deadlocked, as contradictory findings continue to accumulate. Unfortunately, despite attempts to find explanations in the diversity of bilingual experiences as a potential source of individual variability and the questioning of the reliability of executive function tests used to measure BICA, the status quo is maintained and new research perspectives are strongly needed, possibly outside the realm of psycholinguistics. We consider bilingual experience as deeply anchored in social context and argue that any conclusion drawn from traditional paradigms assessing cognition in socially isolated subjects would be hazardous. In an era of increasing influence of concepts such as the social brain, studies of bilingualism have seldom taken into account the social nature of human interaction via language. Recent studies, however, suggest that even minimal components of social context, such as mere presence of others, with no overt interaction or communication, modulate BICA in a complex and dynamic manner, in interaction with other factors including linguistic context and gender. We will focus on attention as a common mechanism that accounts for both bilingual language processing and the monitoring of social presence. Bringing together psycholinguistics and social psychology perspectives, this review calls for a move towards a socially embedded approach of bilingualism, with an integrated view of executive attention.",

Reductions in paid work and their consequences for the gendered performance of unpaid work have the potential to shed light on this relationship. However, there is still no clear answer to the question of whether and how reductions in paid work (including reductions in working hours, job losses, and retirement) affect the amount of time spent on unpaid work by gender, and what factors explain the variation in existing studies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature on the topic. We analyzed 198 unique estimates of the effect of reductions in paid work on time spent on housework and care work in different-sex couples. Our findings indicate that both men and women respond to reductions in paid work by increasing the time they spend on unpaid work. Although the effect is stronger for men than for women, it is small and quite heterogeneous across studies. Therefore, it is insufficient to reduce gender inequality in the division of unpaid work.",

The research included 87 students in the second semester of the academic year 2023-2024 within two months. The questionnaire indicated different parts focusing on various aspects, such as students’ attitudes towards the English language, the challenges they encounter during the implementation of EMI, the improved skills, and the benefits. The results displayed the courses’ positive impact on students, including improving their skills, content knowledge, and vocabulary. This eventually reflected the optimistic attitude of the first-year students towards these courses. The results have some implications for the Ministry of Higher Education, such as providing intensive language courses for learners to support linguistic ability and high-quality learning",

          "authors": "Paige E Vaughn; Gregory A Huber",
          "abstract": "New technologies allow unprecedented public visibility of routine police-civilian interactions, but we know little about how the public wants the police to behave during them. We examine public evaluations about preferred punishment and fair treatment using vignette experiments that randomize multiple features of police-civilian interactions. These causal estimates reveal that for the mass public, officer race generally does not affect public attitudes, while participant demeanor, markers of threat, and civilian race do. Police-civilian interactions are evaluated through a lens of reciprocity: hostile officers are judged as less fair, while hostile and armed civilians are viewed as deserving of harsher punishment. When civilians remain polite and threat is low, there is little support for punitive outcomes, but poor civilian behavior warrants more punitive state action. Moreover, people prefer more punishment for White compared to Black civilians, and in interactions with White officers and civilians compared to those in which both parties are Black. Interactions with a White officer and a Black civilian are judged as less fair, as are the fairness of assigned punishments in them. Finally, views about fairness are not equivalent to views about appropriate sanctions. These results provide critical evidence about public attitudes regarding police punishment and fairness in order maintenance.",

Using qualitative content analysis of Faktabaari's Digital Information Literacy Guide, we explore its discussion of mis- and disinformation issues and impact, its construction for digital information literacy, and the role of NGOs in enhancing digital information literacy. Findings reveal Faktabaari’s emphasis on practical approaches to information evaluation, digital competence, and the societal impact of disinformation, highlighting its contributions to knowledge dissemination and advocacy. However, it lacks attention to generative artificial intelligence (AI) challenges and a structured conceptual framework for digital literacy. This research underscores the value of NGO-led efforts in enhancing public digital literacy and civic engagement, offering insights into their potential to address disinformation challenges beyond national borders.",

This challenge will need to be addressed on multiple levels—from small-time producers to large multinational corporations and from local governments to international treaties—across multiple components of food production. Trust among producers, regulators, and resource managers is one of the many things that will be required to successfully transform the food system. In this qualitative study, we explore trust dynamics among aquaculture producers in the midwestern US. Based on a series of 34 interviews, we use the trust ecology framework to illustrate both how the different dimensions of trust are present among aquaculture producers and how the dimensions of trust might be threatened. Our findings emphasize the importance of building stronger interpersonal relationships between regulatory agencies and aquaculture producers. Additionally, our research shows that producers feel a need for more vocal advocacy for the industry within the regulatory system. These findings present an important case study illustrating how trust influences the relationship between producers and regulators and how building trust might allow the industry to work together to grow production and, potentially, sustainability.",

          "abstract": "Background\nWeight-related discrimination is widespread in society. Some US studies have suggested weight discrimination may differ between demographic groups, impacting white women more than minority women or men. However, stigma differs substantially between societies, and few studies have explored intersectional effects outside the US.\nMethods\nIn a large (N=8,057) ethnically diverse panel study UK adults, we examined associations of body mass index (BMI) with two stigma-related outcomes in the past year: being insulted in an everyday setting and being denied a promotion or training at work. To explore intersectional effects, we examined whether sex, ethnicity, sex-ethnicity-combinations, or educational qualifications modified associations.\nResults\nIn models adjusted for confounders including psychological distress, higher BMI was correlated with being insulted in an everyday setting across all participants (per kg/m2, OR: 1.02, CI:1.01,1.03), male (OR: 1.03, CI:1.01,1.05) and female participants (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.00,1.03). Stratifying by ethnicity and sex-ethnicity combinations, the strongest association was seen for Asian men (OR:1.04, CI: 1.01,1.07); other estimates were less precise. Among participants employed in the past year, higher BMI was significantly associated with being denied promotion or training across all participants (OR: 1.03, CI: 1.00,1.06) and women (OR: 1.04, 1.01,1.08). Stratifying by sex-ethnicity combination, the strongest association was for Black women (OR: 1.06, CI: (1.01,1.12).\nConclusions\nResults are consistent with experience of weight discrimination across sexes, ethnic groups and educational levels in the UK. Longitudinal studies are needed to unravel mechanisms linking weight and discrimination in minority ethnic groups.",

          "authors": "Sharmin Jahan Juha; Arefin Mizan",
          "abstract": "Bangladesh started its COVID-19 mass vaccination program from February 2020. According to the COVAX live (Live COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker), as of May 2022, 70.26% of the total population have been vaccinated. This is indeed an example of Bangladesh governments' astounding competence that Bangladesh is considered among the first few countries to start vaccinations. However, Bangladesh did experience occasional hiccups in steady vaccine roll-out due to disruptions in the supply chain. Experts condemned Bangladesh's diplomatic choice of relying on only India as a steady vaccine manufacturing source after India decided to temporarily halt vaccinations right before the administration of second doses. Bearing reference to the 'Neighborhood Effect' in International Politics which implies that excessive dependency on geographical neighbors can cause similar levels of instability in both the countries (neighbors), this paper examines Bangladesh's overall Diplomatic approach in its COVID-19 Vaccination program with comparison to its East Asian counterpart Mongolia. Mongolia secured high-ranking position in COVID-19 mass vaccination using its strategic partnerships to pool vaccines from multiple sources as a result of its 2011 multi-pillars Foreign Policy (Third Neighborhood Policy) approach. Using a novel computational multimodal discourse analysis using machine learning assisted techniques in two large hand-collected datasets, the paper delves into the practices implemented by Bangladesh's multi-level stakeholders from the early stages of the pandemic until January this year to find any signs of or impacts of the Neighborhood Effect in its Vaccine Diplomacy. The paper later on makes policy-level suggestions on how to resolve this in case of future health crisis with occasional mention and comparison to Mongolia's Third Neighborhood approach and its implacability in Bangladeshi context.",

          "abstract": "Rising flood risks present significant threats to communities globally. This study examines the influence of risk perception and place attachment on the adoption of household adaptive behaviors in flood-prone regions of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The study employed latent profile analysis on data from 304 households, revealing four distinct profiles categorized by risk perception and levels of place attachment. The findings reveal that place attachment acts as an amplifier of adaptive behaviors, particularly when combined with high risk perception. Even in contexts of low risk perception, place attachment encouraged certain adaptive behaviors like insurance adoption. However, its effectiveness varied across socioeconomic contexts and types of adaptive measures, with the strongest effects observed for structural adaptation measures. The study demonstrates that combining strong place attachment with high risk perception is particularly effective in motivating costly protective actions. These findings suggest that flood risk management strategies should incorporate place-based elements alongside traditional risk communication approaches to better promote community resilience. This research contributes to understanding how such emotional connections to place can enhance flood adaptation.",

          "authors": "Peter Steiglechner; Paul E. Smaldino; Agostino Merico",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread perception that society has been polarizing into groups with increasingly divergent opinions. Multiple studies have sought to quantify the degree of opinion divergence (or ideological polarization), typically relying on variation among self-reported opinions, and have reached mixed conclusions. Each individual, however, perceives the landscape of public opinion through a subjective lens or viewpoint that is dynamically shaped by their social environment. To account for this subjectivity in perceived polarization, we propose a model of dynamic perception that takes social identity into account. When members of an in-group become increasingly homogeneous on a given topic (that is, when the variance of opinions in that group decreases), they perceive deviant opinions as increasingly distant from their own. Consequently, these individuals may perceive much more polarization than what an objective, neutral observer would perceive. We apply our model to empirical data on the opinions of German citizens about climate change and show that the effect of dynamic opinion perception on polarization can be nearly as substantial as actual opinion divergence. Moreover, we show that the direction of the effect need not be consistent over time, nor across different partisan groups. Our framework helps explain why people might sometimes experience levels of ideological polarization higher than those indicated by opinion surveys, independent of structural divisions, polarization-enforcing biases, or affect-driven attitudes towards out-groups.",

          "abstract": "In this examination of gender differences in financial expectations in academia, we used survey data (N = 11,315 scientists and scholars, 19 academic disciplines) integrated with individual-level bibliometric and demographic data from Scopus. We studied what Polish scientists and scholars with various demographic characteristics, academic attitudes, and bibliometric profiles considered their dream salary. Top dreamers were defined as the upper 10% of scientists in terms of self-reported level of their dream salary. Gender differences are much weaker than expected: Women generally tend to have almost equal dream salaries compared to men across age groups, academic positions, and disciplines. Although men are 56% overrepresented in the group of top dreamers, their financial expectations are similar compared to women. Among top dreamers, the median dream salary for men is only 5% higher than the median dream salary for women. Across all STEM disciplines combined, men on average expect salaries 19% higher than women (in non-STEM 15%, and in MED only 11%). Strongly research-oriented men expect higher median salaries than strongly research-oriented women; male top performers (the upper 10%) expect higher salaries than female top performers; and male internationalists in research expect higher salaries than female internationalists. Finally, as logistic regression shows, men with a strong research orientation, working in STEM disciplines, and with strong international research collaborations are most likely to be top dreamers.",

The review highlights current applications of AI in several journalistic areas, including content creation, audience engagement, and misinformation detection, whilst underscoring the ethical implications of AI. It identifies a notable scarcity of quantitative research and calls for a balanced methodological approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative methods, including large-scale surveys and qualitative techniques. Furthermore, the study highlights the lack of empirical research on AI regulation in journalism, advocating for studies that examine the value of regulatory frameworks for media ethics and journalism practice.

          "abstract": "Whether schools perpetuate or mitigate social inequality has been debated for decades. However, one crucial aspect that has remained unexplored is whether and to what extent inequalities manifest differently across schools. Using administrative data from Norway, our study uncovers that the link between parental income and academic achievement in 8th grade varies considerably across schools. In some schools, achievement gaps are more than twice as large as in others. This highlights that schools do not function as uniform entities; rather, some may exacerbate inequalities while others may play a more compensatory role. In fact, in some successful schools, family-level risk factors remain largely unmanifested. While the achievement gap variability is largely unrelated to the socioeconomic composition of schools, lower-quality schools tend to have a stronger income-achievement association than those of higher quality. Overall, our findings emphasize the necessity of a nuanced understanding of how inequalities manifest across diverse school contexts to fully grasp the role of schooling in social inequality and to devise effective strategies for reducing disparities.",

Aiming to contribute to this debate and provide material for discussion, this research focused on collecting, interpreting, and making available data and information related to the Pharmaceutical Sector on a global scale. It was found that the sector's annual revenue has almost quadrupled over the last two decades, reaching $1.48 trillion in 2022. The twenty largest companies have a combined market value of $3.5 trillion, assets worth $1.86 trillion, and generated revenue of $820 billion, resulting in profits of $181.6 billion. Of an oligopolistic nature, most of the leading companies are concentrated in the USA and Europe, although a group of industries in \"pharmerging countries\", especially in Asia, has been gaining strength. Pharmaceutical consumption, although still highly concentrated in developed countries, has also been expanding in emerging countries. This trend is driven by nations such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), as well as Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey (MIST).

          "authors": "Nikesh Lagun; Rohan Prasad Sah",
          "abstract": "This study discusses the complex range of factors that impact educational quality and school dropout rates in Nepal. It mainly considers such factors as socio-economic, cultural, and environmental ones. Some of the most common problems include social norms, the prevalence of early marriage, poverty, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to schools and school facilities, inadequate transportation, and lack of learning materials. The analysis uncovered severe variations in student-teacher ratios in institutional schools versus children in community schools in various provinces. The ratios were significantly higher in community schools and had a noxious impact on educational impressions. Furthermore, the investigation focuses on the connection between repetition rates and school leaving patterns. Repetition and repetition of many reasons of dropout were observed in the lower grades and transition phases, which were the most vulnerable and unstable periods to deal with. By statistical analysis, the case of high student-teacher ratios is proved, showing the imperativeness of the take-on measures. A problem of endurance in terms of the rural areas is crossing these hazardous places and the long travel distance in the way that dropout rates are increased even more. Cultural phenomena including early marital ties keep girls from getting continued education, increasing the number of female students who drop out at higher levels. The study reveals that improving infrastructure, creating economic assistance, enhancing the skills of the teachers, and encouraging community awareness as well is fundamental for the reduction of the dropout numbers and making quality education available for everyone. Accordingly, the time should be determined by elements targeting several factors that limit educational success in Nepal. which will facilitate more successful intervention in the at-risk persons and provide the children with equal education opportunities, thus, serving as one of the tolls for the future nation advancement.",

          "authors": "Ava Ajax",
          "abstract": "Intergenerational occupational mobility, the ability of individuals to move across occupational statuses relative to their parents, is a key measure of social equity and economic opportunity. While extensively studied in the context of developing economies, research on Bangladesh often focuses on specific factors—such as education, financial resources, or cultural norms—without integrating insights across urban and rural settings. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a secondary analysis of existing studies to examine how socio-economic and structural factors collectively shape occupational mobility in Bangladesh. Synthesizing findings from diverse research sources, the paper highlights the stark contrasts in mobility pathways between urban and rural areas and identifies the interconnected dynamics that influence these trajectories. The analysis reveals how disparities in access to education, labor markets, social networks, and financial resources contribute to differing mobility outcomes. By offering a holistic perspective, this study underscores the need for integrated policy frameworks to address regional disparities and promote equitable opportunities for mobility. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the broader economic implications of mobility barriers, including their impact on human capital development, innovation, and resource allocation. This integrative approach provides valuable insights for policymakers aiming to foster sustainable and inclusive growth in Bangladesh.",

It draws on the mobility approach, regime \ninteraction, and (legal) infrastructural studies, which, together, provide a tentative analytical framework for the legal infrastructuring processes that we observe around border regulation in Latin \nAmerica, an (arguably) understudied but core mobility hotspot. We present - in the form of several vignettes - different outcomes of infrastucturing processes which either enable or impede cross border mobility. This approach reveals the dynamic nature of law surrounding mobility and its apparent contradictions and unintended consequences. It concludes that the shift to an infrastructural account of the law can help us gain a more holistic and, therefore, more realistic understanding of how the law works over time, how it infrastructures crossborder mobility beyond and sometimes against states' intentions and expectations, and how people on the move have more agency than the snapshot image of (forced) migration law conveys.",

          "abstract": "The article draws on the concept of legal infrastructures and infrastructuring processes in the context \nof the ongoing discussion on the (legal) framing of environmental migration. It lays out why the \nentanglement of empirical and normative indeterminacy in environmental migration forces open the \ndoor to a transdisciplinary and multidimensional perspective. It explores how framing environmental \nmigration in terms of legal mobility infrastructures, or, rather, of the legal infrastructuring of (global) \nmobility can help transcend the legal impasse that currently still surrounds it. It draws on previous \nwork on entangled mobility regimes in Latin America, most notably in the context of the Venezuelan \nrefugee crisis as of 2015 and on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the border regime in Brazil. \nSome of the phenomena observed in these contexts provide valuable insights into the logic of the \nlegal infrastructuring of mobility and into how the environment/displacement nexus might be \ninfrastructured in a region that is one of the hotspots of the climate crisis.",

          "abstract": "Time is an essential but overlooked dimension of inequality in modern societies.\nWhile money can be earned and saved, time remains finite, shaped by labor markets,\ncaregiving duties, and institutional frameworks. Despite its importance, mainstream\nsociological research on inequality and resources have predominantly focused on\nmaterial and economic factors and overlooks temporal factors. This manuscript\ncenters on the concept of temporal inequality—the unequal distribution of and control\nover time—to demonstrate that focusing solely on material resources overlooks\ncritical constraints on daily life and offers ground work for further research. Building\non sociological theories of capital, intersectionality, and economic stratification, this\narticle argues that time poverty intersects with race, class, and gender inequalities,\ndeepening existing social divides.

          "authors": "Meredith Slopen; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Background and Objectives: As life expectancy has increased, there has been political pressure to raise the age for retirement benefit claims. Paid sick leave (PSL) may support older workers in maintaining employment intensity by offering workers the flexibility to address health and caregiving needs. However, little is known about the role of PSL access on older workers' employment and income.\n\nResearch Design and Methods: The study uses data from the 2010-2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), accessed via IPUMS. Stratified multivariate regression models controlling for demographic and employment characteristics are used to explore the association between access to PSL and employment intensity among older workers.\n\nResults: Among workers older than age 62, access to PSL is associated with a 28% higher likelihood of working full-time (p&lt;0.001) and an average of 7.3 (18.8%) more hours per week (p&lt;0.001). The strongest associations between access to paid sick leave and employment intensity are observed among female workers and those with educational attainment beyond a high school degree, and weakest among Latinx workers.\n\nDiscussion and Implications: PSL access is associated with greater employment intensity as workers age, with implications for economic security given the significant increase in hours worked per week. Public policy requiring employers to provide PSL may reduce disparities in access and support the employment of older workers.\n\n(Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "authors": "Anushé Hassan; Abigail Emma Page",
          "abstract": "A family is a network of individuals tied to each other by blood, marriage, adoption or fostering and comes in many forms and sizes. There is no singular or universal type of family. Some common family types or structures include a single parent and children, a ‘nuclear’ family comprising two parents and children, or extended families consisting of one or two parents, children and other relatives. However, a range of different family types exist within this spectrum. A household is a commonly used term or unit of analysis to describe a group of people’s living arrangements and relationships to each other. What comprises a household can vary across cultures, social contexts and even seasons. While family and households are often conflated in the literature, in reality they are different. Families refer to specific kinship structures, whereas not all members of a household are necessarily kin but instead are tied to each other through co-residence and roles and responsibilities around the production and consumption of food and labour. One key reason we see so much variation in families and households is because people usually tend to live with other people - although, of course, living alone is also a type of household. Thus, family and household size, structure and composition can vary for multiple reasons across cultures including the number of children a parent/couple have, child and adult survival rates, the types of marriage which form the family and the post-marital residence systems which influence the generational configuration of households. This chapter underlines how flexible and context-specific human family systems are, and how the vast diversity present in humans leads to endless types of families and households.",

France and Germany. While both datasets offer rich, longitudinal information on individual employment trajectories which can be augmented with firm-level infor-mation, they differ in structure, sample coverage, and variable coding. Harmonizing these datasets unlocks new potential for comparative research, particularly in examining the labor market trajectories of mothers in both countries. This paper outlines the necessary steps to harmonize these data sources and gives an overview on the set of harmonized variables. The harmonized data is of significant value for researchers, providing a foundation for comparative studies on labor market outcomes in France and Germany, especially in the context of welfare state differences and their importance within the EU and worldwide. The code for harmonization is provided for further adaptation to specific research questions.",

          "authors": "Giovana Ramalho Lacerda; Ana Claudia Ramalho Lacerda",
          "abstract": "In the novel Torto Arado, various aspects of the daily life of a family living in the poverty of the Bahia backlands are addressed. They survive through work akin to slavery, and their social roles are strongly tied to race, class, and gender. This study provides an observational literary analysis of the female figure and her constant submission and suffering, based on the relationship between Belonisia and Tobias. In the narrative, each of the sisters assumes an identity: while Bibiana represents resistance and social transformation, Belonia represents female submission in a patriarchal society, in discriminatory and unromantic gender relationships, as was the case with their ancestors. The analysis results showed that the marriage between Belonisia and Tobias does not consider the woman's wishes from the beginning, when she is arranged to marry her husband by her father. Furthermore, throughout the relationship, she suffers various mistreatments from her husband, who constantly disqualifies and beats the girl, who is unable to free herself from this relationship due to the social expectations surrounding her marriage. Thus, it was concluded that the girl is silenced in her relationship with Tobias, both by the accident she suffered in childhood, which took away her ability to speak, and by her inability to distance herself from her husband and his aggression. Due to the girl's patriarchal education and the lack of knowledge about social rights, Belonisia lives in a context where domestic violence is normalized, and the culture of being silenced by the male figure prevails. Therefore, the analysis of the female figure in the marriage between Belonisia and Tobias is of utmost importance.",

          "abstract": "In the late 2010s, countries began to strengthen policies that redirect financial flows into\ndecarbonization, such as higher carbon prices and new green industrial policies. However, investments\nremain below what is necessary to reach official climate targets. We argue that the green turn reflects\nthe success and limits of political bargains that attempt to use decarbonization as a means to fortify\ncountries’ growth models and dominant economic interests. Such bargains have proven effective in\novercoming entrenched path dependencies, unlocking policy progress. But these bargains also entail\ntrade-offs that constrain the scope and goals of decarbonization. Prioritizing incumbent economic\ninterests can slow emission cuts, limit tools to the unpopular and ineffective, and thwart visions of a\njust transition. To develop this argument empirically, we provide original quantitative estimates of\nclimate policies in the G20 and conduct case studies of the UK, the EU, and South Korea.",

          "authors": "Sharmin Jahan Juha; Arefin Mizan",
          "abstract": "Recent research in the emerging field of ‘Indigenous Entrepreneurship’ is revealing that there are various conditions and values present when it comes to Indigenous businesses and enterprises, that fundamentally challenges the common assumptions about entrepreneurship. This study aims to address the challenges that ethnic minorities in Bangladesh, otherwise known as Indigenous people (IP), face in their entrepreneurial ventures while remaining in the informal sector, and recommend policy initiatives to counteract those challenges. We hypothesize that the Indigenous economy’s entrepreneurial landscape mainly comprises informal entrepreneurship. Which inevitably creates barriers to accessing financial institutions, incentives and services provided by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and other formal institutions, necessary for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to scale up and maximize market development. For this study, we used 67 case studies of IP-led businesses and startups in Bangladesh, in conjunction with the Future of Business Survey Data from Facebook. We use Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (Fs/QCA), a novel analytical method to identify complex interacting causal factors from a large body of case studies. We hope to provide a sound basis for policy interventions based on practical and perceived needs of IPs, which are required to make entrepreneurship in Bangladesh more inclusive and ensure that IPs have a level playing field in the formal economy of Bangladesh.",

          "abstract": "International sanctions have been an increasingly common tool for enforcing\ninternational norms of behavior, among other goals. There is continuing debate\non what drives sanctioning behavior: while IR theories of sanctions have a long\nempirical history, more recent studies identify a need to extend these theories\nto better account for the endogenous nature of state sanction networks. Using a\ncombination of network and IR-based insights, we aim to build a theory-driven,\ninterpretable model of international sanctions that has high predictive utility.\nUsing a separable version of dynamic network logistic regression, we test network\ntheories of “Matthew effects,” reciprocity, and previous state-level sanctioning\nactivity alongside traditional IR theories regarding the democratic peace, cultural\nor institutional similarity, power imbalance, and trade. Though we find that\nmechanisms from established IR theories largely hold with the inclusion of network\nendogeneity, endogenous network effects are more powerful than traditional\nIR concepts for predictive accuracy of the sanctioning network. We also find considerable\ndifferences for factors driving the imposition of sanctions (tie formation)\nversus persistence of sanction regimes (persistence), pointing to the importance\nof treating such effects separately.",

          "authors": "Giacomo Lanfiuti Baldi; Andrea Nigri; Sergi Trias-Llimos; Elisabetta Barbi",
          "abstract": "The term ”Deaths of Despair” (DoD) refers to mortality due to alcohol consumption, drug use, and suicides. While the concept has predominantly been studied in the United States, where these deaths have increased significantly, this analysis examines its application to Italy, a country with comparatively lower DoD rates. This work aims to analyse the magnitude of these causes of death in Italy and examine both their joint and independent trends to determine whether they can be treated as a single group of causes. We employ the Potential Gain in Life Expectancy to assess the impact of these causes on overall mortality in Italy, then investigate the identified time series leveraging Cointegration Analysis. Utilizing ISTAT data from 1983 to 2018, aggregated by gender and age groups at the NUTS1 level, the study reveals a decline in DoD mortality in Italy, driven mainly by a reduction in alcohol-related deaths. The magnitude and trajectory of the analysed causes offer valuable insights into the unique dynamics of DoD in Italy and its regional variations. Cointegration Analysis indicates that there is no significant dependency structure between these causes or across regions, with only a few exceptions. These findings suggest that in Italy, DoD should not be treated as a homogeneous group, but rather as distinct outcomes of despair that require separate consideration in public health interventions.",

In this study, we identified 180 keystone corporations from highly concentrated sectors with significant environmental impacts and assessed their biodiversity commitments. Our findings reveal that while 79% of firms have made some form of biodiversity pledge, only 13% have reported sufficiently detailed, transparent and specific commitments (“robust commitments”) to allow others to assess if the targets have been met – a key prerequisite of accountability. We discuss future directions and underscore the urgent need for companies, governments, and civil society – including the research community – to work collaboratively to develop, implement, and monitor credible corporate strategies that drive meaningful action for nature.",

          "abstract": "This study examines biologists leaving science in 38 OECD countries in the past two decades. We use publication metadata from a global bibliometric database (raw Scopus data at the micro-level of individual scientists). In a cohort-based and longitudinal fashion, we follow individual men and women scientists over time, from their first to their last publication (N=86,178). We examine four academic disciplines: AGRI (agricultural and biological sciences), BIO (biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology), IMMU (immunology and microbiology), and NEURO (neuroscience). We apply survival analysis, conceptualizing scientific life as a sequence of scholarly publishing events. Our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows how women disappear from science: in BIO, about 60% are still in science after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and only 20% by the end of the period examined (i.e., after 19 years). The percentages are substantially higher for men: approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier estimations indicate that women in the largest discipline (BIO) are 23.26% more likely to leave science after 10 years and 39.74% more likely to leave science at the end of the study period. Gender difference in attrition, slightly visible after 5 years, increase consistently in later career stages. The probability of surviving for women after 15 years varies considerably, from 47.8% in AGRI to 27.6% in IMMU; for men, the probability is about a fifth higher. Our data show that with the passage of time, women disappear from science in ever-larger proportions compared to men. Gender differences in attrition in the four disciplines have been and continue to be high, but comparing the 2000 and 2010 cohorts, have slightly decreased over time.",

The workshop was held in Trondheim on November 4-5, 2023 and involved 17 citizens from mid Norway. The good life was the broad theme, and we invited the participants to consider the themes of sustainable health and society within this frame. \nThe participants developed 4 different visions for a sustainable healthy future for Norway. We gave them a mid-term horizon (2070) to leave room for needs- and aspirations-based social imagination, not overly conditioned by the current institutional framework, and to challenge the short-termism of the dominant policy cycles and thinking.\nThe visions developed by the citizens are remarkably consistent in emphasizing the importance of good social integration and community life, interpersonal relations, individual development and an individual’s sense of meaning, contribution, and agency. Noteworthy is also their emphasis on the need to regulate new technologies, and to reduce information overload and unsustainable choices through trusted and transparent governance.\nThe report provides a discussion of the visions, the full text of the 4 visions and a concise background about the method and the project of which the workshop was part. The Sustainable Healthy Futures pilot was a collaboration between the Norwegian centre for responsible research and Innovation (AFINO) and NTNU Health. The main aim of the project was to rethink health in society in the attempt to imagine innovative and sustainable approaches to health in the future.",
