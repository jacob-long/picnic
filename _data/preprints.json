          "authors": "Mare Knibbe; Sarah de Rijcke; Bart Penders",
          "abstract": "In order to build legitimacy, we argue that reform movements need to make their moral programmes visible and account for their value-prioritisation . To support such reflection on moral programmes, we compare moral programs of the protestant Reformation and the reform movement in science. We argue that moral programs play a crucial role in shaping science, and different moral programs offer different promises for sustained support of credible, reliable, fair, and equitable science. We primarily discuss the virtue and equity programmes and through interrogating both reform programmes in relation to the Reformation, we seek to display the relevance of sociopolitical contexts for how key values operate in science and how they generate orders of worth. These conversations will allow us to determine when and where which moral programme would serve us and others best.",

          "abstract": "This protocol aims to address two metaresearch questions: what do we know about the science underlying impactful legal decisions and how can we assess this evidence efficiently and accurately, such that it is usable for courts? To do so, this protocol describes our plan for a systematic review of the literature underlying whether there are reliable indicators of the manner of death in stab wound cases. Evidence of nature was recently found admissible at the High Court of Australia in Lang v The Queen. However, despite the High Court uncritically accepting this evidence, there has never been a systematic review that critically appraises the relevant literature. Beyond the review itself, we will fully document our process and all of the time-saving tools we rely on to provide knowledge about whether systematic reviews of this nature can be efficiently deployed in legal proceedings.",

Two studies situated excellencism and perfectionism within the nomological network of the Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model (PSDM). Study 1 (n=284) showed that excellencism and perfectionism were distinctively associated with loneliness, social goals, self-presentation strategies, and sacrificing social and community goals. Study 2 (n=396) replicated the associations with loneliness and showed higher frustration of the need for relatedness in perfection strivers than in excellence strivers. The results emphasized the importance of distinguishing between perfectionism and excellencism to understand their unique roles in psychological and social adjustment, with perfectionism leading to social disconnection and excellencism promoting healthier relationships.",

          "authors": "Andrew Dawson; Ashutosh Bista; Anne E Wilson",
          "abstract": "Trust in mainstream institutions is declining while people are increasingly turning to alternative media and conspiracy theories. Previous research has suggested that these trends may be linked, but the dynamics of trust across multiple sources has received little investigation. Is trust a neutral process, where each source is judged independently, is it a zero-sum competition, where a loss for one side is a gain for the other, or does losing trust in one source in foster a more generalized sense of distrust? Across three experimental studies (N = 2,951) we examined how people react when a source makes a serious error, testing several potential models of trust dynamics. We found that regardless of whether the outlet is mainstream, counter-mainstream, or neutral, trust drops for the erring source but does not rise for its competitors. This was the case in the context of both food regulations and COVID-19 precautions. Such a pattern suggest that each source may be judged independently of others. However, in several cases, an error made by one source led to a loss of trust in all sources, suggesting that rather than choosing sides between competing sources, people are also judging the media landscape as a whole to discern if it is feasible to find trustworthy information. However, correlational data did also find that the more people saw a source as politicized, the less they trusted that source and the more they trusted its competitors.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Many cancer treatments can lead to a disrupted body image and identity. One intervention to address these outcomes is therapeutic tattooing. However, despite the wide dissemination of this practice for cancer survivors (CSs), current research on it is lacking. This study aimed to identify tattoo artists’ (TAs’) perspectives on the types, impacts, barriers, and facilitators of therapeutic tattooing for CSs and the impact of doing this work on themselves.\n\nMethods: Twenty-two international TAs who tattoo CSs were interviewed and resultant transcripts were analysed thematically. \nResults: The following themes emerged: Emotional Management of Artists, Emotional Transformation of CSs, Stigma and its effects on CSs, Artist Barriers, CS Barriers, Artist Facilitators, and CS Facilitators. The findings also identify a typology of cancer survivorship therapeutic tattoos.\n\nConclusion: This is the first study to identify barriers/facilitators of therapeutic tattooing, a typology of cancer survivorship therapeutic tattoos, TAs’ perspectives on therapeutic tattooing, and potential negative outcomes from this practice. The findings indicate that therapeutic tattooing can be both beneficial and harmful for CSs and TAs, that there is a need for better therapeutic tattooing training for TAs and healthcare providers (HPs), increased awareness of therapeutic tattoos, a reduction in barriers to the practice and greater collaboration between HPs and TAs. \n\nImplications for Cancer Survivors: Findings from this study have major policy implications for healthcare systems, non-profit organizations, and regulatory bodies, which could serve to empower cancer survivors to make more informed decisions about their bodies and support enhanced training and accreditation of this practice.",

          "abstract": "Street harassment of women is a prevalent global problem with significant effects on the\nfreedom and well-being of its victims. Although research has investigated the consequences of this phenomenon, little is known about individual factors that predict street harassment tolerance in men. The current study investigates the role of cognitive empathy toward victims and social dominance orientation (SDO) on tolerance of street harassment in two European cultures. After being assessed for SDO and street harassment tolerance, 136 Italian and 113 British heterosexual men viewed a video of a woman repeatedly subjected to street harassment. Participants reported beliefs about the emotions experienced by the victim and were again assessed for street harassment. Results revealed that street harassment tolerance both before and after the video was independently associated with lower cognitive empathy and higher SDO. These effects replicated across the two cultures. These findings suggest two possible attitudinal and cognitive targets for reducing street harassment tolerance across societies.",

In this article, we track changes in participant diversity in developmental science over the past decade. These analyses reveal surprisingly modest shifts in global diversity of research participants over time, calling into question the generalizability of our empirical foundation. We provide examples from the study of early child development of the significant epistemic and ethical costs of a lack of geographical and cultural diversity to demonstrate why greater diversification is essential to a generalizable science of human development. We also discuss strategies for diversification that could be implemented throughout the research ecosystem in the service of a culturally anchored, generalizable, and replicable science.",

However, less is known about whether the same or different factors contribute to this phenomenon among liberals and conservatives. We test three different relationships that could emerge between cognitive ability and cognitive reflection, and political group-based attitudes. Analyzing two nationally representative surveys of US Americans (N= 9,035) containing a measure of cognitive ability, we find evidence that compared to people lower in cognitive ability, people higher in cognitive ability express more animosity towards ideologically discordant groups, and more favouritism towards ideologically concordant groups. This pattern was particularly pronounced among liberals. In a registered report study, we then test whether the same is true of cognitive reflection in another large dataset (N = 3,498). In contrast to cognitive ability, we find no relationship between cognitive reflection and political animosity and favouritism. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive test of how cognitive ability and cognitive reflection are related to political animosity and favouritism for liberals and conservatives in the United States.",

          "authors": "Michaela Bocheva",
          "abstract": "It is well known that perception and cognition are systematically biased towards the recent past. That is, a decision about the current state of a perceptual feature (e.g., orientation) can be predicted based on a recent state of the same feature. Such serial dependencies have been demonstrated across perception, memory, and cognition, and have been jointly attributed to an adaptive mechanism meant to promote stability in a constantly changing environment. Here, we argue that this adaptive mechanism prioritizes past information on the most basic structural level, such that the strength of the attractive bias is modulated by the amount of structural coherence in stimuli. We presented visual patterns of varied structural disorder (randomness) prior to a recognition memory decision that required discriminating between trained and novel visual patterns. Both highly generic geometrical shapes and completely random patterns failed to elicit an effect on decisional response times. By contrast, we found recognition memory decisions to be significantly faster in trials where the irrelevant probe pattern was “optimally” random. This result suggests that decision-making is influenced by the past’s informational worth. More importantly, it suggests an optimal amount of uncertainty to facilitate future decisions.",

          "abstract": "Sexual misperceptions refer to instances in which individuals wrongly infer sexual interest from other people. Traditionally, such sexual misperceptions have been studied within the dating context among student samples primarily. Our research extends this line of research and examines sexual misperceptions in the workplace. In a two-wave survey (N = 212), we show that employees with a higher dominance motivation are more likely to perceive sexual interest in the behavior of a co-worker with a different gender, regardless of one’s own gender or formal power position. In a preregistered three-wave survey (N = 349) we further show that perceptions of sexual interest are positively associated with the likelihood to sexually harass co-workers, and that perceptions of sexual interest mediate the positive relationship between dominance motivation and sexual workplace harassment. We discuss theoretical and practical contributions of our findings as well as suggestions for future research.",

          "authors": "Zachary J Williams; D. Jonah Barrett; Carissa J. Cascio; Tiffany G. Woynaroski",
          "abstract": "Background: Between 50–70% of autistic individuals report clinically significant decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sound in one’s environment) at some point in their lives. DST in autism comprises multiple distinct disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust), although few studies to date have distinguished these conditions from one another or studied their correlates independently. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Univariate and multivariate Bayesian models were then used to examine the demographic and clinical correlates of each DST diagnosis (both alone and independently of the other condition) in the autistic adult population. \n\nResults: Hyperacusis and misophonia were strongly correlated. Accordingly, all significant correlates in univariate analyses were found to associate with both conditions. In multivariate analyses (including control for depression and generalized anxiety, which strongly related to DST symptoms), both disorders were independently associated with female sex; increased autistic traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and phonophobia symptoms; and increased likelihood of seeking medical care for DST. Most other significant correlates (primarily hearing-related or neurological symptoms/disorders) were found to be associated only with hyperacusis rather than misophonia, although misophonia was uniquely associated with anger symptoms and identification as a gender minority. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia explain substantial variance in clinical outcomes of interest in the autistic population and demonstrate utility as additional diagnoses for autistic adults who experience debilitating DST symptoms within clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether perceived racial and ethnic discrimination mediates the relationship between race and impulsivity, as measured by delay discounting, among adolescents aged 10–11 years.\nMethods: Utilizing data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study release 5.1, we analyzed a sample of 3,857 participants who completed the delay discounting task and perceived discrimination measures at the year-one follow-up. Delay discounting was assessed through a hypothetical monetary choice task, with the area under the curve (AUC) serving as the primary measure of impulsivity—lower AUC scores indicate higher impulsivity. Perceived discrimination was measured using an adapted Perceived Discrimination Scale. Linear mixed-effects regression models examined the direct effects of race, socioeconomic factors, age, and gender on impulsivity, as well as the mediating effect of perceived discrimination.\nResults: Black adolescents exhibited significantly lower AUC scores compared to White adolescents (p &lt; 0.05), indicating higher impulsivity. When perceived discrimination was included in the model, the effect of being Black on impulsivity was no longer significant, suggesting mediation. Perceived discrimination was associated with lower AUC scores (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting greater impulsivity. Males demonstrated higher impulsivity than females (p &lt; 0.001), consistent across models.\nConclusion: Perceived racial and ethnic discrimination significantly mediates the relationship between being Black and higher impulsivity in early adolescence. These findings underscore the importance of addressing discrimination to reduce racial disparities in impulsivity and associated risk behaviors. Interventions focusing on both systemic factors contributing to discrimination and enhancing individual coping strategies are crucial for promoting equitable developmental outcomes among minority adolescents.",

          "authors": "Zachary J Williams; D. Jonah Barrett; Carissa J. Cascio; Tiffany G. Woynaroski",
          "abstract": "Background: Decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sounds in one’s environment) is one of the most common sensory features of autism, with a lifetime prevalence between 50–70%. Multiple disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust) likely contribute to the burden of DST in the autistic population, but there has been little exploration of this symptom cluster in autism in a way that distinguishes these conditions from each other or that examines how these disorders potentially differ in autistic and non-autistic individuals. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Descriptive statistics were derived to report on the prevalence of each DST category, as well as clinical features of individuals in both categories.  \n\nResults: Across the sample, 40.2% met case criteria for hyperacusis (sex-weighted prevalence: 33.5%), whereas 35.5% met case criteria for misophonia (sex-weighted prevalence: 29.1%), and comorbid hyperacusis and misophonia was found in 27.0% (sex-weighted prevalence: 21.9%). Both hyperacusis and misophonia were associated with tinnitus and tinnitus disorder, although neither condition was associated with (diagnosed) hearing loss. Sound-evoked pain was a commonly reported symptom of hyperacusis, with 64.7% of autistic adults experiencing pain at least once per month and 24.7% of autistic individuals with hyperacusis meeting criteria for “pain hyperacusis.” Onset of hyperacusis was much earlier than previously reported in non-autistic samples, although most other features of both hyperacusis and misophonia did not differ from what is known from general population studies. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia (and their comorbidity) are highly prevalent in the autistic population and should be studied in tandem (rather than as a unified construct) in future investigations of autism-associated DST.",

They were instructed to report\nthought transitions with a key press (online segmentation). First, we validate the use of this online\nsegmentation as a report of thought transitions, enabling us to measure the duration of coherent\nthought episodes. Then, we show that among a reasonable set of candidate mechanisms, the\ntiming of thought transitions is best explained by an accumulation-to-threshold model. We further\nfind that the threshold of this accumulation – but not the drift rate – negatively correlates with\nparticipants’ trait tendency for mind-wandering.

Video data from 53 toddlers (410-1080days, 27boys) were collected during free play time in 3 Portuguese nursery schools. Toddlers adjusted their vocabulary complexity and the temporal patterns of their gestures to the recipient’s age, but did not change their prominence. Toddlers communicated with younger peers at a slower pace and using a simpler vocabulary, following child-directed communication patterns. However, when comparing adult-directed with peer-directed communication, toddlers used a more diverse set of gestures and shorter gestures. This study suggests that our ability to accommodate our communication emerges before language is fully developed, and that accommodation is flexibly expressed as a result of intersecting features of social partners.",

          "authors": "Matthias Guggenmos; Philipp Sterzer; Isa Steinecker",
          "abstract": "An intriguing finding in human decision making is that the act of choice itself affects preferences − chosen options often increase and unchosen options decrease in subjective value. The observation of such choice-induced revaluation inspired the theory of cognitive dissonance, which posits that human behavior generally strives for internal consistency. Yet, which aspects of choices are responsible for choice-induced revaluation has remained unclear. Here we argue that previous research has overlooked an important explanatory variable: choice confidence. While the original cognitive dissonance theory posits stronger revaluation for low-confidence decisions, a recently proposed theory that parallels confidence and reward predicts stronger revaluation for high-confidence decisions. To arbitrate between these hypotheses, and a confidence-independent mere-choice hypothesis, we employ an instrumental conditioning paradigm and quantitatively compare computational models of choice revaluation that operationalize the hypothesized confidence effects. Our results will clarify the mechanism of how choices and preferences interact in human decision making.",

          "authors": "Michaela Bocheva; Dobromir Rahnev",
          "abstract": "Confidence leak (i.e., confidence serial dependence) is a phenomenon where confidence from a previous trial predicts confidence in a current trial independent of current choice or accuracy. Confidence leak has been shown to robustly occur across various cognitive domains and tasks. However, it remains unclear what factors, if any, modulate the strength of the confidence serial dependence. Here we investigate whether switching the motor response in a perceptual decision-making task influences the strength of the confidence leak effect. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch using their left or right hand, with the response hand being randomly cued on each trial. We found that switching the response substantially weakened the confidence leak effect. We further replicated this finding in a second experiment in which left-hand responses were given using a keyboard and right-hand responses were given with a mouse. In both experiments, we also found that confidence leak was weaker whenever the left hand was used in the previous trial, suggesting that lack of motor fluency reduces the strength of confidence serial dependence. These results demonstrate that switching the motor response weakens serial dependencies and imply that the action required to make a choice can impact one’s metacognitive evaluations.",

          "authors": "Cesar Lima",
          "abstract": "Despite widespread claims that music training enhances nonmusical abilities, causal evidence remains inconclusive. Moreover, much research has focused on potential benefits for perception and cognition, but socioemotional skills are often overlooked. Here, we used longitudinal and correlational approaches to ask whether music training improves emotion recognition in voices and faces among school-aged children. We also assessed musical abilities, fine- and gross-motor skills, broader socioemotional functioning, and cognitive abilities including nonverbal reasoning, executive functions, and auditory short-term and working memory. Study 1 (N = 110) was a two-year longitudinal intervention conducted in a naturalistic school environment with three groups: music training, basketball training (active control), and no training (passive control). Compared to both control groups, music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory short-term and working memory, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Study 2 (N = 192) compared musically untrained children with those attending a music school. Music training correlated with improved emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), but this association disappeared after accounting for musical abilities, short-term memory, or socioeconomic status. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with improved emotion recognition in prosody and faces independently of music training and other confounding variables. These findings suggest that while music training may enhance fine-motor skills and auditory memory, observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Addressing mental health, a dynamic and culturally variable concept, requires comprehensive analysis in the medical field. This study highlights the importance of researching positive mental health and resilience in doctors starting their careers, going beyond the mere absence of mental disorders. It emphasizes the need to understand resilience as an essential component in this context, especially in the face of challenges such as \"Burnout\" syndrome.\n Methodology: The \"Positive Mental Health (PMH) Scale\" and the \"Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale\" were administered to doctors beginning their career paths. A descriptive and correlational analysis was conducted between the results of both scales. Results: A total of 93 young medical professionals participated, with most women. The results reveal a positive correlation between positive mental health and resilience. Although, in general, an increase in positive mental health was associated with greater resilience, atypical cases showed inverse correlations, thus underscoring the complexity of this relationship.\n Discussion: The evident correlation between positive mental health and resilience highlights the importance of adaptability in challenging work environments. The low scores in criteria assessing physical and emotional aspects suggest potential deficiencies in the comprehensive understanding of what positive mental health entails in the studied population. There is a highlighted need to strengthen strategies to manage work-related stress, especially in improving equanimity. \nConclusions: There is a correlation between positive mental health and resilience in this group of professionals. Understanding this relationship enriches knowledge and suggests practical strategies to improve the quality of life of healthcare professionals, specifically doctors, prioritizing a balance between work and personal life.",

          "authors": "Johannes Thrul; Janardan Devkota; Dahlia Aljuboori; Timothy Regan; Saud Alomairah; Carol Vidal",
          "abstract": "A recent meta-analysis published in this journal included 27 studies that experimentally manipulated social media use and investigated their impact on mental health outcomes (Ferguson, 2024). The author concluded that social media effects were statistically no different from zero. However, this meta-analysis did not investigate potential moderating effects of length of social media reduction or abstinence interventions. We conducted a re-analysis to investigate the impact of social media reduction / abstinence intervention length on mental health outcomes. We used the information available on the OSF platform related to the original meta-analysis and excluded 7 studies because they were not reduction / abstinence interventions. We categorized studies into those with intervention lengths of less than 1 week vs. 1 week or longer, and tested for curvilinear relationships between intervention length (weeks and days as continuous variables) and outcomes by including quadratic terms. Stratified analyses indicated that interventions of less than 1 week resulted in significantly worse mental health outcomes (d=-0.168, SE=0.058, p=.004), while interventions of 1 week or longer resulted in significant improvements (d=0.169, SE=0.065, p=.01). Analyses of intervention length as continuous moderator included k=19 studies and showed significant quadratic effects for number of weeks (b=-0.022; SE=0.008; z=-2.6; p&lt;.01), as well as number of days (b=-0.001; SE=0.000; z=-2.5; p&lt;.05). These findings suggest that social media use reduction / abstinence interventions should have a minimum length of 1 week or longer to confer mental health benefits. An ideal intervention length may be around 3 weeks, but future research is needed to confirm this.",

          "abstract": "Sequence learning in the serial response time task (SRTT) is one of the few learning phenomena that are widely agreed to be implicit in nature (i.e., that learning may proceed in the absence of awareness). Evidently, it is also possible to explicitly learn a sequence of events. In the past few decades, research into sequence learning largely focused on the type of representation that may underlie implicit sequence learning, and whether or not two independent learning systems are necessary to explain qualitative differences between implicit and explicit learning. Using the drift-diffusion model, here we take a cognitive-processes perspective on sequence learning and investigate the cognitive operations that benefit from implicit and explicit sequence learning (e.g., stimulus detection or encoding, response selection, or response facilitation). To separate the processes involved in expressing implicit versus explicit knowledge, we manipulated explicit sequence knowledge independently of the opportunity to express such knowledge. Performance data from this experiment was fed into a dynamic drift-diffusion model that allowed us to disentangle the contributions of the above-mentioned processes to sequence-learning effects. Results revealed three findings that are relevant for sequence learning theories. We discuss how the diffusion model may be helpful in future research addressing these theories.",

          "authors": "Marius Barth; Christoph Stahl",
          "abstract": "The distinction between implicit and explicit learning is fundamental to theories of human learning. However, it remains an open question whether implicit and explicit learning are based on a single, unitary learning meachnism, or multiple learning mechanisms or systems. The dual-systems model (Keele, Ivry, Mayr, Hazeltine, &amp; Heuer, 2003) posits that, in addition to a multidimensional learning system that is accessible to consciousness, implicit learning may also proceed in a unidimensional learning. Learning in this system is considered to proceed within a set of dimension-specific, encapsulated processing modules, where strong separation between different kinds of information protects against interference. Parallel acquisition of multiple uncorrelated sequences has been considered crucial evidence in favor of encapsulated processing. However, recent work has demonstrated that parallel learning is also well accounted for by a single learning mechanism, and can therefore not provide convincing evidence for encapsulated processing. In a series of three experiments, we therefore aimed at testing the assumption of encapsulated processing more stringently. To this aim, we orthogonally manipulated sequences of stimulus and response features, and tested for selective influence of these sequences on the cognitive processes that are involved in SRTT performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, stimulus colors and response locations followed independent six-item probabilistic sequences. In Experiment 3, stimulus colors and stimulus locations followed such independent sequences. Replicating previous findings, we found learning of sequences of response locations. By contrast, we consistently found evidence against learning of sequences of stimulus colors or stimulus locations. First implications for the debate on encapsulated processing, and the organization of sequence learning systems, are discussed.",

          "authors": "Hayden Peel; Philippe A. Chouinard",
          "abstract": "We used the Garner paradigm to examine the relationship between the perceptual and conceptual aspects of an image for identification. Participants completed tasks that required them to selectively attend to semantic identity (e.g., manmade vs. natural) while ignoring image format, and vice versa, with the irrelevant dimension either held constant (baseline block) or varying simultaneously (filtering block). Experiment 1 compared black-and-white and greyscale drawings (BWvGS) and Experiment 2 compared coloured and greyscale drawings (CvGS). The former assessed the contribution of structural form cues to perception, while the latter assessed the importance of colour. Garner interference was found with accuracy (with more errors in filtering than baseline) in both the BWvGS and CvGS experiments, but this was asymmetric and limited to the semantic classification task. Participants’ selective attention to semantic identity failed when the image format varied simultaneously, indicating that conceptual processing is not independent of perceptual processing. However, in the image format task, selective attention to image format was successful despite variation in semantic identity, demonstrating that perceptual processing can occur independently of conceptual analysis. Together, these results demonstrate that the semantic classification of images is influenced by the format of the stimulus.",

To this end, many new initiatives have been developed that represent procedural (i.e., behaviours and sets of commonly used practices in the research process), structural (new norms, rules, infrastructure, and incentives), and community-based change (working groups, networks). Objectives: To outline international initiatives that enhance awareness and uptake of open research practices in the discipline of psychology. Methods: A systematic, narrative review was conducted in three stages: (1) a web search to identify open research initiatives in psychology; (2) a literature search to identify supporting publications; and (3) a hand search of grey literature. Eligible initiatives were coded into a narrative theme of procedural, structural, or community-based change. Results: A total of 187 initiatives were identified; 30 were procedural (e.g., toolkits, resources, software), 70 structural (e.g., policies, strategies, frameworks), and 87 community-based (e.g., working groups, networks). Discussion: Open research is progressing at pace through various initiatives that share a common goal to reform research culture.

However, no existing models for assessing posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) have successfully demonstrated out-of-sample replicability. We develop\na language-based AI model for PTSD and rigorously evaluate replicability in a prospective\nsample.\nMETHODS: Participants from the Stony Brook World Trade Center (WTC) Health and\nWellness Program described their lives in an automated interview during a clinical monitoring\nvisit. The language was analysed using AI to assess PTSD CheckList (PCL) for total symptom\nseverity score and four symptom subscales and validated against medical record PTSD\ndiagnosis.\nTo yield realistic accuracy estimates in this cross-sectional study, we propose the Sequential\nEvaluation with Model Pre-registration design, consisting of an iterative, two-phase pre-\nregistration paradigm. The first pre-registration specifies the data split, the model development,\nand the initial hypotheses. The second pre-registration specifies the exact pre-trained models,\ndata cleaning procedures, and the refined hypotheses.\nRESULTS: The data split included a development (N=1437) and a prospective (N=346) dataset.\nWithin the prospective sample, the pre-registered models produced scores that significantly\ncorrelated with their targets: PCL total (r=.38, p-value&lt;.001) and the four subscales (r=.28–.37,\np-value&lt;.001).

          "abstract": "Psychological measurement plays a vital role in many areas of science. Traditional methods for developing and scoring measurement instruments require large sets of human responses, making them time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new ways to tackle these challenges. In this brief note, we explore the use of convex hulls—a concept from computational geometry—in combination with AI-driven large language models to enhance psychometric practice. A convex hull is the smallest convex “boundary” around a set of points. By treating language embeddings as high-dimensional coordinates and forming convex hulls, we can interpret the structure of items and free text responses in new ways. We propose two novel applications of convex hulls: (1) item analysis without data: We use convex hulls to check if a test item “belongs” to a scale, providing a new indicator of item quality; and (2) scoring free text: By interpreting candidate responses in relation to the convex hull of other responses, we propose an objective way to score psychological constructs from natural language. Each method is possible in supervised and unsupervised modes. These methods are experimental and yet to be validated. We outline, but do not implement, brief methods for testing their efficacy. We discuss open questions that we expect will impact the utility of these methods, such as, a) why we don’t just ask the LLM to score the items and responses, b) why convex hull centroids might be preferred over clustering and scale embedding means c) what to do if the construct hull does not match the intended target, and d) whether the centroids of psychometric convex hulls represent the intensity or the essence of item discrimination and the constructs being assessed.",

          "abstract": "The sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of controlling one’s own actions and, through them, external events. It is a crucial aspect of consciousness, indicating that an agent can understand the causal relationship between their actions and environmental changes and, more importantly, voluntarily influence the environment through their actions. There has been extensive debate about when children and which animals possess the sense of agency, primarily because they cannot easily report it. Observing actions might be a promising way to estimate the sense of agency without relying on introspection. However, despite actions containing rich information about human subjective feelings, there are very few ways to abstract such information. In the present study, we aim to clarify the relationship between actions and the sense of agency during control exploration using a dataset of 167 children (6-16 years old) acquired by Nobusako et al. (2022). We employ action plan analysis developed by Chang et al. (2024) to analyze motion sequences data which was self-generated by participants during a control detection task. The action plan analysis uses transformer-LSTM-based autoencoders to capture high-level, abstract representations of sequences of motor commands (referred to as action plans). This approach allows us to quantify action plan diversity that reflects control exploration behaviors. The results showed that action plan diversity can be a promising way to measure the sense of agency both within individuals and among them. This suggests that simply observing how actions change under different control conditions can quantitatively reflect the emergence of the sense of agency in children. The findings and methodology provide a highly novel and useful tool for studying the sense of agency in broader populations and species in future studies.",

Less is known about how expert athletes use cognitive inhibition to ‘forget’ previous errors (termed expertise-induced-amnesia). Moreover, whether the relevance of sporting expertise is greater at high-pressure, compared to low-pressure is also unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine if sporting expertise predicted response inhibition (effectiveness and efficiency) and cognitive inhibition (error awareness) and the impact of pressure levels on these relationships. Forty-five participants completed a measure of sporting expertise and a modified Stop Signal Task under two pressure conditions (i.e., high- and low-pressure). Regression results suggested that expertise only significantly predicted response inhibition effectiveness and efficiency at high-pressure. Interestingly, error awareness at high- and low-pressure were independent of sporting expertise. Finally, change scores across pressure conditions were small and near zero for all participants, not just experts, suggesting that all individuals performed similarly across low- and high-pressure conditions. Sporting expertise appears to facilitate response inhibition at high-pressure but the exact methods in which experts ‘forget’ errors and maintain performance remains unknown (i.e., might not be cognitive inhibition).",

          "abstract": "Sensory feedback is crucial for maintaining accurate motor control. One process of movement correction is sensorimotor adaptation, or motor learning in response to perceived sensory errors. Recent studies have demonstrated that people can simultaneously adapt to opposing errors on a single movement (e.g., leftward and rightward errors on a reach) given some context that differentiates when each error occurs. In speech production, linguistic structure (e.g., the same vowel in different words) has been shown to provide sufficient context for adapting to opposing errors, but it is not clear whether this is restricted to the same effectors (i.e. lips, tongue, jaw in the oral cavity) or also includes movements of other effectors used in speech (i.e., the vocal folds in the larynx). While manual reaching studies have shown that contextual movements need not be produced with the same effector as the learning target, they have thus far only tested left-right effector pairs. We present the results of three simultaneous adaptation experiments in speech that examine whether laryngeal movements for pitch control can provide context for oral articulatory movements for vowels. In each experiment, the resonances that correlate with articulator position during vowels were perturbed in three different directions that were predictable given a pitch context. First, Mandarin speakers differentially adapted given pitch contexts that signaled differences in word meaning, suggesting that lexical uses of pitch provide context for vowels. Second, English speakers differentially adapted given different arbitrary pitch matching contexts on the word “head”, suggesting that even non-meaningful pitch movements provide context for vowels. Third, English speakers were unable to differentially adapt when simply listening to a contextual pitch, indicating that mere auditory input of pitch is insufficient. Together, these results indicate that sensorimotor context for learning can be provided by different effectors than the learning target.",

          "abstract": "Pain negatively affects several cognitive abilities, but knowledge about its effect on reinforcement learning (RL) is limited. During RL, instrumental choices can be influenced by heuristic tendencies to approach rewards or inhibit actions when facing potentially aversive events, introducing “Pavlovian bias” in behavior. Recent studies suggest that compromised outcome controllability enhances Pavlovian bias, a phenomenon that may be linked to suboptimal decision-making in learned helplessness (LH). Since LH is common in chronic pain syndromes, this study sought to establish a link between experimental heat pain (EHP), uncontrollable reward/loss and RL performance in healthy adults. In addition, we investigated if intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the medial prefrontal/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/dACC) alleviates the deleterious effects of EHP on choice behavior. In a pre-registered, 2x2 between-group, double-blind study (N = 100), healthy adult participants underwent 3 blocks of an orthogonalized Go/NoGo task with two interleaved bouts of active or sham iTBS, and either EHP or warm skin stimulation combined with compromised outcome controllability during the task. Although EHP did not impact overall performance, it invigorated actions for rewards, reflecting enhanced Pavlovian bias. While two bouts of iTBS attenuated Pavlovian tendencies, this effect was counteracted by EHP, indicating antagonistic effects of pain and iTBS-modulated mPFC activity on Pavlovian-instrumental interactions. Surprisingly, EHP and iTBS exerted largely similar effects on other latent parameters of RL (go-bias, learning rate, exploration) in a manner that resembled LH. These findings shed light on the role of experimental pain and mPFC/dACC activity in LH-like choice behavior.",

This qualitative study explored how unionized public mental health therapists in New York City and Chicago experience and seek to address their workplace challenges.

First, public mental health therapists described that their under-resourced and diverse patients have complex social service and clinical needs —needs therapists are highly motivated to address. Second, therapists described significant workplace challenges (e.g., staffing shortages, demanding workloads, low pay, insufficient clinical support). Third, therapists described that these workplace challenges negatively impact them emotionally and negatively impact the care their under-resourced patients receive. Fourth, therapists described reasons for and benefits to labor organizing including improving their work conditions and the quality of services. Findings revealed that public mental health therapists are intrinsically motivated to support their under-resourced patients, but that their labor conditions often hinder them from offering the high-quality care they feel their patients deserve. Public mental health therapists across both cities view labor unions as a vehicle through which they can improve their working conditions and the treatment conditions of their patients.",

          "abstract": "Across two studies, we examined the Imagined Cognitive Dissonance in a French context (ICD, Cooper et al., 2018). Specifically, Study 1 investigates the effect of vicarious ICD, the dissonance felt when the participant imagines an ingroup member acting counterattitudinally (Cooper et al., 2018). We failed to replicate the effect of vicarious ICD (N = 236) on behavioral intentions. In Study 2, we examined the personal ICD effect: can the mere act of imagining oneself acting counterattitudinally induce cognitive dissonance in subjects? The results are partially in line with the hypotheses of an effect of personal ICD on the subject’s pro-environmental behavioral intention (N = 252). We discuss these results, their implications, limits, and propose directions for future research on dissonance.",

          "abstract": "Historically, memory and language have been seen as separate cognitive functions and studied in isolation. To date, it remains an open question to what extent these cognitive domains are related. The central question in this paper is how we should see the relationship between the domains of language and memory. We discuss relevant empirical evidence from the fields of cognitive psychology, cognitive neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience and take a philosophical perspective on this central question, considering issues such as how to weigh different types of evidence and how to conceptualize the relationship between language and memory. We conclude that elucidating questions about the nature of the relationship between language and memory requires not only more empirical data, but also parallel conceptual development.",

          "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA) refers to the perception that one's actions are influential and that one assumes responsibility for their consequences. In coordinated joint actions, a sense of joint agency emerges, with interaction and cooperation being crucial for enhancing SoA. Prior research indicates that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is integral to monitoring social contexts of SoA, while the left angular gyrus (lAG) focuses on individual aspects of agency. This study examined the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on SoA and judgment of performance (JoP) in eighteen healthy young participants using a three-way crossover design that included inhibitory neurostimulation of the rTPJ, excitatory stimulation of the lAG, and a sham intervention on the Vertex. Participants completed musical tasks involving rhythmic coordination before and after neurostimulation, with self-reported scores for SoA and JoP collected via Likert scales, alongside performance metrics (action time error and number of errors) evaluated through software. While rTMS did not yield significant effects on SoA, JoP, or performance overall, notable correlations between these variables suggest that neurostimulation may influence the interrelations among them. These findings highlight the complexities of how neurostimulation impacts perceived agency and performance, warranting further exploration into their interconnected dynamics.\nKeywords: transcranial magnetic stimulation, right temporoparietal junction, left angular gyrus, sense of joint agency, musical rhythmic coordination, joint action",

In the literature, various factors are discussed as potential inclusion, exclusion, or limiting criteria in BC.\nMethod: Our aim for this interview study was to gain a deeper understanding of the factors psychotherapists consider when inviting patients to participate in BC. For this purpose, we interviewed seven psychotherapists with a psychodynamic and seven psychotherapists with a cognitive behavioral background who participate in a naturalistic trial on BC in routine outpatient psychotherapy. \nResults: Psychotherapists considered few fixed inclusion or exclusion criteria when considering which patients to introduce BC to. The basic technical requirements had to be met and the patients had to be fit for outpatient therapy. Psychotherapists found patients’ response to BC, like their motivation, to be a decisive factor when considering BC. \nDiscussion: Patient motivation for BC emerged as another potential bottleneck in its implementation. Therefore, a successful implementation strategy should focus on strengthening both psychotherapists' and patients' motivation to engage with BC. The openness of psychotherapists towards patient characteristics suggests that BC in outpatient care may target a broad patient population.",

In the current study, we sought converging evidence for knower-levels by examining the correspondence of knower-level classifications between the Give-N Task and the Point-to-X Task. In Study 1, we tested 69 preschool-aged children and found that children at the higher knower-levels often did not receive the same classification across tasks. Further, children who were classified as having acquired the cardinal principle on the Give-N Task were more likely than subset-knowers to count on the Point-to-X Task, but they did not count very frequently. In Study 2, we conducted secondary data analysis on an existing study that included a Point-to-X Task with different stimuli and more trial types. We again found that children’s knower-level assessed with Give-N was not always associated with above chance performance for that number on the Point-To-X Task. These data suggest that knower-levels may adequately capture cardinal number knowledge for very small numbers but not for higher numbers. We discuss the practical implications of these findings and highlight a need for future studies to adopt a multi-method approach to establish a robust pattern of children’s number word acquisition.",

We found that incentivizing Twitter/X users to unfollow hyperpartisan social media influencers improved feelings toward the out-party by 23.5% compared to the control group, with effects persisting for at least six months. Unfollowing also led participants to engage with more accurate news and increased satisfaction with their Twitter/X feeds—without reducing engagement. This study demonstrates the long-term causal impact of exposure to hyperpartisan influencers.

However, this approach sidesteps the Extended Mind, the integration of external information with memory. Indeed, adults prefer to use external resources (lists, models) but will remember more as the ‘cost’ to access them increases. Here, in our Shopping Game, we investigated this trade-off in 5-8-year-olds. Using a touch-screen, children shopped in a virtual store. Their shopping list and the store were not visible simultaneously but could be toggled. We manipulated access cost by varying a delay (0 / 4 s) before the list’s reappearance. Across three preregistered experiments at two sites (US / China, N=141), a pattern emerged: when costlier, children revisited the list less often, studied it longer, and selected more correct items. Also, children recognized the costs, identifying the 0-delay condition as easier. Young children show a cost-dependent trade-off of external resource use versus working memory.",

          "authors": "Yi Yang; David Victor Smith",
          "abstract": "As a social species, making redistribution decisions about how to allocate or reallocate resources across different individuals or groups is crucial for human’s survival and well-being at both micro (e.g., disaster relief distribution, charity donation, household income budget) and macro levels (e.g., national budget allocation, public support to wealth redistribution policies) of human society. Dictator games, among other economic games, have been used intensively to study such decisions regarding resource (re)allocation. In a typical dictator game, there are two players: a dictator and a recipient. The dictator decides how to redistribute an endowment, which the recipient cannot reject. Various factors, including dictator personality traits, recipient identity, and endowment transfer actions, have been found to influence dictators' decisions. Several models have been proposed to explain why dictators make certain redistribution decisions in dictator games. While insightful, existing models often oversimplify complex factors, such as task economic structure (e.g., source of endowment, price of transferring endowment between dictators and recipients) and partner identity (e.g, group membership, social closeness), hindering a holistic understanding of redistribution decisions. In this narrative review, we present an integrative framework categorizing factors into four main categories: task structure, dictator trait (trait), recipient identity (identity), and framing. We discuss potential interactions between task economic structure, dictator trait, and recipient identity. We also discuss how framing may influence redistribution decisions through multiple domains. This Structure-Trait-Identity Relation (STIR) framework provides a systematic approach to analyzing decision dynamics and resolving empirical inconsistencies. Future directions are also discussed.",

Despite the growing popularity of the term and purported harmful implications, empirical efforts to operationalize and define gaslighting remain sparse. This study aimed to define common features and themes of self-reported gaslighting experiences. Young adults (N=250) completed several questionnaires and open-ended prompts relating to gaslighting experiences. Using a variety of natural language processing techniques, we explore the gaslighting construct using a data-driven approach from the perspective of self-reported targets of gaslighting. These data confirm that gaslighting is a type of interpersonal manipulation aimed at making a person feel 'crazy' or doubt their memories. Romantic partners were reported to be the most common perpetrators of gaslighting, and both beneficial (e.g., awareness of manipulative people) and detrimental (e.g., self-doubt) consequences of experiencing gaslighting appear to be long-lasting. Additionally, we found that more severe, frequent, and long-lasting gaslighting experiences are associated with broader subjective memory deficits, even extending to other memories outside of the gaslighting event itself. This study highlights pervasive cognitive and psychological impacts of gaslighting, and underscores the need for further empirical research and informed clinical strategies.",

Thus, it is crucial to examine strategies to mitigate human susceptibility to hallucinated output.  In a between-subjects experiment, participants completed a difficult quiz with assistance from either a polite or neutral-toned AI chatbot, which occasionally provided hallucinated (incorrect) information.  Signal detection analysis revealed that participants interacting with polite-AI showed modestly higher sensitivity in detecting hallucinations and a more conservative response bias compared to those interacting with neutral-toned AI.  While the observed effect sizes were modest, even small improvements in users' ability to detect AI hallucinations can have significant consequences, particularly in high-stakes domains or when aggregated across millions of AI interactions.",

          "abstract": "Featuring climate content on screen is believed to be a highly efficient strategy for shifting audiences’ climate beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. With this objective, major studios and other media organizations have launched initiatives to increase the prevalence of climate content. Despite various psychological theories proposed for how climate content may influence beliefs resulting in climate action, many studies assessing the empirical evidence for this pathway rely on cross-sectional analyses with severely limited causal attribution and nearly all studies only measure the impact at a single point in time, limiting our understanding of the persistence of any estimated impact. In this study, we address these limitations through a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 1,014), estimating the impact of watching narrative climate content (a climate focused episode of the television series Madam Secretary) on a set of climate beliefs and attitudes, including belief in climate change, endorsement of government action, social norms around climate action, and other drivers of personal action. These measures were assessed at baseline, as well as three later points (immediately post-viewing, 3-5 days post-viewing, and 7-10 days post-viewing). We find that watching narrative climate content can significantly increase pro-climate beliefs and attitudes. While these positive changes tend to decline across time, they often persist 7-10 days post-viewing. This finding lends credible causal evidence for the claim that on-screen narrative climate fiction has the power to shift relevant climate beliefs and attitudes, even significantly post-viewership, and may be an effective tool supporting large scale social change towards climate action.",

          "authors": "Carmen Saldana; Patrick Kanampiu; Jennifer Culbertson",
          "abstract": "Languages exhibit a tremendous amount of variation in how they organise and order morphemes within words; however, regularities are also found. For example, gender and number inflectional morphology tend to appear together within a single affix. In the relatively rare cases in which they appear as two separate affixes, morphology encoding gender information tends to be placed closer to the stem than number morphology is. Alternative theories of gender and number have been designed (in part) to explain these tendencies. However, the typological data are very sparse, making it difficult to find clear evidence for the representations and mechanisms shaping the organisation of gender and number. Across a series of experiments, we use an artificial language learning paradigm to explore the inferences learners make about the order of gender and number affixes in the absence of any explicit information in the input. We show that language learners have a clear preference for placing nominal morphology containing gender information closest to the stem. This holds both for prefixing and suffixing morphology, and across different types of gender and number systems. Importantly, these biases are consistent across populations of participants with different L1 experience with gender morphology: English, Italian and Kîîtharaka speakers. These results provide a new source of empirical support for particular theories of gender, and in line with previous work, suggest that cognitive biases play a role in determining morpheme order in the world’s languages.",

          "authors": "Anne M van Valkengoed; Linda Steg; Goda Perlaviciute",
          "abstract": "Sustainable lifestyle changes are an important demand-side solution to reduce CO2 emissions. While sustainable lifestyles are increasingly included in integrated assessment models, modellers have so far not managed to realistically model what drives changes in lifestyles. Important questions about the feasibility and likelihood of lifestyle change, and how lifestyle changes can be accelerated or promoted thus go unanswered. Environmental psychology is a discipline dedicated to understanding environmental behaviour, and its theories and findings could therefore be instrumental to informing the modelling of lifestyle change in integrated assessment models. Yet, we identify two barriers currently hinder the systematic integration of this knowledge into integrated assessment modelling. The first barrier is plurality: there are many theories and findings that are potentially relevant to modelling lifestyle change, but guidance is lacking on which to apply when. The second barrier is ambiguity: many theories in psychology are not precise enough to unambiguously translate them into a mathematical model. To overcome the barrier of plurality, we introduce the Motivation, Agency, and Past behaviour (MAP) framework, which summarises and integrates the insights of 8 prominent behavioural theories used in environmental psychology and that can be used to determine which theories and determinants are most relevant for specific modelling applications. To overcome the barrier of ambiguity, we identify three areas where the precision of theorizing in environmental psychology can be improved, namely definitions and consistent use of constructs, the specification of relationships between constructs, and describing the strength and boundary conditions of these relationships. We urge for closer collaborations between modellers and environmental psychologists to successfully model the drivers and impacts of sustainable lifestyle change.",

By drawing comparisons between species richness and abundance, we applied Shannon entropy and beta diversity measures to assess the diversity and distribution of a verbal repertoire over time. This analysis utilized the outcomes of three verbal operant experimental analyses that use a multi-element design to test for the occurrence of four elementary verbal operants. Using archival data, diversity measures were then used to conduct a detailed analysis of the richness and evenness of verbal responses. The results demonstrate that beta diversity and Shannon entropy effectively capture the richness and distribution of the verbal repertoire over time. These findings suggest that diversity indices can provide a robust framework for assessing language development and the effectiveness of interventions. This research underscores the importance of integrating ecological diversity models into behavioral science to better understand complex human behaviors like language. Future applications of this method may allow for more complex analysis of verbal behavior within and across individuals and interventions.",

Participants heard auditory stimuli of disyllabic Dutch stress pairs (e.g., VOORnaam vs. voorNAAM) with clear or ambiguous stress cues, while seeing videos of a talker in the center of the screen producing a beat gesture on the first or second syllable (or no gesture). Results showed that on stress-ambiguous trials, beat gestures guided word recognition in an on-line manner, similar to acoustic stress cues. For instance, a beat gesture on the first syllable biased looks towards VOORnaam before word offset.

          "authors": "Robert Nosofsky; Adam F Osth",
          "abstract": "We conduct tests of a hybrid-similarity exemplar model on its ability to account for the context-dependent memorability of items embedded in high-dimensional category spaces. According to the model, recognition judgments are based on the summed similarity of test items to studied exemplars. The model allows for the idea that “self-similarity” among objects differs due to matching on highly salient distinctive features. Participants viewed a study list of rock images belonging to geologically defined categories where the number of studied items from each category was manipulated.  Following study, the participants’ old-new recognition memory performance was tested.  We also manipulated across experiments the nature of the encoding task used during the study phase:  Experiment 1 used a category-description matching task, whereas Experiment 2 used more neutral encoding instructions. Hit rates were markedly lower in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 and participants relied less on the presence of distinctive features for recognizing old items in the second experiment.  With a minimum of parameter estimation, the hybrid-similarity model provided good accounts of a wide variety of fundamental benchmark phenomena across the two experiments.  These included changing levels of memorability due to contextual effects of category size, within- and between-category similarity, and the presence of distinctive features.  However, the hybrid model and a variety of extensions of the model fell short in accounting for the variability in hit rates within the class of old target items themselves.  We discuss future directions for potentially improving upon the current predictions from the model.",

          "abstract": "Learning traps are cycles of suboptimal decision-making where a false belief about the structure of the environment leads to avoidance of rewarding options. Two experiments (N= 324) examined the role of selective attention in the emergence and prevention of learning traps. Participants learned to approach or avoid members of two categories that were associated with either gains or losses. A rule involving two visual feature dimensions predicted category membership, while a third dimension was irrelevant. Category feedback was provided only when an item was approached. Selective attention during learning was assessed using an eye tracker. Experiment 1 found that many participants fell into the trap of using a single-dimension rule to guide approach/avoid decisions and consequently missed rewards. Eye tracking confirmed that these participants narrowed their visual attention to a single dimension. In Experiment 2, we manipulated visual feature salience across three groups and found evidence for a causal role of selective attention in determining the emergence and prevalence of learning traps.",

          "authors": "Oliver Brady; Paul Nulty; LIli Zhang; Tomas Ward; David McGovern",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a wide range of everyday decision-making scenarios, transforming the way people make choices and interact with technology. However, despite their seemingly ‘superhuman’ capabilities, LLMs are not infallible and can exhibit pitfalls in their decision-making abilities if not deployed with caution. This review aims to analyse the decision-making capabilities of LLMs by comparing their abilities to humans through the lens of dual process theory. Guided by this framework, it is clear that LLMs can mimic both human-like System 1 thinking – exhibiting cognitive biases and relying on heuristics to support decision-making processes –  and slower System 2 thinking through prompting methods like chain-of-thought reasoning. As LLMs have advanced, they have become more adept at comprehending tasks; however, they can still exhibit biases and make errors, some of which appear similar to human cognitive biases. What remains unclear, however, is the extent to which the processes in AI systems that lead to decision-making biases are truly analogous to those in human cognition, or if they are primarily a byproduct of the human-produced data and algorithms used to train the models. Moreover, LLMs can exhibit their own unique, nonhuman biases, such as hallucinations and overconfidence, that currently limit their application to real-world decision-making applications. Nonetheless, these models hold significant potential to revolutionise the way we make decisions across a diverse range of sectors. Thus, we conclude the review by offering recommendations for future research and practical suggestions on how to leverage LLMs to augment human decision-making.",

          "authors": "Carolyn Kroger; Deborah R. Fu; Renee M. Banakis Hartl; Anahita Mehta",
          "abstract": "Pitch, timing, and space in auditory perception interact, causing changes in one dimension to distort judgments of others (Boltz, 1998; Henry et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2006). The auditory kappa effect exemplifies this, as larger pitch changes between sequential tones create an illusion of longer time intervals (Cohen et al., 1954). Traditionally studied with three-tone sequences (‘A-X-B’), this effect shows that varying the middle tone’s pitch relative to the first and third tones skews time interval perception. The prevailing auditory motion hypothesis (Henry &amp; McAuley, 2009) proposes that a “pitch velocity” is inferred from a consistent pitch trajectory. We tested this against the auditory grouping hypothesis, which proposes that feature similarity affects perceived timing. Experiment 1 tested the kappa effect under varying pitch separations, revealing slower pitch velocities produced larger effects, contradicting the motion hypothesis. Experiment 2 examined inconsistent pitch trajectories to challenge the stability of pitch velocity referents, and still found kappa effects, further supporting the auditory grouping hypothesis. Experiment 3 investigated the kappa effect in auditory space, confirming that sounds presented closer in space are judged as occurring closer in time. These findings suggest that the kappa effect results from the grouping of auditory events by feature similarity, opposing the auditory motion hypothesis.",

          "authors": "Yu Hao",
          "abstract": "Nature benefits stress recovery. However, few studies have examined if individual differences in emotion regulation moderate the restorative effect of nature. I investigated to what extent experiential, physiological, and neural components of stress recovery during nature scene viewing are moderated by individual differences in the habitual use of expressive suppression in daily lives. Thirty-three college students were induced acute stress by a standard laboratory stressor (mental arithmetic). Then they viewed nature scenes with different sunlight conditions and a blank screen as baseline control, immediately after which they rated their relaxation levels. Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals were used to derive functional coupling between prefrontal and posterior cortical regions in alpha oscillation, an indicator of visual attention. Peripheral physiology, skin conductance (SCR) and heart-rate variability (HRV), indicating sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, respectively, were also recorded. Results showed that experiential and physiological outcomes of nature scenes differed by individual differences in expressive suppression. Specifically, high expressive suppression was associated with lower relaxation and HRV in some nature scenes. SCR is invariant across nature scenes or expressive suppression. Furthermore, visual perception of nature scenes may require more involuntary attention; therefore, EEG alpha coupling was reduced. Alpha coupling during nature scenes predicted subjective relaxation, depending on expressive suppression. The present study indicates that individuals high in expressive suppression may not benefit to the same degree as those lower in expressive suppression during nature scene exposure. Future studies on stress processing by integrating environment, brain, body, and individual traits are valuable.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing recognition of the potential benefits of video games, the positive psychological impact of narrative role-playing games (RPGs) remains understudied. These games, with their immersive storytelling, are uniquely positioned to foster meaningful engagement. However, known protective factors for well-being such as positive emotions and character interactions - otherwise known as parasocial interactions - have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this gap, this study employed a mixed-methods approach to investigate the design elements underlying positive emotions and meaningful parasocial interactions in narrative RPGs, combining an online questionnaire with open- and closed-ended questions completed by 100 participants and in-depth interviews with 10 individuals. Linear regression analyses demonstrated reciprocal predictive relationships between positive affect and parasocial interactions as well as positive affect and negative affect. Additionally, reflexive thematic analysis generated six themes that captured how players experienced these effects in narrative RPGs, ranging from the freedom of immersion to narrative soundness. Based on these insights, a set of research-informed recommendations targeted towards optimising player well-being was produced for developers of this genre. Overall, it is suggested that narrative-gameplay consistency, fantasy-reality balance, and negative but meaningful experiences stimulate positive emotions and meaningful parasocial interactions in narrative RPGs,\nproviding implications for the future research, design, and evaluation of this genre.",

          "abstract": "This paper addresses a problem that arises from the ontological commitments of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0, particularly its stance that only conscious entities truly exist. This position leads to the \"origin of consciousness problem\": if non-conscious entities do not truly exist, how could consciousness have evolved from non-conscious ancestors? We explore several responses IIT might offer, such as the co-origin of life and consciousness, or the idea that non-conscious ancestors might have been constituted by \"ontological dust\"—minimally conscious, intrinsic micro-entities collectively aggregated to form bigger objects lacking unified consciousness.  Our analysis shows that IIT’s ontological framework, along with scientific knowledge regarding biological evolution, prebiotic chemical structures, and physical cosmology, ultimately forces the theory into positing a form of  \"Big Bang consciousness\", that is, a primordial ontological dust constituted by minimally conscious elementary particles created soon after the Big Bang. Although IIT may accept this striking implication, we think that it introduces tensions with both the received scientific view of the evolutionary origin of consciousness and the cosmological understanding of early universe components. We also present but ultimately reject an alternative option based on what we call the “formless stuff hypothesis”, which might avoid the implication that consciousness originates from nothing as well as the necessity of a \"Big Bang consciousness”.  We conclude by suggesting that IIT's metaphysical commitments, especially the equation true existence=phenomenal existence, require re-examination to reconcile its framework with standard scientific knowledge, and in particular, with the received view about the phylogenetic origin of consciousness.",

To better understand this alignment, we created a large corpus of human and LLM-generated responses to various moral scenarios. We found a misalignment between human and LLM moral assessments; although both LLMs and humans tended to reject morally complex utilitarian dilemmas, LLMs were more sensitive to personal framing. We then conducted a quantitative user study involving 230 participants, who evaluated these responses by determining whether they were AI-generated and assessed their agreement with the responses. Human evaluators preferred LLMs’ assessments in moral scenarios, though a systematic anti-AI bias was observed: participants were less likely to agree with judgments they believed to be machine-generated. Statistical and NLP-based analyses revealed subtle linguistic differences in responses, influencing detection and agreement.

          "abstract": "Visual narrative comprehension is essential for navigating modern society, where information, rules, and news are frequently communicated through images, diagrams, and visual stories. Encoding a coherent narrative from disparate elements is critical for all age groups. Although recent data indicate that stress levels have risen compared to previous decades, the impact of stress on visual narrative comprehension remains underexplored. This study explored how acute stress affects narrative comprehension in younger (N = 203, 18-57 years; M = 23 years; Experiment 1) and older adults (N = 212, 60-85 years; M = 67 years; Experiment 2). Participants were assessed under both acute stress and neutral conditions. A tool for inducing acute stress online employed mathematical and logical tasks under time pressure, along with elements that simulate social stress. Participants were presented with pictorial stories comprising three panels, where the second panel was intentionally left blank. Their task was to comprehend the stories and determine whether the presented pictorial inference for the missing event was correct or incorrect. Results revealed that acute stress negatively impacted narrative comprehension in younger adults, while the older adults' comprehension remained unaffected by acute stress. Similarly, younger adults demonstrated reduced confidence in their responses under stress, whereas older adults’ confidence levels remained unaffected. These findings highlight the relationship between visual narrative comprehension, stress, and aging, suggesting that, with age and experience, comprehenders may develop more differentiated event schemas, which makes their comprehension processes more resilient to stress.\n\nPublic Significance Statement: \nUnderstanding how cognitive and perceptional processes function under stress is crucial for daily life across all age groups. Our research demonstrates that acute stress leads to a decline in visual narrative comprehension only in younger adults, while older adults' narrative comprehension remains stable despite stress. This finding suggests that older adults may employ more effective coping mechanisms, which helps maintain their cognitive stability in the face of stress. Consequently, narrative comprehension appears to be more resilient compared to other fundamental cognitive skills. These insights could inform interventions and strategies to support cognitive health across different age groups.",

To fully understand their psychological effects, different theories stress that people’s subjective perception of daily events must be considered. However, a systematic examination of the perceived characteristics of daily events is still missing, which has led to jingle-jangle problems and the negligence of their perceived characteristics in existing research. To overcome these problems, we conducted a systematic literature review and four empirical studies (Ntotal = 1,468) to develop a taxonomy that systematically captures the perception of daily events on eight dimensions: positive emotion, challenge, relevance, threat to self, predictability, duty, sociality, and external control. Furthermore, we validated a measure – the Daily Event Questionnaire – to reliably and validly assess these perceived characteristics of daily events. Applying our taxonomy and measure, we found that the perception of daily events systematically differed from the perception of everyday situations. Moreover, the perception of daily events predicted fluctuations in daily and weekly well-being over time. We discuss how this dimensional taxonomy of perceived event characteristics may advance future research and theory development regarding the effects of daily events on well-being and discuss similarities and differences between our taxonomy and taxonomies of the perception of situations and major life events.",

An alternative version of the test has been tested using eye-tracking (Russell et al., 2021) in addition to manual responses and was hypothesized to be more reliable. Here, we put this hypothesis to the test by attempting to reproduce already-assessed correlational results between the performance at the classical RMET and the self-reported personality, loneliness and empathy, now using eye-gaze as an RMET performance index. Despite a marked eye-gaze bias towards the face image corresponding to the target word, the eye-gaze pattern correlated with none of the self-reported psychological variables. This result highlights the interest in using eye-tracking for theory of mind tests, while questioning the robustness of the association between psychological variables and RMET performance, and the reliability of the RMET itself.",

To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank. Analyzing data from 56,122 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect.

Several studies have described their stereotype and compared it to other groups, but none has done so using the dimensions and facets of the most recent integrated framework of stereotypes. In Study 1 among university students (n = 241), we show that unemployed people are rated lower than employed people on the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of their stereotypes, as well as on the facets of capacity, assertiveness, morality and friendliness. In addition, we also show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In study 2, we replicate and extend these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanized when compared to the same target of employed people and to the same high-high and low-low occupations. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on the horizontal and the vertical dimensions, as well as on the capacity, assertiveness and friendliness facets but not on morality. Overall, we conclude that unemployed people have a highly destructive stereotype that is lacking in every dimension and facet, that they are overly despised and that unemployment is so disregarded that not having a job is considered worse than having a devalued job.",

Cultural transmissions have also been modelled mathematically, proving a strong influence from a prior knowledge of transmitters. Here, we investigate an emergence of structured colour expression in painting via cultural transmission. We experimentally transmitted colouring books, wherein the participants memorised and reproduced the colour patterns of the book they saw; then, their response was presented as the memorization target for other participants. We expected the outcome of these transmissions represents the prior knowledge about the colour perception of the objects of the colouring books. Our results revealed a certain type of structuring in the last generation of the transmissions, indicated by the consistent use of fewer colours for recognizable segments/objects, compared to the random patterns in the first generation. However, naturalistic colour patterns (e.g. green for leaves) were observed only in some of the transmission chains. These results suggest that, like language and music, colour representations become structured during cultural transmission.",

In this study, we offer a new but important perspective by conceptualizing political (dis)interest as a social identity.

Employing Item Response Theory, we validate the construct validity of both scales in a pre- registered study in the Netherlands (N = 2,060). Using the same dataset, we also demonstrate their predictive validity. Importantly, the PPIS and NPIS uncover substantial differences in political attitudes and behaviors both between and within individuals who identify as politically (dis)interested. Recognizing political (dis)interest as a social identity enriches our understand- ing of the concept and its implications for politically relevant attitudes and behaviors, while also informing interventions to foster political interest equally across all citizens.",

          "authors": "Eduardo Ekman Schenberg",
          "abstract": "The recent review of a new drug application for MDMA-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder by the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) highlighted epistemological and methodological challenges for evidence assessments. Similar challenges will also be faced in reviews of other compounds in early- and late-stage development, like psilocybin for depression. \nThe regulatory demand for two successful phase 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) seems problematic, given a current lack of agreement on what constitutes “success”, particularly when psychoactive drug administration is concomitant with (psycho)therapy. These complex arrangements challenge the internal validity of estimated average treatment effect through comparison with conventional control conditions. \nThis paper reviews the assumptions behind RCTs’ current “gold-standard” status in the hierarchy of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Recapitulating known epistemic limits of randomisation and blinding, it emphasises the urgent need to avoid the extrapolation fallacy. \nThe resulting argument is that the degree of trustworthiness that efficacy — reported in RCTs — will reliably predict effectiveness — in target populations outside RCTs — depends on what type of psychedelic treatments will be regulated. If “stand-alone” drugs for large scale prescription and consumption, trustworthiness should be graded low. On the other hand, for regulation of drug-assisted (psycho)therapies, the degree of trustworthiness can be considered high. The reason being that these two treatment approaches are based on different causal claims with distinct external validities. Therefore, careful assessment of support factors in each is recommended to prevent detrimental consequences, from potential rejection of effective therapies up to medical reversal of eventually approved drugs.",

With the availability of software programs, the wide application of ANN becomes possible. However, without a firm understanding of the basics of the ANN, issues can easily arise. This paper presents a step-by-step guide for implementing a feed-forward neural network (FNN) on a psychological dataset to illustrate the critical steps in building, estimating, and interpreting a neural network model. We start with a concrete example of a basic 3-layer FNN, illustrating the core concepts, the matrix representation, and the whole optimization process. By adjusting parameters and changing the model structure, we examine their effects on model performance. Then, we introduce accessible methods for interpreting model results and making inferences. Through the guide, we hope to help researchers avoid common problems in applying neural network models, and machine learning methods in general.",

          "abstract": "Objective. Trauma can have a range of effects on individuals over time, including the potential for positive changes in favorable outcomes commonly referred to as posttraumatic growth. The posttraumatic growth literature has been criticized for various methodological limitations and has largely neglected the exploration of factors that may strengthen or weaken posttraumatic growth trajectories. The present study contributes to this literature by investigating trajectories of five dimensions of posttraumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating effects of health and financial difficulties on these trajectories. Method. Longitudinal data were collected monthly between July 2020 and December 2022 from a sample of employed adults in Germany, involving N = 1,678 participants over 30 time points (Nobservations = 29,552). Results. Results suggest that certain dimensions of posttraumatic growth showed significant increases (i.e., relationships) or decreases (i.e., spirituality, possibilities) over time, and that trajectories of three dimensions (i.e., relationships, appreciation, and strength) demonstrated distinctive patterns of interaction with health and financial difficulties. Conclusions. Findings are discussed in the context of the pandemic as well as dynamic theories of personality and identity, with implications for advancing posttraumatic growth theory and research.",

          "authors": "Lotus Shareef-Trudeau; David M. Lydon-Staley; John Medaglia; Aaron Kucyi",
          "abstract": "A substantial portion of waking life consists of mental experiences that arise involuntarily, including mind-wandering, spontaneous thought and rumination. Given that these experiences are fundamental to cognitive function and mental health, there has been growing scientific and clinical interest in using measures of brain activity to model and predict the momentary occurrence of these various forms of involuntary thought. In the most common machine learning approach in neuroimaging and electrophysiology research, model training data include neural features derived from a population of individuals, and testing is performed on held-out data in one or more individuals. However, sources of idiosyncrasy, such as individual differences in the nature of thought and brain functional organization, raise critical questions regarding whether population-derived neural models can generalize to individuals. In this article, we describe how an idiographic (person-specific) approach has potential to improve theory and practice in predictive neural modeling of involuntary thought. This approach emphasizes dense-sampling of individuals so that a diverse set of brain states and mental experiences can be modeled within a single individual, and rigorous tests of cross-subject generalizability can be performed. We review the advantages and shortcomings of both nomothetic (population-based) and idiographic predictive modeling approaches, including recent insights from dense-sampling neuroimaging studies that demonstrate person-specific brain-based predictions of mind-wandering. We discuss implications for developing personalized clinical biomarkers, strategies to overcome the practical challenges of an idiographic approach, and neuroethical concerns that must be considered as person-specific models may enhance the potential for accurate brain-based predictions of involuntary thought.",

          "abstract": "Many autistic adults report negative long-lasting consequences of their early childhood therapy experiences, and caregivers of young autistic children report that these services do not meet their child’s needs. Additionally, therapies in research contexts will often be implemented in family-centered programs such as Early Intervention (EI), but the child-focused nature of current therapies fail to help caregivers understand and support their child. This demonstrates the misalignment of autism therapy research with the goals of autistic people and caregivers, and the contextual demands of EI. This manuscript reports the outputs of a collaborative project in which 17 autistic adults, autistic caregivers, and non-autistic caregivers of autistic children developed research priorities and guiding principles for future early childhood autism research. These principles and priorities will provide a foundation for autism researchers to develop therapies and supports that are aligned with community needs and priorities, resulting in more equitable and effective practices for the diverse families served through EI and other early childhood therapy programs.

          "abstract": "Across eight pre-registered studies with both convenience and representative samples of American adults (N = 6,464), we provide strong evidence of widespread support for Initiatives for Future Generations (IFGs)—institutions and policies designed to ensure political representation for future generations. Despite broad bipartisan support, Americans significantly underestimate how much their peers favor these initiatives, a phenomenon known as pluralistic ignorance. Nonetheless, providing accurate information about actual levels of IFG support corrects these misperceptions and boosts individual support. Additionally, interventions targeting intergenerational concern—frequently used in the field—effectively enhance support for IFGs without increasing pluralistic ignorance as an unintended consequence, suggesting that such interventions are a promising approach to fostering support for pro-future institutions and policies. Nonetheless, merely correcting pluralistic ignorance offers a promising avenue for boosting support as well, opening avenues for future research to investigate whether interventions as simple as correcting misperceptions may inspire more vocal support for IFGs and engagement in pro-future collective action. In sum, our findings suggest that policymakers have a clear opportunity to act by recognizing the broad public support for IFGs and implementing policies to protect future generations, ensuring long-term welfare without alienating any demographic.",

          "abstract": "Research on perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV) has primarily focused on heterosexual relationships with male perpetrators and female victims. The oversight of same-sex couples, and relationships with female abusers and male victims, has led to inconsistent findings in the literature. This incoherence might be explained by a lack of theoretical understanding of people’s beliefs and assumptions about IPV. Thus, this study aims to assess the structure of IPV prototypes of different binary victim-perpetrator gender combinations. Using a mixed-methods approach, a US- and UK-based sample (N = 161) gave open-ended responses on what they believe are common assumptions and beliefs about IPV scenarios. A psychometric network modeling approach was used to provide representations of the prototypes of the different IPV scenarios. Specifically, Gaussian graphical models of the responses were constructed, characterizing the correlations between the contents of participants’ responses. The findings show surprisingly strong global similarities between the prototypes, yet strikingly clear local differences in the domains of perpetrator, victim, relationship, and abuse.",

Hence, we tested MMT in a naturalistic setting by combining experience sampling with logged music streaming data, while accounting for algorithmic curation as a boundary condition to users’ music choices. In a pre-registered study using T = 6,918 observations from N = 144 listeners, results showed that mood, music selection, and algorithmic curation varied substantially from situation to situation. However, we found no effects between mood and music choices that would confirm MMT’s selection hypotheses, yet small mood-congruent music effects on mood. Algorithmic curation did not establish novel MMT-related choice patterns. Our findings suggest re-specifying MMT and related media use theories for daily life.",

          "abstract": "Improving patient outcomes will be enhanced by understanding “what works, for whom?” enabling better matching of patients to available treatments. However, answering this “what works, for whom?” question requires sample sizes that exceed that of most individual trials. Conventional methods for combining data across trials, including aggregate-data meta-analysis, suffer from key limitations including difficulty accounting for differences across trials (e.g., comparing “apples to oranges”). Casually interpretable meta-analysis (CI-MA) addresses these limitations by pairing individual-participant-data (IPD) across trials with advancements in transportability methods to extend causal inferences to clinical “target” populations of interest. Combining IPD across trials also requires careful acquisition and harmonization of data, a challenging process for which practical guidance is not well-described in the literature. To fill these gaps, we describe methods and work to date for (1) harmonization of the largest IPD dataset available from 28 randomized controlled trials for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  treatments, along with target data from a clinical sample of treatment-seeking youth ages 4-20 with OCD and (2) the application of CI-MA to facilitate an understanding “what works, for whom?”.

          "abstract": "Bayesian inference is becoming an increasingly popular framework for statistics in the behavioural sciences. However, its application is hampered by its computational intractability -- almost all Bayesian analyses require a form of approximation. While some of these approximate inference algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), have become well-known throughout the literature, other approaches exist that are not as widespread. Here, we provide an introduction to another family of approximate inference techniques known as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We show that SMC brings a number of benefits, which we illustrate in three different examples: linear regression and variable selection for depression, growth curve mixture modelling of grade point averages, and in computational modelling of the Iowa Gambling Task. These use cases demonstrate that SMC is efficient in exploring posterior distributions, reaching similar predictive performance as state-of-the-art MCMC approaches, in less wall-clock time. Moreover, they show that SMC is effective in dealing with multi-modal distributions, and that SMC not only approximates the posterior distribution, but simultaneously provides a useful estimate of the marginal likelihood, which is the essential quantity in Bayesian model comparison. All of this comes at no additional effort of the end user.",

Data were collected from 551 SGM parents.\n \nSetting: Community-based sample.\n \nParticipants: A total of 551 SGM parents (Mean age = 34.5 years, SD = 8.7 years) who reported their experiences of stigma, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and their children’s emotional and conduct problems\n \nExposure: Parental experiences of stigma, defined as discrimination and internalized stigma.\n \nMain Outcome and Measures: Parental externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, and children’s emotional and conduct problems.\n \nResults: There were significant correlations among general factors of parental and child psychopathology. Parental externalizing psychopathology was associated with child conduct problems, while parental internalizing psychopathology was linked to child emotional problems. General parental stigma was associated with both children’s overall psychopathology and emotional problems specifically, as well as parental internalizing psychopathology.

This review aimed to (1) examine the relationship between SEL implementation variability and student outcomes and (2) identify and assess the quality of the methods used to establish this relationship, to reduce the research-to-practice gap and advance evidence-based practice. \n\nMethods. British Education Index, ERIC, PsycINFO, ASSIA, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science were searched, initially identifying 2,987 studies. A quality appraisal checklist was developed to assess the quality of research statistically examining the implementation-outcomes relationship. Extracted data were grouped according to the implementation dimension(s) assessed, the outcome domain(s) examined, and the statistical method(s) used. \n\nResults. Thirty-one studies met the review inclusion criteria. Quality assessment classified fourteen studies (45%) as low quality, fifteen (48%) as medium quality, and 2 (7%) as high quality. The most frequently examined implementation dimensions were dosage (n=16), fidelity (n=12), quality (n=10), responsiveness (n=6) and reach (n=3). Inferring the relationship between implementation variability and outcomes was hindered by the poor quality of studies and the heterogeneity, complexity, and resulting small sample size of comparison groups; calculation of meta-aggregative effect sizes was therefore not possible. \n\nDiscussion. This review reveals the paucity of high-quality research examining the relationship between SEL implementation variability and student outcomes. Accordingly, we propose the use of the aforementioned quality appraisal checklist to support and guide future research in this area, alongside recommendations to advance implementation science.",

In this space, health advice, misinformation, cat videos, and similar content compete for users’ limited attention. This study explored the hypothesis that content biases support the spread of nonadaptive information online. To test this, we analyzed 1,022,526 instances of engagement (reactions, comments, shares) generated by 356 misleading Facebook posts. We evaluated the relationship between the presence of visual material, cognitive factors of attraction (social, threat-related, intergroup-related information, positivity, and negativity biases), and engagement scores by fitting a Bayesian negative binomial model. Cognitive attractive features were present in 92% of the posts, but only visual material, intergroup-related information, and positive and negative sentiment increased engagement. The findings suggest that the specifics of social media, such as the visibility structures of platforms and competition from salient, accurate information, may moderate what gets transmitted.",

          "abstract": "Opinions of others influence behavior and decision-making, with important consequences for health. An unaddressed question is whether and how social influence can generalize across different situations or decisions. From a learning perspective, generalization is the transfer of previously acquired information to new stimuli and can be based on both perceptual and conceptual similarity. Here, we test whether social influence generalizes to new choices based on shared conceptual features, such as the healthiness and tastiness of different food items. We conducted three studies (total N = 468), in which healthy participants rated how much they would like to eat different food items and were subsequently presented with the ratings of several other people (‘social ratings’). Unbeknownst to our participants, they were randomly assigned to social ratings that either reflected a mainly health-driven valuation of food items (‘health group’) or to social ratings that reflected a taste-driven valuation of food items (‘taste group’). The results in all three studies showed that participants’ food ratings became more influenced by healthiness in the ‘health group’ than in the ‘taste group’. In one study, these effects further transferred to food choices in a naturalistic supermarket task. Our findings provide first evidence of generalization of social influence effects based on inferred social health norms. Futures studies could test conceptual generalization of other types of social and non-social learning and characterize the brain mechanism underlying these effects.",

          "abstract": "Background: Health behaviors and motivations within family units are likely to be associated with the motives and behaviors of other family members. A potential mechanism for these relations is that parents citing autonomous motives toward physical activity are more likely to support their child’s autonomous motivation to be active.

          "abstract": "We present a retrieved-context theory of memory for items, associations, and their\ninteraction (CMR-IA). Our theory assumes an evolving representation of temporal context that binds to items and associations, allowing the rememberer to make judgments based on the occurrence of a mnemonic target within a particular context. In addition to the assumptions inherited from prior retrieved-context theories, CMR-IA assumes a conjunctive (Gestalt) representation for paired associates, increased attention to rare items, and variable thresholds for recognition decisions. We apply CMR-IA to key findings concerning recognition of items and associations, including effects of recency, similarity, receiver-operating characteristic curves, word frequency, differential forgettings of items and associations, and contiguity effects for successive probes. We also apply CMR-IA to cued recall phenomena, including serial position effects, distribution of correct responses and errors, contiguity effects, associative symmetry, and similarity effects. Finally, we ask whether CMR-IA can account for the dependencies between successive tests of item and associative memory. We show that combining a Gestalt associative mechanism with retrieved-context theory provides a good account for many empirical phenomena concerning item and associative memory. The analysis of successive memory tests highlights the important role of output encoding in our model.",

          "abstract": "Background: Racialized heteroscedasticity, characterized by unequal variance in neuroimaging data across racial groups, may challenge the assumptions underlying brain-behavior predictive models. These models often assume homoscedasticity, potentially leading to biased predictions, particularly when applied across diverse populations. This study investigates the presence of heteroscedasticity in functional connectivity data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and examines its implications for predictive modeling using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data.\nMethods: We analyzed resting-state functional connectivity from 5,084 participants in the ABCD study, comparing variance in rs-fMRI connectivity between Black and White participants across 35,912 non-redundant connectivity edges. Levene’s test, adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic covariates, was used to assess differences in variance, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction applied. Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM) was employed to predict performance across 15 behavioral and cognitive tasks, and 95% confidence intervals were generated for prediction intervals via bootstrapping over 1,000 iterations.\nResults: Significant differences in variance were observed in 10.5% (n = 3,768) of connectivity edges, with 98.5% (n = 3,712) showing greater variance in Black participants. CPM analysis revealed significantly wider prediction intervals for Black participants across 10 of 15 tasks, particularly in measures of working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. These results suggest that increased variance in functional connectivity in Black participants contributes to greater prediction uncertainty in brain-behavior models.\nConclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for racialized heteroscedasticity in neuroimaging-based predictive models. Failing to account for differences in variance may exacerbate health disparities and lead to less reliable predictions for Black participants. Addressing these disparities is essential for the development of more equitable predictive models in neuroscience and psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Perceived discrimination is a pervasive social stressor with significant implications for adolescent mental health and neurodevelopment. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we investigated the relationship between perceived discrimination and functional connectivity patterns in the adolescent brain. We applied a Network-Based Statistic (NBS) analysis to 268x268 connectome data from 5,084 participants who provided data on perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination was coded as a binary variable (Yes/No) based on participants' responses to a validated discrimination scale. Our analysis identified two primary subnetworks associated with perceived discrimination: a positive subnetwork, characterized by increased connectivity between the right prefrontal cortex, left insula, and subcortical regions, and a negative subnetwork, marked by disrupted connectivity between the right prefrontal cortex and left temporal regions. The positive subnetwork suggests enhanced cross-hemispheric communication in adolescents reporting discrimination, while the negative subnetwork indicates reduced cross-hemispheric integration in those reporting no discrimination. Additionally, significant alterations in connectivity across large-scale brain networks were observed. Specifically, adolescents reporting discrimination exhibited increased connectivity between visual processing networks and regions involved in attentional control, while showing decreased connectivity in other network interactions. These findings offer novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of perceived discrimination on adolescent brain function, particularly in regions related to emotion regulation, social cognition, and stress responses. Our results underscore the importance of considering discriminatory experiences in the context of adolescent neurodevelopment and mental health.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel methodological framework for cognitive control training, embedded in a video game that incorporates action-based gameplay and a multidimensional Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) system. This system adapts to individual player performance in real-time, ensuring a personalized and engaging experience. The game architecture is modular, including a configurable set of cognitive training modules which are tailored according to one’s training goals. Transitioning between modules occurs through an action-based central hub following the literature on action video games and their positive impact on brain plasticity. Analysis of data from 34 players demonstrates how they progress through each module, with most players reaching their zone of proximal development after approximately 30-45 minutes of playing a module. Once players stabilize in their skill progression, the DDA system maintains variability in gameplay, a feature that has been suggested to promote the transfer of skills to novel situations. This analysis also highlights how our novel multidimensional DDA system accommodates a wide range of skill levels, offering a seamless on-boarding experience across a variety of players. Together, this novel architecture and DDA framework provide a new, rigorous methodological blueprint for the design of computerized cognitive training tools.",

          "authors": "andra geana; Christina L. Boisseau; Michael Frank; Steve Rasmussen",
          "abstract": "Compulsivity is a key feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with compulsions—repetitive, stereotyped behaviors and mental acts meant to relieve distress—often posing significant obstacles to daily function. The last few years have seen increases in compulsive behaviors; yet, the specific mechanisms of compulsions in OCD remain unknown. Previous research holds mixed findings on compulsivity-linked cognitive deficits, and, while many accounts assume compulsions aim to reduce anxiety, most individuals with anxiety do not develop compulsions—suggesting that the anxiety-reduction account is incomplete. A deeper insight into the neural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning compulsions holds immediate potential benefits for improving treatment options for OCD patients. We propose here that one factor in the formation of compulsions is the inability to integrate uncertainty across hierarchical goal levels. Using a predictive inference task with a hierarchical structure relying on local uncertainty reduction (short-term goals) in the service of global uncertainty reduction (long-term goal), we tested local and global learning in OCD patients (n = 20) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). Both groups showed the ability to reduce uncertainty locally, learning the statistical structure of the local environment based on observed data; however, only the healthy volunteers showed evidence of integrated learned knowledge at the local level into reducing uncertainty about the higher level of the task hierarchy. We suggest that this indicates a potential mechanism for compulsions that relies on the inability to adaptively prioritize and “toggle” among different local goals in the service of global goals.",

          "authors": "Xinyue Li; Akram Bakkour",
          "abstract": "Our memories play a crucial role in many decisions. Recent work has begun to study how individuals recombine elements of past episodes stored in memory to evaluate the outcome of some decisions (Biderman et al., 2020; Shohamy &amp; Daw, 2015). However, memory is not infallible and can get distorted. Understanding the impact of a fallible memory system on decision-making is essential. To explore how rewards influence memory and subsequent choices, we employed a modified version of the classic Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995), where we assigned different levels of reward to different DRM lists at the encoding stage . Words were either novel, studied, or conceptually related critical lures. In Experiment 1, we tested the effect of reward level at encoding on subsequent memory performance. In Experiment 2, we tested the effect of reward level on subsequent memory-guided value-based decision making. We found that high-value critical lures were brought to mind more often than low-value critical lures overall. Interestingly, participants properly identified high-value critical lures as new, despite bringing those words to mind (i.e., participants successfully monitored their memory for high-value critical lures), but failed to so for low-value critical lures. Moreover, participants chose high-value critical lures more often than novel items that were not related to the studied lists when compared to low-value critical lures. These findings suggest that reward can modulate memory representations to be more generalizable and consequently shape decisions that rely on such representations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Within sexual- and gender-diverse populations, stressful childhood experiences (SCEs) impact health outcomes in adulthood. We conducted a meta-analysis of the impact of SCEs on health outcomes among sexual- and gender-minority populations.  \nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis based on preregistered search criteria. The initial search identified 3,067 articles from 2013-2022, narrowed to 64 independent studies following double-reviewer abstract and full-text screening. Seven health outcomes were identified: psychological health (k = 26), suicide and related behaviors (k = 23), substance use (k = 14), sexual health (k = 13), physical health (k = 5),  housing instability (k = 3), and adulthood abuse/victimization (k = 3). An individual meta-analysis was conducted for each health outcome. \nResults: Across all health outcomes, there were increased odds (31 - 132%) for sexual- and gender-diverse-identifying individuals who experienced SCEs before age 18 to develop an adverse health outcome after age 18. \nConclusion: Increased odds for the development of an adverse health outcome following SCEs among sexual- and gender-diverse populations highlight the need to assess SCEs in research and clinical practice. This is one of the largest meta-analyses to examine the impacts of SCEs on health outcomes among LGBTQ+ populations. Beyond research and the clinic, these findings have critical policy implications for creating environments that mitigate the impact of SCEs on health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals.",

A major limitation of that study was the use of the binary measurement. In this paper, we show that the same effect is detectable with a new, near-Gaussian measurement of leftism. The correlation between this measurement and paternal age was r = 0.12 (p &lt; 0.001). This measurement has high reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.93) which far outperforms the commonly used Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scale (α = 0.71) [2] as well as high criterion validity, as evidenced by the Cohen’s d between Republicans and Democrat on the measurement (d = 2.31, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, we show that, as before, there is no significant correlation between general leftism and age when having a child in fathers, suggesting this result is not due to older fathers being more leftist.",

In spite of the dire consequences of allowing inequality persist unabated, efforts to mitigate inequality via redistribution typically fail, often because economically disadvantaged people oppose the very redistributive policies which would improve their lives. This counterintuitive finding has posed challenges to existing theories of human behavior, leading many to speculate that it is fairness, not material interest, which underlies redistributive choice. In the current study, we propose a novel experimental paradigm to assess how both fairness and self-interest impact redistributive choice. In an online sample of 231 participants, we demonstrate that the choice of redistributive tax rate was impacted by both factors. However, employing a computational modeling approach, we also find evidence that strategic norms underlie redistributive choice, both in choices observed in the laboratory and the policy views that participants hold.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the interplay between cognitive tasks and physical performance has drawn increasing attention, with research suggesting that engaging in cognitive effort prior to exercise can impair subsequent physical performance due to heightened mental fatigue. However, recent studies have cast doubts on the robustness of this effect, prompting for a reassessment of the mechanisms underlying cognitive fatigue and its impact on physical performance. In this study, we present a novel approach aimed at addressing methodological limitations in prior research, with a focus on individualizing cognitive task difficulty and duration. By integrating innovative techniques such as Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) and psychophysiological monitoring, we sought to unravel the complex dynamics between cognitive engagement, subjective states, and physical performance. In a pre-registered (https://osf.io/8rkxq/), randomized, within-participant design experiment, 21 recreational athletes completed a running task to failure test at 90% of their maximal aerobic speed after performing a cognitive task until failure or watching a self-selected documentary (control). Six different subjective dimensions were recorded with the TET and pupillometry was recorded during cognitive task performance. The key findings of this study were: 1) subjective changes during effortful tasks are not limited to a single experience, such as mental fatigue or boredom, but can be grouped into distinct patterns; 2) despite the individualized and demanding cognitive tasks, completing them before exercise did not impair subsequent physical performance; 3) pupil size reliably reflected cognitive task performance until failure and partially reflected changes in subjective states, while fixation on the stimulus decreased over time, especially during high-demand periods. These results provide a new approach for understanding physical and behavioral responses, with implications for psychology and sports science.",

The purpose of this study was to identify epigenetic predictors of early childhood attention problems among children born very preterm and to examine the joint role of epigenetic and environmental factors in predicting attention problems in this population. We studied 242 participants from a multi-site study of infants born less than 30 weeks gestational age. Neonatal buccal swabs were assayed for DNA methylation levels at over 450,000 CpG sites and age acceleration metrics were calculated using existing epigenetic clocks. A composite of postnatal environmental adversity was calculated using maternal reported risk factors. Attention problems were assessed in early childhood (mean age 6.58 years) using the Conner’s Kiddie Continuous Performance Test 2nd Edition. After adjustment for multiple testing, we found that DNA methylation of 9 CpG sites was associated with childhood attention problems. Several CpGs were located in genes previously linked to neurodevelopmental traits and inflammation in prior epigenome-wide and genome-wide association studies. Greater environmental adversity was also associated with increased attention problems. When tested together, DNA methylation and environmental adversity independently predicted attention problems. This study is the first to show associations between DNA methylation, environmental adversity, and objectively measured attention problems in school-age children born very preterm. These results could shed light on the etiology of attention problems in this population and may help us identify at birth preterm children at highest risk for later ADHD diagnosis.",

In the proposed study, we aim to assess the efficacy of a second-generation mindfulness intervention (SG-MBI) on spiritual distress, spiritual decline, and spiritual growth in women with advanced cancer. A secondary aim is to examine the impact of the intervention on psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, loneliness, nonattachment to self, and self-transcendent states. A third aim is to explore any benefit of nature immersion on intervention outcomes.  \n\nMethod: This study will utilize a three-arm RCT with wait-list control design. A total of 198 women will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (treatment indoors/outdoors) or wait-list control group. Participants in the 8-week intervention groups will be introduced to Buddhist-derived wisdom practices that draw upon the sublime attitudes or abodes (Sanskrit: brahmavihārā): compassion (Sanskrit: karuṇā), loving kindness (Sanskrit: maitrī), appreciative joy (muditā), and equanimity (Sanskrit: upekṣā). Assessments will be conducted at three time points: before random allocation and post-intervention at 8 weeks and 20 weeks. \n\nProposed Analytic Plan: Linear mixed models will be used for intention-to-treat (ITT) primary analyses. Per-protocol (PP), subgroup, and secondary outcome analyses will also be conducted. Results will provide critical information about the utility of SG-MBIs for meeting the spiritual and psychological needs of women with advanced cancer.",

Such effects occur both in visual crowding and in Flanker Compatibility Effects (FCE). Whereas crowding is a visual phenomenon that reflects a breakdown of object recognition in clutter, the FCE in the Eriksen flanker task is thought to be due to conflict during decision-making. In two experiments we investigated if and how these two seemingly independent phenomena are related. We employed an orientation categorisation task that allowed us to concurrently quantify crowding and FCEs. Specifically, we examined whether the spatial arrangement of stimuli affects the FCE in a similar way as in crowding. Interestingly, even when flankers were outside the crowding range, larger FCEs were observed for radially placed flankers compared to tangentially placed ones and for two compared to one flanker, corresponding to established patterns in crowding. However, inner flankers produced larger FCEs than outer flankers - the opposite of what is observed in crowding. In Experiment 2, we further investigated this reversed inner-outer asymmetry while manipulating the magnitude of crowding through varying target-flanker spacings. As expected, the outer flankers produced stronger crowding than inner ones. Crucially, the inner flankers produced a larger reaction time FCE and this inner-flanker interference was highest at the largest spacing. These findings demonstrate that the spatial layout of visual stimuli modulates conflict at both visual and decision-making stages, but the opposite patterns of the inner-outer asymmetry in the two phenomena provide a clear demarcation between the processes underlying them.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can represent information about multiple objects in the form of ensemble statistics, such as their mean feature. Although ensemble representation is often considered a strategy to deal with attentional capacity limitations, it is under debate whether it requires attention. We investigated this question using two ERP markers, the P3 which is evoked by change detection of attended stimuli, and visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) which is elicited by automatic sensory discrimination under attention diverted from the critical stimulus. In Experiment 1 (attended ensemble changes), observers attended to ensembles and reported rare changes of their mean orientation, while fixating on a central cross. In Experiment 2 (unattended ensemble changes), participants attended to changes in a central cross and ignored the background ensemble stimuli which also sporadically changed mean orientation. When ensembles were attended, changes in their mean evoked the P3 component, a marker of conscious change detection. When the same ensembles were unattended, no evidence for the vMMN, a marker of automatic discrimination, to ensemble mean changes was found. These results let us suggest that attention is critical for ensemble discrimination.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows that selective attention can be strategically directed to prioritize items of higher ‘value’ in working memory. This work has typically been limited to tests of feature binding using simple ‘unitized’ colored shapes as memoranda. The current study explored whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiments 2a and 2b). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2a and 2b found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across these experiments, there was no evidence for interaction between binding condition and prioritization; participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space or modality. The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, and suggest that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of material.",

In this paper I explain why Johnston (1991) cannot explain the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’. Indeed, Johnston (1991) makes predictions that are the exact opposite of those observed in the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’. I also highlight a key concern with Johnston (1991)’s account that has so far been overlooked. Johnston (1991)’s account predicts that vergence eye movements will cause massive stereo distortions, leading to a world of unstable stereo perception.

Yet, theoretical models of EF and tasks used to measure them were developed mainly for highly educated young adults from developed countries. Here we assessed EFs in a diverse cohort from a rural town in Brazil (Baependi Heart Study: N=1253; 753 females), in which age (18-88 year) and schooling (0-23 years) varied widely. Based on a popular theoretical model of EF (the unity diversity EF framework), which describes the pattern of inter-associations of three specific types of EFs (inhibitions, shifting and updating), we developed a short, nonautomated, open-access EF test battery adapted for use in samples with varying schooling and age that included EF indicators obtained from three tasks (Plus-Minus, Trail Making and Random Number Generation tasks). Using Confirmatory Factor Analyses we found a good fitting three-correlated factor solution confirming the fractionation and inter-association of the three EF domains that was invariant (except for one of eight indicators) to age, schooling and sex. More years of schooling was related to higher latent traits in all domains, older age to worse shifting and women scored lower in latent shifting and inhibition. We conclude that the unity-diversity EF framework can be determined across adulthood in diverse samples with tasks adapted for these populations, allowing the theory-oriented investigation of sociocultural and demographic factors that influence EFs.",

The study included a large naturalistic sample of 1159 patients, randomized to BC vs. routine psychotherapy PT.\nResults: Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find differences between BC and PT in outcomes, including anxiety, depression, satisfaction with life, level of functioning, therapist-rated severity / changes, and satisfaction with treatment at 6-months post-randomization.

There is emerging evidence that executive function is associated with mental health. However, less is known about a) everyday inhibitory control difficulties among autistic adults; b) the influence of sex assigned at birth and co-occurring attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) features on inhibitory control challenges; and c) relations between inhibitory control challenges and anxiety symptoms.\n\nMethods\nDrawing upon data from 732 autistic adults aged 18-83, this study examined self-reported inhibitory control in autistic adults and the influence of assigned sex and suspected co-occurring ADHD on the degree of inhibitory control challenges experienced. In addition, this research examined relations between inhibitory control challenges and anxiety symptoms, and the moderating role of assigned sex and suspected ADHD status in this relationship.\n\nResults\nAutistic adults endorsed significantly more challenges in inhibitory control relative to published norms. Participants assigned female at birth reported more difficulties in inhibitory control relative to sex-adjusted normative expectations than participants assigned male, and participants suspected to have co-occurring ADHD reported more inhibitory control challenges than those not suspected to have ADHD. Greater endorsement of inhibitory control challenges was associated with greater anxiety symptomatology; this relationship was moderated by suspected ADHD status, but not by assigned sex.\n\nConclusion\nInhibitory control is an area of difficulty in this group and is associated with anxiety symptomatology, suggesting that inhibitory control may be a valuable intervention target to improve emotional well-being in autistic adults.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been increasing observational research into the impacts of arts and cultural engagement on health, drawing on the surprisingly rich phenotyping of these behaviours in observational studies. This, alongside a broader growing evidence base, has led to recent calls from the World Health Organisation for the arts to be formally recognised as a health behaviour. However, access to the arts is not equitable, so a key challenge in observational research is disentangling any causal effects from this social gradient in engagement. In this paper, we consider five of the key methodological challenges in epidemiological research on arts and health and propose solutions by combining causal inference approaches with a new theoretical framework on the determinants of arts and cultural engagement (RADIANCE), which uses a socio-ecological approach to identify multi-level factors influencing patterns of arts behaviours. We end with recommendations for researchers incorporating questions on arts and cultural engagement within the design of longitudinal cohort studies.",

But there is a full process by which money, the desire we feel for it, and even how we end up trading it, can emerge naturally from the dynamics of natural selection and human interaction, with a basis in real value, and happening repeatedly and reliably, even if a group of people all agree that money or precious metals are worthless.

Others have said that the value of money depends on the way it facilitates trade, but even that doesn't explain where the value emerges before people agree to use money to trade. In actuality, there's a real value to gold, silver, and other forms of money that makes them reliably gain worth to people, and will emerge eventually even if everyone in a society does not like or believe in those precious metals or possessions. This is because possessing scarce objects has real reputational value among people, since having those objects indicates that we can go outside the known territory, and we instinctively collect and want things that have known scarcity. When that scarcity combines with other traits like transferability, durability and so on, we can see that money naturally emerges in society. We can use this idea to also see the real value and desire that people have for new forms of money like cryptocurrencies, and to know what will or won't emerge and last as a form of money in the future.",

          "abstract": "Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to changes in healthcare. Government and regulatory bodies have advocated the need for transparency in AI systems with recommendations to provide users with more details about AI accuracy and how AI systems work. However, increased transparency could lead to negative outcomes if humans become over-reliant on the technology. This study investigated how changes in AI transparency affected human decision making in a medical screening visual search task. Transparency was manipulated by either giving or withholding knowledge about the accuracy of an ‘AI system’. We tested performance in seven simulated lab mammography tasks, in which observers searched for a cancer which could be correctly or incorrectly flagged by Computer Aided Detection (CAD) ‘AI prompts’. Across tasks the CAD systems varied in accuracy. In the ‘Transparent’ conditions participants were told the accuracy of the CAD system, in the ‘Not Transparent’ they were not. The results showed that increasing CAD transparency impaired task performance producing an increase in false alarms, decreased sensitivity, an increase in Recall Rate and a decrease in Positive Predictive Value. Along with increasing investment in AI this research shows that it is important to investigate how transparency of AI systems affect human decision making. Increased transparency may lead to over-trust in AI systems, which can impact clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

In this paper, we formalize the concept of multilevel fairness for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects to improve fairness in optimal policies. Specifically, we propose a general framework for the estimation of conditional average treatment effects under multilevel fairness constraints that incorporate individual-level sensitive variables, cluster-level sensitive variables, and their combinations. Using this framework, we analyze the trade-off between fairness and the maximum achievable utility by the optimal policy. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework through a simulation study and a real data study on advanced math courses using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009.",

          "abstract": "Weber’s Law states that the ability to distinguish different stimuli depends on the relative magnitudes of those stimuli. When applied to quantity judgments, this means that the numerical ratio between two quantities (small amount / large amount) will underlie the ability to distinguish the quantities. Ratio-dependent quantification is a hallmark of Weber’s Law that has been demonstrated across a range of species, including dogs. However, other factors such as numerical difference (large amount - small amount) are confounded with ratio but would not support Weber’s Law. Most work on dog quantification abilities has only considered ratio and not difference. Here, we offer dogs a food quantity preference task where we varied both difference and ratio in quantity pairs to investigate which of these factors influences preferences. To address this, dogs could choose to eat one of two plates of food with different quantities of treats on them. We found that, when analyzed separately, both difference and ratio predicted whether the dogs chose the larger quantity of treats. However, when analyzed together, only difference predicted choice when controlling for ratio. This finding does not support the ratio-dependence required for Weber’s Law, raising questions about its importance for quantity preference tasks in dogs.",

We first review aspects of pain-related decisions and the circuits that support different aspects of pain. We then discuss the common neural pathways that support pain and reward, as well as evidence of their interactions. Next, we introduce how pain might be viewed from a neuroeconomic perspective, focusing on the value of pain. Finally, we address hypotheses and outstanding questions for those at the intersection of pain and neuroeconomics.

          "abstract": "Spacing, distributing practice over time rather than in a single session, often benefits long-term memory of simple material. However, it is less clear whether spacing is effective for more complex material. As more educators harness the spacing effect, it is important to know under what conditions it is most effective. We investigated the impact of procedural complexity on the efficacy of spacing, by varying the number of steps in arithmetic procedures. Participants were taught two procedures, either in a single session (massed) or over three sessions spanning three consecutive days (spaced). Experiment one compared learning a two-step with a three-step procedure. Spaced practice led to significantly higher performance, relative to massed practice, with no evidence for a difference in the spacing effect as a function of procedural complexity. However, there was also no evidence for a difference in performance between the two procedures, suggesting the three-step procedure was not sufficiently more complex than the two-step procedure. Experiment two compared learning a two-step with a five-step procedure. We again saw a significant spacing effect, as well a main effect of complexity, with performance in the five-step procedure being significantly lower than the two-step procedure. As in Experiment one, we found no evidence for an interaction between procedural complexity and the spacing effect. Our results show that spacing benefits the learning of arithmetic procedures. Critically, we also show that the spacing effect is not negatively impacted by the procedural complexity of the procedure learnt.",

Methods: Based on 4583 participants who completed three waves of data in a large-scale national survey from 2008 to 2018, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models  were used to examine the concurrent and cross-lagged relationships between each of the three constructs (PA, Purpose, and LS) and the two cognitive domains (recall memory and retrieval fluency) across the three time points adjusting depression. Results: PA and Purpose had significant reciprocal, within-person associations with memory and retrieval fluency. Random intercepts were significantly correlated, indicating that older adults with higher PA and Purpose typically had better recall memory and retrieval fluency. Conclusion: PA and Purpose had positive feedback loops with recall memory and retrieval fluency.

          "abstract": "As an exploration of machine learning strategies applied to behavior analytic investigations, we sought to predict the likelihood that particular children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) would develop echoic verbal behavior. After retrieving 143 case records of children assessed with the VB-MAPP from a data repository, we reserved 22 case records for holdout analysis. Through iterative development, the model achieved 100% accuracy in predicting the presence or absence of an echoic repertoire. While the functional value of predicting a known outcome might be questioned, it is only possible to gauge the accuracy of any prediction technique when known outcomes are available. Thus, rather than trying to predict a completely unknown outcome, our experimental preparations were directed at gauging the multilayer perceptron’s (MLP) ability to predict at high levels of precision, sensitivity, specificity, and overall prediction accuracy while accessing a limited dataset from one children’s healthcare setting. We discuss procedures for employing this machine learning strategy in conjunction with a receiver operator characteristics analysis of our findings. We developed this study as a general guide for using one of several quickly evolving neural network methodologies for behavior analytic researchers, and we examine specifics regarding MLP functions and operations as they relate to providing more efficacious treatment for children with ASD.",

          "abstract": "Do  we  preferentially  learn  from  positive  rather  than  negative  decision  outcomes? Previous  studies  indicated  that  such  bias  characterises  learning  during  simple  reward learning  tasks.  However,  no  research  has  yet  confirmed  whether  learning  bias  is  also present  during  sequential  decision  making  under  uncertainty.  To  fill  this  gap,  we utilised  a  complex  yet  ecologically  valid  paradigm,  the  Balloon  Analogue  Risk  Task (BART),  which  measures  risk-taking  propensity  under  uncertainty  in  everyday  decision making.  Comparing  learning  from  positive  and  negative  outcomes  in  the  BART  has been  made  possible  by  the  Scaled  Target  Learning  model,  which  characterises  both risk-taking  propensity  and  sensitivity  to  wins  and  losses.  For  the  first  time,  we  applied this  model  to  a  modified  BART  paradigm  with  different  levels  of  perceived uncertainty.  Crucially,  our  analyses  revealed  learning  bias  during  high  levels  of uncertainty,  under  which  condition  bias  was  negatively  tied  to  task  performance. Furthermore,  increased  sensitivity  to  wins  compared  to  losses  was  linked  to  more risk-seeking  behaviour  across  all  conditions,  suggesting  that  learning  bias  could mediate  risky  behaviour.  Overall,  our  results  contribute  to  a  more  accurate characterisation  of  reward  learning  behaviour  and  suggest  that  learning  bias  arises when the level of perceived uncertainty surges.",

This report analyzes pay and benefit trends among farmed animal organizations and how they compare with nonprofits in other cause areas. It also examines whether pay gaps exist between marginalized and non-marginalized individuals in the farmed animal advocacy movement, given that such pay gaps are common across many sectors. By surveying nonprofit organizations and collecting salary data from public job boards, we provide benchmarks, recommendations, and tools in order to help strengthen this rapidly growing movement. This study makes clear that, by addressing pay inequities and developing a purposeful approach to pay and benefits, organizations can create a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged work environment where staff within the movement feel more supported and rewarded.",

          "abstract": "Pain states fluctuate over time, and across situations. Similarly, there is variation in risk and protective factors and how they impact on these pain-related transitions. We are interested in whether such variations are more than random, and whether they can be accounted for by observed variables. The availability of large longitudinal datasets, such as UK Biobank (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), offers a unique opportunity to study these variations at scale. However, such datasets bring a high risk of bias (e.g. confounding) and danger of over-interpretation. It is therefore important to be transparent about our causal thinking. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are graphical representations of the hypothesized causal relationships between variables. They are used to identify the smallest set of variables that need to be adjusted for to remove confounding bias in estimating the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. However, use of DAGs in pain research is not common, despite their potential to guide study design and data-analysis. In this paper we present a workflow for building a DAG using domain knowledge from three different sources: researchers, people with lived experience, and the literature. We created a DAG for the putative effect of executive function on the maintenance of chronic high impact pain. The resulting DAG provides a valuable framework for guiding future research on the role of executive functioning in pain and it underscores the broader potential of using DAGs to improve causal inference in pain research.",

          "abstract": "The peak shift effect in generalization, a robust phenomenon where the maximal response occurs to stimuli shifted away from the conditioned stimulus in the direction opposite the inhibitory stimulus, has been predominantly attributed to associative learning. However, recent findings point to biases in stimulus representation as an alternative mechanism. Our research, comprising two experiments (Experiment 1: N = 76; Experiment 2: N = 234), investigated whether the peak shift effect could emerge from a stimulus contrast effect, independent of associative learning. By comparing stimulus identification patterns between simple and differential conditioning groups both after stimulus exposure and following associative learning, we found that shifts in the identification of conditioned stimuli were primarily driven by a stimulus contrast effect, rather than associative learning per se. This representational shift was closely associated with the peak shift phenomenon observed in post-learning generalization patterns, with identification errors strongly impacting generalized responding. These results underscore the importance of considering stimulus representations as an independent process in understanding learning-based behavior, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying generalization phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Statistical models are becoming increasingly complex with more parameters to explain complex dependency structures among larger sets of variables. Regularization techniques (such as penalized regression) are ideal to identify the most important parameters by shrinking negligible effects to zero. The resulting regularized solutions are parsimonious and often show good predictive performance. Currently however regularization techniques have mainly been developed for standard modeling designs even though regularization techniques are also very useful for more complex modeling designs. Moreover, even though Bayesian regularization algorithms are competitive (and sometimes superior) to their classical counterpart, classical regularization techniques (such as the lasso) are still most common in applied research. To address these shortcomings, the current paper presents a fast and flexible approximate Bayesian regularization procedure. A Gaussian approximation is used for the integrated likelihood of the (large) set of parameters which is then combined with a Bayesian shrinkage prior to obtain a parsimonious solution with many (approximately) zero estimates. The method is implemented in the R package ‘shrinkem’. The general applicability of the methodology is illustrated in various applications including linear regression models, relational event models, mediation models, factor analytic models, and Gaussian graphical models.",

In this paper, we present a com- putational neurophenomenological account of minimal phenomenal experience within the active inference framework. We propose a generative mechanism that allows active inference agents to leverage capacities akin to those in generative adversarial networks, which use a dual framework of data generation and discrim- ination to improve perceptual accuracy. Our hypothesis posits that the brain continuously generates synthetic data to fill perceptual and cognitive gaps, and we provide a computational mechanism within the active inference framework to support this. We explore how synthetic data generation, when amplified by meditation, psychedelics, or other altered states, can the brain to ‘defabricate’ entrenched conceptual structures and approach pure consciousness. We provide simulations of an active inference agent embedded in a virtual environment, we demonstrate that recursive loops of synthetic data generation can lead to a breakdown in conceptualization — ’seeing as’ — while enhancing the system’s ability to predict its own observation stream. We argue that this model can characterize the essential features of MPE, including contentlessness, epistemic openness, and the unique valence profile associated with minimal phenomenal experiences.",

          "abstract": "To synthesize evidence on the relations among multiple constructs, measures, or concepts, meta-analyzing correlation matrices across primary studies has become a crucial analytic approach. Common meta-analytic approaches employ univariate or multivariate models to estimate a pooled correlation matrix, which is subjected to further analyses, such as structural equation or network modeling. In practice, meta-analysts often extract multiple correlation matrices per study from multiple samples, study sites, labs, or countries, thus introducing hierarchical effect size multiplicity into the meta-analytic data. However, this feature has largely been ignored when pooling correlation matrices for meta-analysis. To contribute to the methodological development in this area, we describe a multilevel, multivariate, and random-effects modeling (MLMV-REM) approach, which pools correlation matrices meta-analytically and, at the same time, addresses hierarchical effect size multiplicity. Specifically, it allows meta-analysts to test various assumptions on the dependencies among random effects, aiding the selection of a meta-analytic baseline model. We describe this approach, present four working models within it, and illustrative them with an example and the corresponding R code.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experiences (MPEs) represent states of consciousness reduced to their most fundamental elements, posing a unique challenge and opportunity for modeling consciousness. This paper introduces a novel computational framework based on Bayesian and active inference to model MPEs. We propose that MPEs arise when precision weighting shifts predominantly to the lower levels of a hierarchical inferential system, leading to a perceptual state characterized by increased entropy and reduced complexity. Crucially, awareness of this simplified state is main- tained through epistemic depth: The reflexive sharing of the organism’s reality model with itself. Therefore, although the contents of consciousness are exceptionally quiet, a reflexive knowing of the empty field of experience remains. We then propose an in silico simulation to test the relation- ship between precision distribution and entropy, outlining how this model could generate synthetic EEG data to empirically validate the theoretical framework. By advancing our understanding of pure awareness through this computational approach, we provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying various altered states of consciousness, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the full spectrum of conscious experience.",

Whereas classic studies investigated the evolution of organization across lists within the short-time span of a single session, here we ask how memory changes over many days.  Specifically, we examine how semantic, temporal, and subjective organization during a recall period shapes memory after days of intervening cognitive activity. Analyzing data from two multi-session free recall experiments, we find that subjects demonstrate a strong tendency to cluster recalls based on previous output order, with this effect strengthening across sessions. In line with the idea that thoughts become memories, we show that even false memories produced on a given session tend to re-occur on subsequent days. Our results attest to the crucial role that retrieval plays in shaping long-term episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Undergraduate students report a high level of trait anxiety, which is a risk factor for further psychological decline if unmanaged. Common psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy are highly effective in improving symptoms of anxiety for those who are motivated to engage in psychotherapy, but they can be costly. Music-based interventions are cost-effective and have been found to improve indices of anxiety, specifically lower self-reported distress, reduced cortisol, and higher heart rate variability. More recently, music with auditory beat stimulation (ABS) has been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety to a greater extent than music alone. While there is limited empirical evidence, music interventions with ABS may also be effective at targeting neurophysiological markers of anxiety.  In this exploratory trial, fifty undergraduate students will be randomized to participate in a single session of music with ABS or pink noise. They will be asked to complete measures of self-reported anxiety. In addition, they will be asked to provide saliva samples (salivary cortisol), and wear electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes on the wrist (heart rate variability) and an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap (frequency band power measures of anxiety). It is hypothesized that those assigned to the music with ABS condition will experience a reduction in subjective and physiological indices of anxiety. A secondary exploratory aim of this research will be to test potential neurophysiological mechanisms of actions, including neural entrainment and differences in HRV and frequency band power, that may clarify the effect of music with ABS on anxiety.",

The PBACE is a self-report measure comprising seven subscales: Value of Anger, Cost of Positivity, Control, Parental Knowledge, Manipulation, Stability, and Autonomy. The psychometric properties of the PBACE, including reliability, content, convergent, and construct validity, and dimensionality, were assessed in a sample of 397 parents of children aged 5-11 years. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the factor structure of seven models and a general seven-correlated model, which showed good model fit for the PBACE and its subscales, except for the Parental Knowledge subscale. The poor fit of the Parental Knowledge subscale led to testing a six-correlated model without it, which demonstrated superior model fit compared to the seven-correlated model. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) indicated good content validity for the scale. Additionally, significant associations with children's emotion regulation established satisfactory convergent validity. Internal consistency, measured by the Omega coefficient, was acceptable for all subscales except Parental Knowledge, while the PBACE overall demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Findings from the bifactor model indicated that the measure could be considered unidimensional with some multidimensional features. Although the poor fit and lower Omega coefficient for the Parental Knowledge subscale suggest that it should not be used, the PBACE is recommended for research and clinical purposes in Iran due to its sound psychometric properties.",

          "abstract": "Michotte (1946/1954/1963) showed that visual impressions of causality can occur in perception of simple animations of moving geometrical objects. In the launching effect, one object is perceived as making another object move by bumping into it. In the entraining effect, the two objects move together after contact and the first moving object is perceived as pushing or carrying the other one. There has been much further research on the launching effect in particular, and citations of Michotte's pioneering work have increased rapidly in recent decades, underlining its importance in contemporary psychology and neuroscience. However, many of the experiments reported Michotte's book, exploring conditions under which launching and entraining do and do not occur, have never been replicated. The methodology, involving mostly a few knowledgeable observers and no statistical analysis, indicates that replication and extension would be desirable, to assess the reliability of the results reported by Michotte and to inspire further research on aspects of these perceptual impressions that have been neglected in more recent research. In this pre-registered replication study, fourteen experiments are reported that replicate and, in some cases, extend experiments reported by Michotte (1946/1954/1963). Some findings reported by Michotte were replicated, others only partly so, and in other cases results were different from what Michotte reported. Extensions to Michotte's experiments revealed numerous new findings and open up prospects for much more innovative research. The results also have significant implications for possible explanations for perceptual impressions of causality.",

Common tests of MI are not suitable for many groups and cannot be used during the development of measurement models. In addition, popular network-based alternatives to latent variable modeling lack established methods for MI testing. Therefore, we propose Exploratory Graph Analysis Trees (EGA trees) that apply the idea of model-based recursive partitioning to correlation matrices and combine it with EGA - which can be used instead of exploratory factor analysis. In a simulation study, we test the approach regarding its ability to detect configural or metric non-invariance in common factor models given numerous covariates and illustrate its usefulness in conditions with severe violations of configural invaraince based on diverging numbers of factors. The results demonstrate that EGA trees can be a valuable tool for the exploration of MI when constructing scales and working on measurement models.

Therefore, pathogen detection mechanisms arguably categorize a broad array of atypical features as indicative of infection, which gives rise to negative affect toward people with atypical features. We will test a key hypothesis derived from this explanation: specific appearance-based prejudices are associated with tendencies to make false alarms when estimating the presence of infectious disease. While this hypothesis is implicit in much work on the behavioral immune system and prejudice, direct tests of it are lacking and existing relevant work contains important limitations.

          "authors": "Merethe Blandhol; Seoyoung Lee; Dan-Mikael Ellingsen",
          "abstract": "Living with pain that persists over months or years can take a significant toll and requires the use of different strategies to manage the pain in everyday life. Yet how individuals cope with chronic pain and why some people show better functional outcomes is not clearly understood. Previous literature on coping has often focused on describing different coping strategies and their comparative effectiveness, often with the assumption that some are overall less adaptive than others. Existing theoretical models of coping often lack descriptions of how factors unfold over time and often assume relationships between factors remain stable. However, pain coping is not only influenced by continuously changing internal and external contextual factors, but by changing interactions as the process repeats over time. Moreover, the short- and long-term efficacy of different coping approaches depends on individual appraisal of the momentary coping process. In this review, we first systematically synthesise previously published theoretical frameworks that have conceptualised the coping process in health- related stress and pain. Then, we present the ‘Dynamic Interaction Model of Coping in Chronic Pain’ outlining how five central factors: 1) controllability, 2) predictability, 3) pain salience, 4) personal resources, and 5) motivation, interact in a dynamic coping process in chronic pain. The model outlines putative pathways of moment-to-moment and long-term adaptations to pain, and potential targets for intervention are discussed.",

          "authors": "Damian M. Manzone; Xiaoye Michael Wang; Sameeha Jafri; Joseph X. Manzone; Timothy N. Welsh; Luc Tremblay",
          "abstract": "Performing movements in simulated environments (e.g., virtual reality) can be advantageous in training scenarios and when experimentally separating visual and proprioceptive limb representations. However, compared to real physical environments, virtual environments differ in how the limb is represented (e.g., animated hand or cursor) and in the timing of the visual feedback (i.e., latency in rendering the tracked movement). Thus, the current study sought to explore the influence of both representation differences and additional visual feedback delays on sensorimotor control when moving in a virtual reality environment. Participants performed aiming movements in an environment in which they had vision of a cursor representing their index finger or vision of their actual upper-limb. Further, vision was available either only prior to movement onset (i.e., feedforward) or throughout the movement (i.e., online guidance). In the feedforward condition, only representation differences were present between effectors. In the online guidance condition, however, there was an additional feedback delay when aiming with the cursor (at least ~17 ms). Performance was quantified using efficiency (bits/second) calculated using amplitude, effective target width, and movement time. Movements were less efficient when aiming with vision of the cursor compared to vision of the upper-limb in both the feedforward and online guidance conditions. Further, the magnitude of the cursor-limb efficiency difference was larger in the online guidance condition compared to the feedforward condition. Overall, the results suggest that differences in representation and visual feedback delays can combine to produce less efficient movements when aiming in virtual compared to real environments.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Perinatal mental disorders are common, yet few robust risk factors are known. Stressful life events such as loss of a close family member due to death could serve as potential clinical predictors for which mothers develop perinatal mental disorders.  \n\nObjective: To examine the association between bereavement and the risk of first-onset perinatal mental disorders.\n\nDesign: Nationwide register-based study.\n\nSetting:  Swedish population and healthcare registers. \n\nParticipants: Pregnant women who gave a birth during 2001-2021 with follow-up from conception up to a year after pregnancy\n\nExposure: Death of a family member (sibling, parent, partner or child) occurring any time before pregnancy and during the perinatal period, treated as a time-varying variable. \n\nMain Outcome and Measures: First-onset mental disorders diagnosed during the pregnancy and the year after birth were identified from registers. Hazard ratios (HRs) for any mental disorder and specific disorders were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.\n  \nResults:  The study included 1,986,490 pregnancies in Sweden (1,097,126 mothers, mean age at conception [standard deviation] = 31.1 [5.0]). In total 276,252 (13.9%) mothers were exposed to family loss. Loss of a family member at any time before or during the perinatal period was associated with an increased risk of any perinatal mental disorder (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% confidence intervals: 1.44 [1.41, 1.48]), particularly if the loss occurred during the perinatal period (HR [95% CI]: 5.86 [5.62, 6.12]). Loss of a spouse and child yielded higher HRs, compared loss of a parent or a sibling. The strongest associations were observed for postpartum mental disorders in relation to stillbirth (HR [95% CI]: 25.97 [24.60, 27.42]) or multiple losses during the perinatal period (HR [95% CI]: 16.92 [13.72, 20.86]). Family loss during the perinatal period was most strongly associated with stress-related disorders (HR [95% CI]: 16.90 [16.10, 17.75]), but also with depressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Loss of a family member was associated with increased risks of first-onset perinatal mental disorders, particularly if the loss occurred during the perinatal period. Bereaved women may benefit from enhanced monitoring and screening for mental disorders during the perinatal period.",

          "abstract": "The current pair of highly-powered, preregistered studies estimate the associations between personality/temperament and youth psychopathology, and evaluate the generalizability of these associations across diverse populations and research designs. \nIn Study 1, a multilevel meta-analysis of 147 studies (N = 46,369) quantified the associations between Five-Factor Model personality traits and internalizing/externalizing psychopathology dimensions among subjects aged 1.5 to 18. All traits but openness evidenced small-to-medium bivariate associations with both psychopathology dimensions (z = |.18 - .46|). After adjusting for the covariance between internalizing and externalizing, each dimension showed a distinct personality profile. Internalizing was associated with neuroticism (β = .42) and negative-extraversion (β = -.37). Externalizing was associated with extraversion (β = .30), negative-conscientiousness (β = -.46), and negative-agreeableness (β = -.50). Most variance was driven by informant effects, particularly within the externalizing dimension and when personality and psychopathology were informed by the same person (i.e., mono-informant). \nStudy 2 was a preregistered replication and extension of Study 1 in a large cohort of youth (N = 10,414) using individual-participant, item-level data. Most of Study 1’s associations were replicated for higher-order scales (e.g., Effortful Control) and for their lower-order scales (e.g., Activation Control). Again, mono-informant effects were more pronounced than cross-informant effects. \nTaken together, these studies provide the first quantitative synthesis of associations between personality/temperament and psychopathology in youth. These preregistered quantitative findings are largely consistent with decades of theory (e.g., Tackett, 2006), evidence a robustness of effects across populations, and highlight the impact of mono-informant effects.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a method for identifying minimally sufficient neurocognitive mechanisms of selfhood. It focuses on extracting context-independent mechanisms from computational models and neuroimaging data of states with disrupted self-specifying processing. A proof-of-concept is demonstrated using active inference models of meditative non-dual awareness and psychedelic ego-dissolution. The resulting predictions suggest that the hierarchical nature of neural systems may be a core mechanism for generating selfhood. The hypothesis posits that flattening the hierarchy in a system allows one to experience qualia without the psychological sense that they are given to a subject. This hypothesis is then implemented in a current computational model of selfhood (Reichle &amp; Boag, 2024). The paper provides two insights: (1) how to deduce core mechanisms of selfhood, and (2) specific guidance on which parameters to modify in computational models of consciousness or selfhood to simulate selflessness.",

          "authors": "Yuning Liu; Matt Motta; Amanda Yarnell",
          "abstract": "Background: Social media platforms like TikTok are pivotal for mental health communication (MHC), providing accessible, trusted content. Despite known benefits of creator training programs in improving content quality, it's uncertain if or how these enhancements affect people who watch that content. This study examines how training programs for TikTok creators influence TikTok users’ mental health knowledge construction and intended behaviors by analyzing user comments on TikTok videos.\n\nMethod: We employed LLM-assisted content analysis to annotate TikTok video comments for mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions. We then analyzed the impact of a creator training program on users' mental health knowledge construction through within-subject field experiments. Additionally, we extended this method to measure how TikTok's Mental Health Awareness Month (MHAM) in May 2023 affected user mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions.\n\nResults: LLM-assisted analysis showed that asynchronous toolkits significantly enhance mental health knowledge construction among video commenters, particularly among creators with high engagement, fewer followers, who are licensed mental health professionals, or  who do not offer paid coaching services. MHAM increased mental health knowledge construction among users, though the audiences of the 7 institutions and 10 content creators that were spotlighted by TikTok during MHAM did not show this effect.\n\nConclusions: Asynchronous toolkits improve mental health knowledge construction among video viewers. Future training should focus on emerging creators and separate toolkit learning from conference training to enhance training efficacy. In addition, promoting hashtags such as #MentalHealthAwareness can drive meaningful discussions and knowledge construction in video comments, but there is an opportunity for platforms to refine their creator selection criteria to improve on-platform mental health knowledge construction.",

Using an annotated dataset focused on fungi, particularly those classified as edible or non-edible, we implement a practical application that allows users to upload plant images. The LLM then identifies the species, determines its edibility, and provides detailed information on its characteristics. For edible species, the model offers culinary insights and preparation methods, while also delivering comprehensive educational content on plant ecology and cultural significance. Our approach showcases the ability of LLMs to bridge image recognition with rich, text-based knowledge, facilitating an interactive learning experience that promotes plant literacy and practical understanding. This study highlights the effectiveness of LLMs in educational tools and their potential to enhance public awareness of plant species, including fungi, through visual and contextual data fusion.",

          "abstract": "Given the global displacement crisis, the integration of refugees has emerged as a critical policy issue for many host countries. A key challenge involves supporting refugees in learning the language of their host country. While several European nations have instituted publicly funded language training for asylum seekers and refugees soon after their arrival, evidence on the efficacy of these early language programs in promoting economic integration remains limited. This study examines the impact of a pioneering, large-scale ad hoc program introduced by German policymakers, which provided basic language training to over 230,000 refugees arriving in 2015-16. Utilizing register data on the population of asylum seekers and exploiting a cutoff date in program eligibility, we assess the program's effectiveness using a regression discontinuity design. Our findings reveal no discernible effect on refugee employment over the subsequent two years. To explore whether language programs are generally ineffective during refugee crises, we contrast these results with the impacts of a more comprehensive, preexisting, yet smaller-scale program. Using a variety of difference-in-differences estimators, we find that this program considerably increased refugee employment. These contrasting findings offer important insights for policymakers on designing effective language training programs for refugees.",

The study is designed to answer this research question: Does participating in a youth philanthropy program foster positive outcomes for young people? Data are from a youth philanthropy program hosted within 12 community organizations in 7 US states. The program is two years in duration: youth participate as juniors and seniors in high school. Data were collected through surveys with graduating youth who had completed both years of the program (n=180). Findings indicate that the program “works” in fostering engagement in philanthropic activities, gaining prosocial orientations, and having rewarding program experiences. When available, youth outcomes from program participants are compared to national or global data on comparable measures to assess whether youth in this program appear to be participating in philanthropic activities at rates greater than average. Results show that youth participants are high on philanthropic activities and prosocial orientations, and their rates are 30-50% higher than comparable rates. Additionally, youth demonstrate positive growth in targeted philanthropic learning and skills, and youth participants gain a greater network of engaged peers and supportive mentors. The implication is that this youth philanthropy program is successful in fostering positive youth development.",

Our results contrast sharply with previous evidence from acceptance decisions showing bias in favor of Black applicants. We introduce a model of university pricing and use information from counselors' LinkedIn and university profiles, along with university characteristics, to test predictions. We find evidence consistent with agent-taste-based discrimination, where biases stem from counselors' preferences, and profit-maximizing statistical discrimination. Discrimination in university admissions can vary substantially based on the context in which decisions are made.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines whether kindergarten-level Urdu phonological processing predicts the future Grade 1 English word and non-word reading accuracy skills of Urdu-English bilinguals in (i) Pakistan, with an Urdu as a national/societal-language country context, and (ii) Canada, with an Urdu as a heritage-language country context. Method: At Timepoint 1 of this longitudinal study, we assessed 154 Urdu-English kindergarten-aged bilinguals in Pakistan (n = 104) and Canada (n = 50) on their Urdu phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills, via the Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment Tool (U-PASS). After 1 year at Timepoint 2, we tested their English word and non-word reading accuracy skills at the Grade 1 level. Result: Our hierarchical linear regressions consistently demonstrated cross-language transfer between Urdu phonological awareness and the English word and non-word reading accuracy measures in both Pakistan and Canada. Predictive strength differences were demonstrated between RAN and reading outcomes, based on country-specific contexts. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that languages learnt in both a societal or heritage context (i.e., Urdu) contribute to early reading skills in another language (i.e., English), thereby emphasizing the importance of overall cross-language knowledge at the early stages of learning to read. This study also emphasizes the role of cross-language transfer for facilitating equitable access to early assessment for bilingual populations: Urdu phonological processing skills can be used to identify bilingual children’s future English reading abilities, rather than waiting until the child demonstrates adequate English language proficiency for completing traditional English phonological processing assessments.",

This study critically examines disparities among prominent climate performance indices, including the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), and Climate Action Tracker (CAT). We reveal significant divergences in country rankings, particularly between ‘developed’ and ‘least developed’ nations, underscoring how methodological choices profoundly impact outcomes and interpretability. We develop an analytic tool, called EPI-equity, to demonstrate how integrating equity principles can substantially alter performance assessments. We propose a conceptual framework to classify indices based on the perspectives they embody, highlighting how these can shape the interpretation of performance. Our results suggest that the outcomes of environmental performance indices are more likely to concur when they represent similar perspectives. We propose that explicitly articulating the perspective implied by the formalism of performance indices can enhance transparency, guide developers in aligning methodological choices with intended interpretations, and equip users with a clearer understanding of the results. Our analysis highlights the importance of employing multiple indices that encompass a range of perspectives for a comprehensive evaluation of countries' environmental performance. Our adaptable framework provides a structured approach to guide the selection of indices ensuring that they span a broad spectrum of viewpoints. This method mitigates the likelihood of conflicts arising from fragmented worldviews on complex socio-environmental issues.",

          "abstract": "Workplace surveillance is a common occurrence in many traditional workplaces and excessive forms can lead to resistance efforts from employees. However, most of the literature on this topic has been focused on the traditional office worker. There is now a new evolutionary worker that goes against social norms by travelling around the world while working remotely, the Digital Nomad. Therefore, this article aims to incorporate Digital Nomads into workplace surveillance research. This resulted in the research question “How does the Digital Nomad lifestyle interact with workplace surveillance and resistance acts”. To answer this, 5 semi-structured interviews were conducted on Digital Nomads recruited from social media platforms. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic data analysis where 3 main themes were identified: Shift from Traditional Restraints, Perks of Elite Workers, Panopticon’s Future. Overall, Digital Nomads did not experience intensive surveillance and findings supported the idea that they are productive, elite workers, opting to work for employers that do not monitor their employees. It was also found that Digital Nomads take part in minor acts of resistance, but they were not actively resisting their employers. These results suggest the need for future researchers to further expand upon the status of the Digital Nomad worker and explore their experiences of workplace surveillance and resistance.",

Mothers' speech is likely a key driver of the transmission of family background inequality in education. Yet, long-term associations between mothers' speech and children's education-related outcomes beyond the early years have not been studied previously. Here, we quantified differences in mothers' vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity from 10-minute-long naturalistic speech samples audio-recorded when children were age 5 and starting formal education. Children completed measures of cognition at age 5 and measures of literacy at ages 7 and 10 years; teachers rated their educational achievement at ages 7, 10, and 12 years. Data came from E-Risk, a UK cohort study that recruited families with twins born in 1994 and 1995 who represented the full range of Britain's socioeconomic conditions (analytic sample N = 894 mother-child trios). Mothers' vocabulary sophistication significantly predicted children's cognition, literacy, and educational achievement between the ages of 5 and 12 years, accounting for 2% to 5% of the variance. These estimates were reduced to 1% and 2% or became altogether non-significant after adjusting for mothers' educational attainment and household income. Our findings suggest that mothers' speech plays a small independent role in the long-term transmission of family background inequality in education.",

The current work provides a synthesis of the intersection of aging, vision loss, and narrative engagement, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and sensory changes. We discuss how age and vision loss may modify critical components of story engagement, potentially altering narrative consumption and experience. Our research highlights the need to adapt research methodologies and measurement scales to suit older adults and auditory narratives, ensuring they capture unique aspects of auditory engagement and account for sensory impairments. We propose novel directions for studying narrative engagement and offer insights for future research to provide inclusive and accessible narrative forms that support the cognitive and emotional well-being of older adults.",

The study suggests that the Norse mythology in the video game Skyrim does not directly correlate with contemporary social conflicts. Instead, it suggests that socially relevant themes and ideologies may be attracted to different channels, such as less specific spaces. This aligns with the echo chamber model, where different themes correspond to different communicative and performative spaces. The Norse mythology serves as an open narrative infrastructure for the game's designers and players, supporting the construction of the possible world of the lore. However, the study does not show direct contamination effects on communities, suggesting that the lore may indirectly produce ideology on socially relevant issues.",

          "authors": "Garen J. Wintemute; Andrew Crawford; Elizabeth A. Tomsich; Veronica A. Pear",
          "abstract": "Background: In 2022, a nationally representative longitudinal survey in the USA found concerningly high prevalences of support for and personal willingness to engage in political violence, but those prevalences decreased in 2023. This study examines changes in those prevalences from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA.\n\nMethods: Participants were members of Ipsos KnowledgePanel. Wave 3 of the survey was conducted May 23-June 14, 2024; invitations to participate were sent to all respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions. Year-to-year change is based on the means of aggregated individual change scores, which have a potential range from 0 (no change) to ±2. \n\nResults: The 2024 completion rates were 88.4% (8896 respondents/10,064 invitees) overall, 91.6% (8185 respondents/8932 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2023, and 62.8% (711 respondents/1132 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2022 but not in 2023. After weighting, 50.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.5%, 52.3%) were female; weighted mean (SD) age was 48.5 (24.9) years. From 2023 to 2024, the prevalence of the view that violence was usually or always justified to advance at least 1 political objective did not change (2024: 26.2%, 95% CI 25.0%, 27.5%; 2023: 25.3%, 95% CI 24.1%, 26.5%). There were no changes from 2023 to 2024 in willingness to damage property, threaten a person, injure a person, or kill a person in an act of political violence, and no changes in expectations of firearm use in situations where respondents considered political violence justifiable. Changes on other measures were infrequent (17 of 58 comparisons in the main analysis) and small where they occurred (with 2 exceptions, change &lt; 0.05). \n\nConclusions: Contrary to expectation, support for and willingness to participate in political violence in this cohort showed little to no change from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA. These findings can help guide prevention efforts.",

          "authors": "Yuan Sui",
          "abstract": "Political science research increasingly relies on text classification to gauge subtle concepts like toxicity or anger. However, common methods treat words and phrases in isolation, ignoring the relational dynamics where meaning is embedded in the interaction between phrases and their textual environment. Recent transformer-based language models overcome such limitations, but are rarely used in published political science articles, possibly due to misconceptions about their data and computational requirements. This article explains the pretrain-finetune paradigm for transformer-based language models and its potential to improve text analysis in political science by harnessing robust models trained on extensive datasets while requiring relatively small amounts of labeled data and computational resources from researchers. To demonstrate its effectiveness, I employ the approach to identify toxic language in conversation threads following US Senators' tweets.",

          "abstract": "We review 53 studies on the impacts of climate activism. We present the existing evidence in a map of what we know about climate activism and its impacts. We have strong evidence that climate activism shifts public opinion and media coverage in a pro-climate direction, but this varies by context and the tactics employed. We have more moderate evidence that activism can pressure policymakers to communicate more about climate change, encourage voters to vote in a more pro-climate direction, and financially pressure carbon intensive companies. We review suggestive evidence that protest can influence emissions and environmental policy. Although these studies cover a wide swath of outcome variables, a majority examine intermediate variables, rather than long term impacts. Generalizability is challenged by a bias towards the U.S. and Western Europe. We call for greater focus outside those geographic areas and more attention to activism's impact on public policy and emissions.",

          "abstract": "Citizens are expected to hold corrupt politicians accountable. However, while observational studies and field experiments often find corrupt politicians re-elected, survey experiments show that citizens are unlikely to vote for corrupt candidates. This contradiction may arise because previous studies have not accounted for how citizens navigate political information in the real world. In this paper, we propose a model of corruption accountability that considers how citizens selectively engage with political information. We test this model using a PICA experimental design fielded in Spain. The results indicate that information selection can explain the limited consequences of corruption scandals, as not all citizens expose themselves to corruption information, and their likelihood to hold corrupt politicians accountable depends on their information preferences. These findings suggest corruption accountability may be increased not by informing those who select out of counter-attitudinal information, but by reaching inattentive citizens generally not exposed to political information.",

          "abstract": "Illegal dumping, the unauthorized disposal of waste in public spaces, poses significant environmental, social, and economic challenges, particularly in Ontario, Canada. This study investigates the drivers behind illegal dumping, with a focus on rural and urban communities in Ontario. Using a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys and interviews, we examine self-reported instances of dumping, attitudes towards waste management, and perceived barriers to legal waste disposal. The results reveal that inadequate waste collection infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, and high disposal costs are primary motivators for illegal dumping. Additionally, a lack of awareness regarding proper disposal methods exacerbates the issue. While most respondents recognize the immorality of illegal dumping, rural participants show less guilt and are more likely to engage in the behavior. The study provides actionable insights for policymakers, including the need for improved waste infrastructure, targeted educational campaigns, and increased enforcement efforts. By addressing these key factors, Ontario can mitigate the environmental and public health risks posed by illegal dumping, while fostering a culture of responsible waste disposal.",

          "authors": "Goro Takahashi",
          "abstract": "Background: The conventional formula for calculating food self-sufficiency cannot cover all the food we eat on a daily basis, and the food self-sufficiency ratio (FSSR) of each country cannot be calculated. The conventional food self-sufficiency ratio (CFSSR) can only calculate the FSSRs of each country for grains. To determine the actual state of food insecurity worldwide as accurately as possible, a method for calculating the FSSR of each country for all the foods we eat on a daily basis is needed. To address this situation, this study proposes the supply-side food self-sufficiency ratio (SSFSSR), which can be used to systematically calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of all foods in all countries/regions.\n\nResults: We compared the results of both calculations under the same conditions and used the same data to determine whether the CFSSR or the SSFSSR is a more suitable method for obtaining basic information and formulating measures of global food security. The results showed that the SSFSSR has advantages and practicality over the CFSSR. The SSFSSR can calculate self-sufficiency ratios for all foods in all countries/regions of the world, and the figures for various statistical tests are better. The food that is the subject of the calculation in the SSFSSR formula is the entire supply from production, distribution, storage, and consumption, excluding duplication in the calculation, and includes primary products required to produce secondary products, such as livestock products and edible oils. The study also highlighted the value of reducing the amount of primary products used to produce secondary products such as livestock and edible oils, thereby lowering the primary product conversion rate (PPCR).\n\nConclusion: This study used actual data to estimate the SSFSSR for each country/region to demonstrate the applicability of this method and that lowering the PPCR would lead to an increase in the food self-sufficiency ratio. To further refine this methodology, we find that the most important tasks for the future are to collect more reliable data on calories per weight for a large number of foods, expand the number of types covered by more reliable PPCRs, and analyze those data.",

          "abstract": "Supply of more housing options for people on social housing waiting lists should be given increased priority, as longer wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing creates further mental health challenges for applicants already facing increased health needs, according to new AHURI research.\n\nThe research, ‘The role of housing providers in supporting clients with complex needs’, was undertaken for AHURI by researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology and the University of Tasmania. It investigates the current challenges in providing social housing to people with complex support needs and considers potential alternative policy responses. \n\nMental health was identified at the centre of many clients’ health needs. Longer social housing wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing was seen as increasing mental health challenges for clients. An increasingly uncertain and expensive rental market was also recognised as exacerbating the issues.\n\nAt the simplest service response, connecting people to secure housing helped their mental health. Indeed, social housing providers may be the first and only point of contact that clients with unmet mental health needs have with the service system.\n\nDeveloping the housing service providers’ workforce could improve the effectiveness of support provided to people with multiple support needs, together with providing individual casework support for with clients to helping people navigate support networks, including ensuring that clients are designated as priority clients on social housing registries. \n\nThe provision of secure, genuinely affordable housing for people with low and moderate incomes would reduce the pressure on social housing registries. Affordable housing rents need to be reviewed and set based on percentage of income formulae, rather than setting rents as a percentage of market rents.",

          "abstract": "Research on the impact of elections on attitudes toward democracy has focused\nprimarily on satisfaction with democracy. Building on this, we analyze how win-\nning and losing elections, along with affective polarization, shapes citizens’ support\nfor norms of democratic restraint and consent. We propose that partisan animus\nweakens the “reservoir of goodwill” that helps citizens accept democratic norms of\nrestraint and consent that may go against their self-interest. However, a compara-\ntive study of 36 elections and two quasi-experimental case studies show that win-\nners and losers do not differ significantly in their support for these key democratic\nnorms. Even in highly polarized contexts, winners’ restraint and losers’ consent\nremain relatively robust. While satisfaction with democracy is shaped by winner-\nloser dynamics, especially when polarization is high, support for core democratic\nprinciples is not, despite increased partisan hostility. These findings have positive\nimplications for our understanding of the role of citizens in democratic processes.",

          "abstract": "Recent economic development policy in the United States has, in a break from previous decades, identified equity as an explicit goal.  However, little is known about what novel challenges and opportunities face economic development programs and practitioners in attempting to advance equity.  This paper reports results from a workshop engaging 48 managers and staff working on components of the Georgia Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Project (Georgia AIM), a $65 million equity-focused regional economic development project funded by the U.S. Economic Development Administration and the Georgia state government.  Participants discussed their understandings of economic participation and equity, potential obstacles and opportunities in achieving equity, and approaches to assessing equity outcomes.  Results reveal diversity in understandings of equity in the manufacturing economy.  Participants agree that widespread participation in manufacturing work partly constitutes manufacturing equity, but they exhibit more divergence about social, psychological, or environmental aspects of participation and equity.  Meanwhile, participants identified a wide variety of both internal and external factors which will affect whether Georgia AIM achieves its equity goals.  This report illustrates several tensions which equity-focused economic development projects will have to face—between promoting all or only some sorts of manufacturing jobs; between promoting benefits from manufacturing and reducing harms from manufacturing; and between achieving and assessing impact.  Participants’ grounded perspectives on negotiating these tensions can provide guidance for future economic development projects.",

          "abstract": "War is rare, less because states peacefully settle disputes, but more because they have nothing to dispute. To address this simple but oft-neglected reality, I propose a concept of claimability, defined as the appropriateness of making a claim. Focusing on three international norms that emerged after the world wars (territorial integrity, self-determination, and maritime sovereignty), I construct a new dataset of states’ claimable areas for 1946–2024. I illustrate the usefulness of this concept by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increase interstate conflicts only when they are discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as a “most-similar” case study, provide further credence. These findings imply a crucial role of claimability; states claim and dispute only when international norms permit such actions.",

Using family reconstitution data for the province of Zeeland (LINKS) containing over 200.000 children born 1835-1914, I show that mortality was higher among children under age 5 whose parents lost siblings before age 5. This intergenerational persistence of child mortality existed independently from socioeconomic differences in child mortality. Inequalities accumulated, as child mortality was highest for low-SES children whose parents originated from high-mortality, low-socioeconomic status families. Intergenerational transmission in child mortality persisted even when child mortality had declined in the early 20th century.",

          "abstract": "Autoethnography is a methodological approach which seeks to provide depth of experience and understanding of a phenomena through the researcher’s analysis of their own personal experience. As a veterinary researcher with a focus on different methodologies, I elected to apply the autoethnographic approach to my experiences adopting my cat, Athena, from a shelter in 2014. I knew I had experienced feelings of regret and considered relinquishing Athena in the immediate post-adoption period, and I was interested in using this as a case study into the formation of a successful human companion-animal relationship. Through my analysis of my own experiences, I have three main reflections which may be able to aid the veterinary and shelter industries in supporting successful adoptions. First, the highly individual nature of each individual companion animal relationship must be recognised and supported, with veterinary and shelter advice being tailored to the specific needs of the owner and animal. Second, the transition to pet owner requires more active and realistic management, without following a ‘recipe’ for a perfect owner and pet relationship. Finally, I reflect on how my own mental health impacted the process of adoption in light of research surrounding the beneficial impacts of companion animals on pets. Overall, I found the autoethnographic process to be a challenging, but useful lens onto the phenomenon of pet relinquishment, and highlight some considerations for its use in veterinary research.",

We then turn to the specific inferential challenges that must be addressed by cognitive mechanisms for social learning. We review several proposed heuristics that humans and other animals use to extract information from conspecifics, while considering how they deal with each inferential challenge. We finish by describing some of the big debates regarding the cognition underlying cultural capacities in humans and how they provide avenues for future research.",
