          "title": "The Emotion Economy: Algorithmic amplification, cognitive fluency, and cultural schemas in Instapoetry",
          "authors": "Hanan Hussein Sheha",
          "abstract": "The contemporary literary landscape has been fundamentally reshaped by the rise of Instapoetry: short, visual, and emotionally direct verse disseminated primarily through Instagram, a platform whose image-first architecture and recommender systems privilege affectively engaging content. This article argues that the dominance of this poetic form represents not a superficial cultural trend but an adaptive response to a digitally mediated attention economy. It advances an integrative theoretical framework explaining Instapoetry through the convergence of three dimensions: algorithmic, psychological, and cultural. First, algorithmic amplification on Instagram leverages patterns of repetition and social proof to promote specific formal styles. Second, the cognitive state of the platform’s users—marked by social media fatigue and elevated cognitive load—produces a preference for content high in processing fluency. Third, the cultural motifs that dominate Instapoetry function as accessible affective schemas, enabling readers to engage in self-expression, identity construction, and emotional validation. Drawing on research in media studies, cognitive science, and feminist literary criticism—and referencing the influential work of early Instapoets such as Rupi Kaur and Amanda Lovelace—this paper proposes a multidisciplinary account of how digital infrastructures and human psychology jointly shape contemporary poetic production and reception.",

          "authors": "Martin Bush",
          "abstract": "The projection planetarium has been called one of the most the most important single device for popularising astronomy. More than most comparable technologies, the planetarium projector is bound to the environment it operates within. As impressive a machine as it is, it cannot operate effectively except within a well-defined space. This article considers the role of space in the operation of the projection planetarium, through a range of aspects. The domed surface for projection is one of the most characteristic features of the space if the planetarium and its history is described. There are also the transitional spaces that were built into planetarium architecture from early on. The planetarium dome often shaped the external space of the planetarium as well, placing these buildings in architectural comparison with ceremonial structures. Finally, planetariums, as a new kind of performance space, were often established within an institutional space of existing organisations. I use as a case study the Sijthoff Planetarium, located in The Hague, an example that is revealing of many of these aspects of space. Situating the projection planetarium in the history of astronomical visualisation allows us to think in space and to think about space.",

          "authors": "Musa al-Gharbi",
          "abstract": "On its face, journalism is a project that requires humble inquiry: reporters have to speak on matters that are fluid, complex, dynamic, and ambiguous – they have to turn in the “first draft of history” even as the “facts” continue to evolve. They must also convey “the facts” in a manner that is concise, compelling, and accessible to non-specialized audiences, often working under tight deadlines, and engaging with stakeholders who have their agendas, which may diverge from those of the readers, the publication, or the journalists themselves. Put simply, this is very difficult work. And “getting it right” often requires a willingness to check one’s assumptions, recognize and admit errors, and subordinate one’s vision and preferences to those of editors and audiences. This chapter will describe some failures and opportunities of news media to promote humble inquiry. It will discuss how journalists may foster HI in their own work and how journalists can encourage HI in their readers.",

          "authors": "Vihaan Sahu",
          "abstract": "Objective: To develop a specialized Python tool for visualizing Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) risk-of-bias assessments that addresses the limitations of existing generic visualization tools.\n\nMethods: The author developed NOS-TLPlot, an open-source Python package and accompanying Streamlit-based web application. The tool automatically converts raw NOS star ratings (0–9) into standardized risk categories (Low, Moderate, High) and generates twelve distinct visualization types, including star distribution plots, traffic-light plots, radar charts, heatmaps, dot profiles, donut charts, and lollipop charts. It offers both an interactive web application and a command-line interface for batch processing and integration into reproducible analytical pipelines. Users can customize output themes (e.g., traffic-light or grayscale), figure sizes, and export formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS).\n\nResults: NOS-TLPlot successfully produces publication-quality visualizations for NOS risk-of-bias assessments. The tool's web application provides an intuitive interface for data upload, plot selection, and customization. The command-line interface allows for automated plot generation, facilitating reproducibility. The variety of visualization options enhances the flexibility and comprehensiveness of risk-of-bias reporting.\n\nConclusion: NOS-TLPlot provides a dedicated, user-friendly, and reproducible solution for NOS data visualization, enhancing the transparency, consistency, and efficiency of reporting study quality in systematic reviews and meta-analyses involving non-randomized studies.\n\nKeywords: Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, risk of bias, data visualization, Python, systematic review, meta-analysis, open-source software.",

          "abstract": "The widespread adoption of smartphones creates the possibility to passively monitor everyday behavior via sensors. Sensor data has been linked to moment-tomoment psychological symptoms and mood of individuals and thus could alleviate the burden associated with repeated measurement. Additionally, psychological care could be improved by predicting moments of high psychopathology and providing immediate interventions. Current research assumes that the relationship between sensor data and psychological symptoms is constant over time - or changes with a fixed rate: Models are trained on all past data or on a fixed window, without comparing different window sizes with each other. This is problematic as choosing the wrong training window can negatively impact prediction accuracy, especially if the underlying rate of change is varying. As a potential solution we compare different methodologies for choosing the correct window size ranging from frequent practice\nbased on heuristics to super learning approaches. In a simulation study, we vary the rate of change in the underlying relationship form over time as well as the model type (OLS and RF). We show that even computing a simple average across different windows can reduce the prediction error rather than selecting a single best window for both simulated and real-world data.",

          "abstract": "How do people learn to predict what happens next? On one account, people do so by building mental models that mirror aspects of the causal structure of the world. Accordingly, people tell a story of how the data was generated, focusing on goal-relevant information. On another account, people make predictions by learning simple mappings from relevant features of the situation to the outcome. Here, we provide evidence for the causal account. Across three experiments and two paradigms, we find that people misremember what happened, predict incorrectly what will happen, and generalize to novel situations in a way that's consistent with the causal account and inconsistent with a feature-based alternative. People spontaneously construct causal models that compress experience to privilege causally relevant information. These models organize how we remember the past, predict the future, and generalize to novel situations.",

          "authors": "Urvi Maheshwari; David Barner",
          "abstract": "What is the origin of exact numerical reasoning in humans? Previous studies report that innumerate humans are unable to recognize that two sets placed in one-to-one correspondence are exactly equal, and argue that this ability emerges when humans acquire symbolic numbers. Here we tested blind children and adults (n = 140), and found that despite having symbols to label and count large quantities, these participants did not use one-to-one correspondence to match large sets. We also found that blind individuals who had a gradient of visual sensitivity were more likely to match sets exactly, but participants who only used haptic exploration did not. Thus, numerate individuals (who can sometimes match sets exactly) are nevertheless unable to express their understanding of exact equality in a commonly used measure of this ability. We conclude that expressing knowledge of exact equality via set-matching requires not only conceptual understanding, but also experience with sophisticated sensori-motor procedures, suggesting a possible re-analysis of studies with innumerate and semi-numerate humans.",

          "authors": "Chris C. Martin; Wendy Newstetter",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Professors want students to feel included, but there has been little work on how to engender inclusion in collaborative learning. Recent work suggests that justice determines inclusion at the within-person level in student teams: an individual feels included on occasions when justice is high. In this article, we examine whether justice predicts inclusion at higher levels of analysis. Our hypotheses are that justice predicts a sense of inclusion at the between-person level and between-team level: individuals and teams will have higher mean inclusion when their justice levels are high. \nMethods: Four studies were conducted with data from 894 undergraduates across 342 teams, primarily from a biomedical engineering program. Overall peer justice was the independent variable, construed as a combination of distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Inclusion was construed as a combination of belonging and authenticity. Multilevel latent mean models were used for data analysis. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were specified. \nResults: Justice robustly predicted inclusion at the between-team and between-person levels. In two-person teams, there was also a contextual effect, indicating that the first partner’s justice perception affected the second partner’s inclusion level, holding other factors constant.\nConclusions: Instructors are likely to increase inclusion if they teach students about justice and set up team processes to maintain justice. Monitoring justice levels and ameliorating cases of injustice may also be helpful.",

          "authors": "Anas El Ammari",
          "abstract": "Our current understandings of cybercrime are mainly rooted in sociological and opportunity-based theories. This leaves a critical gap in explaining a person's neurobiological predispositions; specifically, the psychological trait of impulsivity. We propose a theoretical framework, The Dopaminergic Impulsivity Hypothesis of Cybercrime (DHIC), which lays that the dysregulation in the brain's dopamine reward system elevates the propensity for impulsive cybercriminal acts. I argue that individuals with a reduced dopamine receptor function, exhibit inherent reward deficiency and high trait impulsivity. The digital environment combines anonymity and immediacy, therefore appearing to be a \"supernormal stimulus\" that facilitates hacking, trolling, or digital piracy. This paper synthesizes evidence from neurobiology and criminology to build this model and derives testable and specific predictions. If validated, this framework would provide a foundational biological perspective on multiple fronts, including: Cybercrime propensity, Forensic psychology, Targeted interventions... and much more.",

          "abstract": "The Psychopathic Boldness Scale (PBS; Marcus et al., 2025) is a newly developed 21-item self-report measure intended to assess boldness as it manifests within psychopathy. In this commentary, we raise concerns about the PBS's construct validity, particularly its conceptual and empirical overlap with antagonism-related traits. Drawing on theoretical analysis and results from Marcus et al., we evaluated how PBS items function relative to the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of overall correlational profiles revealed that the nomological network of the PBS more closely aligns with TriPM Meanness than with Boldness. Rather than clarifying the role of boldness within psychopathy, the PBS repackages maladaptive content typically captured by meanness/antagonism under the boldness label and results in a case of the jingle fallacy. We argue that this conflation undermines theoretical precision and sets the stage for a more difficult-to-integrate literature.",

          "abstract": "Concerns that AI will homogenize human thinking—and homogenization evidence when human-AI collaboration is observed—appear at odds with findings that AI-assisted content is judged as highly original. Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas both within and across essays. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation. Paradoxical homogenization appears to have reached a real-world, high-stakes educational context where writing is expressly personal and AI use is explicitly prohibited.",

          "authors": "Anjie Cao; Michael C. Frank",
          "abstract": "Mid-20th century in the People's Republic of China was a turbulent period: wars, famines, and Cultural Revolution that disrupted lives for a decade and more. Amidst this historical context, two state farms, Lianhu and Qukou, were founded and developed. According to Talhelm and Dong (2024), Lianhu should be considered a rice farm and Qukou should be considered a wheat farm. Since the farmers in the two farms were mostly randomly assigned to work on these farms, this pair of farms is thus a rare natural experiment that allows a test of the causal relationship between farming practices and their cultural orientation: that farming rice leads people to become more collectivistic. But do these two farms really provide a clear causal test for the effect of farming practices? In this comment, we argue that the reported differences between farmers from the two farms show varying sensitivity to the specifics of the researchers' analytical decisions, creating challenges in interpreting the empirical evidence. Furthermore, the historical context of the two farms may have played an important role in shaping their cultural orientation, suggesting that differences observed across two farms could be attributed to factors other than their farming practices.",

Yet, the structure of threat perceptions and their socio-demographic and ideological correlates remain underexplored. Using a six-wave Dutch survey (N = 685) and a network approach, we uncover the complexity of societal threat perceptions. First, we show that societal threat perceptions vary in their interconnectedness, with security threats as crime, threats related to asylum seekers, and the war in Ukraine emerging as central nodes. Second, ideology, age, and education are the most relevant variables linked to societal threat perceptions. Third, we replicate the levels and structure of societal threat perceptions over time, highlighting the robustness of our conclusions. Our study’s results indicate that societal threat perceptions form a complex network that replicates over one year. We outline an agenda for the next generation of theorizing on the structure, correlates and stability of societal threat perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Societal threat perception, worry, and issue salience are central to research in psychology and political science, and previous research suggests considerable overlap between the three measures. Nevertheless, they have not yet been empirically distinguished. This study addresses whether the empirical patterns of these three measures are consistent and whether they yield congruent conclusions about political ideology across twelve societal issues. Using data from a diverse Dutch sample (N = 1863), we first show that threat and worry, but not salience, produce similar empirical patterns in terms of means and correlations, as citizens find issues more important than threatening or worrying. Next, we find that threat and worry correlate overall similarly with ideology -- but also highlight exceptions -- whereas issue salience often overestimates this relationship (Type M error) but rarely reverses its direction (Type S error). These findings clarify the unique roles of threat, worry, and issue salience in (political) psychology, offering a framework for future research on the threat-politics link.",

          "authors": "Alma Bitran; Hannah Krall; Kenneth R. Conner; Shireen L. Rizvi",
          "abstract": "Objective: Studies show that only 50% of suicide decedents disclose their suicidal ideation or intent before death. However, most research has only assessed direct disclosure (i.e., explicitly stating suicidal intent), and may not capture indirect forms of disclosure that occur euphemistically or vaguely (e.g., “I’m worried I’ll do something dumb”). Prior evidence suggests that indirect disclosure may serve as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior, indicating its importance as a potential point of intervention. \nMethod: The current study examines direct and indirect disclosure in a sample of 35 adult inpatients hospitalized following a suicide attempt. Participants completed narrative interviews describing the day preceding their attempt. Suicide-related disclosures were characterized by two coders using qualitative content analysis. Coded features of disclosure included content, directness, function, recipient, and consequences.\nResults:  The majority (60%) of participants engaged in some form of disclosure, direct or indirect, preceding their hospitalization. The vast majority (95%) of disclosures occurred within 24 hours of the attempt. About one-third of reported disclosures were considered indirect, and included behaviors such as communicating distress, asking for help, expressing love, and saying goodbye. For 85% of participants, disclosure was at least partially responsible for the receipt of crisis intervention.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that indirect disclosure is relatively common in the 24 hours surrounding an attempt, indicating its importance as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior. Moreover, disclosure appears to be a critical precursor to the receipt of crisis intervention. Further research into indirect suicide-related disclosure is warranted.",

Adolescence marks a pivotal stage where individuals actively construct their identities and behaviors, such as dietary practices. Dietary habits however extend beyond personal preferences. Adolescents may find resonance with the eating habits of their peers, incorporating them into their own dietary practices, or deliberately select friends who share similar moral perspectives on meat consumption.\nThis study utilized data from the two-year panel survey SOCIALBOND, encompassing approximately 1,372 students in 22 schools in the North Rhine Westphalia region of Germany. Leveraging sociometric peer networks on the grade level, the potential co-dependence of friendship networks and vegetarianism in adolescence is investigated by disentangling social selection and influence effects. This research not only contributes to the broader discourse on social networks but also provides new insights into how dietary choices, such as vegetarianism, unfold within adolescent peer group dynamics.",

It argues that this neglect stems from the field’s colonial roots and paternalistic framings. To re-center the analysis, this chapter applies a decolonial lens, deconstructing the “mainstream” as a product of an invisible racial hierarchy. It then reinterprets empirical findings: reframing “own-culture maintenance” as a defense of racial normativity and “other-culture adoption” as a selective process often governed by dominant interests. Finally, the chapter distinguishes between colonial cultural appropriation and decolonial cultural exchange, advocating for an antiracist psychology that analyzes intercultural relations as a negotiation of power.",

          "abstract": "Sacred moments are characterised by the five qualities of boundlessness, deep\ninterconnectedness, transcendence, ultimacy, and spiritual emotions, experienced at one moment\nin time (Pargament et al., 2014). These moments have been associated with improvements to\nwell-being in numerous ways. Benefits to well-being as a result of attending concerts have also\nbeen well documented, as concerts have become increasingly popular in recent years. The goal\nof the present study was to investigate how sacred moments manifest during rock concerts, and\nthe extent to which sacred moments contribute to the improvements in well-being experienced\nfrom concert attendances. Thus, the present study involved a questionnaire to examine the\nprevalence of experiencing sacred moment qualities at rock concerts (N = 87). Semi-structured\ninterviews were also used to explore the lived experience of these qualities, along with the\nelements that made the concert impactful (n = 3). The results of the questionnaire revealed that\nparticipants were likely to experience sacred moment qualities during at least one or few concerts\nthey have attended. Religious belief, age, gender, and frequency of rock concert attendance\ngenerally did not have an effect on the frequency of experiencing sacred moment qualities at\nconcerts, except for ultimacy, which had a slight negative correlation with age only.\nInterpretative phenomenological analysis on the in-depth interview data uncovered two group\nexperiential themes: “The Singular and Unique Experience of Live Music,” with Literally\nSingular, and Figuratively Singular; Unique and Extraordinary as subthemes, and “Live Music\nis a Sensory and Physical Experience,” with Physicality and Moshing, The Visual Experience,\nThe Auditory Experience, and Physical Realness as subthemes. Notably, every sacred moment\nquality experienced at concerts was described by the participants as exceedingly enjoyable and\nresulted in improved well-being, though the longevity of these effects had limited evidence. The\nhypothesis that sacred moment experiences could be a mechanism through which live music\nexperiences improve people’s well-being was supported by the findings. Limitations and\nimplications for future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Bipolar disorder is strongly associated with financial instability. We examine how different interventions motivate individuals with bipolar disorder to share financial data with others. This approach can inform the development of tools for digital monitoring and intervention designed to promote financial stability in this population.\n\nMethods: 500 individuals with BD completed a pre-registered factorial vignette survey to examine level of comfort with hypothetical scenarios involving third-party financial interventions during symptomatic and euthymic periods. Scenario components were systematically varied between third-party actors, mood states, and intervention types. Participants rated sharing comfort on a 0-10 point scale. Multilevel models tested differences alongside clinical and financial histories, relational trust, and personality.\n\nResults: Participants were most comfortable involving care partners in financial planning. They were more comfortable with temporary spending restrictions during symptomatic states than euthymic periods, underscoring the importance of accurate mood detection for intervention delivery. Prior financial help-seeking behavior and higher relational trust predicted greater comfort. Bankruptcy experience — declared by 11.4% and considered by 31.7% — was associated with increased comfort with spending restrictions. Individuals with psychiatric advance directives (8%) were significantly more comfortable sharing spending behaviors than those without. \n\nConclusions: Comfort with financial interventions was higher among those with prior financial challenges or help-seeking histories. Participants distinguished between symptomatic and euthymic periods, favoring targeted, time-limited restrictions over general monitoring. These findings extend prior work on financial data sharing for illness self-management, highlighting the role of trusted third parties in designing acceptable, effective interventions.",

Contemporary assessments of gc in adults often focus on school-based knowledge acquired through formal education. To broaden this scope, we developed a gc measure that captures life knowledge acquired through biographical experiences outside formal schooling. A sample of 348 adults completed items assessing school knowledge and newly developed items targeting life knowledge, tailored to specific biographical experiences, covering five areas: humanities, natural sciences, life sciences, arts, and social sciences. Besides the knowledge items, participants also answered questions about the associated biographical experiences. Latent factors for both knowledge item sets correlated perfectly with each other. Nonetheless, correlations between biographical experiences and corresponding life knowledge items were slightly stronger than correlations between biographical items and non-corresponding life or school knowledge items. We discuss the often-neglected relevance of the source of knowledge acquisition and biographical learning opportunities, and consider their implications for the psychometric modeling of gc.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: In psychotherapy, self-report measures with standardized item-sets are widely used to evaluate therapy progress and outcome. However, relying solely on standardized (nomothetic) measures may overlook person-specific (idiographic) problems. Idiographic patient-reported outcome measures (I-PROMs) allow patients to formulate their items, capturing therapy-relevant aspects that standardized measures might miss. To provide guidance on implementing I-PROMs and improving item quality, we conducted a pre-registered narrative systematic review (PROSPERO:CRD42022361535).\nMethods: We searched \"Web of Science,\" \"PsycINFO,\" \"PubMed,\" and \"EMBASE,\" along with reference screenings, to identify studies using I-PROMs in therapy settings, including a psychometric evaluation, published before March 18th 2025.\nResults: Our search yielded 32 empirical articles (51 studies) examining 13 I-PROMs and 6,706 participants. Four I-PROMs assessed therapy-relevant aims (three assessed goals, measuring goal-attainment; one assessed values, measuring value-directed behaviour), four problems (measuring problem-duration, -severity or -change), three both goals and problems (measuring motivational variables), and two assessed helpful aspects of therapy (measuring helpfulness/hindrance). Items were generated via self-administration (four I-PROMs), interviews (six I-PROMs), or both (three I-PROMs). We identified two strategies to enhance item quality: improving item-wording (e.g., instructions, examples, (re)formulation guidelines) and ensuring relevance to therapy (e.g., predefined focus-areas, prioritization-procedures). I-PROMs were applied across therapy settings, talking-therapy schools, nationalities, genders, and disorders, but differences in applicability across these remained unclear.\nDiscussion: Our synthesis helps therapists and researchers evaluate I-PROMs' strengths and limitations, enabling informed choices for selection and implementation, and offers guidance to improve item quality – thereby, facilitating comprehensive measurement and promoting a broader adoption of I-PROMs moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Visual illusions are a popular scientific topic frequently shared on social media. When shared online, illusion images are usually accompanied by explanatory statements, which often contain misinformation. Although such posts combining illusion images and misinformation are widely shared, the psychological mechanism underlying this sharing remains unclear. To address this issue, we hypothesized that illusory experiences would shape user’s intention to share misinformation primarily through two mediators: user interest (triggered situational interest) and truthiness. In an online experiment, participants viewed posts that paired an illusion image with explanatory descriptions containing a brief misinformation statement. They then rated their illusory experience, user interest, truthiness, and intention to share. Mediation analysis revealed that illusory experience had a significant total effect on intention to share whereas its direct effect was not significant. Instead, the illusory experience indirectly influenced the intention to share through the two mediators. The pathway via user interest was the strongest, indicating that an increase in triggered situational interest was the principal driver of sharing intentions. The pathway via truthiness was weaker but still significant, suggesting a secondary role of truthiness in shaping sharing intentions. Regarding supplementary factors, neither valence (positive vs. negative) nor presentation format (original vs. repost) exerted significant effects on the outcomes. Overall, the findings indicate that illusory experience influences information-sharing behavior indirectly through psychological mediators, underscoring the importance of considering individual perceptual experience when accounting for misinformation sharing on social media.",

          "abstract": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and clinically urgent condition in adolescence, marked by impairments in cognitive flexibility—a capacity thought to be supported by neural variability. However, most research to date has focused on static brain features, leaving the role of variability largely unexplored. Importantly, variability-based metrics have been emerging as promising biomarkers in psychiatry, offering superior test–retest and intersession reliability compared with traditional static metrics. Leveraging resting-state fMRI data from 160 psychiatric patients with NSSI and 50 psychiatric controls, we examined neural variability at two hierarchical levels—connectivity and network topology—and evaluated their clinical relevance using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Patients with NSSI consistently exhibited heightened variability at both the local and global level, and these measures demonstrated significant discriminative power in classifying NSSI from controls (AUC = 0.75). The functional implications, however, diverged between two levels. Greater connectivity-level variability was associated with better emotional and attentional functioning and predicted larger reductions in NSSI behaviors over three months, suggesting an adaptive or compensatory role. In contrast, greater topology-level variability was linked to higher impulsivity, and predicted poorer behavioral improvement, reflecting maladaptive instability of large-scale organization. These findings reveal that elevated neural variability in NSSI encompasses both adaptive and dysregulated dynamics: increases in local connectivity variability may promote flexible adaptation, whereas excessive large-scale reconfiguration indicates loss of global control. Together, our findings indicate that disruption of the balance between local flexibility and global stability may constitute a neural mechanism underlying self-regulatory dysfunction in NSSI and highlight variability-based metrics as potential biomarkers and intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "One-pedal driving (OPD) is increasingly adopted in electric vehicles (EVs) due to its benefits in energy efficiency and driving comfort. However, this driving mode also raises safety concerns regarding potential pedal misapplication (PM) and sudden unintended acceleration. This study evaluated PM risk in OPD and explored its possible causes by a simulated driving experiment. Behavioral responses and subjective evaluations from 42 participants were systematically analyzed across one-pedal, two-pedal and joystick modes. Results indicate that compared to two-pedal mode, participants in OPD exhibited faster reaction times, reported higher perceived ease of driving and lower cognitive load. However, PM incidence was higher in OPD than both two-pedal and joystick modes. Its potential cognitive explanations were proposed from both innate and acquired perspectives. This suggests that OPD may pose a higher PM risk, thereby increasing the likelihood of collision, particularly in low-speed scenarios with short time-to-collision. The findings can deepen the understanding the cognitive mechanisms of PM in OPD and provide practical guidance for the safety design of OPD systems in EVs.",

While many models of reading comprehension have been proposed, these are commonly based on neurotypical students, with more limited research into their applicability to autistic students. We investigated whether one model of reading, the Direct and Indirect Effects Model of Reading (DIER), could be applied to autistic students. Namely, we sought to determine whether the component skills of the DIER were associated with reading comprehension in this population and whether reading comprehension could be predicted based on significantly associated components. \nMethods: Assessments across the following DIER components were completed with 69 autistic students in the primary school years in Australia: domain general cognition, word reading, listening comprehension (including foundational oral language skills and higher order cognition), text reading fluency, and reading comprehension. \nResults: Reading comprehension was correlated with many of the components of the DIER. Of these, non-verbal IQ, text reading fluency, and listening comprehension (including story comprehension, grammar, and perspective taking) accounted for 60.1% of the variance in reading comprehension, with grammar a significant individual predictor. \nConclusion: These results suggest that the DIER may be applicable to autistic primary school students, however the relative contributions of the components may differ to neurotypical populations. Our findings provide insights into how this model may function across a wider profile of learners, enhancing our understanding of key areas",

We present an approach that draws from the phylogenetic approach to cognition, dual inheritance models of cultural biology, and 4E cognition. The eco-evo-devo approach allows us to construct various morphological and behavioral configurations by utilizing a phylogenetic approach to cognition. This is compared and contrasted with the cybernetic approach to cognition, which is a more standard approach to implementing computational agents. To demonstrate this, the biocybernetic Braitenberg Vehicle approach is subject to a phylogenetic analysis, which reveals an evolutionary development (evo-devo) model of embodiment origins. Computational agents achieve embodiment through a genotype-to-phenotype mapping where phylogenetic diversification amongst agents is driven by mutational and recombination events. Cognitive abilities are built upon common ancestry and refined by taxonomic-specific genotypic configurations. We then compare our approach to the cybernetic approach to cognition and how our approach differs. To reconcile some of these incompatibilities, we discuss the application of 4E approaches to cognition and dual inheritance models that enable an eco-evo-devo approach to computational intelligence.",

Externalizing disorders with impulsivity as a key symptom such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been associated with altered sensory processing and decision-making. This study investigated the relationship between impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours, and multisensory integration. Participants had to discriminate between two visual gratings, and/or two sounds presented to the right and left ear based on respectively contrast and loudness in a two-alternative forced-choice task. The study included 44 participants, 13 of whom were diagnosed with ADHD or Disruptive Behaviour Disorders. Results show similar task performance across participants. Performance accuracies were highest on audiovisual trials and participants responded fastest on auditory trials, independent of impulsivity levels. Examining the timescale of evidence weighting revealed that early sensory information contributed most to decisions, with dynamic dominance switching between visual and auditory modalities. We found no evidence that the temporal dynamics were affected by impulsivity. These findings suggest that impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours do not significantly affect MSI during our task and that sensory processing mechanisms remain robust against individual impulsivity levels.",

          "abstract": "Extensive research has shown that the presence of others, especially when perceived as evaluative, can either facilitate or impair performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, depending on their difficulty. While it is well-established that the mental abilities assessed in these studies are underpinned by common executive functions, such as working memory, there has been limited research dealing with the impact of social presence on these cognitive systems directly. The current study addressed this gap by examining the influence of evaluative social presence on working memory performance. In addition, motivational states were considered as potential drivers of the effects. Using a within-subjects design and pre-registered methods, 43 participants performed n-back tasks under varying cognitive load and social evaluation conditions, while motivational states were assessed through self-reported eustress and distress scales. The results revealed that under social evaluation, some individuals exhibit both improved accuracy and speed, while others demonstrate reduced accuracy (without a clear pattern in reaction times), regardless of cognitive load. The anticipated mediation of motivational states could therefore not be supported. These findings challenge traditional understandings of social presence effects, suggesting that its impact on working memory—and potentially other cognitive functions—may be influenced by factors beyond task difficulty. The results have important implications for the design of test environments and highlight the need for further research on moderating factors that could explain the large interindividual variability in social presence effects.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes that the experience of agency and concomitant patterns of attention emerge not only within individuals but between them — in the transient, autonomous dynamics of social interaction known in dance improvisation as the “third entity.” Drawing on the enactive theory of participatory sense-making (PSM), we examine how interactive dynamics shape how we attend to what matters, and how attentional modes may shift in relation to levels of “I,” “we,” and “it” agency. We will also discuss some instances of neurodivergence and psychopathology where PSM dynamics can fail. Integrating cognitive neuroscience on affect-biased attention with ethnographic insights from dance improvisation, we propose a neurophenomenological approach to studying attention as embodied, relational, and affectively charged. We argue that dance improvisation offers a rich, underused laboratory for investigating how attention is dynamically tuned through relational movement. Attention, in this view, is not just selection but participation — a means of moving through and with meaning. Understanding its dynamics will play a central role in advancing transdisciplinary models of mental health grounded in shared sense-making.",

          "abstract": "The assessment of creative achievement (CA) can be cumbersome as participants are typically asked to respond to long lists of possible accomplishments that may still miss their specific achievements. A bottom-up alternative is to let participants openly report their most significant CAs, which, however, involves more complex scoring such as via human ratings. In this study, we investigated whether language models (LMs) can provide an efficient and valid scoring of such open-ended responses. Across two data sets, participants described their three most significant CAs. These responses were rated by human judges and by three LMs (Llama 3.1–8B, Llama 3.3–70B, GPT-4o) using zero-shot prompting. Correlations between human and LM ratings were consistently high (r = .53–.80), and criterion validity evidence of LM-based scores was largely on par with rater-based scores. In addition, we examined zero-shot domain classification of CAs into nine creative domains (e.g., music, visual arts). Classification accuracy was 62.3% overall; closer inspection of findings suggested that automated classification has the potential to unveil conceptual overlaps between domains and to identify CAs involving multiple domains. Taken together, the findings suggest that automated scoring of CA via LMs represents a promising and efficient alternative to traditional CA measures.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of depression during the preschool years is well established. However, the neural correlates of depressive symptoms during this developmental period remain relatively understudied. Prior work has suggested a concurrent association between left amygdala salience reactivity (i.e., reward and loss versus neutral) and depressive symptoms in early childhood. Replication and extension into the predictive utility of the amygdala and other relevant neurobiological correlates are now needed. The current longitudinal study conducted a conceptual replication and extension of prior work using task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a sample of 4-8-year-old children. We investigated whether reward-related reactivity in a priori regions of interest were associated with parent-reported early childhood depressive symptoms concurrently (N = 114; 54% female) and approximately one year later (N = 75; 53% female). Left amygdala salience reactivity and right caudate and medial prefrontal cortex reward reactivity (i.e., reward versus neutral) negatively associated with concurrent childhood depressive symptom severity. Only right caudate reward reactivity negatively associated with childhood depressive symptom severity one year later. Results replicate prior research suggesting an association between amygdala response to salient outcomes during reward processing and concurrent depressive symptom elevations in young children. They also provide novel information supporting the potential role of right caudate reactivity during reward processing as a biomarker of future elevations in depressive symptoms. These findings provide neurobiological insights into our developmental understanding of early emerging depressive symptoms and underscore early childhood as an important developmental period for understanding depression.",

          "abstract": "Numerical and non-numerical quantities are often mapped onto horizontal space. Previous research suggests that culture-related habits, such as reading and writing direction, can influence the orientation of this mapping. While cross-cultural differences have been observed in the spatial representation of time, similar effects have not been consistently found for numbers. This discrepancy has been attributed to the fact that reading and writing involve the sequential processing of information in a specific direction but are not inherently related to numerical content. These findings support the hypothesis that the spatial representation of magnitudes depends on specific experiential associations. The present study investigated potential cross-cultural differences in the spatial representation of visual speed by comparing participants from Italy, who use a left-to-right reading and writing system, with participants from Iran, who use a right-to-left system. Participants judged whether the speed of a centrally presented random dot kinematogram was slower or faster than a reference, using left or right response keys. Results revealed opposite spatial mappings of visual speed: a left-to-right mapping for Italian participants and a right-to-left mapping for Iranian participants. These findings support the view that reading and writing direction shapes the spatial representation of magnitudes intrinsically linked to directional reading experiences, such as motion at a specific speed.",

          "abstract": "Continuous speech presents a challenge to the ab initio learner, as the language-specific segmentation strategies they use in their first language are not always reliable cues in other languages (Cutler, 2001). Yet, they are able to use more general acoustic, prosodic, and statistical cues to word boundaries, as well as lexical similarity to their first language (e.g., Shoemaker &amp; Rast, 2013) to recognize words at first exposure to a new language. In the current study, we investigated whether adult ab initio learners’ ability to recognize words after brief exposure to continuous speech in a new language is improved when that speech is produced using an infant-directed register, a style of speech found to facilitate segmentation in infancy (Thiessen et al., 2005). In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that although English ab initio learners of German benefited from infant-directed speech, their performance was generally lower than in previous studies unless task demands were reduced. These learners also benefited from word length and from frequency of occurrence, as has been shown previously, but these did not interact with register. As in infancy, learner-directed speech registers appear to facilitate initial processing and recognition in adult ab initio learners.",

          "abstract": "BayesPower is an R package with a user-friendly Shiny interface for conducting sample size determination, power calculation, and Bayes factor calculation in the context of Bayesian hypothesis testing without the use of simulation. The app supports a wide range of commonly encountered statistical tests in the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences, including standardized mean differences, correlations, linear regression and ANOVA, as well as tests for one and two proportions. In addition to traditional point null hypothesis versus composite alternative hypothesis, BayesPower supports sample size planning for interval hypothesis Bayes factors (i.e., equivalence testing). Moreover, the Shiny app provides command-line-based R code for the reproducibility of results. For most testing problems, the sample size and power are returned almost instantly, enabling researchers to rapidly design informative and efficient studies.",

          "abstract": "Background: Music-based therapeutic interventions are a promising addition to conventional treatments for people with dementia, positively affecting mood and wellbeing. However, previous studies on music-based interventions in dementia show variability in design and results, hampering clear understanding of the beneficial effects of music. Particularly, the specific benefits of music compared to similar non-musical activities remain unclear. \n\nObjective: Here, we piloted the feasibility of a randomized cross-over study design to isolate music-specific positive effects of a music intervention on people with dementia from general, nonspecific effects of participating in a stimulating group activity.\n\nMethods: 15 nursing home residents diagnosed with dementia participated in both a music and a conversation activity, which only differed with respect to the presence of music. Before and after five weeks of intervention, we assessed behavioural symptoms, using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-NH), and wellbeing, using the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID) scale. During the activities we assessed engagement (Menorah Park Engagement Scale; MPES) and affect (Observed Emotion Rating Scale; OERS).\n\nResults: The singing activity reduced professional caregiver burden, while the conversation activity increased wellbeing. We found no difference between music and conversation in eliciting engagement and affect during the activities.\n\nConclusion: Tentatively, both singing and conversation activities can positively affect people with dementia, with neither clearly outperforming the other. Given our sample size, these findings need to be confirmed in future larger studies. We discuss the feasibility of the design and implications for future studies examining music-specific positive effects on people with dementia.",

          "abstract": "Everyday behaviour requires balancing two control modes: flexibility, for switching between tasks, and stability, for maintaining goals in the face of interference. One influential account posits that these two modes trade off: increased flexibility comes at the cost of reduced stability, and vice-versa. However, empirical support for this trade-off remains equivocal. We propose that this trade-off arises from reward-induced effortful control modulations during tasks that simultaneously require flexible and stable control. Across two experiments (N=80 and N=87), participants completed a task-switching paradigm in which cued reward incentives were manipulated over varying timescales. Large rewards increased flexibility, evinced by reduced task switch costs, but reduced stability, evinced by increased incongruence costs, indicating a reward-induced trade-off. In Experiment 1, such control adjustments— both at the block-to- block and individual differences level—followed this trade-off. Overall, these findings provide evidence for a reward-driven flexibility-stability trade-off; higher incentives promote flexibility at the cost of stability.",

          "abstract": "Co-rumination, defined as when individuals perseverate on problems with each other, focus excessively on negative feelings, and cyclically discuss the causes and consequences of problems, is often examined from the perspective of the person seeking support about a problem or by averaging both dyad members’ individual ratings of co-rumination. This approach muddles how each dyad member contributes to the “co” of co-rumination and may have implications for understanding prior work that has shown associations between co-rumination and intrapersonal and interpersonal well-being. We leveraged state space grids to examine co-rumination as a dyadic and dynamic system, as constituted by the temporal unfolding of each dyad member’s self-rated social rumination throughout their discussion. From 2019-2020, 85 primarily White and female college-aged close friend dyads engaged in a support discussion. After, friends viewed their recorded discussion and rated their individual contributions to the co-rumination process (i.e., social rumination) every 30 seconds across the eight-minute conversation. Results revealed that the more both dyad members got “stuck” engaging in mutually high social rumination (i.e., co-rumination), the more they perceived each other as responsive and supportive and viewed the problem as more solved. In contrast, the more that only the person disclosing the problem was stuck in high levels of social rumination or when dyads more flexibly engaged in social rumination, the more individuals with the problem benefited from the conversation, but responders benefited less. Examining co-rumination dyadically and dynamically can reveal when and for whom co-rumination processes are associated with costs and benefits.",

          "abstract": "Attachment processes during early childhood shape the development of basic emotional regulation skills that can impact how individuals cope with trauma and stress through their ontogeny. As a result, insecure attachment styles impact mental health by facilitating inadequate emotional regulation such as hypervigilance and negative affect, ultimately increasing the risk of both internalizing symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, and externalizing symptoms, such as harmful substance use and antisocial behavior. In this review, we focus on pathways linking insecure attachment (especially anxious-insecure styles) and anxiety disorders throughout development, summarizing cross-species data on the impacts of attachment issues on neurobehavioral systems involved in anxiety and defense. Data from animal research, gene variant and epigenetic human studies, and clinical research suggest an interplay between oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin, and glucocorticoids in shaping the responsiveness of neural circuits involved in social behavior, reward, and defensive behavior, resulting in maladaptive behavior in later stages of life. These findings underscore the multifaceted biological underpinnings of insecure attachment and its long-term psychological consequences.",

          "authors": "Shaheed Azaad",
          "abstract": "Theoretically-driven meta-analyses often involve testing whether study characteristics moderate an effect in a pattern that supports one of multiple competing theoretical accounts. To conduct such analyses, researchers must manually extract, i.e., code, these characteristics from sometimes hundreds of studies. Ideally, studies should be coded by two researchers independently to prevent errors and biases from compromising the dataset’s integrity. The laborious nature of this task, however, means that meta-analysts usually settle for double-coding just a portion of the studies included in their study. Some researchers have proposed using large language models (LLMs) as a double-coder, showing that they can reliably extract explicitly stated information (e.g., publication year) from articles. However, meta-analyses in psychology generally require studies to be coded in terms of higher-level conceptual dimensions (e.g., the type of behaviour rather than which behaviour). The present study investigated whether two LLMs, OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, can code studies in this way. Both models replicated study codes from three recently published meta-analyses in psychology with high accuracy (&gt;92% overall), despite limitations in the information that they received. LLM double-coding, therefore, offers a practical solution for meta-analysts seeking to ensure data integrity.",

The present study aimed to investigate the network structure linking PEs, social functioning, and loneliness, and to identify the central mechanisms underlying these associations. \nMethods: We analyzed data from a representative sample of Slovak adults (N = 1200) who completed validated measures of PEs, loneliness, social functioning, emotional distress, social motivation, and mentalizing. A regularized partial correlation network was estimated using EBICglasso, comprising 17 nodes. Centrality indices and edge weights were used to determine the most influential nodes and connections. \nResults: The network revealed 40 non-zero edges. Friendship approach, bizarre experiences, social withdrawal, paranoia, and avolition emerged as the most interconnected nodes. Paranoia was strongly associated with loneliness and social withdrawal, while avolition was linked to loneliness and reduced social participation. Negative affect showed associations with loneliness and diminished participation. Social withdrawal linked negative symptoms to diminished social engagement and interpersonal communication. In contrast, hallucinations and grandiosity showed no notable direct associations with social functioning or loneliness. \nConclusion: These findings highlight paranoia, social withdrawal, and avolition as central mechanisms connecting PEs with social functioning and loneliness, while social approach motivation may serve as a protective factor. The results support a dimensional model of psychosis and point to early social and motivational targets for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model is a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes a modifiable health-determining construct, identity state, defined by three domains hypothesized to all stem from identification of the core self with the physical body: 1) a self-concept that is inclusive of all living beings vs. exclusive based on physical attributes, 2) the perceived basis of the worth of all living beings as intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and 3) the degree of universally compassionate orientation toward all living beings. The identity state construct is theorized to act through modulating stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior to influence the causal relationship between social position-dependent stressors, biological aging, and age-related diseases. The IVP Scale (IVPS) was developed to empirically assess the hypotheses of the IVP framework and the utility of the identity state construct for population health research. This study provides the first description of the psychometric properties of the long (20-item) and short form (12-item) IVPS. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) of data from two separate samples of self-identified Black and White adults (aged 18-81) collected in 2021 and 2025 (total N=2,318). Associations between the IVPS and related constructs of optimism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and resilience were examined to establish construct validity. EFA supported a unidimensional structure and CFA confirmed good model fit for both IVPS measures. Both scales are significantly positively correlated with indicators of optimism and resilience and significantly negatively correlated with SDO. These initial findings suggest the IVPS-20 and the IVPS-Short are valid and psychometrically sound scales.",

When completing a novel profile-generation task, people ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they spontaneously think of a woman (vs. a man) and when assigned. Across 1,864 previously normed behaviors, we find that actions associated with moral goodness are stereotyped as feminine. Finally, in a novel impression updating task, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men; equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, moral goodness is gendered: people think women are morally superior to men.",

While prior research has shown some success in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at scale, how individual-level interventions impact the quality of content shared on social networks remains understudied. Across two pre-registered longitudinal studies, we ran two Twitter/X ad campaigns, targeting a total of 967,640 Twitter/X users with either a previously validated “inoculation” video about emotional manipulation or a control video. We hypothesized that Twitter/X users who saw the inoculation video would engage less with negative-emotional content and share less content from unreliable sources. We do not find evidence for our hypotheses, observing no meaningful changes in posting or retweeting post-intervention. Our findings are most likely compromised by Twitter/X’s “fuzzy matching” policy, which introduced substantial noise in our data (~7.5% of targeted individuals were actually exposed to the intervention). Our findings are thus likely the result of treatment non-compliance rather than “true” null effects. Importantly, we also demonstrate that different statistical analyses and time windows (looking at the intervention’s effects over 1 hour versus 6 hours or 24 hours, etc.) can yield different and even opposite significant effects, highlighting the risk of interpreting noise from field studies as signal.",

We tested the robustness and developmental trajectory of this intuition, and its relation to belief-desire psychology. Across three studies using novel, non-verbal video vignettes we found that both adults and children (5-8 years) systematically denied knowledge in Gettier tasks. Crucially, while the experimental task (True Belief vs. Gettier cases) strongly influenced knowledge attributions, it had little direct effect on action predictions in adults and children. The key factor influencing action prediction in adults was whether participants had attributed or denied knowledge beforehand. Despite all participants attributing the relevant belief, when knowledge was denied, participants became significantly slower and more uncertain in their predictions. Our findings are compatible with dual-process accounts, suggesting the primacy of knowledge in theory of mind.",

          "authors": "Noah M. Laskey; Spike W. S. Lee",
          "abstract": "Hundreds of studies have identified psychological and behavioral differences between liberals and conservatives. Many of these differences, however, shrink or vanish under conditions like cognitive load, heightened threat, and pharmacological interruptions of executive functioning. To explain why these “ideological shifts” occur, we offer a dual-process model of ideology. It postulates that liberals and conservatives have more similar automatic than controlled processes in response to social and moral stimuli. What unifies numerous ideological shift-inducing conditions is that they undermine the influence of relatively controlled processes or amplify that of relatively automatic processes. Under these conditions, outcomes are guided more by relatively automatic processes such as intuitions (e.g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation) that are similar across the aisle, less by relatively controlled processes such as explicit ideological prescriptions (e.g., outgroup tolerance) that differ across the aisle. We illustrate our model’s explanatory power with multiple lines of research, from ideological shifts to moral foundations to implicit bias, which consistently reveal more similar responses between liberals and conservatives when relatively automatic processes prevail over controlled ones. Contrary to influential perspectives (e.g., Moral Foundations Theory), our model posits—and evidence supports—that many differences between liberals and conservatives are driven not by irreconcilable social intuitions, but by controlled processes for maintaining ideological concordance. Our model has theoretical, applied, methodological, and empirical implications. One of them is that liberals’ and conservatives’ similar automatic processes could be leveraged for both beneficial (e.g., reducing interpersonal friction in cross-aisle dialogue) and harmful outcomes (e.g., exacerbating outgroup prejudices).",

This Conceptual Analysis advances System 3, a compact, falsifiable account in which creativity arises from a tightly coupled generate–evaluate–gate micro-cycle. System 3 both iterates (rapid alternation between associative and evaluative processing) and integrates (affect-laden, phenomenological signals that bias exploration with rational-logical codes—constraints and decision confidence—that enforce evaluation) under metacognitive control operating in two forms: explicit (conscious, reportable monitoring and strategy selection) and implicit (non-conscious confidence/error signals that bias attention, evaluation, and gating). We render the framework testable through three behavioral indices: associative-distance density (breadth and rate of semantic exploration), analytic-verification ratio (degree of online checking), and convergence latency (commit speed at a fixed quality threshold). The account links these indices to large-scale brain dynamics—cooperation and switching between the Default Mode and Central Executive networks—and to neuromodulatory gains (dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, acetylcholine) that tune explore–exploit balance and network integration–segregation. System 3 yields clear predictions and disconfirmers: non-disruptive bias toward Default Mode should increase density and track judged originality at matched fluency; bias toward Central Executive should raise the verification ratio and improve judged usefulness at matched density; alternating Default-Mode/Central-Executive bias should phase-lock verification to evaluative epochs and reduce latency; and, under weak monitoring, density should follow an inverted-U with usefulness that shifts toward joint gains as monitoring strengthens. By linking measurable behavior to network dynamics and control signals, System 3 offers an adjudicable roadmap for explaining and responsibly enhancing creative cognition.",

The present study investigated the extent to which learners accurately estimate their own English proficiency and examined the empirical consequences of substituting proxy variables for an objective proficiency measure. A total of 228 English language learners completed the Oxford Placement Test alongside measures of self-rated CEFR proficiency, self-perceived communication competence, and self-reported academic achievement. Only 37% of participants accurately estimated their proficiency, with lower-level learners tending to overestimate and advanced learners to underestimate their abilities. Correlations between the Oxford Placement Test and proxy variables were modest (r = .20–.49), and structural equation models using proxies in place of objective proficiency produced results differing in strength and directionality in explanatory models. These findings illustrate the price of convenience: while proxy variables are practical, their use impacts the findings of studies and may compromise validity.

          "abstract": "Background: Mindful activities are recommended to support and improve student wellbeing. Mindful colouring in particular is a low-cost, low-effort intervention shown to improve student wellbeing, mental health, and mindfulness. Less evidence exists about the effectiveness of different colouring formats, such as paper versus digital. This study investigated a self-guided two-week colouring intervention for university student wellbeing, comparing outcomes between paper-based and digital engagement.\nMethods: Two-hundred and ninety-seven participants completed at least six sessions of self-guided colouring for 10 minutes over two weeks. Participants were assessed using self-report measures of quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression, and dispositional mindfulness pre- and post-intervention. Effects of colouring over time, and between groups were investigated with linear mixed‑effects models.\nResults: Significant improvements were noted in all outcome measures, with large effects for stress (η²ₚ = .26), depression (η²ₚ = .17), trait anxiety (η²ₚ = .16), medium effects for mindfulness (η²ₚ = .10), and quality of life (η²ₚ = .12), and small effects for state anxiety (η²ₚ = .03). There was a small but significant time x group interaction for dispositional mindfulness, where the digital colouring group experienced a greater increase in compared to the paper colouring group. \nConclusion: Digital colouring has notable benefits to dispositional mindfulness. Regardless of format, mindful colouring can improve student quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression and dispositional mindfulness, when carried out regularly over two weeks. Colouring shows promise as a low-cost and accessible way to improve wellbeing in a higher education setting that promotes positive engagement with digital technology.",

          "abstract": "Rhythmic structure enables precise temporal expectations that are essential to human communication, including speech and music. Computational models have been developed to account for how humans perceive, produce, and learn rhythmic sequences. However, it is unclear how different types of models relate to each other and how they can be evaluated. In this review and perspective, we discuss how three major classes of models – entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models – have been used to study rhythmic expectations. We critically assess each model class in terms of its level of explanation, the rhythmic behaviors it captures, its ability to account for learning and enculturation, and its ability to integrate other features, such as pitch. We show that entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models differ substantially in the aspects of rhythmic expectations they can capture. To move the field forward, we propose that model comparison and integration are crucial. We identify key challenges to this effort, such as the varying nature of the input and output signals and divergent modeling goals. To address these challenges, we arrive at several practical recommendations: to equate input and output signals when comparing models, to consider several model outcomes beyond goodness-of-fit measures in model evaluation, to use model-integration efforts to inform theory building, and to make code and data openly accessible. Ultimately, understanding how models of rhythmic expectations relate, and how features in these models account for behavior, neural, and cognitive aspects of rhythmic expectations, will deepen our understanding of a core aspect of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Recognizing emotional expressions is important for successful social interactions. Prior research has demonstrated that emotion recognition is influenced by evaluative associations people have with different social categories. Here, we systematically investigate whether reinforcement learning can modify social category biases in emotion recognition. Previous research has shown that reinforcement learning is a promising method for altering evaluative associations. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we replicated that the Happy Face Advantage is influenced by social category membership. People were faster at recognizing happiness as happiness than anger as anger⁠ for White–Dutch faces, while no difference was found for Moroccan–Dutch faces. In Experiments 2–3 (Ntotal = 144), we used a reinforcement learning go/no-go task, in which people learned to act to images of Moroccan–Dutch faces to obtain rewards and to not act to images of White–Dutch faces to avoid punishments before participating in the emotion recognition task. Results show that reinforcement learning influences emotion recognition. Instead of the commonly observed interaction effect between social category and expression valence (e.g., in Experiment 1 and previous work), we consistently found a main effect of valence on emotion recognition. These findings suggest that aligning (in)actions with rewards/punishments changes emotion recognition.",

          "abstract": "A central purpose of exploration is to reduce goal-relevant uncertainty. Consequentially, individuals often explore by focusing on areas of uncertainty in the environment. However, people sometimes adopt the opposite strategy, one of avoiding uncertainty. How are the conflicting tendencies to approach and avoid uncertainty reconciled in human exploration? We hypothesized that the balance between avoiding and approaching uncertainty can be understood by considering capacity constraints. Accordingly, people are expected to approach uncertainty in most cases, but to avoid it when overall uncertainty is highest. To test this, we developed a new task and used modeling to compare human choices to a range of plausible policies. The task required participants to learn the statistics of a simulated environment by active exploration. On each trial, participants chose to explore a better-known or lesser-known option. Participants generally chose to approach uncertainty, however, when overall uncertainty about the choice options was highest, they instead avoided uncertainty and chose to sample better-known objects. This strategy was associated with faster decisions and, despite reducing the rate of observed information, it did not impair learning. We suggest that balancing approaching and avoiding uncertainty reduces the cognitive costs of exploration in a resource-rational manner.",

Across three experiments, we gave U.S. Democrat and Republican voters (N=5,230) a chance to lie anonymously to double their own or another participant’s earnings. For selfish dishonesty (Experiment 1), people lied equally to benefit themselves regardless of whether it harmed an in-group or out-group member. For coalitional dishonesty (Experiment 2), however, people lied significantly more to benefit in-group than out-group members (9 percentage-points), despite not personally benefiting from lying. Experiment 3 successfully replicated these findings, and revealed that people overestimated out-group dishonesty more than in-group dishonesty. In conclusion, intergroup coalitional dishonesty drives moral decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Emotion characteristics, like emotion intensity and perceived emotion controllability, shape how individuals regulate their emotions. While the link between emotion characteristics and emotion regulation strategies seems clear-cut for some strategies, findings are mixed for others. This study proposes that emotion regulation choice may be best understood in a non-linear framework, where individuals may not regulate emotions of low intensity and/or high controllability, because these emotions require little regulation, but also not emotions of high intensity and/or low controllability, because these emotions may be perceived as  overwhelming and difficult to regulate. To test this hypothesis, we used data from a 60-day diary study in 79 adults (mean age = 22.29, SD = 6.08, 84% identified as female), who every evening reported on emotion characteristics (emotion intensity and controllability) and strategy use (distraction, rumination, reappraisal, expression, suppression, relaxation). In addition to single strategies, we also examined daily emotion regulation variability (i.e., the extent to which individuals vary in multiple strategies across time). We replicate some linear findings, including that expression, relaxation, and rumination were used with emotions of increasing intensity and uncontrollablility (for expression only). Importantly, we also provide novel evidence for non-linear relations, where suppression and reappraisal were used with emotions of average intensity and controllability, and less with emotions relatively low or high in intensity and controllability. In addition, individuals showed higher emotion regulation variability when emotions were relatively low or high in intensity and controllability. These findings combined highlight the value of considering non-linear relations when studying emotion regulation choice in daily life - both of single strategies and variability across multiple strategies.",

          "abstract": "For many, flavour is the quintessential multisensory experience. The experience of flavour arises from inputs across a wide variety of sensory modalities, including but not limited to taste, smell, sound, several somatosensory channels as well as a range of other anticipatory cues that trigger expectations about the flavour object (visual, smell through the nose, context, etcetera). The regulation of inevitable mismatches between these bundles of inputs is necessary not only for these to converge into a unitary flavour percept but also to determine a hedonic response by the consumer. Remarkably, a framework to understand the regulation of incongruities across levels of the flavour experience is lacking. Here, we draw on a range of evidence to propose that the theoretical framework of conflict monitoring, which is well established in other areas of human cognition, could plausibly extend to encompass flavour-related phenomena. More specifically, we argue that brain mechanisms monitoring for, signalling, and eventually orchestrating the resolution of discrepancies between cues are decisive for the emergence of a unified flavour percept, and its associated evaluation by consumers. This framework helps elucidate well-documented facets of the experience of flavour and suggests promising avenues for research both in the laboratory and in the consumer industry.",

          "abstract": "The Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm demonstrates that false memories can be elicited by presenting semantically related words centered around a common theme. In recent years, the scope of false memory research has expanded beyond verbal materials to include visual, imaginative, and autobiographical stimuli. Given that humans rely heavily on visual perception in everyday life, examining visual false memories through perceptual paradigms is of critical importance. Biological motion—dynamic visual information depicting human movement—offers a particularly powerful tool for studying visual perception due to its social relevance and ecological validity. However, no prior research has explored false memory formation using biological motion stimuli. The present study investigated whether false memories can be induced in visual perception using biological motion displays as both targets and critical lures. Thirty-five university students (18 female, 17 male) participated in two experimental sessions. During encoding, participants viewed 35 biological motion stimuli and were later tested on recognition among 49 stimuli. Results revealed that false memories can indeed be generated through biological motion. Interestingly, participants were more accurate at correctly rejecting unseen stimuli, and detection performance improved with higher confidence ratings. Overall, the findings suggest that biological motion can reliably elicit false memories, albeit to a lesser extent in high-confidence conditions. Crucially, these results indicate that observing an action can lead to confident yet erroneous claims of having observed a different action. This study is the first to demonstrate false memory formation within the domain of biological motion perception, offering a novel direction for future research on memory and action observation.",

To better capture its dynamic nature, we propose a shift from viewing acculturation as solely an individual-level adjustment to understanding it as a socially embedded and interaction-driven phenomenon. Building on recent insights from interacting minds, cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, and cultural psychology, we examine how shared cultural meanings are formed and reshaped through everyday interactions between immigrants and non-immigrant residents. We also emphasize the importance of methodological innovation, including naturalistic paradigms, social network analysis, and computational simulations in disentangling the complicated mechanisms underlying acculturation. In addition, by extending the scope of inquiry to less frequently studied migratory flows across regions beyond the classical East-West framework, future work should call for more globally attuned and multidimensional models of cultural adaptation. Together, these perspectives offer a path toward a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of acculturation processes.",

          "abstract": "In our folk psychology, which cognitive attitude that we ascribe is primary? Tra-ditionally, in epistemology and in Theory of Mind research in cognitive science, it was assumed that belief is the primary cognitive attitude, and that knowledge is second-ary, derived from belief (as justified true belief). More recent Knowledge First Episte-mology and Factive Theory of Mind accounts claim the revers: knowledge ascription is primary relative to belief ascription. Various sources of evidence are adduced in favor of these accounts, among them reaction time asymmetries: adults have been found to be faster to ascribe knowledge than belief to other agents. The present study tested whether these effects are robust and really indicate an asymmetry between knowledge and belief ascription. An alternative possibility is that subjects were merely faster in ascribing simpler, non-propositional states of information access relative to full-fledged, meta-representational, propositional belief ascription. To test for this possibility, subjects were asked about the knowledge or beliefs of agents in situations that did or did not involve fine-grained aspectual scenarios that require full-blown propositional belief and knowledge ascription. Across three studies, subjects (N~ 5000‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍) were faster to ascribe knowledge than belief across conditions and task variations that controlled for pragmatic and lexical frequency effects. Taken together, these studies present converging evidence that knowledge ascription is primary rela-tive to belief ascription and thus speak for Factive Theory of Mind accounts.",

We contextualise states such as the jhānas within this process, drawing on both Buddhist theoretical frameworks and contemporary phenomenological understanding. We take a step towards ‘translating’ Buddhist meditation-based phenomenology into computational neurophenomenology. We demonstrate how Buddhist defabrication can be understood as a deconstructive process driving inference ever lower in an agent’s hierarchical generative model by the repeated release of mental tensing associated with clinging and aversion. We cast this release of mental tensing as corresponding to a hierarchical level-specific reduction in belief precision, permitting the interpretation of Buddhist notions such as equanimity and meditative stillness under AIF. We then illustrate the deconstruction process up to its conclusion in a cessation of phenomenal experience, touching on how states traversed during the process may inform areas related to core-knowledge structuring and the generation of experience.",

However, nationally representative samples that allow for accurate estimates of prevalence and relation to mental health are scarce. \nMethods: We conducted a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey in Australia and New Zealand (N=2640). Sampling was stratified by age, gender, ancestry/ethnicity, region and income. Two pre-registered questions were analysed to explore participants’ engagement in contemplative practices and associations to psychological distress and mental healthcare use. We used posthoc regression analyses to further clarify relationships between variables.\nResults: Overall, 70% of participants engaged in contemplative practices over the past year, most commonly meditation (31%), relaxation (25%), breathing techniques (24%), and yoga (21%). Improving health and wellbeing were the primary motivations for practice. All contemplative practice users reported significantly higher psychological distress and mental healthcare use than non-practitioners (p’s&lt;.05). Adjusting for socio-demographic differences removed associations with distress among yoga and relaxa-tion practitioners (βrelaxation=.02, βyoga=−.03, n.s.). For meditators, the association disap-peared when we accounted for mental healthcare use (βmeditation=.01, n.s.). Breathing practice was associated with increased distress in all models (βbreathing=.04–.11, p’s&lt;.05). Notably, meditators and relaxation practitioners with unmet healthcare needs reported less distress than non-practitioners with unmet needs (dmeditation=0.38, drelaxa-tion=0.35). \nConclusion: Contemplative practices are widespread among Australians and New Zealanders and may play a complementary and/or alternative role in managing mental health. Further research is needed to study their complex associations with mental health, and which types of contemplative practices are beneficial and safe for whom.",

          "abstract": "Social media use has become a near-universal feature of modern life, offering many opportunities for connection and self-presentation. Yet, certain patterns of use have been implicated in poorer psychological outcomes. Further, evidence suggests that individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may be particularly drawn to certain social media behaviours as a means of coping with distress. The present study aimed to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties predict patterns of social media use and, in turn, symptoms of depression and anxiety. We examined four distinct types of social media use: (1) image management-based, (2) social comparison-based, (3) negative engagement-based, and (4) passive consumption-based. Sampling 548 adults aged 18 to 84 years (Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.37; 401 (73.2%) female; 128 (23.2%) male), we tested a structural equation model to examine whether the four distinct types of social media use mediated links between difficulties in emotion regulation at Time 1 and depression and anxiety symptomology at Time 2, one week later. Results suggested that, when controlling for age, difficulties in emotion regulation significantly predicted all types of social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety over one week. Only comparison-based social media use predicted anxiety symptoms over time, with no other types of social media use significantly predicting these symptoms. The model explained 50.1% of the variance in depression symptoms and 52.1% of the variance in anxiety symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest the critical importance of emotion regulation over and above social media use in shaping mental health.",

          "abstract": "This study tested whether Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom misread public support for climate policies and whether this perception gap can be corrected. Given MPs’ central role in shaping policy direction, underestimation of public support for climate action could carry serious consequences for climate progress and for representative democracy, but remains understudied. In an online survey–experiment with current MPs (N=100), participants’ estimated support for four climate policies under both neutral and cost-salient descriptions were compared with nationally representative polling. MPs significantly underestimated public support, and underestimated public willingness to accept financial impacts of climate policies. This study also offered novel evidence that MPs exaggerated partisan polarisation and formed significantly larger underestimation of support among Conservative voters. Offering original evidence of Spiral of Silence in Parliament, lower perceived support was associated with lower willingness to advocate for a pricing policy. Results indicated significantly larger underestimation of public support in politicians opposed to a climate policy, but even supportive politicians underestimate on average. Bayesian estimation suggested a moderate effect of a norm-based intervention on underestimation reduction, although results were inconclusive under frequentist tests. These findings suggest that misperceptions of others’ preferences within Parliament are structured in a way that can actively discourage climate advocacy, by presenting public opinion on climate policy as weaker and more polarised than it is. By highlighting gaps between public demand and elite perception, the study identifies a tractable barrier to climate action and democratic responsiveness.",

How such beliefs form or change across the lifespan is largely unknown, although theory suggests that beliefs become more negative after disruptive events. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test whether dramatic world changes and personal adversity affect beliefs. \nMETHOD: In a longitudinal, quasi-experimental, pre-registered design, 529 US participants (51% female, 76% White) provided ratings of primals before and several months after pandemic onset, and information about personal adversity (e.g., losing family, financial hardship). Data was compared to 398 participants without experience of the pandemic. \nRESULTS: The average person in our sample showed no change in 23 of the 26 primals, including Safe, in response to the early pandemic, and only saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Higher adversity, however, was associated with slight declines in some beliefs. One limitation is that participants were exclusively American. \nCONCLUSION: Primals were remarkably stable during the initial shock wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic, supporting a view of primals as stable lenses through which people interpret the world.",

To assess whether this gap persists, we conducted a large-scale content analysis of three leading well-being journals. We scraped all abstracts published up to September 2024 (n = 3,094), then used large language models (GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0) for systematic screening. Articles flagged as potentially relevant were reviewed manually. Only 18 articles (0.6%) substantively focused on the topic. Out of these, 8 (0.3%) addressed topics related to minority groups, 6 (0.2%) negative aspects of sexuality such as abuse, and 4 (0.1%) general positive or neutral aspects. Sexuality remains underexplored in well-being science. Integrating it is essential for a complete understanding of human flourishing. We call for a paradigm shift: to move beyond silence toward a research agenda that embraces sexuality as a vital dimension of well-being.",

          "authors": "Christopher N. Wahlheim; Geoff Ward; Samuel Cox",
          "abstract": "Memory for an earlier event can be impaired by later studying a related event (retroactive interference). However, when later events cue retrievals of earlier events that also enable integrative encoding, memory for the earlier event can be enhanced (retroactive facilitation). Two experiments using continuous A-B, A-C paired-associate tasks examined retroactive memory effects across lags and retention intervals. We indexed study-phase retrieval and integrative encoding by examining associations between awareness of changes and memory for first responses. Participants studied A-B, A-C, and retention-interval-matched A-B pairs and indicated when they detected response changes. The lag between A-B and A-C and the retention interval between A-C and test trials varied factorially across 4, 16, and 48 intervening items. Cued-recall test formats differed: Experiment 1 prompted direct retrieval of first responses, with participants reporting recollected changes. Experiment 2 used modified-modified free recall in which participants reported responses as they came to mind and indicated whether they were the first, second, or only responses; the first two decisions indicated recollection of changes. Both experiments showed the greatest retroactive facilitation at the longest retention interval and intermediate lag. Retroactive facilitation co-occurred with and was statistically associated with detection and recollection of changes, suggesting these processes contributed to the observed effect. Negatively curvilinear, non-monotonic lag functions occurred for A-B, A-C recall at the longest retention interval and were associated with detected changes, especially those not recollected. These findings may be accounted for by a memory-for-change framework with a role for contextual variability that determines study-phase retrieval success.",

          "abstract": "Forming a long-term memory requires changes in neuronal transcription.  What happens, though, as the memory is forgotten?  And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory?  To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica.  Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible.  We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017).  Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018).  Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust.  Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting.  Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression.  We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.",

In this study, we developed the Big Three-Mini, a nine-item instrument designed to assess the three fundamental dimensions of character — heart, mind, and will — based on McGrath's Big Three of Character model. Using data from 27,000 participants across 27 countries, items were selected from the VIA Inventory of Strengths using Ant Colony Optimization to maximize cross-cultural measurement invariance. The resulting Big Three-Mini demonstrated metric invariance across all but one country comparison and scalar invariance across nearly half of them. Exploratory analyses using World Values Survey indicators revealed meaningful associations between the Big Three-Mini dimensions and national well-being. These findings demonstrate that metaheuristic optimization can produce a concise, cross-culturally comparable measure of character, providing a practical tool for international studies on values and flourishing.",

          "abstract": "A necessary prerequisite for the accumulation of beneficial knowledge, aka cumulative cultural evolution, is the sharing of information via social learning. Yet little work in the field of cultural evolution has examined the mechanisms that support information sharing in the face of exploitative information free-riding and information hoarding. We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to engage in costly innovation, and whether to share the resultant knowledge. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing, and participants could use reputations to select recipients of knowledge. Study 1 found, in participants from the UK and China, high levels of information sharing but only weak partner choice. Study 2 replicated this finding with various methodological improvements. Study 3 showed that participants used partner choice to exclude non-sharing artificial bots from receiving information. Study 4 found that when partner choice was not possible, preferences for information sharing declined to comparable levels as non-sharing. Overall, our findings provide tentative positive experimental evidence that partner choice can facilitate information sharing and enable cumulative cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Affective valence and reinforcement learning (RL) are increasingly recognized to be closely connected, yet the exact nature of their relationship remains unclear. Here, we investigated how RL-related computations contribute to affective valence and how affective valence contributes to RL. Applying an original computational method, we found that affective experience during RL is best explained by a combination of three prominent theoretical perspectives: valence is determined by reward, prediction errors, and counterfactual comparisons. To account for these findings, we hypothesized that the valence of affective responses represents (i.e., encodes, tracks) the value of the eliciting stimulus, and contributes to RL alongside reward per se. We confirmed this hypothesis across three RL tasks, showing that decision-makers prefer choice options associated with more positive affect in addition to preferring options associated with greater reward. Altogether, our results establish a unifying model of the valence-RL relationship with key implications for the mechanisms of affective experience and human RL. Moreover, they validate a powerful new computational framework for future research on these topics.",

          "abstract": "Open science (OS) practices are increasingly integrated into undergraduate psychology curricula. While OS can enhance students’ scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes toward research, its teaching also introduces challenges. This narrative review synthesizes published experiences and recommendations concerning OS education for undergraduate psychology students, identifying common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate them. Eleven pitfalls were identified: the overwhelming variety of OS practices, high technical demands, substantial time investment, insufficient support, perceived competitive disadvantage, potential disengagement, worries about public mistakes, inconsistencies between teaching and practice, risks of academic misconduct, erosion of trust in science, and inclusivity concerns. To address these challenges, educators are encouraged to scaffold learning through replication and preregistration exercises, create authentic assignments, foster collaboration and student authorship, increase feedback literacy and epistemic humility, embed OS across the curriculum, and pay attention to inclusivity. We conclude that teaching OS to undergraduates is both feasible and valuable, provided educators anticipate its challenges and make deliberate pedagogical choices. Viewing OS as a buffet of practices rather than a prescriptive set of rules can help align educational choices with course goals and student readiness. The availability of open educational resources and international teaching communities further supports the integration of OS into undergraduate psychology education, allowing students to experience firsthand the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and rigorous scientific practice.",

Higher-order (HO) theories of consciousness seek to explain how mental states that are conscious differ from those that are not.  That would tell us what it is for a mental state to be conscious.  All HO theories rest on the commonsense observation that whenever a mental state is conscious, one is in some way aware of being in that state.  So they see awareness of being in a mental state as a necessary condition for that state to be conscious.  The reliance on this condition distinguishes HO theories from other theories of consciousness.  There are several versions of a HO theory, which differ mainly in how they explain our awareness of mental states when those states are conscious.",

We leveraged meta-analytically synthesized data from the extant research to test a mediational model specifying indirect effects of trait self-control on health behavior mediated by social cognition theory constructs and intention as a candidate mechanism. We also tested effects of moderators on model effects: behavior control process (impulsive vs. reflective), behavior type, trait self-control and behavior measure type, and measurement lag. Method: Studies reporting relations among trait self-control, social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control), intention, and health behavior were identified in a systematic database search. Our proposed model was fit to the pooled correlation matrix among these variables using multilevel meta-analytic structural equation modeling. Results: Findings supported model predictions including indirect effects of trait self-control on health behavior directed through attitude, perceived behavioral control, and intentions, and a residual direct effect indicating partial mediation. Moderator analysis revealed larger direct and indirect trait self-control-health behavior effects in studies targeting behaviors under impulsive process control relative to those under reflective control. Analyses of behavior type, behavior and self-control measure type and measurement lag moderators did not reveal systematic variation in model effects. Conclusion: Findings provide preliminary support for the model signaling a candidate mechanism for trait self-control-health behavior relations and providing prior effect size and variability estimates that could be expected in future studies. Impulse-related behaviors represent a key moderating condition that magnifies trait self-control-behavior effects.",

Results show that anger consistently exceeded fear across all regions, indicating that the conflict primarily evoked mobilizing rather than paralyzing emotional responses. Russia showed substantially lower levels of both emotions than other regions, while no significant differences emerged among the U.S., NATO countries, and Ukraine despite their varying proximity to the conflict.

Here we investigate naturally occurring memory distortions using the largest known dataset of narrative recall, comprising hundreds of spoken recollections. Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

          "abstract": "Relatively stable personality traits shape people’s motivations and attitudes, and their potential effect on pro-environmental attitudes and resulting behaviours can accumulate over time. However, narrow personality traits—nuances that tend to provide stronger and more refined associations with various outcomes—have received little attention in relation to pro-environmental attitudes. Furthermore, research has almost exclusively focused on self-reports that are prone to biases. This suggests that the associations between personality traits and pro-environmental attitudes have likely been underestimated. We collected participants' self- and informant-reports of narrow personality nuances and broad Big Five domains from three samples (Estonian, N = 20,926; Russian, N = 762; English, N = 600). This allowed us to estimate their true correlation (rtrue) with and predictive accuracy (rtruepred) for pro-environmental attitudes, while controlling for single-method, occasion-specific, and random errors and estimating the findings’ generalizability. The rtrues were higher than self-reports-based correlations, and nuances had larger effect sizes than domains. In the largest sample, the Openness (rtrue = .35) and Agreeableness domains (rtrue = .27) had the highest rtrues with pro-environmental attitudes. However, a range of nuances had even stronger rtrues , primarily those reflecting progressive views, care for other people, and appreciation of art. The combined predictive accuracy of nuances for pro-environmental attitudes reached nearly rtruepred = .60, even with only three “top” nuances; the domains’ predictive accuracy was lower (rtruepred = .50). The findings replicated well across samples and suggest that pro-environmental attitudes are linked with personality traits more strongly and in more nuanced ways than previously thought.",

Specifically, we presented children with pictures and books that were initially upright to them, and we asked children to show those pictures and books to people who faced the children (i.e., whose perspectives on the pictures and books were opposite those of the children). Across experiments, we found that young children spontaneously oriented pictures and books so that those objects appeared upright to their social partners. Whereas classic research suggests that young children are egocentric, these findings suggest that young children are sensitive to the visual experiences of their social partners. These findings support the possibility that, from early in development, children engage in mental state reasoning to better cooperate with and communicate to their social partners.",

The results suggested common genetic influences underlying alcohol abuse/dependence and antisocial behavior. In addition, cotwins of female probands reported more conduct problems than cotwins of male probands, suggesting that affected females both require and transmit a higher liability for antisocial behavior than do affected males. Despite sex differences for liability and -- to some extent -- in the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental influences, the specific genetic and environmental influences on conduct problems appeared to be the same in both sexes. Analyses ignoring birth cohort suggested that twin similarity for childhood and adolescent conduct problems was due mainly to genetic influences with minimal shared environmental influences. In contrast, birth cohort differences were found for the number of conduct problems reported, as well as for the genetic and shared environmental influences underlying these problems. Genetic influences were of greater magnitude in older cohorts, whereas shared environmental influences were of considerable magnitude only in younger cohorts. These findings suggest that secular trends in societal factors (e.g., increased poverty, community violence, and substance abuse in more recent generations) may have resulted in specific shared environmental influences that increase the similarity for antisocial behavior among family members differing in genetic liability.",

          "abstract": "Fairness is a fundamental social norm guiding human decision-making. Yet much of our empirical understanding of fairness-related choices are derived from controlled laboratory studies with homogenous student samples, raising concerns about the ecological validity of experimental findings. Here, we tackle this challenge by introducing a citizen science, lab-in-the-field approach, embedding a classic fairness paradigm, the Ultimatum Game (UG), in a well-visited public space within a community: a museum. Over the course of 13 months, we recorded &gt;18,672 decisions from a heterogenous sample of volunteer members of the public. Each participant responded to four allocation offers from an anonymous proposer (two generous, two selfish), with the option to view proposers’ past behaviour (previously generous vs. selfish), before deciding whether to accept or reject each offer. Results closely replicated classic UG effects, with unfair offers frequently rejected, confirming the presence of inequality aversion beyond the laboratory. Notably, the majority of participants chose to sample proposer-history information, and those who did showed heightened sensitivity to fairness violations, demonstrating that judgements of unfairness are shaped by expectations which emerge from voluntary information sampling. Furthermore, the ecologically enriched design helped uncover temporal and demographic patterns, namely an association between time-of-day and information-seeking behaviour, and an increased willingness to accept unfairness across age. By situating a foundational experimental paradigm in a community venue, our methodological approach provides a scalable model for studying decision-making in ecologically enhanced contexts and a framework for examining authentic behaviours beyond the laboratory, ultimately helping to deepen our understanding of the crucial norms that shape society.",

          "abstract": "In a pilot study using mouse tracking, men’s interpretation and weighting of global sexual (e.g., clothing style) and specific affective (e.g., facial expression) cues when judging women’s flirting intentions depended on two factors: (1) whether the men were sexually aroused and (2) whether the women’s sexual and affective cues were congruent or incongruent. Both reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) emerged as significant indicators of men’s overreliance on global cues (OGC) in the context of sexual flirting, as evidenced by their positive correlations with self-report trait measures of interpersonally problematic (e.g., disinhibited, exploitative) sexuality. In the present study, we sought to replicate these findings in a substantially larger sample, using a simplified key-press paradigm and focusing solely on RT and ER as dependent variables. In a preregistered online study with heterosexual men (N = 284), experimentally induced sexual arousal again increased the likelihood of OGC as a function of task difficulty, i.e., the (in)congruence between global sexual and specific affective cues displayed by a potential female flirting partner. While the main and interaction effects were replicated and a meaningful pattern of correlations emerged between the experimental measures and self-report measures of dispositional risk factors for sexually problematic behavior, a somewhat different moderation pattern by these individual differences was observed. Taken together, the simplified paradigm proved largely successful and appears promising for diagnostic applications in forensic and clinical contexts.",

This study took a within-person perspective to explore their day-to-day relations and the moderating role of self-transcendence values in strengthening such associations.\nMethod: We employed a daily diary design and recruited 60 Italian young adults (Mean Age = 25.8; SD = 3.6; Women = 58%) who reported their behavior once a day over 21 days.\nResults: Using Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling, we found no significant day-to-day spillover effect of PB and PEB. However, we identified significant same-day positive associations, namely, on days when individuals engaged in PB, they also showed higher than usual levels of PEB. Additionally, we found positive carryover effects in both PB and PEB, suggesting that young adults are likely to persist in their daily prosocial and pro-environmental efforts. No significant cross-level interaction between self-transcendence values and the spillover effect from PB to PEB was found.\nConclusion: The findings provide new insights into young adults’ daily engagement in prosocial and pro-environmental behaviors, highlighting the role of day-to-day within-person changes, while accounting for stable, between-person differences in behavioral and motivational tendencies.\nKeywords: Pro-environmental behavior, Prosocial behavior; Young adults; Experience Sampling Methods; Spillover; Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Older adults (≥60 years) often report better mental health than younger cohorts but may be more vulnerable to natural hazards due to limited mobility and injury risk. This meta-analysis examined mental disorder prevalences among older adults post-hazard and compared them to younger populations.\nMethods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies published from inception to October 2024. Eligible studies focused on ICD-/DSM-based mental disorders ≥1 month post-hazard and reported prevalence estimates or odds ratio (OR) for age-related differences in prevalences (i.e., in adults ≥60 years vs. &lt;60 years). Random-effects models were used for all analyses.\nResults: Thirty-eight studies (N = 29,342 older adults; N = 41,575 younger adults) were included. PTSD prevalence in older adults was 17.43% (95% CI [8.48%; 32.48%], k = 8, I2 = 97.10%) in the first year post-hazard and 10.07% (95% CI [6.32%; 17.45%], k = 14, I2 = 96.10%) in long-term assessments (range 15 months to 17 years). MDD prevalence (combined across time points) was 4.70% (95% CI [1.76; 12.00], k = 7, I2 = 92.60%). Older adults were not significantly more likely than younger adults to meet PTSD criteria in the first year post-hazard (OR = 1.22, 95% CI [0.80, 1.84], k = 12, p = .324, I2 = 70.00%) or in its long-term aftermath (OR = 1.24, 95% CI [76.38, 2.04], k = 9, I2 = 73.50%, p = .329). Heterogeneity was substantial across all analyses (I2 &gt; 70%). Data for MDD-related comparisons were limited, and information on other mental disorders than PTSD and MDD in this population was scarcely reported.\nConclusions: PTSD and MDD prevalences were elevated in older adults post-hazard but similar to younger adults. More research is needed on other mental disorders and age-related moderators of post-disaster mental health.",

          "abstract": "The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model is a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes a modifiable health-determining construct, identity state, defined by three domains hypothesized to all stem from identification of the core self with the physical body: 1) a self-concept that is inclusive of all living beings vs. exclusive based on physical attributes, 2) the perceived basis of the worth of all living beings as intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and 3) the degree of universally compassionate orientation toward all living beings. The identity state construct is theorized to act through modulating stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior to influence the causal relationship between social position-dependent stressors, biological aging, and age-related diseases. The IVP Scale (IVPS) was developed to empirically assess the hypotheses of the IVP framework and the utility of the identity state construct for population health research. This study provides the first description of the psychometric properties of the long (20-item) and short form (12-item) IVPS. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) of data from two separate samples of self-identified Black and White adults (aged 18-81) collected in 2021 and 2025 (total N=2,318). Associations between the IVPS and related constructs of optimism and resilience were examined to establish construct validity. EFA supported a unidimensional structure and CFA confirmed good model fit for both IVPS measures. Both scales are significantly positively correlated with indicators of optimism and resilience and significantly negatively correlated with social dominance orientation. These initial findings suggest the IVPS-20 and the IVPS-Short are valid and psychometrically sound scales.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

          "authors": "Joshua D. Wright",
          "abstract": "Categorizing oneself as a member of a group involves merging ones’ sense of self with the group, such that the self becomes an interchangeable exemplar of the social category (Turner et al., 1987) and self-interest and ingroup interests become interchangeable (Brewer, 2010). Because of this, social identification is associated with ingroup favoritism and behaviors that support the ingroup (Brewer, 1999; Brown, 2000). However, we suggest that some of the variance generally explained by social identification may be better explained by the concept of psychological ownership—feelings of ownership for place (Verkuyten &amp; Martinović, 2017), which implies the right to control use or access (Furby, 1978). In Study 1, I demonstrate the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the South is a better predictor of positive attitudes toward the Confederate battle flag than Southern identification. In Study 2, I provide further evidence of the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the United States is a better predictor of intentions to purchase American-made versus foreign-made products than is national identification.",

          "abstract": "Successful task-switching performance is thought to rely on inhibitory mechanisms suppressing no-longer-relevant tasks, indexed by the n–2 repetition cost. Recent work has shown that episodic retrieval contributes to this cost, confounding estimates of inhibition. This study examines age-related differences in the contributions of inhibition and episodic retrieval to the n–2 repetition cost using a paradigm that controls episodic interference. We also applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) to estimate latent processes underlying these effects. Results showed robust n–2 repetition costs for younger and older adults in response times which reduced when episodic interference was controlled. However, only younger adults showed this pattern in error rates. The DDM showed n–2 repetition costs and their modulation by episodic retrieval were isolated to drift rates, reflecting changes in evidence accumulation. Only younger adults' drift rates were affected by episodic retrieval, with n–2 repetition costs reduced under episodic match conditions. Older adults showed n–2 repetition costs in drift rate regardless of episodic match, suggesting age-related differences in episodic retrieval at the latent level. The results provide insight into age-related differences in inhibition, the importance of controlling episodic retrieval effects in task switching, and the value of computational modelling in revealing age-related differences.",

          "abstract": "To enable human living within planetary boundaries is among the biggest challenges of our time. In this context the question emerges how consuming less can go along with subjective wellbeing. Analysing meaning construction of pro-environmental behaviour might offer insights regarding this relationship. Based on the hierarchical model of meaning the current study aimed to investigate meaning construction of behaviours that mitigate resource consumption which we call sufficiency behaviour. Therefore, we analyzed survey data with N = 544 participants. Path-analysis revealed intrinsic motivation for repairing, curtailment and sharing to be related to hedonic wellbeing and behaviour frequency mediated by ascribed behavioural meaning. Intrinsic motivation did partially regress on altruistic and biospheric values. We found no significant relationship between sufficiency behaviour and life satisfaction or presence of meaning in life. We conclude that finding meaning in behaviour is important for behaviour frequency as well as experienced behavioural wellbeing. Choosing alternatives to buying new products seems to be perceived as meaningful when it is intrinsically motivated. Biospheric and altruistic values might constitute sources for the intrinsic motivation to develop. Taken together, these results illustrate how less consumption might positively connect to wellbeing. Future research should explore ways how meaningfulness of sufficiency behaviour can be fostered.",

          "abstract": "Precise norm scores are essential for psychological diagnostics. While conventional norming estimates norms based on subgroups, continuous norming uses regression to estimate norms based on the entire sample. One consequence of this is that continuous norming achieves a comparable precision with smaller sample sizes compared to conventional norming. However, clear guidelines on the required sample sizes for continuous norming are scarce. To provide empirically based guidance for determining required sample sizes in normative studies using continuous norming, we used normative data from two intelligence tests to evaluate the precision of continuous norms across various sample sizes, norm predictor values, and latent trait levels. Results show that continuous norms can achieve similar precision as conventional norms with substantially smaller samples (N = 1,000–1,500 vs. N = 2,500–3,000). However, precision declines at extreme percentiles and norm predictor values, emphasizing the need to tailor sample size planning to the specific test.",

          "abstract": "A central feature of consciousness is the association between external events and subjective experiences of content. These experiences range from low level (detection) to high level (identification). For example, a visual experience may range from seeing something on a computer screen (detection) to seeing the digit 3 (identification). In research, neural processes that correlate with these experiences are called neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). In vision, a candidate NCC is the visual awareness negativity (VAN) that is derived from event-related potentials, occurring about 200 ms after stimulus onset over posterior electrode sites. Previous research suggests that VAN is more sensitive to low-level experiences (detection) than high-level experiences (identification). Because previous results are limited, two preregistered experiments were conducted. In both experiments, two separate staircases continuously adjusted stimulus opacity to either detection- or identification thresholds. Detection awareness referred to experiencing something rather than nothing. Identification awareness referred to experiencing the identity of the stimulus rather than not experiencing its identity. Experiment 1 (N = 30) showed that VAN was similarly sensitive to detection awareness and identification awareness. This was shown for a digit task and for a letter task. Experiment 2 (N = 28) used the same digit task as in Experiment 1 with two stimulus sizes. Results found identification VAN for both digit sizes, and VAN was unaffected by stimulus size. These results confirm the sensitivity of VAN to both low-level experiences (detection) and high-level experiences (identification). However, results emphasize the limited specificity of VAN in separating between low-level and high-level experiences, suggested by the similarity of VAN in both conditions.",

Practitioners who had\npublished in peer reviewed journals and/or presented at Association for Contextual\nBehavioral Science conferences on CB supervision in the last 20 years were invited to take\npart in a Delphi study to find consensus: 20 participants provided responses to an open-ended\nonline questionnaire on CB supervision. A reflexive thematic analysis, within a qualitative\nresearch design, was used to interpret common ideas and themes within the data. Through\nanalysis, four main themes were generated: contextual factors, tasks and behaviors,\nsupervision qualities, and supervision purposes. A further round to find consensus was then\nconducted, with participants providing ratings of statements based on these themes in an\nonline survey. Consensus ratings indicated that functional analysis and experiential learning\nmethods appeared to be central to the practice of CB supervision. Overall, participants\ndescribed features of CB supervision, which were both consistent with existing ideas on CB\nsupervision and contextual behavioral science, as well as clinical supervision more broadly.\nThe results serve to inform future research in the area.",

          "abstract": "Cultivated meat is an emerging food innovation with the potential to transform food systems, raising important ethical, social, and sustainability considerations. Including consumer perspectives is essential to understand which cultivated meat attributes drive acceptance and satisfaction, highlighting the need to study specific products rather than the category as a whole. This study presents the first exploratory application of the widely validated Kano model to explore consumer classification of seven key cultivated meat products’ attributes, their impact on satisfaction, and potential differences across dietary groups.   Two products were examined: a cultivated burger and cultivated foie gras, including a willingness-to-try assessment using realistic product images provided by companies. A total of 107 conference attendees representing diverse nationalities and dietary patterns participated. Results indicate that attribute classification differs both within and across products. Price and protein content emerged as attractive attributes for all consumers. Taste parity was valued mainly by meat-eaters for the more familiar burger, while vegan labelling was considered one-dimensional by non-meat-eaters, especially vegans. No must-be attributes were identified, suggesting consumer expectations for cultivated meat are not yet fully formed. Attributes such as appearance resemblance, country of origin, and those drawing policy attention, like labelling products as “meat” or “foie gras”, were largely perceived as indifferent. These findings underscore the product and consumer- specific nature of cultivated meat acceptance \nand the value of incorporating consumer perspectives early in product development. The Kano model proved effective in classifying attributes, providing insights for both theoretical understanding and practical decision-making in this innovative sector.",

The effect of pharmacological treatments on suicide-related outcomes is inconsistent. Although the main approach to evaluate effectiveness, randomised controlled trials may not provide externally valid results for suicide prevention in psychiatric populations. We aimed to synthesise the evidence and assess the medication effects on suicide outcomes from observational studies.\nMethods\nWe systematically searched eight databases from database inception to March 2025 for pharmacoepidemiological and other observational studies on suicide-related outcomes in people treated with the main types of psychotropic medications. We included primary studies involving adults with psychiatric diagnoses who were prescribed medication and a comparison sample with the same diagnosis without prescribed medication (between-individual studies) or the same individuals during a non-prescription period (within-individual studies). We excluded studies that did not report psychiatric diagnoses and selected samples (such as inpatients only). Outcomes were any suicide-related behaviour (self-harm, attempted suicide) and suicide mortality. We pooled effect sizes as odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR) or risk ratios (RR) using random-effects models and assessed study quality. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024515794.\nFindings\nWe identified 47 independent studies from 13 countries based on more than 6 million people (46.6% male). Across main diagnostic categories and 70 individual medications examined, strongest associations with suicide risks were found for second generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (OR range 0.35 to 0.75), lithium and divalproex/valproic acid in bipolar disorder (OR range 0.26 to 1.03), and SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants in depression (OR range 0.47-0.78). Benzodiazepines were associated with higher suicide risks in all diagnostic categories (OR range 1.57-5.47). There was evidence for publication bias for SSRIs in depression, leading to more papers reporting higher risks of suicide-related outcomes.\nInterpretation\nObservational studies suggest a role for psychotropic medication for suicide prevention in certain psychiatric disorders.",

The emotion category model, particularly sadness and disappointment, was consistently associated with neural event boundaries across the cortical hierarchy from early sensory areas to transmodal hubs in the default mode network, and aligned with behavioral segmentation at coarser temporal scales. These effects persisted after controlling for low- and high-level non-emotional features, underscoring the unique predictive value of emotion categories. Social salience cues, such as “collective presence,” also robustly predicted boundaries, suggesting complementary roles of emotional and social information.

(2022), which investigated the importance of individual and classroom characteristics for students' social integration in secondary mathematics classrooms. The original study showed that performance anxiety in mathematics was negatively related to subjective social integration and that performance self-concept and constructive support from teachers were positively related to social integration. Finally, it was shown that classroom characteristics could moderate these relationships. Teacher support was particularly important for the social integration of students with high achievement anxiety, and to a lesser extent, for the integration of students with low self-concept of mathematics ability. This study replicates and extends these findings. Using data from the IQB Trends in Education Study 2018, in which approximately 44,000 German ninth graders were surveyed, factors related to the operationalization of the constructs were identified that affect the replicability of the original study in this dataset. For this purpose, the replication study used different related measures for the concepts from the original study. Patterns in the effect sizes were identified using exploratory multiverse analyses. Across all analyses, a pattern of results comparable to the original study emerged for the main effects, albeit with smaller effect sizes. The interaction effect from the original study could not be replicated. Reasons for differences between original and replication study were mainly the operationalization of the construct of social integration. We discuss the value of replication studies and how multiverse analyses can be used to speed up the process of knowledge development.",

          "abstract": "Researchers analyzing intensive longitudinal data often aim to detect between-group differences in dynamics of psychological constructs, such as positive and negative affect. These constructs are usually latent (not directly observable). To validly compare groups of individuals in their dynamic processes, the latent constructs must be measured equally across the individuals. If this is not the case – that is, if measurement invariance is violated for some items – this partial non-invariance must be accounted for. Otherwise, the group-specific estimates of the dynamic process may be biased. To aid researchers in obtaining unbiased group-specific estimates despite partial measurement non-invariance, we present an extension of the Three-Step Latent Vector Autoregression, a novel method that separates the estimation of the measurement model and the structural model. We expand this method to multi-group modeling, where differences in structural parameters (e.g., regression coefficients) are captured by allowing these parameters to vary across the groups of individuals. Measurement heterogeneity between and within these groups is captured by group- or person-specific MM parameters. Through two simulation studies, we demonstrate that the method performs well in obtaining correct estimates of a dynamic process despite the presence of measurement heterogeneity. The method is further illustrated with an empirical example.",

          "abstract": "Self-other relationship is a fundamental component in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal components of self-other relationship can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. In this study, we aim to evaluate how individual differences in both intrapersonal and intersubjective traits influence the quality of friendship and the experience of loneliness. We hypothesize that the quality of friendships and the experience of loneliness arise not only from interpersonal factors, but also from distinct intrapersonal features of the individual. We administered a set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis was employed to confirm the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results confirmed that the intrapersonal factor has an important influence on the sociability of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and lockdown-related changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. A mediation analysis further showed that the effect of intrapersonal traits on loneliness was partially mediated by the participants’ friendships. Our results emphasize a central role of self-concept for social life quality. These findings further provide a new perspective for individuals in the general population with low social life quality and possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. Finally, our study also brings potential contributions to the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

          "abstract": "Humans can flexibly adjust how they make decisions to arbitrary goals. However, most theories in decision-making focus on predicting one specific choice type (i.e., choosing the best option). Here, we link decision-making and cognitive-control research to test a theory that accounts for flexible adjustments of choice mechanisms to different goals and demands. Our biologically inspired model specifies how different features translate into evidence for the current goal, and how evidence is mapped onto different output structures. We tested the model in an eye-tracking study in which participants were asked to choose one out of four consumer products or to appraise the entire set, each with respect to positive or negative value. The results confirmed our preregistered hypotheses that response time (RT) should decrease with the overall value of a set of options in choose-best but increase in choose-worst trials. As predicted, this interaction was absent in appraisal RT, which instead exhibited an inverted-U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, the amount of attention devoted to an option was positively related to its value in choose-best, negatively related in choose-worst trials, and unrelated when participants appraised entire sets of products. Time-resolved analyses of eye movements revealed strategic goal-dependent search processes, as attention is increasingly focused on goal-congruent options in choice but remains more uniformly distributed in appraisal. Our findings suggest that cognitive control shapes choice and search dynamics by flexibly adjusting them to current goals and demands.",

          "abstract": "Not all pro-environmental behaviors are created equal—some are vastly more effective at mitigating climate change than others. Do people judge more effective behaviors as proportionally morally superior? This question is important because moral motivations are powerful drivers of individual and collective action. Four studies (N = 5,334; three pre-registered) reveal a robust morality-effectiveness disconnect: Behaviors that rank better on objective climate mitigation potential rank worse on perceived morality. This disconnect is mediated by stronger personal support for less effective behaviors, and is weaker among individuals more interested in learning about environmental impacts. Study 3, a five-country experiment, reveals that explicitly labeling behaviors' impact reduces the disconnect by 68%, but does not eliminate it. Study 4 demonstrates that providing detailed information reverses the disconnect, leading people to judge more effective behaviors as proportionally more moral and increasing policy support relative to less effective behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescent mental health is deteriorating, and identifying those in need is challenging because of flawed assessments, flooded services, and low help-seeking by those most in need. A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed. We make recommendations for research and practice to improve how young people in need are identified and supported.",

          "abstract": "Statistics anxiety is a persistent barrier for psychology undergraduates, yet little qualitative work has explored how it is experienced in higher education. This study employed semi-structured interviews with twelve psychology students from Scottish universities to examine the lived experiences of statistics anxiety. Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four overarching themes were formulated: (1) Negative Prior Experiences with Mathematics, (2) Misconceptions of Course Content, (3) Fragility and Hypervigilance, and (4) Student-Tutor Interaction. The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt. Tutor communication, class size, and assumptions about baseline competence further shaped students’ experiences, intensifying anxiety. This research provides a nuanced investigation of how students conceptualise statistics in their psychology journey, and offers suggestions and recommendations for applied practice.",

          "abstract": "Trust is a critical factor in the acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs), but market data indicate that public trust in AVs remains suboptimal. Of all tested strategies, anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices, has gained attention. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes, from 5903 participants across seven databases, were included.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

The research explores their lived experiences within a collectivist and conservative society, addressing the psychological impacts of marginalization and the potential of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as a personal and communal resilience tool.\nEight Arab-Bedouin mental health professionals (five men, three women) participated in an eight-week MBSR program delivered in Arabic. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted before and after the program. A qualitative approach grounded in thematic analysis was employed to understand participants’ perspectives on mindfulness and its integration into their personal and professional lives.\nPre-program interviews revealed participants’ emotional burdens related to systemic exclusion, racism, and intra-community stereotypes, alongside reliance on family, religious practices, and connection to nature as coping strategies. Post-program findings highlighted improved emotional regulation, reduced reactivity, and greater presence in daily activities through mindfulness practices such as breathing exercises. Participants reported enhanced interpersonal relationships, including improved empathy and communication. While mindfulness was empowering on a personal level, its limitations in addressing systemic inequalities were acknowledged.\nThis study enriches existing literature on mindfulness in marginalized populations, highlighting its potential to empower Arab-Bedouins by fostering resilience and mitigating emotional burdens. Insights from this research underscore the importance of culturally sensitive interventions in supporting both personal and professional well-being in minority communities.",

          "abstract": "Love Island is a popular reality dating series that has faced significant criticism for consistently casting contestants with highly idealized bodies. There has been widespread concern that these casting choices may inadvertently pressure young viewers to internalize unrealistic body ideals and engage in body change strategies to conform to them. However, to date, no longitudinal research has explored this possibility. Using three-wave panel data collected during the 2023 series of Love Island UK (N = 344; M age = 20.42, SD = 1.98), this study examined the reciprocal within-person relationships between body pressure from watching Love Island and engagement in - or desire to engage in - three body change strategies (i.e., weight loss, muscle gain, cosmetic surgery). Nearly all (97.38%) participants reported at least some degree (i.e., M &gt; 1.00) of body pressure from watching Love Island, and fluctuations in body pressure followed a positive developmental trajectory across the series. Body pressure at the midpoint of the series predicted heightened engagement in weight loss and muscle gain strategies, and increased desire for cosmetic surgery, at the end of the series. Furthermore, heightened desire for cosmetic surgery at the beginning of the series predicted increased body pressure during the series. Results therefore suggest that prolonged exposure to highly idealized bodies on Love Island may harm young viewers’ body image, to the point that many feel compelled to alter aspects of their body.",

          "abstract": "Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness—a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritised emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behaviour than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context‑sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This research investigated how people respond to true and false news, and how the type of social endorsement associated with news posts influences belief and engagement intentions.  Across three experiments (total N = 1084), participants viewed true and false news accompanied by varying levels of positive (likes) and negative (dislikes) endorsement.  Participants were sensitive to post veracity, rating true news as more believable (large effect), and showing greater willingness to like true content, dislike false content and share true content (small effects).  Positive social endorsement by others reliably increased belief, like and share intentions and decreased dislike intentions (small effects).  Negative endorsement reduced belief (Experiment 1) and like intentions and increased dislike intentions (small effects), but had no detectable impact on share intentions.  When negative endorsement was presented alongside high positive endorsement, this reduced belief and like intentions, but only when the negative endorsement level was high, signalling divided opinion.  These findings demonstrate that: 1) veracity has a strong effect on beliefs, and a small effect on engagement and 2) social cues—positive and negative—have a small but significant role in shaping how people evaluate and interact with online news.  Our findings suggest that incorporating a dislike option on social media platforms could improve content evaluation by signalling epistemic rejection, though safeguards may be needed to mitigate risks of misuse.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising cost-effective alternative for assessing public opinion. However, most prior research has focused on simulating individual personas using past surveys, leaving it unclear whether LLMs can accurately estimate out-of-sample public opinion at the societal level. We address this gap with three studies that systematically evaluate the accuracy, bias, and variability of commercial and non-commercial LLMs in inferring societal-level public opinion. First, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four recent Pew Research Centre polls, finding that both models outperformed traditional baseline methods, with GPT-4 showing higher accuracy, with an error rate ranging from 4% to 9%. Notably, GPT-3.5 produced overly uniform responses characterized by lower variance and higher entropy compared to actual human data, whereas GPT-4’s predictions more closely mirrored real response patterns. Both models, however, exhibited partisan skew, aligning more strongly with Democratic perspectives and underrepresenting Republican viewpoints. Second, we assessed the generalisability of these findings by testing various models (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.3) on three additional Pew surveys. These models demonstrated similar predictive accuracy and a continued tendency toward less varied responses, though partisan bias was less pronounced in the latest models. Third, we examined the robustness of our findings through ablation studies of prompt design by varying parameters such as temperature, role, and input format and found that the results were consistent across these conditions. Importantly, collective-level estimation consistently outperformed averaged individual-level simulation, which suffered from greater homogeneity bias. Overall, LLMs show strong potential for public opinion estimation, though their inherent biases and methodological limitations warrant careful consideration.",

We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses. We then apply the model to empirical judgments of verbal quantifiers.",

          "abstract": "Transsaccadic vision is typically described as the ability to retain and integrate visual information across rapid eye movements (saccades) for the purpose of continuous perception. In this review, we break this down further into two fundamental processes: the cortical mechanisms that maintain extrinsic spatial properties (i.e., location, orientation) versus intrinsic identity cues (i.e., spatial frequency, shape) of objects across saccades. First, we summarize the computational problems associated with transsaccadic vision, emphasizing the need to retain and integrate both extrinsic and intrinsic feature information between fixations for predictive vision. Next, we briefly review psychophysical, neurophysiological, stimulation, and neuroimaging evidence that specific cortical mechanisms exist for these processes. Then, we focus on our recent experiments combining functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation-inspired and functional connectivity approaches. These experiments suggest that parietal cortex (specifically, right supramarginal gyrus) contributes to spatial updating of object orientation, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex (cuneus) supports updating of spatial frequency and object shape. Taken together with the previous literature, this supports the notion that an ‘extended parietal eye field’ is involved in the updating of extrinsic spatial cues, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex is involved in updating intrinsic cues to object identity, both in communication with the broader functional networks for perception and action. Finally, we synthesize these results in a simple conceptual model for cortical updating and integration of object features and consider the implications for future studies of transsaccadic integration, the ‘binding problem’, and possible clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent screen use is highly heterogeneous, varying across dimensions such as activity type, time spent, purpose, and content exposure, with patterns that may persist or shift over time. However, little is known about how such heterogeneity relates to later psychosocial functioning in everyday life. This study addressed this gap by examining longitudinal trajectories of screen time and media content engagement across adolescence and their associations with day-to-day psychosocial functioning in emerging adulthood. Data were drawn from the Zurich Project on Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood (z-proso) and its add-on study, Decades-to-Minutes (D2M), which employed ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Parallel latent class growth analysis modelled trajectories of three screen activities (ages 11,13,15,17) and three types of media content exposure (ages 13,15,17,20) in z-proso (n=1521). Daily psychosocial functioning was assessed in the D2M sample at ages 21 (n=255) and 27 (n=451), and associations with adolescent screen-use trajectories were examined using dynamic structural equation modelling (DSEM). Results showed that youth in the high TV/DVD and chatting/surfing, moderate-content group exhibited higher mean levels and variability of daily aggression and aggressive reactivity. The high-use, high-content group displayed greater daily cannabis use, aggressive reactivity, and provocation inertia. The moderate-use, escalating-content group showed higher stress variability, aggression inertia, aggressive reactivity, and cannabis use. The low-use, low-content group consistently displayed the most adaptive daily functioning. These findings underscore the importance of jointly considering adolescent screen time and media content patterns, given the distinct relations of different joint trajectories to (mal-)adaptive dimensions of psychosocial functioning into adulthood.",

To test these hypotheses one hundred and forty-nine undergraduates were randomly assigned to receive either a 5-day mindfulness training intervention or no training (control). Both groups answered physics questions before and directly after the intervention and rated their confidence, anxiety, and difficulty for each question. Mindfulness training led to a greater increase in confidence and a reduction in anxiety among women and non-binary students, but not for men. The intervention also led to a reduction in judgments of difficulty for all students. The association between mindfulness training and self-reported anxiety among women and non-binary students was mediated by reductions in physics threat (measured mid-week using experience sampling). However, physics threat did not mediate any of the other mindfulness training outcomes for confidence or difficulty. The results are discussed in relation to a model of challenge and threat and mindfulness applications.",

We stacked a brief video intervention highlighting sympathetic personal narratives previously shown to decrease political animosity on a multi-hour event, led by MCC Respectful Conversations, that aims to increase empathy and understanding through guided conversations. The idea is that the video intervention would open people up to the lessons of the event. We tested this in a preregistered pre-test post-test experimental design (N = 209, Events k = 10). Although effects for liking and respect for people with different opinions were in the expected direction (b’s range [.02, .05] across inclusion criteria), they were not typically significantly different from zero (p’s range [.03, .26] across inclusion criteria). We also explored if the events improved people’s attitudes in a one-group pre-test post-test design and found evidence that the overall events may be effective.

Applying multilevel models to harmonized longitudinal panel survey data from the U.S. and 13 European nations (N = 59,030, ages 45 to 65) revealed that middle-aged adults in nations with less investment in family benefits (as % of Gross Domestic Product) and more income inequality (assessed using the GINI coefficient) report higher levels of individual-level loneliness and exhibit steeper within-person increase in loneliness over time. Findings from our observational study document that nation-level policy factors pertaining to family benefits and income inequalities are associated with cross-national differences in midlife loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Neural specialization is a developmental phenomenon across multiple domains of language processing. The home literacy environment (HLE) is observed to relate to brain activation during language and reading tasks; however, whether HLE relates to phonological and semantic functional specialization and sensitivity remains unknown. \nMethod: Using an open-source dataset, the present study examined 33 5–6-year-olds and 76 7–8-year-olds. Data from fMRI sound and meaning judgment tasks were used to examine phonological and semantic functional specialization (contrasting tasks) and sensitivity (comparing conditions within a task). Then, voxel-wise regression analyses were used to test correlations between those brain indexes and HLE (i.e., family-to-child reading, child independent reading) measured using a parent survey. \nResults: We observed weak evidence of phonological specialization at 5 years old and weak evidence of semantic specialization at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. We also observed weak evidence of phonological sensitivity at 5 years old and strong evidence of semantic sensitivity at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. Across the cohorts, a progression from temporal to frontal brain regions was observed in those relations, in line with prior literature on language specialization and sensitivity across development. \nConclusions: Overall, our results suggest that HLE is linked to functional specialization and sensitivity, with a relation of family-to-child reading to processing the sound structure of language at 5 years old and meaning at 7 years old. This finding supports the Interactive Specialization theory, which emphasizes the role of environmental inputs in neural specialization.",

This study examined HIV stigma among 260 health care providers in Türkiye, comparing HIV care providers with other professionals. Measures included HIV knowledge and training, fear of infection, observed stigma, stigmatizing attitudes, intention to discriminate, and facility policies. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated the Turkish stigma scale, and chi-square tests compared stigma indicators between groups. Stigmatizing attitudes and fear of infection were prevalent across all participants. HIV care providers had higher knowledge and training but still exhibited discriminatory practices. Policies reinforcing stigma, such as testing without consent and differential treatment protocols, were commonly reported.

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

No signals of indirect effects of condition on any outcome through the five mechanisms (i.e., 95 % confidence intervals included zero) were found.

Further, we observed associations between changes in candidate mechanisms and mental health outcomes.\nConclusions: Although no direct signals of mediation via candidate mechanisms were observed due to lack of power, condition-linked shifts in our candidate mechanisms were associated with mental-health outcomes. Larger mechanism-powered trials are now required to delineate causal pathways and refine scalable prevention and early intervention strategies.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Ehmann; Terje Sparby; Daniel M. Ingram; Matthew Sacchet",
          "abstract": "That meditation is similar to mental training is a widely used analogy that seeks to capture the\ngrowth-oriented processes that unfold through the intentional performance of mental activities.\nHowever, despite its intuitive appeal, this notion remains conceptually underdeveloped. To our\nknowledge, no interdisciplinary dialogue has been established with training science—a field\ndedicated to the understanding of training variables and principles. In this paper, we address this\ngap by first providing an overview of foundational principles in exercise science, introducing key\nconcepts such as programming and periodization. Building on this foundation, we outline how\ncore training variables—such as volume, frequency, duration, density, and intensity—can be\nmeaningfully adapted to contemplative training contexts. Among these, we propose training\nintensity, defined as the graded phenomenal presence of specific meditative qualities together with\nthe minimization of counteractive qualities. Referenced against a normative standard, this\nconstruct offers a particularly promising link between objective training metrics of meditative\nexperience and subjective markers of meditative proficiency. We argue that advanced meditation\nentails not only the accumulation of training volume over time but the refinement and mastery of\nspecific skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Finally, we\nsuggest that meditation would benefit from adopting a unified semantic framework and\nsystematically assessing these training variables, thereby enabling more precise, comparable, and\ncumulative analyses across studies. This work represents a first step toward integrating principles\nfrom training science into meditation research, offering novel tools to understand the mechanisms\nand trajectories underlying meditative development.",

It also tests the effects of party cues on the intentions assigned to reformers proposing to alter democratic rules. The results show that (1) the in-party supporters evaluated the intentions to reform checks and balances as benign, whereas the out-party supporters were more vigilant and saw them as malicious; (2) participants were less vigilant of an administrative reform and evaluated it as less ill-intended; (3) these effects held across supporters of different political parties – both incumbent and opposition.

          "abstract": "Reward and punishment learning are critical across multiple clinical populations. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is frequently used to assess these constructs and multiple forms of psychopathology are associated with IGT performance. However, it is not clear whether alterations in IGT performance are general to psychopathology, or specific to different forms of psychopathology. Thus, we examined whether IGT performance was uniquely predicted by anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Overall, our findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

The angular gyrus (AnG) has been implicated in both perspective reconstruction and subjective memory experience, yet its specific contribution remains unclear. We investigated the role of the AnG across three studies using a behavioural paradigm in which healthy adults (aged 18–35) encoded a naturalistic video. At retrieval, participants judged whether test images matched their original perspective and rated subjective aspects of the experience, including vividness and re-experiencing. In Study 1 (n=42), vividness ratings significantly predicted accurate perspective discrimination. In Study 2 (n=45), offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the AnG significantly enhanced perspective discrimination relative to control stimulation, with richness of visual imagery predicting performance. In Study 3 (n=28), online rTMS to the AnG produced a non-significant impairment in discrimination, suggesting possible disruption. Re-experiencing ratings predicted successful discrimination of first-person perspective scenes, particularly under AnG stimulation. Across these studies, we show that the AnG supports memory for encoded perspective and contributes to subjective aspects of episodic retrieval. The direction of its influence may depend on stimulation timing and its interaction with broader cortical networks involved in self-referential processing and memory reconstruction.",

This sustainability behavior gap stems partly from misaligned risk perceptions: individuals rely on heuristics that generate cognitive biases, whereas experts use statistical probabilities. Existing interventions often fail to produce lasting effects because they neglect underlying cognitive drivers of risk perception. We introduce rebiasing, a novel strategy that leverages cognitive biases to realign risk perceptions. Across seven studies (N = 2,213), we show that (1) opposing heuristics and biases can neutralize each other, reverting perceptions to baseline; (2) rebiasing can be tailored to individuals with either high or low risk perceptions to better align with expert views; and (3) adjusted perceptions influence downstream sustainability behaviors, though context-dependently. Our findings advance theory on bias interaction and offer actionable insights for marketers, policymakers, and advocates seeking to close the sustainability behavior gap.",

          "abstract": "Online, at-home testing of scholastic skills can widen participation in research, but needs evidence on quality and practicality. We ran two pilots in samples of Dutch adults to: (a) compare a digital version to the official pen &amp; paper version on a short arithmetic test (TempoToets Rekenen; TTR), (b) evaluate two online vocabulary tests, (c) benchmark a developing abstract-reasoning test (OMSS), and (d) examine the Dutch translation of the Math Ability Rating Questionnaire (MARQ) self-report.\nPilot I (N = 55) included home online testing and supervised lab testing (online and pen/paper). Home: TTR, Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB), synonym vocabulary test, Dutch Auditory &amp; Image Vocabulary Test (DAIVT).  Lab: TTR, synonym test, DAIVT, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the OMSS. Pilot II (N=61) repeated TTR across three settings; home-digital, lab-digital, lab-pen/paper and compared it to (subsets of) the MARQ. Outcomes included internal consistency (α), Pearson correlations (r), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) from mixed models, administration time, and feasibility indicators.\nArithmetic (TTR): In Pilot I, cross-format associations were moderate (r = .63). In Pilot II, home-digital vs pen/paper r = .69, lab-digital vs pen/paper r = .70, and home- vs lab-digital r = .79. Scores were generally higher on pen/paper than on the digital versions (modality effect), but the two digital settings were more consistent.\nVocabulary: Both tests were reliable and convergent with PPVT: DAIVT α = .90; r = .76; synonym α = .85; r = .66. The synonym test was shorter than the DAIVT (~4.5 vs. 7 min) and required no audio, favouring remote feasibility; DAIVT provided stronger convergence, likely reflecting the similar format to the PPVT.\nAbstract reasoning: OMSS showed acceptable preliminary indices versus MaRs-IB (α = .67; r = .56; ICC = .51; ~11 min). A ~20-item OMSS form appears efficient with limited expected loss in precision.\nSelf-reported math (MARQ): Internal consistency was strong (α &gt; .80 for MARQ-19/5/3). Higher MARQ scores (poorer self-reported arithmetic ability) were weakly to, at best, moderately correlated with TTR (timed arithmetic performance); the strongest being for MARQ-5 (r = −.33, p = .011).\nFor the remote, online version of the TTR standardized administration (clear on-screen instructions, short practice, consistent device) is crucial to limit modality-related variance. For vocabulary, both online tests are suitable; the synonym test is pragmatic for remote use, whereas DAIVT offers stronger convergence at greater time cost. OMSS is promising pending item refinement and shortening. MARQ–TTR associations were weaker than expected, suggesting differences in construct coverage (broad self-report vs. timed operations), translation and sample effects. Within MARQ, the MARQ5 subset appears most suitable in our context due to its brevity, high internal consistency, and the strongest, albeit modest, correlation with TTR.",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists often compare groups in terms of relations between latent variables (LV) (often called structural relations) using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). LVs are measured indirectly by questionnaires; thus, measurement invariance must be evaluated before comparisons can be made. To efficiently compare many groups, the recently proposed Mixture Multigroup SEM (MMG-SEM) clusters groups based on their structural relations while accounting for measurement (non-)invariance. However, the current MMG-SEM relies on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, which assumes continuous indicators. This can introduce bias when dealing with ordinal data, especially for variables with fewer item categories. In this paper, we extend MMG-SEM to accommodate ordinal data relying on the stepwise Structural-After-Measurement estimation approach. In the first step, we implement a multigroup categorical confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CCFA) with diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) to estimate the measurement model (MM). The second step uses ML to perform the clustering and estimate cluster-specific structural relations. A simulation study compares the performance of this approach to that of ML-based MMG-SEM under various conditions. The results show a better recovery of MM parameters with DWLS, particularly with fewer response categories, whereas both approaches perform similarly regarding the recovery of the clusters and structural relations.",

Further, we observed associations between changes in candidate mechanisms and mental health outcomes.\nConclusions: Although no direct signals of mediation via candidate mechanisms were observed due to lack of power, condition-linked shifts in our candidate mechanisms were associated with mental-health outcomes. Larger mechanism-powered trials are now required to delineate causal pathways and refine scalable prevention and early intervention strategies.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how semantic transparency influences the phonetic realization of triconstituent nominal compounds (NNN) in English. Building on earlier work that employed averaged (static) embeddings, we use contextualized BERT representations derived from the exact carrier and context sentences presented to participants in a production experiment. This method aligns computational measures of semantic similarity with the experimental context guiding speakers’ interpretations. Our analyses reveal a branching-sensitive asymmetry, indicating that contextualized semantic information affects phonetic realization selectively, depending on structural configuration. More broadly, the results highlight how computational embeddings can enrich experimental data by capturing semantic dimensions that are not directly accessible through traditional methods.",

          "authors": "Andrew D Wilson",
          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

          "abstract": "Products and services are usually rated on either a five-point scale or a binary scale (i.e. positive vs negative). Using a pilot study and two between-subjects experiments, this paper investigates how individuals evaluate products differently depending on the scale used, how they implicitly categorise ratings on a five-point scale into binary bins, and how they estimate five-point distributions from binary scales. Individuals perceive products as higher in quality when ratings are presented on a binary scale, assuming reviews have been assigned to positive or negative categories based on whether they are above or below the midpoint of a five-point scale. Individuals perceive products as being of equivalent quality across scales only when ratings of four and five are taken as positive, and the remainder as negative. However, when individuals are asked to generate a five-point ratings distribution from binary ratings, they do not account for this skewed perception of positivity unless the five-point scale is labelled so that the ‘neutral’ point of the scale is defined as four rather than three. These findings have theoretical implications for understanding how people implicitly categorise and bin ratings, as well as practical implications for industry and policymakers.",

          "abstract": "The behavioral immune system, a set of antipathogenic psychological adaptations driven by disgust, has been shown to shape social dynamics and influence outgroup prejudice. Traditional models of xenophobia have historically emphasized the role of fear, stress, and anxiety, potentially overlooking the role of disgust. To better capture the specificity of disgust-driven outgroup prejudice, we introduce the term xenodyskheria (from the old Greek xenos-(ξένος) = stranger and-dyskheria (δυσχέρεια) = disgust or repugnance). We explore the extent of xenodyskheria's influence on outgroup prejudice before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic-arguably one of the most salient pathogen threats of the century. We found that, prior to the pandemic, pathogen disgust had no effect on rejection of and callousness towards healthy looking strangers. However, at the onset of the pandemic, pathogen disgust became the main predictor of outgroup prejudice. In contrast, neither stress nor anxiety were associated with outgroup prejudice during or after the pandemic. Interestingly, we observed a paradoxical relationship between pathogen and moral disgust, as the latter can serve as a \"buffer\" tempering the exclusionary tendencies of the former, despite these two disgust domains being highly correlated. Additionally, our Post-COVID sample showed no reversion to pre-pandemic levels of xenodyskheria, suggesting that the psychological effects of COVID-19 crisis may have left a more enduring imprint on social dynamics than previously assumed. Results are discussed in the light of evolutionary theories. Future research avenues for a dual-process model of behavioral immunity and for pre-genocide dehumanization processes are proposed.",

During self-directed learning, participants chose to progress via a curriculum that graduated the complexity of concept discovery (number of concepts involved) rather than of concept implementation (number of steps to goal). However, those who chose to graduate the implementation complexity performed better. Three subsequent experiments that randomised participants into curriculum groups confirmed that adjusting the complexity of concept implementation (not discovery) is the more effective learning strategy. When acquiring complex tasks, learners should not attempt to discover new concepts prematurely, but instead focus on practicing those which they have already mastered.",

          "abstract": "Treadmill Virtual Reality (VR) has a potential application in rehabilitation, but its adoption is hampered by commonly experienced cybersickness symptoms, and an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence relevant (learning) outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that with active locomotion (self-motion) cybersickness symptoms may be limited. Restriction of the field-of-view – e.g., via the use of video vignettes – may also reduce symptoms. Whether a VR intervention is effective may also depend on the subjective presence within the virtual environment as experienced by the user. It remains unclear, however, what the optimal conditions to prevent cybersickness and to induce high levels of presence are. In the current study we investigated the effect of self-motion (walking vs. standing) and field of view as manipulated by vignetting (on vs. off) on cybersickness, presence and memory. Thirty-two healthy adults walked two predetermined routes in two different virtual environments: During one trial participants walked on the treadmill, determining direction with a handlebar (walking condition; using a Virtuwalk-treadmill), and during the other trial (order counterbalanced between participants), participants used the handlebar while standing still to move around the virtual environment (standing condition). In a between-subjects design, half the participants experienced the virtual environments with a vignette that restricted the field-of-view, while vignetting was not applied for the other half of the participants. In contrast to expectations, cybersickness was not influenced by walking or vignetting. However, results showed a positive effect of self-motion on presence, with higher presence in the walking than no-walking condition. In addition, presence and motivation were positively correlated. Vignetting did not affect presence, but it reduced landmark memory, potentially by partially obstructing the field-of-view. The current study’s findings thus suggest that self-motion is positively associated with presence, and in turn higher presence is associated with higher motivation. Vignetting did not reduce cybersickness and may not be recommended when memory of the environment is of relevance.",

During their current incarceration, one in three (31%) participants had ever used drugs and a quarter (26%) did so in the past month. Cannabis and non-prescribed tranquillizers (such as benzodiazepines) were most commonly used. The main reasons cited by participants for using drugs in prison were to relieve stress, forget problems, and counteract boredom. In a multivariate analysis, perceived social support and availability of meaningful activities were negatively associated with recent drug use while incarcerated. Other factors related to the prison environment had no significant influence on drug use, providing a more nuanced perspective on extant qualitative literature.",

Dramatic\nirony (DI)—a narrative device through which viewers are made aware of crucial information\nwhich is unknown to characters of the narrative—provides a controlled but naturalistic context\nto examine these processes. Using a curated DI film corpus (Cabañas et al., 2023), we\ncombined eye-tracking with a Self-Paced Viewing (SPV) paradigm to investigate how SToM\nshapes real-time processing. In a pre-registered between-subjects study (https://osf.io/by56s),\nparticipants viewed edited Harold Lloyd film excerpts that either provided viewers with\nprivileged information unknown to a character (Installation group) or withheld it to align\nviewer and character knowledge (Control group), reflecting false-belief and true-belief\nscenarios, respectively. We analysed narrative comprehension, reaction times, and eye-\ntracking measures indexing cognitive effort and attentional allocation. Results showed that the\nInstallation group exhibited longer viewing times at moments of representational conflict and\nlonger overall fixation durations, indicating greater cognitive effort. Gaze analyses revealed\nselective attention to belief-relevant characters and objects, suggesting top-down control\nguided by mental state representations. Extended dwell times on characters’ mouths in the\nInstallation group further reflected deliberate information seeking. These findings indicate that\nviewers spontaneously construct and maintain complex false-belief representations during DI\ncomprehension, dynamically modulating cognitive processing and attention.

          "abstract": "Polyregulation refers to employing multiple strategies to regulate emotions within a single emotional episode. However, evidence on its affective outcomes remains inconclusive, likely due to reliance on strategy count as the operationalization of polyregulation and the overlook of context sensitivity. Across two independent ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies from the United States (Study 1, N = 158, 12,217 observations) and China (Study 2, N = 144, 11,347 observations), we introduced the effective strategy ratio, the ratio of idiographically effective strategies to total strategies used, to evaluate the overall quality of polyregulation. We directly tested whether the joint contribution of context sensitivity and the overall quality predicted various indices of momentary psychological distress. Total number of strategies was associated with increased distress at lower levels of the effective strategy ratio, but with reduced distress at higher levels. Context sensitivity magnified the benefits of high effective strategy ratio but was less helpful when the ratio was low. The results were robust across culturally distinct samples and after controlling for lagged distress. These findings underscore the utility of the effective strategy ratio and highlight the synergistic benefits of flexibly aligning idiographic effective strategies with contextual demands. We emphasize the importance of moving beyond strategy count to focus on overall quality and prioritizing context-sensitive emotion regulation in future affective science research.",

Twenty adults with elevated inattention completed two single-blind, sham-controlled, and counterbalanced sessions. Stimulation was delivered at 25 Hz to the cymba concha (active) or at 1 Hz with identical montage and sensation (sham). Participants performed the Attention Network Task (ANT: alerting, orienting, executive control) and a 2-back working memory task. ANT reaction times were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models; 2-back accuracy with linear mixed models. Blinding was successful, and only mild transient side effects occurred. Results showed that active taVNS selectively reduced flanker interference, indicating enhanced attentional control, with no effects on alerting, orienting, or working memory. These findings demonstrate a domain-specific benefit of online taVNS in subclinical ADHD, selectively strengthening executive control rather than producing broad gains across attention and memory.",

While LQH components are typically investigated in reading, their role in resolving cognitive conflict remains unknown. This study applies the construct of lexical precision to the traditional naming Stroop task, a gold-standard to quantify cognitive conflict resolution specifically investigating its influence in dyslexia and stuttering. \nMethod: Stroop interference was measured in 84 neurotypical readers, 50 dyslexic adults and 30 adults who stutter (AWS). All participants completed a naming Stroop task, together with a suite of individual difference measures that were analysed using a Principal Component Analysis, which established measures of phonological precision and lexical precision. \nResults: The data showed that, on average, dyslexic adults and AWS showed significantly larger Stroop interference effects compared with neurotypical adults. Crucially, the magnitude of the Stroop interference was moderated by lexical precision. Dyslexic adults and AWS who scored higher on the lexical precision component showed Stroop interference levels similar to the neurotypical adults, while those with lower precision demonstrated a significantly larger Stroop interference. However, the level of Stroop interference did not differ between AWS and dyslexic adults. \nConclusions: The results indicate that an imprecise lexical representation underpins the difficulties in cognitive control mechanisms that are independent of the specific neurodivergent groups.",

          "authors": "Zachary Robert Bennett",
          "abstract": "Far transfer—applying learned principles to superficially dissimilar contexts—remains elusive despite decades of educational research. Meta-analyses show transfer occurs rarely and unpredictably, even among high-performing learners. We argue the problem is not insufficient metacognitive awareness but missing algorithmic specification: existing frameworks describe transfer as desirable but do not specify the cognitive operations that mechanistically produce abstraction. We propose far transfer arises from recursive dialogical cognition—structured internal conversation implementing diversity-driven signal extraction. The SCALE framework (Stimulate-Classify-Analyze-Learn-Evolve) formalizes this as a five-stage algorithm where multi-perspectival dialogue within problems cancels perspective-dependent noise, and cross-domain application across problems cancels domain-specific features, isolating transferable relational invariants. Converging evidence supports this architecture. Cognitive science demonstrates transfer depends on relational similarity (structure-mapping theory). Neuroscience reveals rhythmic alternation between default-mode and control networks during complex reasoning. Computational learning establishes that diversity-driven integration produces generalization (ensemble methods). SCALE synthesizes these into a unified mechanistic account with biological precedent in stochastic resonance, where moderate noise enhances signal detection. Proof-of-concept demonstrates algorithmic formalizability: systems trained on SCALE-structured examples produce high-quality abstractions (CCSR 12/12), exhibit cross-Route transfer (e.g., formal to empirical domains), and generate novel insights. Critically, meta-cognitive operations require explicit scaffolding even after training—mirroring human learning. We derive falsifiable predictions at behavioral (investment-dip then crossover-advantage), cognitive (principle quality mediates transfer), computational (diversity-driven ensemble gains), and neural (stage-specific network recruitment) levels, inviting interdisciplinary commentary on whether dialogical recursion constitutes intelligence’s signature algorithm.",

Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

          "authors": "Julia Graf; Renate Renner; Thomas Klebel",
          "abstract": "Effective risk communication is a core element of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030), emphasizing the importance of early warning and public information in mitigating disaster impacts. However, existing research often treats risk communication as a uniform process, lacking systematic differentiation between short-term warnings for acute hazards and long-term adaptation strategies. This scoping review analyzes 194 peer-reviewed studies to examine how risk communication strategies vary according to the temporal dimension (short-term, long-term, or hybrid), hazard types by group (atmospheric, geophysical, hydrological, and biophysi-cal), and intended purpose. Communication goals are categorized through an inductively developed approach—Act, Prepare, and Aware—and mapped across the four major hazard groups. A focused analysis of 141 studies reveals that differences, such as atmospheric hazards, are predominantly addressed through hybrid (41%) and short-term (25%) strategies, often combining real-time alerts with awareness and preparedness. Geophysical haz-ards are strongly associated with hybrid approaches (43%), which emphasize participatory and educational for-mats. Hydrological hazards display the widest variation, combining short-term, hybrid, and complex strategies. Purely long-term formats, however, are rarely found across all hazard types (1.4%), despite their strategic im-portance for resilience. Findings suggest that the choice of communication strategy can be tied to the nature and dynamics of each hazard type. This review identifies key patterns, research gaps, and a structured basis for further evaluation and the development of risk communication. It provides an overview of current literature and guidance for developing context-sensitive, temporally integrated communication strategies.",

          "abstract": "Marriage is consistently associated with better health and longevity, often attributed to economic advantages, health monitoring by a partner, and emotional support. Conversely, spousal death increases the risk of immediate mortality, known as the “widowhood effect.” Although these patterns are well-documented in contemporary populations, less is understood about their prevalence in historical populations, where extended family households may have mitigated the adverse effects of being unmarried or widowed. We investigated the effects of marital status on survival probabilities from age 40 onward, focusing on socioeconomic variability. Access to resources and coping mechanisms likely differed by social class, influencing how marital status affected survival across age groups and socioeconomic strata. We analyzed historical church book data from Finland (1730–1910), applying discrete-time event models to estimate annual survival for men (n = 5,802) and women (n = 6,203) aged 40 to 90. Time-varying marital statuses were categorized into five groups: never married, married, recently widowed, widowed, and remarried. Survival differences by marital status were strongly mediated by socioeconomic status (SES). Among high-SES individuals, never-married men and women had 15% and 21% higher survival rates, respectively, compared to their married counterparts. In contrast, among the moderate and lowest socioeconomic classes, survival probabilities for the never-married did not differ from those of the married. The survival advantage of never-married women was limited to ages below 60. Both men and women experienced sharp declines in survival during the two years following spousal loss (15–27%, depending on sex and class). Beyond this acute period, widowed men exhibited 5–10% lower survival rates across all classes compared to married men, while only high-SES widowed women faced a 6% survival disadvantage. Remarriage was associated with survival rates comparable to those of first-time marriage. This study provides insight into the survival advantages of pair-bonding in historical societies, characterized by high mortality rates, extended family structures, and the absence of modern medical resources.",

          "title": "Predicting Rates of Food Insecurity in the United States  in the Absence of Official Data Collection",
          "authors": "Sophie Collyer",
          "abstract": "As of 2023, more than 47 million people in the United States (14.3%) lived in food-insecure households. In the coming years, however, we will not know whether the national prevalence of food insecurity has risen, fallen, or remained stable, as the USDA recently announced the permanent suspension of food security data collection on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.",

          "abstract": "Norms are essential for social stability but can hinder adaptability in changing environments. Yet human societies have found ways to modify existing norms or create new ones in response to novel challenges. This paper proposes a framework for understanding adaptive norm evolution. First, drawing on a theory of legal order, we posit that societies balance normative stability and adaptability through metanorms—rules that govern the process by which norms are interpreted, changed and enforced. Second, we test this idea in the context of customary dispute resolution by elders among the Turkana, a pastoralist society in Kenya. Based on vignette experiments with 369 participants, we found that community members were significantly more willing to enforce decisions when elders aligned their conduct with metanorms. Elders are constrained in their ability to alter long-standing customs, but by following metanorms can create new rules for novel situations. These findings support our proposed mechanism: in the absence of centralized authority, metanorms governing normative institutions allow for adaptive norm change while preserving cultural continuity. We conclude by suggesting that group-level selection acts on cultural variation in metanorms, shaping the evolvability of normative systems and enabling societies to sustain adaptive legal order without coercive centralized power",

          "abstract": "This paper describes a strategic mechanism, fuzzy boundaries, that groups use to accumulate advantage. In contrast to the dominant view that rigid, well-defined boundaries maximize group rewards, I argue that ambiguity in membership criteria can, under certain conditions, more effectively secure and promote group benefits. Fuzzy boundaries are defined by two features: an intentionally ambiguous criterion for inclusion and the selective, inconsistent application of that criterion to adjust the insider-outsider line as needed. I illustrate the operation of fuzzy boundaries through a historical analysis of occupational boundary-drawing in the nineteenth-century United States. Ultimately, the study offers a generalizable framework for understanding how strategic ambiguity in group boundaries can serve actors seeking to preserve privilege across domains such as education, hiring, and professional accreditation. Unlike well-defined qualifications, the malleability of fuzzy boundaries often insulates them from legal challenge, making them an effective mechanism for maintaining social and institutional advantage. https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751251378516",

          "abstract": "Human social networks are inherently multiplex, comprising overlapping layers of relationships. Different layers may have distinct structural properties and interpersonal dynamics, but also may interact to form complex interdependent pathways for social contagion. This poses a fundamental problem in understanding behavioral diffusion and in devising effective network‑based interventions. Here, we introduce a new conceptualization of how much each network layer contributes to critical contagion pathways and quantify it using a novel metric, “network torque.” We exploit data regarding sociocentric maps of 110 rural Honduran communities using a battery of 11 name generators and an experiment involving an exogenous intervention. Using a novel statistical framework, we assess the extent to which specific network layers alter global connectivity and support the spread of three experimentally introduced health practices. The results show that specific relationship types—such as close friendships—particularly enable non-overlapping diffusion pathways, amplifying behavioral change at the village level. For instance, non-redundant pathways enabled by closest friends can increase the adoption of correct knowledge about feeding newborns inappropriate “chupones” and enhance attitudes regarding fathers’ involvement in postpartum care. Non-overlapping multiplex social ties are relevant to social contagion and social coherence in traditionally organized social systems.",

          "authors": "Norah MacKendrick; Seungyun Lee; Hanee Choi; Marina Rivera Ramos",
          "abstract": "How environmental health problems gain social visibility is key to understanding social problem formation. In this paper we examine this process by studying American news media coverage of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution, a pollutant linked to premature death and cardiovascular disease. After years of decline, in 2016 PM2.5 concentrations began rising nationally in the United States, largely due to wildfires. To understand how this change has been captured in public discourse, we use frame analysis of articles in two national U.S. newspapers—the New York Times and USA Today—to trace the evolution of the social problem framing of PM2.5 from 2013 to 2024. PM2.5 was framed as a health threat and governance problem, and while 2016 marks the reversal of the nationwide trend of declining PM2.5, 2020 is the inflection point when coverage increased, and environmental justice framing became salient. We explain these changes as the consequence of a convergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, major wildfires, and regulatory rollbacks that rendered PM2.5 more salient because of heightened public interest in airborne threats and growing awareness of racial inequality. Our study elucidates how intersecting crises can increase the media visibility of environmental health risks.",

This paper identifies bots as a major influence in digital protest ecologies, and responds by updating the Discursive Opportunity Structure (DOS) theoretical framework - focusing on its core dimensions of visibility, resonance, and legitimacy. To ground this theoretical development, we apply this revised framework through computer-assisted content analysis of bot activity in two major protests: Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Extinction Rebellion (XR). Rather than treating bots as a monolithic influence, we identify competing bot strategies with distinct discursive impacts. In BLM, supportive bots enhance cultural resonance, while counter-bots target movement legitimacy. In XR, pro-protest bots work to establish legitimacy and participatory visibility, whereas counter-bots strategically manipulate issue salience. These findings show that any serious understanding of contemporary movements must recognise how bot activity shapes discourse - steering public perception, influencing movement trajectories, and impacting protest outcomes.",

These bills signal a shift in the local political climate, pressuring public colleges and universities to realign their priorities in anticipation of future legal changes. Using federal data on new postsecondary hires, we find that the introduction of early anti-DEI legislation was followed by a substantial decline in the share of faculty hires from marginalized groups and an increase in the share of White men, even before bills were signed into law. This shift was most pronounced at schools highly dependent on state funding and at teaching-oriented schools.

A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "authors": "Brittany Tarufelli; James Gibson; Sarah Barrows; Abhishek Somani; Daniel Boff",
          "abstract": "Energy storage plays a crucial role in modern power systems, providing services such as grid stability, frequency regulation, and load balancing. Currently, storage systems earn revenue by offering these grid services and through energy arbitrage—buying electricity when prices are low and selling when prices are high. However, as storage deployment expands, arbitrage profitability declines due to market saturation and narrowing price differentials (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2024). In ERCOT, for example, 2024 saw reduced arbitrage potential due to moderate weather and increased storage capacity. This trend underscores the need for new business models that more fully recognize and compensate the value energy storage provides to the power system.\n\nThis paper presents empirical research on the full value of energy storage and proposes a commodity-market-based framework to better align compensation mechanisms with system-wide benefits. We examine hydropower as a proxy for grid-scale storage, using exogenous variation in reservoir storage volume to estimate causal effects on (1) real-time electricity prices and (2) risk premiums, measured by the day-ahead to real-time price spread, in the Northwestern United States between May 2022 and November 2024. Employing fixed-effects and lagged dependent variable models, we control for unobserved heterogeneity across balancing authorities and capture dynamic price behavior.\n\nWe find that a 10% increase in reservoir storage volume reduces real-time prices by approximately 6% and lowers risk premiums by about 5%, indicating that storage mitigates short-term supply–demand imbalances. These effects are most pronounced during grid stress events, such as cold snaps, suggesting that stored energy provides significant value when the system is under strain. The results are robust to dynamic pricing effects and highlight storage’s role in reducing both price volatility and systemic risk.\n\nOverall, stored energy substantially reduces system costs and alleviates grid stress, yet most electricity markets lack mechanisms that compensate storage for these benefits. As revenue from arbitrage and grid services diminishes with increased deployment, alternative business models are needed to reward storage for its intrinsic function—potentially through the creation of a stand-alone commodity, such as stored energy itself (see the winter reserve mechanism in Switzerland). Our findings provide empirical support for developing future market frameworks that more accurately capture the risk-reducing and reliability-enhancing contributions of grid-scale energy storage.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the intersection of technology, labor, and cultural practices in the fast food industry, with a particular focus on the adoption of robotic fryers and automation. Drawing on insights from cultural sociology and the economics of technological change, the analysis explores how automation reshapes work, alters food production processes, and reframes cultural meanings attached to fast food labor. The study highlights the tension between efficiency gains and concerns over labor displacement, situating fast food automation within broader debates about technology and society. By linking industry-specific developments to questions of employment, cultural identity, and consumer expectations, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of how automation in everyday contexts reflects and shapes broader social transformations.",

          "abstract": "Individual social identities indicate group affiliations and are typically associated with group-typical preferences, signals that indicate group membership, and the propensity to condition actions on the social signals of others, resulting in group-differentiated interaction norms. Past work modeling identity signaling and coordination has typically assumed that individuals belong to one of a discrete set of groups. Yet individuals can simultaneously belong to multiple groups, which may be nested within larger groupings. Here, we introduce the generalized Bach or Stravinsky game, a coordination game with ordered preferences, which allows us to construct a model that captures the overlapping and hierarchical nature of social identity. Our model unifies several prior results into a single framework, including results related to coordination, minority disadvantage, and cross-cultural competence. Our model also allows agents to express complex social identities through multidimensional signaling, which we use to explore a variety of complex group structures. Our consideration of intersectional identities exposes flaws in naive measures of group structure, illustrating how empirical studies may overlook some social identities if they do not consider the behaviors that those identities function to afford.",

          "authors": "Amit Suresh",
          "abstract": "India’s education sector faces the complex challenge of aligning its foundational structures with the demands of a rapidly evolving global landscape (Khan et al., 2024). This necessitates a comprehensive reform strategy extending beyond curriculum updates to encompass holistic educator development. This document addresses the critical question of how Kerala and India can devise and execute a transformative education policy. Such a policy must not only advance skill-based curricula, digital literacy, and vocational training but also significantly uplift teachers and professors through innovative professional development, thereby fostering a resilient and adaptive education ecosystem by 2035. The methodological approach involves a systematic review and thematic analysis of existing literature on educational reforms, professional development models, and the integration of technology in learning. Qualitative findings illuminate the necessity for personalized, continuous, and technology-supported professional learning pathways for educators. Key themes emerging include the potential of AI-powered personalized training, the efficacy of blended and peer-led learning networks, and the benefits of gamification and simulation for teaching effectiveness (Mintii, 2023)(Toledo Palomino et al., 2023). Policy implications underscore the importance of government-private sector collaborations, the institutionalization of lifelong learning, and targeted interventions for marginalized educators. An effective evaluation framework includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as educator retention rates, student learning outcomes in skill-based assessments, and the rate of adoption of innovative pedagogical practices. This holistic reform is designed to empower educators as central agents of transformation, ensuring an adaptive, inclusive, and future-focused education system for India and Kerala.",

          "abstract": "When compulsory voting is abolished, this generally leads to a substantial drop in voter turnout. Can measures to increase turnout by local government administrations combat such decline?  In this research note, we take up this question by focusing on the 2024 Flemish local elections, which were the first elections held under voluntary voting after more than 125 years of compulsory voting in the region. We first analyze aggregate level data to study whether municipalities who took more initiatives to mobilize voters witnessed lower levels of turnout decline than municipalities with weaker information campaigns. Second, we employ individual-level post-election survey data to assess whether respondents who were reached by these campaigns were more likely to cast a ballot in the election. The analyses yield a consistent pattern of null results: we find no significant effects on turnout at the aggregate nor at the individual level. We conclude that abolishing compulsory voting leads to a substantial decline in voter turnout that cannot be compensated by targeted measures and campaigns to mobilize citizens to vote.",

Based on original survey data collected from 2019 to 2022 (three pooled cross-sections, random samples of the adult population), the study reveals substantial social (by class) and political (by partisanship) divides regarding how redistributive ambitious and socially inclusive the welfare state should be, challenging assumptions of strong sociopolitical consensus. Welfare chauvinism is found to be more politically divisive than approval of income differences, with the sharpest divides emerging in the exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness held by voters of the non-mainstream (radical) right party, the Sweden Democrats. The results suggest that conflicts over inclusivist versus exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness could become central in Swedish politics, potentially shifting away from the universalist principles that underpin its social democratic welfare state model.",

This document delineates a comprehensive policy blueprint for Kerala, designed to leverage advanced artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and immersive technologies to fundamentally reshape its healthcare landscape by 2035, serving as a scalable model for India. The analysis outlines objectives centered on augmenting primary healthcare access, enhancing mental health support, and fortifying preventive care, aligning with India’s National Digital Health Mission and broader global innovation trajectories. A systematic review of existing literature, coupled with thematic analysis, informs the identification of critical policy gaps and technological opportunities. Key qualitative findings underscore the transformative capacity of AI-powered predictive models for risk identification and resource optimization, the potential for genomics-enabled personalized prevention, and the efficacy of immersive technologies in delivering stigma-free mental health interventions. The analysis also highlights the imperative for robust, interoperable digital infrastructures and community-embedded autonomous healthcare solutions. Policy implications emphasize the need for integrated governance models, ethical frameworks for data use, and strategies for equitable technology deployment. The proposed framework includes pragmatic implementation pathways, detailing institutional roles, stakeholder engagement, and resource allocation. Evaluation strategies, incorporating key performance indicators (KPIs) and continuous feedback loops, are also presented to ensure adaptive policy refinement. This approach offers a foundational strategy for achieving universal, inclusive, and resilient health systems in Kerala, with significant implications for national healthcare evolution.

While AI technologies enhance journalistic workflows by automating and augmenting content creation, they also introduce opacity in professional decisions, complicating traditional transparency norms and its disclosure practices. The paper maps citizens’ perceptions regarding disclosures of AI use in journalism, addressing two key themes: (1) the practical information needs of news consumers about AI-generated content and (2) the specific rationales when exposed to (disclosures of) AI generated news content. Through qualitative focus groups (N=21), the exploratory research reveals a strong demand for clear, visible, and detailed disclosures about AI-generated content. Participants emphasized the necessity of including general source references akin to traditional authorship attributions, explicitly stating AI involvement - for example, a label such as ‘generated by AI’ alongside author and publication details. Visual indicators like logos or watermarks in contrasting colors were preferred to ensure AI disclosures are noticeable and not easily overlooked. This study contributes to developing more granular audience-centered, practical guidelines for AI transparency in journalism that goes beyond the mere ‘label’, emphasizing that effective disclosure requires more than simply ‘informing’ audiences.",

Using geo-referenced administrative data from Germany and a conditional instrumental variable approach that exploits distance between place of residence and large firms, we find negative financial consequences but show that the dropout penalty is entirely concentrated among individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. We further show that these stratified scars partly reflect unequal educational re-enrollment rates and unequal employment outcomes among dropouts who do not re-enroll. Our results highlight the potential of policies targeting higher graduation rates to reduce social inequality in labor markets. Furthermore, our study suggests that social advantage serves as an important buffer against the negative financial consequences of apprenticeship dropout, even in institutional settings with strong links between credentials and labor market outcomes.",

Results reveal a global “schooling effect”: each additional month of exposure increases mathematics achievement and narrows socioeconomic gaps. However, limited variation in test windows reduces precision in country-specific estimates, suggesting that broader, randomized testing schedules would strengthen future ILSAs’ capacity to identify and compare schooling effects across countries.",

          "abstract": "IT governance has emerged as one of the most critical elements of organizational success in the modern digital economy in enabling technology assets to support business objectives, reduce risks, and ensure regulatory compliance. Whereas large organizations have the resources and expertise to adopt governance frameworks like COBIT, ISO/IEC 27001, or the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are at a significant disadvantage. Financial limitations, scarcity of skilled human resources, low management awareness level, and complexity in international compliance regulations are likely to deter SMEs from embracing good governance practices (Mirtsch et al., 2021; Almaqtari et al., 2024).\n\nThese challenges are investigated in this research through a comparative study of SMEs in Bangladesh and Denmark, two different settings: a developing and a developed economy. My interest in pursuing this research stems from the fact that I have work experience at AIBL Capital Market Services Limited, where I observed directly the critical role that governance plays in maintaining operational security and efficiency. The inferences are that SMEs in Bangladesh are primarily faced with shortages of resources and infrastructure (Bangladesh Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, 2018), while SMEs in Denmark are faced with the cost and complexity of complying with rigorous regulations such as GDPR and NIS2 European Commission, 2016; European Commission, 2022). The above analysis puts into perspective the need for tailored, context-specific governance styles which are appropriate for SMEs across various economies.",

          "abstract": "Heightened geopolitical tensions, extreme weather conditions, and an increased risk of hybrid attacks have brought renewed attention to crisis preparedness as a key political and research priority across Europe. However, much of the current discourse focuses on individual and household-level measures and overlooks the broader social dimensions of crisis resilience, which are more frequently examined in the aftermath of crises. Given the crucial role of social capital and informal civil society networks in crisis response and recovery, there is a pressing need for greater sociological engagement with the crisis preparedness phase as well. Incorporating literatures of sociology of disasters, civil society studies, crisis management, and disaster risk management, this paper develops an extended sociological framework that conceptualizes crisis preparedness as an inherently social process taking place at the early onset of a crisis. In outlining such a framework, it expands the conceptualization of crisis preparedness beyond individual and material measures to include social infrastructures, such as social capital and the mobilization of civil society. In doing so, the paper contributes to the sociological theory of crisis resilience by conceptualizing crisis preparedness as prospective collective action, thereby reframing sociological understandings of crisis preparedness as risk governance.",

A paradigm shift is required from the logic of the attention economy to that of epistemic signals—structured, auditable, and multi‑sourced claims designed for machine readability. A research agenda is outlined that emphasizes the analysis of algorithmic evidence preferences, the exploration of principles of machine‑readable communication, the development of new metrics such as answer share, and the examination of governance and ethical challenges. Case illustrations from healthcare, finance, and education demonstrate how these inquiries can be operationalized.

          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

          "abstract": "Causal reasoning is central to social sciences, supporting both theory development and testing. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to analyze texts across social sciences, yet their abilities to interpret causal statements and reconstruct causal structures remain uncertain in social science texts. This study examines to what extent LLMs can (a) identify causal sentences and (b) recover causal edges to reconstruct directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This examination relies on two text-based simulations and one experiment using real sociological texts. In simulated texts, models reliably detected explicit causal statements but often misclassified non-causal ones, particularly when probabilistic language was used. For causal graph recovery, clarity of expression strongly influenced accuracy. Across 500 replications with real texts, performance ranged from moderate to near perfect, revealing both model heterogeneity and inconsistency. These results indicate that LLMs can assist in extracting causal knowledge from social science texts, yet accurate inference of complex causal mechanisms still requires careful theoretical reasoning. Future applications may benefit from targeted prompting and domain-specific fine-tuning, but their contribution to sociological theorizing should be carefully assessed against traditional methodological standards.",

We outline an empirical roadmap for advancing research at this intersection. First, we call for descriptive work documenting how polarization manifests in organizations, including inequalities in political expression and the emergence of partisan signaling in daily interactions. Second, we highlight the need to examine how polarization influences workplace communication, from dyadic exchanges to organizational networks, using diverse methodological approaches such as surveys, experiments, and computational analyses. Finally, we encourage research that reverses the causal arrow by investigating how workplace communication might mitigate or exacerbate polarization, considering factors such as leadership communication, virtual collaboration, and diversity initiatives. By integrating theories of polarization and organizational communication, this framework aims to guide systematic inquiry into how political divisions are reproduced—or potentially repaired—through the communicative fabric of work.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how rising income inequality has been impacting individuals' belief in merit-based success, using three decades of survey data from 39 advanced capitalist democracies. Challenging the seminal finding of a \"paradox of inequality,\" we find no evidence of a positive effect of inequality on meritocratic beliefs across countries. Instead, we identify a substantively moderate but robustly negative effect of inequality on perceptions of meritocracy from within-country changes over time: as inequality rises, citizens’ belief in meritocracy declines. We further uncover that inequality does not merely induce a mean shift, but affects the shape of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs insofar as we find the proportion of sceptical perceptions of meritocratic realities to be increasing with higher levels of inequality. Our findings thus suggest that growing inequality undermines citizens’ trust in procedural fairness and contributes to an increased polarisation of attitudes and beliefs at the heart of open societies.",

It calls for inclusive and contextualized platform design, critical training for teachers, participatory co-design of evaluation systems, and governance mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability.

We find that this wave of racial justice protests was more peaceful than Civil Rights protests of the 1960’s and that Antifa was present at only a handful of events which turned violent. We also find that media attention to Antifa corresponded with declining support for BLM, suggesting that scapegoating Antifa led to a decline in support of the movement.",

          "abstract": "Retail investors have greatly increased their options trading volume, raising questions about whether higher payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) rates that brokerages receive from option trades are linked with increased brokerage options promotion. In this paper, I conduct an empirical study to explore the association between options PFOF rates and promotion across four brokerages: Robinhood, Webull, E*TRADE, and Charles Schwab. Utilizing their SEC Rule 606(a) reports and social media posts from X, Facebook, and Instagram, I calculate a monthly average options PFOF rate for each brokerage and construct an options promotion strength score through a hand-coded framework. I find that Robinhood and E*TRADE initially display a statistically significant association, and Charles Schwab joins them when a one-month lag is introduced. However, when controlling for market-wide options activity through OCC equity options volume, no brokerage has a statistically significant association with their average options PFOF rate, and Robinhood displays statistical significance with the OCC equity options volume; this may partly be attributed to overcontrolling if market-wide options activity is a downstream effect of options promotion. Lastly, when excluding E*TRADE and Charles Schwab's transition months following acquisitions, neither brokerage displays a statistically significant association. Collectively, the evidence suggests heterogeneity among brokerages, with Robinhood showing the clearest association between options PFOF and promotion strength. The results have implications on regulation surrounding best-interest obligations and options disclosures, especially as more retail investors enter the market.",

          "abstract": "Traditional labor negotiations are frequently perceived as difficult and high-risk, involving actors predisposed to defensive and antagonistic positions. This work addresses this problem by exploring the application of intercultural negotiation techniques, typically used in commercial relations, as a viable alternative for improving negotiations between unions and companies. Through an investigative and practical approach, utilizing tools borrowed from social anthropology, the author identified and measured significant cultural differences, not only among nationalities but also between the negotiating entities themselves: companies and unions. Although the negotiators' country of origin culture is predominant, there is a marked, albeit relative, difference between business culture and union culture, regardless of the country of origin. This relative difference proved sufficient to apply intercultural techniques, changing the traditional antagonistic view. The underlying model contrasts these cultures across eight key dimensions (Table 1) and underscores the importance of Cultural Intelligence (CQ) for managing communication, trust, and power in this context. The application of this approach has shown promising results, including the reduction in the number of requests in the petitions, the decrease in the number of negotiation rounds required, and agreements that are more beneficial for both parties. This methodology promotes a collaborative vision instead of a confrontational one, which is essential for constructive dialogue in the modern labor market.",

To identify this effect, I exploit the deaths of elderly co-residents which occur during the study period in an empirical strategy which relies on triple-differences with child fixed-effects. I show that an event of elderly death is associated with 23% additional education completed over a period of 4 years by affected girls. I present evidence that changes in demand for informal caregiving among older female children within the household are one of the mechanisms at play. These results highlight the importance of female teenagers in caregiving activities and suggest that policies that increase the availability of formal care for the elderly could reduce gender inequalities in education in contexts similar to Senegal.",

For over a decade, large Silicon Valley technology firms have been relying on outsourcing of data work via a host of intermediary suppliers and labour platforms to different parts of the globe often the Global South region, such as East Africa. Much of this work is often shrouded in secrecy as firms rarely reveal the extent of their value chains. This results in the poor and marginalised forming the hidden underbelly of the Silicon Valley, training some of their most advanced machines in adverse working conditions.

Support Vector Machine regression analysis shows that eco-friendliness ratings are explained almost entirely by overall guest satisfaction, with sustainability indicators contributing little explanatory power. This suggests that ratings conflate general service impressions with perceptions of environmental responsibility, limiting their value as measures of sustainability performance. While plausible explanations such as response biases and the limited salience of many certified practices warrant further research, our findings provide robust evidence that single survey items on eco-friendliness should be interpreted with caution. For platforms and policymakers, the results highlight the need to make sustainability cues more visible and directly tied to the consumer experience if ratings are to support informed choice.",

          "authors": "Daniel Martinez-Felip; Steven G.M. Schilizzi; Chi Nguyen; David Pannell",
          "abstract": "In analysing potential policy responses to improve outcomes in collective-action problems, economists often focus on financial disincentives to reduce the expected gains from free-riding and thereby promote within-group cooperation. In this study, we investigate the potential for groups to develop non-financial disincentives to free riding, thereby promoting convergence towards collectively beneficial actions. Using a within-subjects laboratory experiment, participants play two multi-period public-goods games sequentially: without and then with non-financial incentives activated by allowing for the endogenous formation of a social exclusion mechanism. This is operationalised by allowing participants, at a personal cost, to assign exclusion tickets to group members after observing their contributions: the member(s) having accumulated the most in their group gets excluded from a group activity not involving monetary payoffs nor linked to the main game. First, the threat of receiving exclusion tickets, then the threat of being excluded, and finally actually being excluded work as non-financial social disincentives to free ride. Results show that group members who contribute relatively less receive more exclusion tickets. By imposing expected social costs on relatively low contributors, exclusion or the threat of exclusion enables groups to operate with higher contribution levels, thereby reversing the collective decline in contributions observed in the Baseline public good game. Exclusion is experienced by individuals who consistently contribute less than other group members, and this experience amplifies the effectiveness of the subsequent exclusion threat. Willingness to incur personal costs to enhance the exclusion threat increases over time and it is shaped by more cooperative normative expectations. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who perceive norms as tight, especially when higher contributions become more dispersed. In the absence of financial disincentives, these patterns show how non-financial incentives, shaped by more cooperative normative expectations, can foster group coordination and higher public-good contributions.",

          "abstract": "Firms increasingly drive college graduates' labor market earnings, yet the vast literature on the value-added of college has largely overlooked their role. Drawing on human capital theory and institutional theories of credentialism, closure, and organizational matching, I argue that college-to-workplace pipelines are a critical driver of college value-added. To test this, I assemble a novel US employer-employee matched dataset merged with postsecondary and high school academic records. Firm placement explains much of the variation in earnings premiums between colleges. Absent firm sorting, the range of counterfactual earnings differences across colleges would fall by 56%, and over half of the earnings advantage to attending the state flagship comes from access to higher-paying employers. These sorting effects extend broadly across the distribution of high-wage firms, and not merely a handful of elite employers. Crucially, sorting effects do not simply reflect skill-based advantages, implying that college quality derives as much from institutional linkages to the labor market as from human capital development. Policies aimed at broadening recruitment pipelines, rather than solely improving instructional inputs, are therefore essential to reducing inequalities in the economic returns to higher education.",

          "abstract": "Organization redesign often raises a central question: Where are managers needed? A potential substitute for formal supervision by managers is interpersonal cultural alignment, which can ease coordination between colleagues. Yet prior research suggests cultural alignment may also complement formal structure. We theorize that the balance depends on coordinative complexity: Whether culturally aligned individuals benefit from common supervision hinges on how broadly they depend on others to get work done. Cultural alignment substitutes for formal structure when coordinative complexity is low and complements it when coordinative complexity is high. Focusing on one of the most tangible and consequential forms of cultural alignment---the degree to which individuals are linguistically aligned with their peers in everyday communications---we make predictions about which pairs of colleagues will be brought together under, versus pulled apart from, a shared supervisor. Using archival data from a design firm, we find support for our theory, with effects especially strong when colleagues are highly visible to their senior managers.",

          "abstract": "We combine household survey micro data, tax data, and national accounts to construct annual pretax income inequality series for South Korea, which is coherent with macro aggregates. We provide the distribution of pretax national income over the time period from 1933 to 2022, with detailed breakdown by income composition in the years from 1996 to 2022. Our new series demonstrates that Korean top income shares decreased substantially from the 1930s up until the mid-1960s, following various wars, independence and land reform policies. Income inequalities then stabilized against the backdrop of rapid economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and decreased even further from the late 1980s onwards until the onset of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, which contradicts the “Kuznets Curve.” In the aftermath of the crisis, income inequality worsened due to the rise of tax-exempted capital income concentration at the top. Compared to other East Asian countries, South Korea exhibits relatively lower levels of income inequality in terms of higher bottom 50% income shares, mostly due to a more equal distribution of national income growth at the stages of economic take-off in the 1980s, even though income concentration at the very top has strikingly worsened over the last two decades, with its top 1% income shares in 2022 returning back to the peak only observed during the colonial era.

Using cross- sectional data, the paper analyzes the impact of saving and population growth, technology and capital depreciation rates on the economic growth of a country. It shows that, in line with the textbook Solow model, higher saving positively affects economic growth, while the population growth rate affects it negatively. However, the paper demonstrates higher values of the OLS estimators of these factors than predicted by the Solow model, which suggests that augmentation of the model is necessary for it to be more successful in explaining the variation in international standards of living.",

          "authors": "Brittany Tarufelli; James Gibson; Sarah Barrows; Abhishek Somani; Daniel Boff",
          "abstract": "Energy storage plays a crucial role in modern power systems, providing services such as grid stability, frequency regulation, and load balancing. Currently, storage systems earn revenue by offering these grid services and through energy arbitrage—buying electricity when prices are low and selling when prices are high. However, as storage deployment expands, arbitrage profitability declines due to market saturation and narrowing price differentials (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2024). In ERCOT, for example, 2024 saw reduced arbitrage potential due to moderate weather and increased storage capacity. This trend underscores the need for new business models that more fully recognize and compensate the value energy storage provides to the power system.\n\nThis paper presents empirical research on the full value of energy storage and proposes a commodity-market-based framework to better align compensation mechanisms with system-wide benefits. We examine hydropower as a proxy for grid-scale storage, using exogenous variation in reservoir storage volume to estimate causal effects on (1) real-time electricity prices and (2) risk premiums, measured by the day-ahead to real-time price spread, in the Northwestern United States between May 2022 and November 2024. Employing fixed-effects and lagged dependent variable models, we control for unobserved heterogeneity across balancing authorities and capture dynamic price behavior.\n\nWe find that a 10% increase in reservoir storage volume reduces real-time prices by approximately 6% and lowers risk premiums by about 5%, indicating that storage mitigates short-term supply–demand imbalances. These effects are most pronounced during grid stress events, such as cold snaps, suggesting that stored energy provides significant value when the system is under strain. The results are robust to dynamic pricing effects and highlight storage’s role in reducing both price volatility and systemic risk.\n\nOverall, stored energy substantially reduces system costs and alleviates grid stress, yet most electricity markets lack mechanisms that compensate storage for these benefits. As revenue from arbitrage and grid services diminishes with increased deployment, alternative business models are needed to reward storage for its intrinsic function—potentially through the creation of a stand-alone commodity, such as stored energy itself (see the winter reserve mechanism in Switzerland). Our findings provide empirical support for developing future market frameworks that more accurately capture the risk-reducing and reliability-enhancing contributions of grid-scale energy storage.",

          "abstract": "Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea marked the onset of a systematic repression campaign against the Crimean Tatar population. We introduce CriTaRep v1.0, the first comprehensive, geo-coded event dataset documenting state repression against Crimean Tatars (2014-2024). Drawing on locally sourced materials in Crimean Tatar, Ukrainian, and Russian languages, CriTaRep records n = 690 repression events affecting more than 2,200 individual victims. We inductively identify 22 repression types across three categories: deprivation of liberty, legal and administrative repression, and physical repression. Our data shows a strategic yet adaptive campaign, including a systematic concentration of arbitrary searches on Thursdays, initial physical repression targeting primarily elites, and intensified repression during periods of dissent. Integrating additional disaggregated variables and employing fixed-effects Poisson models, we find that the short-term frequency of repression is significantly driven by protest activity, rather than sanction levels or cultural focal events. Russian authorities respond rapidly and increasingly harshly to dissent, pursuing a dual strategy of immediate protest suppression and long-term deterrence. CriTaRep fills critical gaps in existing datasets and provides new opportunities to study patterns and mechanisms of demographically targeted repression.",

          "abstract": "This proof-of-concept study introduces the Social Morphology Ball, a framework for visualizing multivariate social data as three-dimensional morphological structures. The method normalizes variables using the median and interquartile range (IQR), followed by nonlinear compression with a hyperbolic tangent function to reduce the impact of extreme outliers. Each normalized variable is mapped onto spherical basis functions, transforming numerical relationships into geometric deformations—bulges or concavities—on a sphere. When all variables align with their long-term medians, the model yields a perfect sphere representing a morphologically neutral, structurally balanced state. Implemented in Python, the pipeline automates normalization, shape generation, and visualization, exporting results in STL, PNG, and GIF formats. Applied to Japanese national statistics from 2015–2023, the model captured temporal variations in the balance and distortion of societal indicators through intuitive 3D forms. By interpreting data as morphology rather than numbers, this approach extends social data visualization into a sensory and cognitive domain, providing a conceptual foundation for morphological visualization of social phenomena and potential applications in education, policy, and data-driven art.",

          "abstract": "摘要\n\n本研究旨在解决客家民系与语言起源的核心谜题。通过整合大规模群体遗传学数据、数学模型、制度经济学分析、历史地理学与语言学证据，本文提出了一个有别于传统“中原移民说”与“土著融合说”的整合性理论。其核心论点是：现代客家民系的主体，其根源并非晚至宋代的北方移民，而是可追溯至公元前三世纪秦帝国派驻岭南的南方野战主力。\n\n决定性证据来自大规模全基因组数据分析。 分析显示：（1）众多南方汉族及客家核心父系（如曾氏、黄氏、钟氏）的共祖时间，并非如传统叙事所暗示的魏晋或唐宋，而是惊人地集中在距今2300-2100年前，与秦军南征及南越国立国的时间窗口完全重合。（2）客家群体的常染色体主体（超过80%）为古老的南方汉族基底，其“北方汉族”成分虽高于广府地区，但远不足以支持“北方移民”为主体的论断。\n\n基于此，本理论重构了客家民系的演化路径：这支秦军事拓殖集团，在赵佗建立的南越国时期及之后西汉“以其故俗治”的制度框架下，形成了享有高度自治权的“南越士族”。他们凭借组织与技术优势，系统性地占据了华南关键山间盆地，并为维系其制度特权而长期采取“战略性默存”的集体生存策略。这一策略使其在近千年的时间内实现了内部的稳定繁衍和文化的独立演化，其所使用的古老汉语（“南越国国语”）也得以保存，成为客家话的直接源头。直至宋代，随着科举制度的全面渗透，该群体才开始吸收少量携带“中原叙事”的北方移民，其文化认同也随之重塑，最终形成了现代客家的面貌。\n\n本理论将客家的形成，理解为一个以秦军事拓殖集团为生物学基础，历经千年制度性封存，最终在文化上被后来者叙事所覆盖的复杂过程，为客赣同源、客粤差异等区域性难题提供了统一的解释框架。\n\n关键词：客家，群体遗传学，秦军，南越国，南越士族，战略性默存，客赣同源，历史社会学，方言地理学",

          "abstract": "A new software platform is presented in this article to oversee and manage urban and industrial smart systems by employing digital twin technologies and immersive, interactive metaverse settings, thereby achieving environmentally sustainable urban infrastructure. The system proposed is prepared to track, simulate, and optimize building performance using predictive analytics and interactive dashboards, and thus serves as a modular, interoperable solution. By defining a multi-residential site management case study, a working prototype is developed and implemented here using simulated and realistic datasets, thereby designed for real-time calculation and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) across various areas, including energy efficiency, preventive maintenance, user experience through design, and economic performance. The choice of KPIs, such as energy usage intensity, return on investment, and user satisfaction, can benefit from this technology setup and yield improvements through enhanced operational efficiency, clearer decision-making, and long-term cost-effectiveness. Although such obstacles exist, empirical testing with real data may reveal that integration with hardware, interoperability with existing setups, and economic costing are feasible for small to medium-sized players. With evaluation performed using simulated data, the platform suggests a prospective setup ready to be tested through pilot testing with real-world deployment. In situating the Smart Infrastructure Metaverse here, as a transformation setup of digital governance within a built and developed framework with technological innovation coupled with sustainability and with inclusivity to all the players/stakeholders, the cities embarked here through ever-increasing digital ecosystems with advantages of having such works through an emerging discussion of how immersive technology informs here of a next-generation potential of smart, sustainable, and participatory urban living.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nMolecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) integrate molecular and clinical data to guide precision oncology decisions. However, their structure and functioning remain highly heterogeneous across Europe. This study aimed to develop consensus-based policy recommendations to support their harmonized implementation. \nMethods:\nA two-round Delphi process was conducted among 17 European experts actively involved in MTBs. Questionnaire items were derived from a systematic and scoping review on the clinical impact and implementation aspects of MTBs. Experts rated items on a five-point Likert scale, with consensus predefined as a Content Validity Index (CVI) ≥ 80% of experts agreeing or strongly agreeing (scores 4-5).\nResults:\nAcross two Delphi rounds, 76 items were evaluated. Thirty-six achieved consensus and were consolidated into 15 recommendations across four domains: organizational aspects (n = 8), testing (n = 3), inclusion criteria (n = 2), and clinical aspects (n = 2). Organizational standards emphasized the appointment of a referent clinician, the use of standardized digital submission tools, online meeting formats, and the integration of decision-support systems. The recommended MTB composition was multidisciplinary, including oncologists, molecular biologists, pathologists, geneticists, and other relevant specialists. In the testing domain, experts agreed that NGS should be the preferred approach for molecular profiling, conducted in certified laboratories, with variant interpretation supported by curated databases (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC, OncoKB). Inclusion criteria prioritized patients with metastatic or rare diseases, ECOG performance status 0–2, life expectancy ≥12 weeks, and exhaustion of standard therapeutic options.\nConclusions:\nThis Delphi consensus produced 15 policy recommendations to standardize and sustain MTBs across Europe. These guidelines complement existing frameworks by providing practical operational guidance for precision oncology implementation.",

          "abstract": "El Consenso de Washington ha sido uno de los paradigmas de política económica más influyentes y controvertidos de finales del siglo XX. Concebido como un decálogo de reformas orientadas al mercado, su implementación generó un vasto cuerpo de literatura que evalúa sus impactos. Esta revisión narrativa cualitativa sintetiza la evidencia de 53 estudios académicos para ofrecer una visión panorámica de su legado. Se exploran sus orígenes y evolución, la evidencia empírica que lo asocia con mejoras en el crecimiento, y las críticas que lo vinculan con el aumento de la desigualdad y las crisis económicas. Finalmente, se analiza el surgimiento de narrativas post-consenso, argumentando que esta evolución, más que una ruptura, representa una adaptación estratégica del neoliberalismo. Los hallazgos revelan que, si bien la era de las soluciones universales ha terminado, el paradigma post-consenso a menudo recicla principios fundamentales bajo un nuevo lenguaje de inclusión y especificidad contextual, planteando nuevos desafíos para la búsqueda de alternativas de desarrollo genuinas.",
