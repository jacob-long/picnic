          "authors": "Marta Topor; Henrik Danielsson",
          "abstract": "Preregistration, the process of publicly recording a study’s hypotheses, design, and analysis plan before data collection and/or analysis, is an essential practice for enhancing transparency, methodological rigour, and reproducibility in research. This chapter provides a practical guide for integrating preregistration into teaching and supervision.\n\nThe first section highlights arguments for adopting preregistration, emphasising its role in reducing biases. It introduces preregistration as a critical skill for academic development and offers guidance for designing learning exercises, including activities that build competencies in hypothesis formulation, study design, and analysis planning relevant to both quantitative and qualitative studies.\nThe second section addresses the practical implementation of preregistration in student-led projects. It discusses how to support preregistration across methodological traditions—quantitative, qualitative, and systematic reviews—and offers concrete guidance on template selection, platform use, managing deviations from preregistered plans, and reporting exploratory analyses.",

          "authors": "María de los Ángeles Crespo López; Claudia Pallise Perello; Jeroen de Ridder; Krishma Labib",
          "abstract": "The open science (OS) movement is growing, with increasing policies, guidelines, tools and infrastructures being developed to support researchers who engage in OS practices. However, there is no widely accepted single definition of OS. Different initiatives and countries employ a variety of characterizations. To chart how OS is understood in different parts of the world, we conducted a scoping review and critical discourse analysis of OS guidance documents aimed at researchers. Our search led to the inclusion of 69 national and international documents, with most originating from North America, Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that OS discourses are exaggerated, framing OS as the solution to address all scientific and societal problems. Furthermore, they provide often conflicting ideas about what OS can achieve. Many guidance documents frame OS as a tool to promote economic growth and efficiency. Others see OS as necessary to safeguard research quality and reproducibility through transparency. In contrast, few documents address knowledge equity and inclusion. Taking this into account, we see dominant OS discourses reproducing knowledge equity problems already present in research, rather than tackling them. We urge researchers be more precise about the specific approach they take to OS and more humble about the effects it can have – both positive, and negative.",

          "authors": "Crystal Nicole Steltenpohl; Stephanie Beckman; Laurel Standiford Reyes; Monica Gonzalez-Marquez; Gizem Solmaz-Ratzlaff; Madeleine Pownall; Charlotte Rebecca Pennington",
          "abstract": "This chapter focuses on multidisciplinary teaching strategies for open qualitative research. It addresses open science values (transparency, reproducibility, and inclusivity), practices (preregistration, replication, data sharing, etc.), and class activities. Teaching qualitative open science is more effectively accomplished when researchers conceptualize scientific processes as expressions of human cognition and various types of labor with the goal of creating usable and reliable documentation for posterity. This chapter covers practices developed within qualitative paradigms (reflexivity, audit trails, negative case analysis, etc.) and offers suggestions for how to lead diverse populations of students through the logic and application of these paradigms. Emphasizing contextual integrity, the chapter explores how to ethically balance openness with participant confidentiality and cultural sensitivity. While this chapter focuses on qualitative perspectives, these perspectives and practices are also relevant and beneficial to those working with quantitative data and methods.",

          "authors": "Philipp Stang; Hanna Brandt; Christian Heidl; Yvonne Sedelmaier",
          "abstract": "The sexuality of older people in long-term residential care remains a taboo topic, often met with uncertainty and prejudice among care staff. Many facilities lack clear guidelines and training, leading to restrictions on residents' sexual self-determination. Professionalization in this area can be improved through targeted education. This study investigates the effects of a profession-specific workshop on handling sexuality in long-term care. Using a pre-post mixed-methods design, 27 nursing staff members were surveyed before and after the workshop with a psychometric questionnaire (BS-SWE). Additionally, qualitative data was gathered through observations and content analysis. Findings show varied responses to the topic: some staff engaged openly, while others found it uncomfortable. Challenges included dealing with assaultive behavior, cultural differences, and ethical concerns. Participants emphasized the need for further training, increased privacy for residents, and better documentation of incidents. Quantitative results revealed a significant increase (p &lt; .001, d = .865) in job-specific self-efficacy expectations, shifting from a lower to an upper average range compared to norm values. Since sexual issues frequently arise in nursing care, systematic preparation and destigmatization are essential for professional practice. Sexual psychology workshops effectively enhance self-efficacy, though ethical issues such as documentation and sexually transmitted diseases require further attention.",

          "authors": "Greta Manini; Francisco Garre-Frutos; Elisa Martín-Arévalo; Fabiano Botta; Juan Lupiáñez",
          "abstract": "Perceptual load theory (Forster &amp; Lavie, 2008) is a key framework in visual attention research, demonstrating that under high-load conditions, fully irrelevant distractors are no longer processed and do not disrupt task performance. In our recent work (Manini et al., 2025), we replicated this effect. However, we also found that under high load, the distractor not only failed to impair performance but actually led to faster reaction times (RTs) in distractor-present trials. In the broader attentional capture literature, this reversed effect is typically considered to reflect distractor suppression. However, in the perceptual load task, where the distractor is placed outside the relevant search array, suppression should not logically lead to faster responses.  Furthermore, the faster responses were accompanied by increased error rates, leading us to hypothesize that this reversed effect reflects spatially controlled attentional capture rather than distractor suppression. Specifically, the distractor may alert the attentional system, accelerating responses, while attention moving to its position remains somehow controlled, as the distractor is never the target. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the consistency of this effect across all available open-data resources using the Forster and Lavie (2008) task. We then reanalyzed the same data, incorporating the spatial proximity between target and distractor, observing that trials with the distractor near the target strongly drove the reversed RT effect, while trials with the distractor far from the target led to increased error rates. These findings challenge the idea that high perceptual load prevents attentional capture by irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, they suggest that faster RTs in distractor-present conditions do not necessarily indicate distractor suppression, as commonly assumed in attentional capture research, giving new insight into the interpretation of this reversed effect.",

          "abstract": "Open data are often regarded as an important step towards improving the reproducibility and transparency of educational science. Yet, data sharing remains rare, and without open data, statistical analyses often remain irreproducible. In this article, we provide an introduction to synthetic data, a statistical technique based on multiple imputation (MI) that can be used to create simulated copies of the data that can be shared even when the original data cannot. To this end, we discuss reproducibility-related challenges of synthetic data and outline different approaches for generating synthetic data, including conventional and data-augmented MI (DA-MI) approaches to synthetic data. Furthermore, we conducted a case study using data from the PISA 2018 study, in which we aimed to address several challenges with synthetic data in educational research, such as missing data, multilevel data, and complex sampling designs. Our results indicate that these challenges can be addressed with relatively simple tools and that synthetic data can reproduce the results in a variety of statistical analyses. Finally, we discuss remaining challenges and directions for future research.",

          "authors": "Samuel Finnerty; jared piazza; Mark Levine",
          "abstract": "Amidst escalating global environmental crises, understanding the psychological factors driving pro-environmental action is crucial. We argue that stewarding the Earth System away from instability requires an embrace of expansive perspectives that drive effective action. Past perspectives underscore the importance of ‘expansiveness’ for prosocial behaviour, including both a more inclusive moral universe and an extended self-concept. Across two studies (N = 546), assessed via the well-established Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and identification processes. Specifically, we employed a tailored version of the MES to scrutinize self-identity and its relative expansiveness. Study 1 revealed a significant relationship between moral concern and self-expansion, yet each exhibited distinct patterns, displaying discriminant validity. The degree of identification with an entity, especially nature-related ones, related to moral concern judgments associated with it, offering fresh insights into moral expansiveness. In Study 2, individuals demonstrating broader and deeper moral circles, alongside a more inclusive self-concept, exhibited heightened tendencies to identify as environmental activists and engage in pro-environmental activism. However, neither construct predicted signing the Climate and Ecology Bill, indicating the need for further investigation into factors influencing pro-environmental behaviour. This paper extends research into environmental activism by examining the unique contribution of expansiveness in moral circles and the self-concept, shedding light on individuals' prosocial engagement with the natural world.",

          "abstract": "Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users’ diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.",

          "abstract": "Although people’s ideological beliefs are key to understanding how they make moral judgments, existing research has been silent on how such ideological beliefs drive their psychological perceptions of corporations and their responses to corporate misconduct. Across multiple studies we consistently found that people high in SDO judge organizational transgressions less harshly. These results generalized across organizational size and industry, and they were not explained by political orientation. However, evidence for the mechanism for this relationship, including the role of mind perception and perceived threat, was mixed. We discuss possible reasons for such mixed evidence and the theoretical implications of the findings.",

          "authors": "Andrew Jun Lee; Grace Qiyuan Miao; Rick Dale; Alexia Galati; Hongjing Lu",
          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Sensory processing sensitivity (sensitivity) involves the ways people differ in being attentive and responsive to bodily, social, and environmental cues. We aimed to build evidence that sensitivity is complementary to other individual differences and measures of personality, yet is not redundant with measures of temperament, traits, character, and narrative identity. We recruited 774 young adults from the central U.S. (M age = 18.9 years; 60.9% women) and tested relations between sensitivity and other self-reports and narrative expressions of personality. Each dimension of sensitivity was significantly correlated with other measures of personality. These correlations were not so large as to suggest redundancy between measures. Further, sensitivity to emotional and physiological stimuli was related to the ways people changed expressions of narrative processing between the construction of positive-valence and negative-valence life stories. We discuss how findings reinforce theories about sensory processing sensitivity and personality, as well as the value of considering sensitivity as distinct yet complementary to other longstanding measures of personality.",

By reviewing evidence that children use social groups to judge others across a range of contexts, it describes findings regarding children’s attitudes toward group members—that they hold positive views of ingroup members and negative views of outgroup members—as well as their more general beliefs about members of different social groups, in the form of stereotypes. It also explores how children identify which groups in their environment are relevant for social judgment, and how children’s use of social groups both changes and remains continuous in different ways over the course of development. Finally, it discusses the implications of this research for facilitating positive intergroup relations.",

          "authors": "Carolynn Hare; Anne-Marie Muller; Tyler C. Dalal; Elim Chan; Samantha Schulz; Ryan A Stevenson",
          "abstract": "In daily life, we are constantly bombarded with sensory information from multiple sources. Our ability to combine these cues into a single perceptual experience is known as multisensory integration. Research is starting to show that multisensory integration may be altered in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, most studies have focused on clinical populations, leaving little known about how multisensory integration related to ADHD traits along a dimensional spectrum, consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach. The present study examined associations between ADHD traits and multisensory integration in university students using three different behavioural tasks (i.e., Sound-Induced Flash Illusion [SIFI], McGurk, and speech-in-noise). ADHD traits were assessed dimensionally, including overall ADHD traits, as well as inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive trait dimensions. Participants were also divided into High ADHD and Low ADHD trait groups for categorical comparisons. Results indicated no significant associations between overall, inattentive, or hyperactive-impulsive ADHD traits and performance on any of the multisensory tasks. Similarly, no group differences were observed between High and Low ADHD trait groups. These findings suggest that multisensory integration differences reported in previous research may emerge only when ADHD traits reach clinical severity, rather than existing across the broader continuum of traits. This study highlights the importance of considering both dimensional and categorical approaches when examining cognitive mechanisms in ADHD. Future work should explore developmental and contextual factors that may shape multisensory integration in clinically significant ADHD.",

          "authors": "Hemali Angne; Snigdha Mishra; Guo Lin; Qiong Zhang",
          "abstract": "A fundamental question in psychology is how humans digest, retain, and reconstruct information. While this process has been extensively studied in laboratory-based memory recall tasks, we have missed opportunities to examine it under more naturalistic, real-world conditions. Summarization is a task that people routinely engage in every day, and it is also a long-standing challenge in the machine learning community. Researchers in machine learning have developed rich datasets of human summaries for model training, which represent a valuable and largely untapped resource for cognitive science researchers. In this work, we analyze 45,220 human summaries drawn from three large datasets, including news articles, autobiographical stories, and Reddit posts, and compare them with a dataset of narrative memory recall. We demonstrate a close relationship between human summarization and laboratory-based memory recall. We show that while summarization operates at a higher level of the event abstraction than memory recall, the two tasks share deep similarities. The process of summarizing is fundamentally constrained by the mechanisms of memory recall, displaying behavioral patterns that align with well-known memory biases. Conversely, memory recall takes the form of summarization, prioritizing more central and important information. Together, these findings bridge the real-world task of summarization and the rich literature on memory recall and lay the foundation for developing integrated theories of how humans digest and reconstruct information.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Many current interventions target reward deficits in depression and anxiety. However, fear of happiness, a construct representing reward devaluation may negatively impact the efficacy of these reward-based interventions. As such, the current meta-analysis sought to examine the associations between fear of happiness and psychopathology.\n\nMethod: We conducted a scoping literature review in July 2025 from various databases. We calculated the pooled Hedges’ g for each of the following meta-analyses: the association between fear of happiness and (1) concurrent depression, (2) longitudinal depression, (3) concurrent anxiety, and (4) concurrent anhedonia. We also conducted moderation analyses for culture, scale version, symptom severity, and demographics.\n\nResults: Twenty-six samples were included, representing 6,604 different individuals. We found large effect sizes for the cross-sectional associations between fear of happiness and depression (g = 1.117), anxiety (g = 0.999), and anhedonia (g = 0.837), and a small-to-medium effect size for the longitudinal association between fear of happiness and depression (g = 0.481). We also found stronger associations in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.\n\nConclusion: Our findings provide evidence of strong concurrent and predictive implications of fear of happiness on depression, as well as concurrent implications on anxiety and anhedonia. Moreover, there were nuanced differences across cultures, symptom severity, and scale version, indicating that the clinical implications of fear of happiness may differ across populations. Nevertheless, these findings provide rationale for the assessment and treatment of fear of happiness among persons with depression and anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Background: Various lines of research explore how psychosocial factors like gender dysphoria, minority stress, gender euphoria, and social support affect trans people’s mental health. Conceptualizations of these factors have continuously evolved, resulting in a diverse spectrum of ideas for research on stressors and resources, but also leading to a considerable risk of overlap and confusion. Thus, clarifying and distinguishing these factors is now crucial for improving research and mental health care in this population. This study aims to develop a comprehensive questionnaire on stressors and resources relevant to trans and non-binary individuals, designed for health services and therapy outcome research, and inclusive of all gender identities.\n\nMethods: Participants (n=483 trans adults; age range 18-62) filled out an online questionnaire of candidate items for a comprehensive questionnaire (A-JOURNEY) on stressors and resources as well as self-report measures for well-being and psychopathology to assess criterion validity. We used parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis to identify the questionnaire’s factors and select items.\n\nResults: Analyses yielded a final A-JOURNEY questionnaire comprising 53 items that assesses nine stress factors and four resource factors. Extracted factors showed high reliability (𝛼=.77-.93) and correlated with mental health outcomes in the expected directions.\n\nDiscussion: The A-JOURNEY questionnaire provides a comprehensive tool for assessing stressors and resources in trans and non-binary individuals, streamlining evaluation without requiring multiple measures. While validation for change sensitivity is still required, it shows promise for advancing psychological and healthcare research and may enhance our understanding of how specific trans-specific stressors/resources affect mental health.",

          "abstract": "Language comprehension involves prediction, but what exactly can comprehenders predict? We ask if bilinguals can consciously predict upcoming code-switches between languages. If predictions focus on a sentence’s message, then listeners should not predict code-switches, which alter the language used but not necessarily the meaning. Alternatively, if listeners predict at many levels—including language—then they may predict code-switches. Here, we selected sentences from a corpus of spontaneous bilingual conversations that started in Spanish and removed the final word that would have continued in Spanish or code-switched to English. In two pre-registered experiments, Spanish-English bilinguals heard these sentence fragments and predicted the language of the omitted final word. They successfully predicted upcoming code-switches when given 30 seconds of context prior to their predictions (Experiment 1; N=94), but not when only hearing the sentence fragment (Experiment 2, N=115). This shows that bilinguals can predict upcoming code-switches when sufficient conversational cues are available.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Aurora Cárdenas; Melanie B. Fessinger",
          "abstract": "Research Summary\nWe compared ratings provided by 355 judges and 372 laypeople on the ethicality of various prosecutorial behaviors and whether they should be investigated as possible misconduct. Most prosecutorial behaviors were sourced from exoneration cases and varied from highly egregious misconduct (e.g., manipulating exculpatory evidence) to more questionable in nature (e.g., opposing a defense expert witness on Frye grounds). Results showed that laypeople had generally stricter ethical standards—perceiving acts as more unethical (d = 0.36) and more worthy of investigation (21 of 27 acts; 77%) compared to judges. Notably, however, this varied based on individual acts. For some acts, specifically those with clearly established legal rules, judges had stricter ethical standards instead. Overall, our data showed wide variation in ethicality and investigation judgments across individuals, across respondent type, and across specific acts. \nPolicy Implications \nLaypeople were more skeptical of prosecutorial discretion than judges—a skepticism that may be justified given that many of the behaviors stemmed from wrongful conviction cases. Yet, as experts, judges are in a better position to identify and report misconduct. This discrepancy between who perceives and who reports misconduct may partly explain why misconduct is seldom investigated or sanctioned. Laypeople, however, are not powerless to mitigate such injustices. As jurors, awareness of misconduct can protect them from being unduly influenced by improper prosecutorial tactics. As members of the court of public opinion, laypeople shape narratives about justice processes, apply pressure for institutional accountability, and can mobilize collective action when official outcomes clash with public values. Most critically, as voters, laypeople influence the platforms on which prosecutors run and who ultimately gets elected, which can help drive more ethical institutional norms within prosecutors’ offices. Our results highlight the challenges facing prosecutorial oversight and accountability, underscoring the roles that judges and laypeople can play in addressing them.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI systems, especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, have recently emerged as significant contributors to creative processes. While LLMs can produce creative content that might be as good as or even better than human-created content, their widespread use risks reducing creative diversity across groups of people. In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.",

For practical use, MLOB supports unbalanced group sizes through built-in balancing\nprocedures and offers comprehensive inference, including estimates, standard errors,\np values, and confidence intervals for both target predictors and covariates. To provide\ncontext, we first review the theoretical underpinnings of the regularized Bayesian estimator\n(Dashuk et al. 2024, 2025a), followed by a description of its implementation in MLOB,\nfocusing on the core function mlob().

Specifically, we allow for the inclusion of covariates and optimize the estimator’s accuracy in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Simulation results indicate that the regularized Bayesian estimator consistently outperforms both standard and transformed maximum likelihood (ML) estimators, especially in scenarios with small sample sizes and low intraclass correlations. While the estimator achieves lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and relative bias, it exhibited poorer coverage rates and less reliable standard errors compared to ML estimators. To address these limitations, we propose some strategies. Furthermore, a transformed ML estimator is utilized to enhance the accuracy of the estimation of the covariate parameter γ.

          "abstract": "Previous studies have examined how the COVID-19 pandemic affected dream recall, dream content, and nightmares. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to the individual and situational factors associated with pandemic-induced changes in dreams. The threat simulation theory of dreaming predicts that threatening situations in our waking life (situational factors) influence threatening dream content. At the same time, individual differences predispose some people to be more prone to experience threatening dreams more frequently than others. Using a large Finnish sample of prospective dream diaries, we analyzed the relative importance of individual (e.g., belonging to COVID-19 risk group, life satisfaction, depression symptoms) and situational factors (e.g., daily COVID-19 worry, COVID-19 media consumption, negative and positive emotions) to determine the best predictors for threatening events and COVID-19 related threatening events in dreams. Random forest analyses revealed that individual factors were consistently better predictors than situational factors for both threatening events and pandemic-related threatening events in dreams. Lower life satisfaction was the only statistically significant predictor for threatening events, and fewer positive emotions in the past two weeks the only statistically significant predictor for pandemic-related threatening events, in dreams. These findings suggest that the propensity to experience threatening dream content, including pandemic-related threatening events, is more of a stable trait rather than a daily fluctuating feature of dreams. In the light of the threat simulation theory, it could be argued that individual variation in the proneness to simulate threatening events adaptively interacts with daily experiences to modulate threatening dream content.",

In addition, R&amp;S might be differentially related to processing exteroceptive and interoceptive information. The present study aimed at manipulating different components of the predictive processing model (prior beliefs and prediction error monitoring) in interoception, and evaluating the resulting changes in the implicit R&amp;S. In a variant of the heartbeat discrimination task (HDT), we used a sham transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol to induce prior beliefs about a decrease or increase of the heartbeat frequency (Experiment 1). Prediction error monitoring was modulated by manipulating error feedback reliability in the same HDT (Experiment 2). Results showed that the point of subjective equality and the decision criterion shifted towards the direction of the induced prior compared to the baseline condition only in the direction of the decreased heartbeat frequency (Experiment 1), while the sensitivity decreased with unreliable error feedback compared to reliable one (Experiment 2). Crucially, implicit S, but not R, that were measured after the HDT increased following the prior beliefs induction; no significant change was observed after the unreliable error feedback. The effects in Experiment 1 were modulated by the prevalence of autistic personality traits. Together, the results support the predictive coding account of R&amp;S where increased reliance on prior beliefs, but not on prediction error monitoring, has a crucial role in the R&amp;S experiences, and demonstrate the differential input of interoceptive signals in the R&amp;S.",

          "abstract": "Gender differences in reading comprehension and motivation can contribute to disparities between genders in educational and occupational success, as well as in societal participation. Previous meta-analyses on gender differences in reading have had several limitations: They investigated only student samples, lacked recent international effect size estimates, and focused on printed texts and a narrow set of motivational constructs. To address these gaps, we synthesized representative individual participant data from international large-scale assessments conducted between 1990 and 2023, spanning 130 countries and including both student and adult populations (total N = 6,365,416). Overall, females outperformed males in reading comprehension (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.17) and reported higher reading motivation (SMD = 0.22). Moderator analyses provided novel evidence that the magnitude of these gender differences varies systematically by age, assessment format, construct operationalization, and contextual factors. Gender differences in both reading comprehension and motivation were more pronounced during adolescence but decreased for motivation and diminished for comprehension in adulthood. Gender differences in reading comprehension were smaller for digital than for printed texts, and gender differences in task values were larger than those in self-beliefs. From 1990 to 2023, motivation differences declined, whereas comprehension differences increased overall but narrowed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater national prosperity and higher participation of women in management positions and tertiary education were associated with larger advantages for females in comprehension, whereas motivation differences decreased as national prosperity rose. These findings provide the most comprehensive and robust evidence on gender differences in reading with important implications for research, practice, and policy.",

To address this limitation, we introduce the Lockbox paradigm, a novel, ecologically valid, and challenging task that requires active exploration and physical interaction.\nData from 263 participants interacting with the Lockbox across three different interaction modalities of varying interaction costs, reveal a remarkable ability to adapt and solve problems efficiently in complex scenarios. By comparing the interaction modalities, we demonstrate the critical role of cost variations, such as physical and temporal costs, in driving attentiveness and shaping exploration strategies. These findings provide important insights into human exploration strategies, with potential applications in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence.",

Is this effect driven by the debunking facts and evidence, or does it rely on the messenger being an AI model? In other words, would the same message be equally effective if delivered by a human? To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief, and interacted with an AI model that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking AI model was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.",

We categorised targets’ dynamic facial displays of emotional reactions to game outcomes using MorphCast Emotion AI HTML5 SDK, an online machine-learning tool that detects emotions in recorded videos. Additionally, we investigated the role of perceivers ' covert facial mimicry during the categorisation task using facial electromyography (fEMG). Results indicate that while perceivers achieved above-chance accuracy in guessing targets’ outcomes (win, loss, or draw) from facial displays of emotion, they struggled to distinguish between losses and draws. Further, although emotions (positive vs. negative)appear to act as cues for outcome detection, fEMG data reveal no significant pattern of activation linked to outcome accuracy. These findings highlight facial display of emotion as a communicative tool for contextual information and the role of experience, societal and cultural norms in constructing subjective yet socially expected reactions across individuals.",

          "abstract": "Science-related populism, as a specific form of populist attitude toward scientific authority, has attracted increasing scholarly attention in recent years. Although the SciPop Scale has been proposed to measure this attitude, its cross-national validity and measurement invariance remain underexplored. Moreover, the impact of scoring approaches corresponding to different measurement philosophies on the interpretation of the SciPop Scale has not yet been examined. Using data from the “Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism” (TISP) project and the Swiss Science Barometer, this study analyzes a sample of 69,341 participants across 68 countries and regions, as well as a nationally representative Swiss sample of 1124 participants, to examine the psychometric properties of the SciPop Scale. The results indicate that: first, the SciPop Scale demonstrates high reliability, with a four-factor structure being the most widely applicable optimal model; second, full measurement invariance is achieved across sex, age, education, residence, political orientation, and religiosity, while partial invariance is observed across geographic regions, economic development levels, cultural values, and political regimes. However, overall cross-national comparability remains limited, though approximate invariance can be attained through measurement alignment. Third, different scoring methods yield inconsistent identification of the weakest dimension. Fourth, when examining criterion validity, alignment-adjusted scores based on the Bollen approach consistently outperform those based on the Goertz approach, showing greater explanatory power for cross-national or cross-group comparisons. Taken together, this study not only provides evidence for cross-national applicability of the SciPop Scale but also engages with broader questions regarding the measurement philosophy of populist attitudes. The choice of scoring method is not merely a technical decision; it directly shapes how the structure of populism is understood and interpreted.",

In the aftermath, the health and well-being of older adults have been a major concern for researchers and policymakers. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding the post-disaster health outcomes of older adults affected by this natural disaster. This study aims to first compare the health status of older adults who were affected by the flood to those who were unaffected using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting, approximately 1.5 years after the disaster, and then examine the impact of primary and secondary stressors on health outcomes among flood-affected older adults, identifying potential risk and protective factors. Results suggested that, for most health outcomes, there were no significant differences between the affected and unaffected groups. Notably, older adults who experienced the flood reported significantly lower levels of loneliness and better psychological health-related quality of life, suggesting effective recovery and strong resilience. However, injuries, the loss of close family members or friends, and structural damage to homes were significantly associated with poorer health and well-being. However, some counterintuitive findings also emerged, with certain stressors showing associations with better post-disaster health outcomes. In sum, our findings provide support for the inoculation/maturation hypothesis and challenge common assumptions about older adults’ vulnerability in disaster contexts.",

The intervention targeted loss-related memory characteristics, negative grief appraisals, a sense of social disconnection, and unhelpful coping strategies, and used a personalised digital modular approach and therapist support through weekly calls and messages. Outcomes were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up using validated measures.\nResults:\nAll participants completed treatment. Large reductions in PGD symptoms and comorbid symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment were observed. At post-treatment, 87.5% (7/8) demonstrated both reliable improvement in PGD symptoms on the Reliable Change Index, and recovery below clinical cut-offs. There was no reliable deterioration on any measure. Process measures showed large effect sizes, with the strongest improvements in loss-related memory characteristics. Therapeutic gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Average therapist time was approximately 10 hours per participant.\nConclusions:\niCT-PG was feasible, well-accepted, and associated with substantial clinical improvement. The intervention successfully targeted mechanisms known to maintain PGD, supporting its theoretical foundation. Though uncontrolled and small in sample size, findings support further evaluation in larger trials to determine efficacy and scalability.",

We manipulated stimulus onset asynchrony (300 ms vs. 1300 ms), reflecting early attentional engagement and later, more controlled processing phases respectively, and threat type (sensory-affective vs. stigma-related). \nResults:\nResults consistently showed no evidence of attentional bias toward personally relevant threat words compared to neutral control words. This was true during both attention processing phases.

However, successive systematic reviews have identified a lack of well-validated measures that capture ageism according to contemporary consensus definitions and that can be used to illuminate ageism experiences across the world. To address this gap, the WHO Ageism Experiences Scale was developed; however, to date it has not been validated in Arabic and there is limited knowledge about its functioning in humanitarian settings, where issues related to ageism may be exacerbated. The present study, therefore, conducted the first psychometric evaluation of the new Arabic translation of the scale in Libya, including participants who were directly affected by the recent devastating floods. As relevant, results supported the factorial validity, internal consistency reliability, convergent validity and concurrent validity of the subscale scores, including in participants affected by the floods. This suggests that the Arabic version of the scale can be recommended for use, including in humanitarian contexts where ageism and its consequences may be exacerbated.",

          "abstract": "Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

However, so far, these beliefs have been mainly explored with self-report and response conflict measures where expectation-confirming (vs. violating) judgments elicit faster responding. The present lab study (N = 57) applied a novel approach – the random generation paradigm – to understand how pre-existing social assumptions determine which information is retrieved from memory when prompted by different social categories. Specifically, we asked participants to imagine (hypothetical) people working in certain professions and to say their names out loud. We found that the statistics of the uttered names reflected societal gender stereotypes and environmental statistics of actual people working in these occupations. Importantly, the proportion of female and male names generated for each profession by each participant predicted their performance in a sequential priming task (prime = stereotyped professions, target = female and male faces) better than the environmental statistics or participants’ estimates of gender proportions. Together, these findings offer a new, and widely applicable, method for exploring cultural beliefs and help clarify how social information is sampled from memory when making social judgments.",

          "authors": "Johannah Völler; Juan Linde Domingo; Javier Ortiz-Tudela; Carlos González-García",
          "abstract": "Sudden perceptual learning refers to the abrupt disambiguation of an initially ambiguous stimulus. Despite the limited encoding time, these brief perceptual experiences transform into enduring memory engrams. Still, a comprehensive framework of why these memories are so long-lasting and their neural underpinnings, in particular the role of the hippocampus, is currently lacking. Here, we build on the apparent connection of sudden perceptual learning with long-term memory to outline how a representational perspective may help to overcome current limitations, similar to other areas of memory research. In short, we claim that sudden perceptual learning triggers initial prediction errors across the hierarchy, including strong higher-level (semantic) ones. Once a solution is found, the formerly ambiguous image can be connected to previous schemas and a disambiguation cascade of prediction error minimization is triggered, starting with semantic prediction errors. As a consequence, these events lead to low-dimensional representations that show signs of early semanticization, thereby favouring semantics over perceptual details. In sum, we propose that multiple memory traces are simultaneously encoded during sudden perceptual learning, and while low-dimensional representations engage neocortical structures, high-dimensional, episodic representations require the hippocampus. This perspective offers a promising framework to advance research on sudden perceptual learning and related phenomena.",

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are characterized as a risk factor for self-harm within the Integrated-Motivational Volitional (IMV) model. However, it is unclear how ACEs relate to self-harm as it unfolds in daily-life, and research investigating potential protective factors in the association between ACEs and self-harm is scarce. Here, we investigated whether ACEs were associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), and whether parent-child or peer attachment relationship quality influenced this association. Additionally, we explored whether specific types of ACEs were differentially associated with self-harm. \n\tMethods: A cross-sectional study using retrospective questionnaires to assess ACEs, lifetime self-harm thoughts and behaviours, and paternal, maternal, and peer attachment relationship quality, and ESM to assess daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, 10x/day for 6 days. N=1014 adolescents (Age, Mean (SD) = 14.05 years (1.91), 66.66% female) were recruited from the general population via schools across Flanders (Belgium). \n\tResults: Multilevel analyses demonstrated associations between ACEs and lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, that were attenuated by a high-quality maternal attachment relationship. Specific types of ACEs (e.g., sexual victimization) were more strongly associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours.\n\tConclusion: The study provides evidence for ACEs as a pre-motivational phase variable within the IMV model. Clinicians are encouraged to consider exposure to ACEs and the potential of maternal relationships to buffer their impact in the prevention and management of adolescent self-harm.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nDigital mental health platforms often consist of many different forms of self-care exercises. To our knowledge, whether the number of choices presented to the users affects their uptake and experiences and poses negative consequences (i.e., not choosing any exercises, choice dissatisfaction) for users, especially those experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms or unpleasant state emotions have not been empirically investigated.\n\nObjective:\nThe present study investigated the impact of choice set size on practice decisions, completion, satisfaction, and subjective experiences, as well as potential moderators including depression and anxiety symptoms, state emotions, and motivational and decisional attributes on these choice outcomes.\n\nMethods:\nParticipants were recruited through university mass email and social media, and 652 participants were included in our analyses. Participants completed questions regarding anxiety and depressive symptoms, state emotions, and other psychological attributes. Then, they were randomly assigned to 1-choice, 4-choice, and 16-choice conditions, in which they may choose a self-care activity to practice or decide not to practice. Finally, they completed questions regarding completion, satisfaction, engagement, attitude, and perceived improvement in psychological state.\n\nResults:\nPresenting multiple choices resulted in a higher likelihood of practice (ORs = 3.12, 95% CI [2.08, 4.67] and 3.83. 95% CI [2.55, 5.76], ps &lt; .001) and better decision satisfaction (16-choice vs 1-choice: d = 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.56], p &lt; .001; 4-choice vs 1-choice: d = 0.24, 95% CI [0.05, 0.43], p = .033) compared to presenting with a single choice. Tentative evidence indicates anxiety symptoms and state emotions were meaningful moderators. Specifically, for individuals with more anxiety symptoms and intense negative emotions, presenting a larger choice set (16 choices) resulted in more positive chosen exercise satisfaction, better attitudes towards chosen activity, and higher perceived improvement in mental health state after the activity, when compared to presenting with smaller choice sets (anxiety: β = -0.38, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.06] to -0.51, 95% CI [-0.84, -0.18], state emotions: β = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.66, 0.03] to -0.60, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.28]). No evidence was found for moderating effect of motivational and decisional attributes. \n\nConclusions:\nThe moderation results were contradictory to prior research and our expectation that a larger choice set may result in worse outcomes than a smaller choice set for people who were experiencing higher levels of psychological distress. We speculated a possible reason for these findings may be that people with more anxiety symptoms and unpleasant emotions may have stronger need to reduce these uncomfortable symptoms and emotions, and being presented with more choices on self-care activities, there may be a higher possibility that these self-care activities can address their distress.\n\nRegistration:\nOpen Science Framework puwxb; https://osf.io/puwxb/",

Leveraging a deep mobile event log and experience sampling dataset of German Internet users (N = 889), we probe the situational dynamics of smartphone habits. We investigate how moment-to-moment smartphone behavior corresponds to the perception of automaticity, with implications for the measurement of habitual behavior more generally. Contrary to expectations, duration – rather than frequency – of smartphone behavior emerged as the more consistent predictor of situational habit perception at both within- and between-person levels. However, these links varied by the type of behavior, with sessions and episodes (but not glances) relating to perceived automaticity. Additionally, home screen and gateway app use were not associated with perceived automaticity. Our results generate new insights – and deep questions – into the nature of real-world media habits.",

          "abstract": "Meta-analytic confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a type of meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) that is useful for evaluating the factor structure of measurement scales based on data from multiple studies. Modeling the factor structure is just one example of many potentially interesting research questions. Analyzing covariance matrices allows for the evaluation of measurement properties across studies, such as whether indicators are functioning the same across studies. For example, are some indicators more indicative of the common factor in certain types of studies than in others? The additional analysis of means of the observed variables opens up many other research questions to consider such as: ‘Are there mean differences in mental health between clinical and non-clinical samples?’. To answer such questions, it is necessary to analyze both the covariance and the mean structure of the indicators. Meta-analytic CFA with means is applicable when the studies included in the meta-analysis used the same indicators, measured on the same scales. In this paper, we present and illustrate a method to incorporate the means of variables in MASEM analyses of such datasets. We focus on meta-analytic CFA, with the aim of testing differences in latent means across studies. We provide illustrations of the comparison of latent means across groups of studies using two empirical datasets, for which data and analysis scripts are provided online. Finally, we discuss how the proposed method relates to other analysis options such as multigroup or multilevel structural equation modeling.",

Growth Mixture Modeling identified two sex-invariant lying trajectories: most adolescents lied infrequently (84.40%; low stable), while some lied more frequently with a slight decrease (13.60%; medium decreasing). Poorer parental monitoring and supervision, more inconsistent discipline, more corporal punishment, more family dysfunction, male sex, and lower family socio-economic status significantly predicted higher odds of being in the medium decreasing trajectory.

Across three studies comprising 429,980 responses from 1,159 human participants and 4,068 large language model (LLM) agents, we tested whether LLMs use emotions to guide altruistic punishment in ways comparable to humans. In Study 1, humans (n = 1,017) and four LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, o3-mini, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) exhibited emotion-behaviour coupling: unfair allocations elicited stronger negative emotions which, in mediation analyses, predicted higher punishment. In Study 2a, prompting reasoning-optimised LLMs (o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1) to self-report their emotional valence and arousal significantly increased punishment, and this causal effect was replicated in humans (Study 2b, n = 142). Alongside these parallels, LLMs were less cost-sensitive and showed stronger emotion-mediated effects than humans, revealing a “hyper-fairness” tendency. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that modern LLMs move beyond emotional knowledge to active emotion utilisation, while highlighting the potential and safeguards for emotionally intelligent AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that arise specifically in multialternative decisions. This study, based on preregistered procedures, investigated such nonnormative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a “max versus next” decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally accounted for a well-known nonnormative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multichoice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by identifying two critical time windows in confidence constructions: Confidence is based on sensory evidence collected shortly after stimulus presentation and evidence gathered right after decision making. These findings represent a significant advancement in understanding the dynamics underlying multichoice irrationalities.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception entails the integration of multiple acoustic cues that unfold asynchronously. While conventional work posits that listeners immediately update higher-level interpretations as cues become available, emerging evidence suggests that processing of certain speech sounds (e.g., voiceless sibilant fricatives) may be buffered, in which categorical judgments are temporarily withheld until the arrival of subsequent cues (such as a following vocoid). This study examined the mechanisms underlying this buffered integration, testing whether its release is triggered by specific incoming information or by a fixed temporal threshold. Additionally, we examine potential sources of this buffering effect. Using the Visual World Paradigm (VWP), we tested this by manipulating frication duration for /s/ and /ʃ/ to canonical, doubled, and tripled lengths. Participants (n=56) completed a VWP task to determine when recognition of a fricative occurred, and a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task to assess categorization profiles and determine whether these profiles predict individual differences in buffering. The VWP results replicated prior findings: for canonical-length fricatives, listeners delayed processing until frication offset. For double-length fricatives, this buffering was extended, with listeners withholding decisions until the entire fricative duration had elapsed. When fricative lengths were tripled, partial commitment emerged during the frication period, yet final decisions remained contingent on later cues. These results suggest that buffering is largely governed by the availability of acoustic information over time, though listeners may integrate partial information at extreme durations. VAS results revealed that listeners with greater sensitivity to secondary cues showed faster recognition. Together, these findings underscore the flexible nature of speech perception, highlighting how listeners strategically modulate processing to optimize cue integration.",

This paper examined the use of ASReview and ChatGPT for screening, data extraction, and quality ratings compared against a traditional systematic review to explore potential efficiency, accuracy of information, and consistency of judgements compared to human reviewers. \n\nMethods\nThree screening simulations were conducted using ASReview with different amounts of training data (1, 3, or 5 irrelevant/relevant records). A standardised set of prompts were developed and uploaded to ChatGPT for data extraction and coded for accuracy against the primary studies.  For quality ratings, Cochrane’s guidance for the Risk of Bias 2.0 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tools were provided to ChatGPT, with their respective templates.\n\nResults\nIn all simulations ASReview prioritised relevant studies within the first 800 records (approximately 17% of the dataset). When extracting, ChatGPT sometimes omitted information, though further detail was provided with additional prompting. Few instances of inaccurate information were observed. Consistency of quality ratings was low to moderate, depending on the domain of bias. \n\nConclusions\nAI tools can reduce the time required for screening through effective prioritisation of relevant articles and might also support data extraction by quickly locating relevant information in a manuscript. They should, however, be approached with caution for more complex tasks (e.g., quality ratings). In any case, the use of AI requires careful testing and validation of outputs.",

Across the cognitive sciences, researchers have studied theory of mind (making sense of other people’s behaviors in terms of their mental states, or ‘naive psychology’) and physical reasoning (making sense of physical events in terms of their underlying mechanics and dynamics, or ‘naive physics’), as two separate processes. In this paper, we describe two key ways in which psychological reasoning depends on physical reasoning. First, people represent the bodies of animate agents as objects, and their actions as physical events. Second, people use physical knowledge to make inferences about other minds, including what other people want, feel, and know, how hard they are trying, and how much danger they are in. We review research from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, which provides evidence for the interaction between these two systems, and Bayesian computational models of theory of mind, which articulate a formal hypothesis about how they work together.

          "authors": "Vipul Nair; Mehul Bhatt; Jakob Suchan; Erik Billing; Paul Hemeren",
          "abstract": "Studies in visual cognition highlight the importance of visual, spatial, and auditory cues in influencing human attention. Such cues often tend to be indicative of actions or events, thereby serving as predictive indicators in both passive observation as well as in interactive engagement. Our research focuses on visual attention in passive observation, particularly examining the manner in which visual, spatial, and auditory cues ---henceforth visuoauditory cues--- influence attention on everyday multimodal interaction.  We systematically develop a visuoauditory event model for investigating visual attention in naturalistic embodied settings. Rooted in this event model, we explore the influence of five select visuoauditory cues ---namely, speaking, gaze, relative motion, hand action, and visibility--- on visual attention. Our analysis utilizes eye-tracking data from 90 participants observing 27 carefully designed naturalistic event scenarios and correlating their attentional metrics with the select visuoauditory cues in the backdrop of the developed event model. Findings reveal strong associations between attention and both {intra-modal (irrespective of other cues) and cross-modal (combined with other cues)} cueing effects, thereby highlighting the nuanced interplay amongst the cues influencing attentional patterns. We develop a systematic and generalized method for analyzing interactions and behavioral parameters, thereby characterizing the impact of visuoauditory cues on attentional dynamics. Our methodology, combined with the obtained insights into the attentional cueing effects, provides an analytical framework explicating the manner in which everyday (interactive) events directly drive attention under naturalistic conditions. This facilitates not only the precise modeling of behavior and attention allocation but also offers a high-level `experimental lens' for examining interactions in relation to behavioral parameters. Taken together, our methodological and behavioral findings are well-positioned to benefit multiple fields, particularly by advancing human-centered design across diverse application domains. Lastly, towards promoting open-science and for wider dissemination, the complete experimental basis of this research -e.g., event-scenarios, high-quality annotated data, data-set supplementary- have been independently documented together with instructions to use and access experimental data.\n\nwww. https://codesign-lab.org/cognitive-vision/multimodal-cues",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that sustained visual attention operates rhythmically, as if the visual system periodically samples stimuli in the environment. Here we present evidence for rhythmic sampling of internal representations of targets and distractors up to one second after visual stimulation offset. Twenty participants performed an anticipatory object-based visual attention task involving a short-lasting (50 msec) target object image. This task was made more challenging by the overlaid presentation of a distractor object image. We conducted a decoding analysis on stimulus-evoked EEG to measure target and distractor information over the stimulus epoch, which extended almost 1000 msec beyond the visual stimulus offset. We found that the magnitudes of target and distractor information represented in brain activity after the offset of the visual stimuli oscillated in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz). This oscillatory period accords with previous characterizations of rhythmic attentional sampling of continuously visually presented stimuli. Moreover, greater target-distractor theta band phase differences correlated with improved task performance. Our findings show that: 1. Attention separately samples target and distractor representations in sensory memory; 2. These separately sampled streams of information may mutually inhibit one another; and 3. Target discrimination improves when target and distractor sampling rhythms are desynchronized.",

          "abstract": "Implicit (unintentional) biases related to social categories such as race, gender, and age are often seen as impediments to belonging and success in diverse organizations. Indeed, organizations around the world expend considerable effort and resources to implement educational programs with the stated goal of addressing — and even eradicating — such biases. However, in recent years, implicit bias education has come under scrutiny for several reasons, including via claims that implicit bias (a) is inherently unchangeable, (b) has no real-world analogs, (c) is unrelated to, and takes focus away from, biased behaviors, (d) provides an excuse for discrimination, and (e) is a structural problem and thus requires structural solutions. After refuting these critiques, I introduce the MAIBE checklist to help organizations decide if implicit bias education is worth their investment based on whether it (a) includes measurable benchmarks (rather than assuming success), (b) foregrounds epistemic agency (rather than treating individuals as passive consumers of information), (c) is integrated into a larger toolbox (rather than administered in isolation), (d) is broad (rather than light-touch), and (e) is evidence-based (rather than unscientific). I conclude by calling for extended collaboration between academic psychologists and organizational decision-makers to synergistically improve both basic science and institutional practices.",

Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial lexical activation and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception, and a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, especially lower-L2-proficiency listeners. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

Developed collaboratively with survivors of war, disaster, and systemic violence, F.A.S.T. reflects principles of participatory action and prioritizes co-creation, equity, and embodied healing. Rather than relying on verbal disclosure or intensive cognitive processing, F.A.S.T. emphasizes physiological regulation, safety, and immediacy, aligning with polyvagal theory and global mental health priorities for scalable and culturally adaptable interventions. The framework is structured around a number of core foundations, including: polyvagal-informed regulation, the Power Threat Meaning Framework, ex juvantibus reasoning, depotentiation through minimal exposure, and empowerment through self-help and peer-to-peer support. Its approach, including Trauma Tapping Technique, Lymphatic Breathing Techniques, F.A.S.T.-Adapted Self-Havening, and a further Toolbox of Techniques of Adaptive Methods for Context-Dependent Practice, offer low-threshold, non-invasive regulation tools that can be applied individually, within communities, or alongside clinical care.

To investigate the effect of Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on memory performance and slow-wave activity (SWA) in older adults with insomnia disorder. 2. To determine whether changes in SWA are linked to improvements in memory performance. 3. To assess how the individual therapies of CBT-I treatment contribute to these effects. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from 104 older adults with insomnia disorder enrolled in a clinical trial examining the impact of CBT-I, Behavioral Therapy (BT), and Cognitive Therapy (CT) on insomnia severity. Participants were randomized to six sessions of BT, CT, or CBT-I (combined BT and CT). They underwent polysomnography and RBANS memory testing ––assessing immediate (List Learning and Story Memory) and delayed memory (List Recall, Story Recall, Figure Recall, and List Recognition)–– at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Linear-mixed effects models examined the impact of treatment on memory and SWA. Regression analyses examined relationships between changes in SWA and memory following the treatment. Results: Improvements were identified in immediate memory (List Learning and Story Memory) and delayed memory (List Recall, Story Recall, and Figure Recall). The analysis did not reveal significant changes in SWA following treatment. However, there was a significant positive association between improvements in List Learning and increases in SWA. There were no differences in outcomes among the treatments. Conclusions: These findings suggest that BT, CT and CBT-I may enhance memory performance in older adults with insomnia disorder, with a potential link between SWA and immediate memory performance.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nTrinidad &amp; Tobago is part of a region with high rates of undiagnosed Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), making children with the condition particularly vulnerable to various negative outcomes. Parents and teachers can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, but only if they associate excessive hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, with ADHD. \nObjectives:\nThis study was designed to determine how parents and teachers in Trinidad &amp; Tobago perceive children’s ADHD-related behaviours, as compared with Canadians. It also explored the influence of ADHD-specific knowledge and attitudes on their perceptions. \nMethods:\nWe sampled parents and teachers from Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Canada (n = 380), using four brief vignettes about a child exhibiting behaviours consistent with four mental health conditions. After reading each vignette, participants rated their perception of the children’s behaviours and then completed ADHD knowledge and attitudes scales. We analyzed the data using a series of multilevel models. \nResults:\nOur findings indicate that although parents and teachers in Trinidad &amp; Tobago perceive children’s ADHD symptoms as indiscipline or low motivation more so than Canadians, this country-level difference was non-significant when controlling for knowledge of ADHD; attitudes had no discernible impact. \nDiscussion/Conclusion:\nCountry-level differences appear to be strongly shaped by variation in knowledge about ADHD, highlighting psychoeducation as a critical first step toward improving parents’ and teachers’ accurate identification of symptoms. This, in turn, could benefit children with undiagnosed ADHD by increasing the likelihood of earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, sociocultural differences in interpreting symptoms as illness may further contribute to contrasts between Trinidad and Tobago and Canada.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to map the breadth and latent structure of paranormal beliefs have been challenged by inconsistent findings, largely due to conceptual clarity and the use of incompatible instruments. To address this, we developed the 67-item Comprehensive Paranormal Belief Scale (CPBS), derived from 29 existing measures, and administered it to an undergraduate sample (N = 287). The CPBS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = .97) and acceptable-to-good reliabilities for 12 subscales (αs ranging from .71 to .87). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a bifactor structure comprising a general paranormal-belief factor alongside five specific dimensions: Psychic powers, Superstition, Supernatural beings, Material divination, and Traditional religious beliefs (CFI = .93, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .075). Hierarchical regressions revealed that psychological variables, particularly psychosis proneness and experiential thinking, accounted for substantial incremental variance beyond socio-political factors (ΔR-squared ranged from 7.9% to 31.1%), among which spirituality emerged as the strongest predictor. However, distinct predictor profiles for individual dimensions also emerged, further illuminated by canonical correlation analysis. The debated status of traditional religious beliefs within the paranormal domain is also discussed. Limitations include the homogeneous undergraduate sample and several culturally specific items, highlighting the need for cross-cultural validation.",

          "abstract": "With growing interest in ecologically valid stimuli and the proliferation of recognition and classification algorithms, environmental sounds are increasingly a topic of interest and study. However, there is a lack of consensus as to which sound categories should be selected, and which exemplars should represent these categories. Indeed, many existing datasets include only one exemplar per sound class. This is not characteristic of the actual acoustic environment and can lead to brittle and unrepresentative computational solutions and experimental results. Importantly, the existing literature provides relatively little information about how human listeners perceive the recognizability, similarity and representativeness of acoustically and perceptually varying sounds. Here, we introduce the Environmental Sounds (EnviSounds) dataset. It provides data from over 1000 human listeners performing different tasks (recognition, similarity judgement, goodness of fit) on 53 commonly encountered environmental sound categories of human, natural and man-made sounds, each represented by 10 different exemplars. We provide behavioural indices of within-class similarity and goodness of exemplar for all samples. Furthermore, we include normative data for recognition and identification latency, accuracy, and imageability, enabling researchers to select items for experiments based on pre-defined criteria across these dimensions. With this dataset, environmental sounds can be considered at various levels of complexity: sounds produced by the same sources varying in their acoustics (within-class acoustic variability) and acoustically similar sounds produced by different sources (between-category confusion). The dataset can be used for specifying training sets with individual sound sources, defining the categorical boundaries, or providing additional variables to building prediction models.",

We quantified motor\nsimilarity between each observer and stimulus kinematics and examined its impact on neural\nrepresentations within the action observation network. Motor similarity sharpened affective\nrepresentations in inferior frontal gyrus: cross-validated classifiers trained on high-similarity\ntrials decoded valence reliably above chance and outperformed classifiers trained on low-simi-\nlarity trials. In contrast, motor similarity attenuated univariate BOLD responses in inferior pa-\nrietal lobule, consistent with reduced prediction error under more precise priors.

Affective inten-\nsity further modulated neural precision in inferior frontal gyrus, revealing an interaction\nbetween social salience and embodied priors. Together, these converging neural and behavio-\nral results adjudicate between competing accounts by demonstrating a principled double dis-\nsociation: representational sharpening in inferior frontal gyrus without increased activation,\nalongside attenuation in inferior parietal lobule under higher similarity, supporting a hierar-\nchical predictive coding framework for social perception.

          "abstract": "Biased information processing plays an important role in mental disorders. This study investi-gates biases in value-based decision making and how links to psychological resilience can be accounted for by individual differences in the cognitive and neural processing of affective in-formation. Decision making was studied in 82 people (41 female, 41 male; age: 18–37 years) using a cost-benefit integration task. Neural activity was recorded via fMRI, cognitive pro-cessing modeled with an evidence-accumulation model. Choice bias was positively associated with self-reported resilience (particularly the facet ‘acceptance’) – and this association was me-diated by differences in the neural processing of affective information during decision making: Participants with a more positive bias and higher resilience showed stronger increases in neural activity in response to loss in ten prefrontal and parietal brain regions – and stronger decreases in response to gain in the right inferior frontal junction. Cognitive-computational modeling re-vealed that more positive biases were associated with lower sensitivity to and lower valuation of negative information – along with relatively higher sensitivity to and higher valuation of positive information. Notably, higher valuation of positive information was associated with stronger neural responses to negative information in dACC and bilateral insula. Finally, bias and resili-ence were associated with differential functional connectivity between prefrontal seeds, midbrain, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest that stronger activation of brain regions associated with cognitive control – specifically in response to negative information – promotes a positive cognitive bias in affective decision making that may support resilience to mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "This study demonstrates that urban migration is a key driver of AI acceptance in e-commerce. Using survey data from 784 Chinese consumers, we show that migrants from small to large cities exhibit significantly higher AI acceptance than non-migrants, and that this acceptance fully mediates their greater purchase intention. The effect is sequentially transmitted through enhanced self-esteem. Personality traits also play a role. Openness and conscientiousness increase acceptance, whereas neuroticism reduces it. However, the positive effect of openness is attenuated among individuals who remain in small cities. Gender dynamics reveal an asymmetry: men report higher overall AI acceptance but lower purchase intention toward female AI presenters. Finally, both greater monthly expenditure and broader product category diversity enhance AI acceptance, although among migrants the benefit of high expenditure diminishes when combined with high diversity, a pattern we refer to as the “complexity paradox.” By integrating environmental transitions with psychological traits, this study extends the Technology Acceptance Model and provides actionable insights for targeting migrants and optimizing AI influencer design.",

The current study explored whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiments 2a and 2b). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2a and 2b found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across these experiments, there was no evidence for interaction between binding condition and prioritization; participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space or modality. The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, and suggest that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of material.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Most youth psychotherapies contain multiple treatment elements; little is known about their relative effectiveness. We assessed symptom improvements associated with treatment elements, represented by modules within modular psychotherapy.\n\nMethods: Data from six clinical trials of the MATCH modular psychotherapy were combined (N=490; 5403 sessions; 6-15 years) to test effects of modules grouped into seven common treatment principles: Feeling Calm (e.g., relaxation strategies), Increasing Motivation (e.g., contingency management), Repairing Thoughts (e.g., cognitive restructuring), Solving Problems (e.g., problem solving), Trying the Opposite (e.g., exposure), Engagement/Psychoeducation (e.g., building rapport), and Future Planning (e.g., planning skill use). Multi-level models with autoregressive covariance controlled for previous symptoms, session number, and baseline symptoms; accounted for temporality with each session occurring prior to associated outcomes; importantly, we modeled associations between outcomes and between- and within-person use of treatment principles. Measures included weekly youth- and caregiver-reported internalizing, externalizing, and total symptoms, plus idiographic top problems.\n\nResults: A between-person effect linked Future Planning (B’s=-.369 — -.368; p’s&lt;.05) to better outcomes. Better within-person effects were observed for Increasing Motivation (B’s=-0.087 — -0.057; p's&lt;.05), Trying the Opposite (B’s=-.087 – -.056); p’s&lt;.05), and Future Planning (B=-0.146; p&lt;.001). Six outcomes showed worse within-person effects for Engagement/Psychoeducation (B’s=.036 — .099; p’s&lt;.05); efforts to build engagement drove this finding; those efforts were associated with less use of skills-focused principles.\n\nConclusions: Increasing Motivation, Trying the Opposite, and Future Planning were associated with especially good outcomes; therapists’ engagement attempts were associated with less focus on skill-building, and poorer immediate outcomes. Results may inform youth psychotherapy decision-making research and practice.",

          "authors": "Lynn Weiher; Rosa Vermeulen; Hannah Wessels; Steven James Watson",
          "abstract": "Research indicates autistic defendants are treated more leniently than non-autistic defendants. However, it is unclear whether this is caused by positive perceptions of autistic people, or because autism is a relevant mitigating factor. Across two studies we tested how mock jurors evaluated autistic defendants in autism relevant and irrelevant criminal cases to better understand when and why autistic defendants receive leniency. Further, we provided some of the participants with educational information about ASD allowing these participants to recognise autism as a relevant mitigation for criminal cases for which autistic traits can be a risk factor (assault and stalking cases, but not burglary cases).\nDefendants with ASD only received lower sentences when autism was a relevant mitigation (assault and stalking), but not when autism was irrelevant (burglary). Thus, participants did not simply give preferential treatment to autistic defendants, but considered how ASD was related to the offense. However, providing information about autism weakened these effects, indicating educating people about autism may not always benefit autistic defendants.\nOur study highlights the importance of nuanced messaging about autism. While explaining how autistic characteristics can explain criminal behaviour may reduce perceptions of criminal responsibility, it may also imply greater dangerousness or risk of reoffending.",

          "abstract": "How do we create new language? Drawing on the observation that some languages—such as Pirahã—are almost entirely without a number system, this work explores what other features of human language could be fundamental yet remain unrealized. We propose the super language framework, a modular approach for iterating new forms (e.g. phonetic or morphological containers) and interpretations (e.g. semantic or pragmatic functions) on top of any base language. The resulting augmented variants are organized into a typology serving as a roadmap for experimentation. As a simple proof of concept, we present StegaPhone, a super language prototype that hides binary data within deliberate mispronunciations (e.g. “swim” vs. “svim”), thereby extending a phonetic layer into a parallel communication channel. To operationalize the framework, we outline a transformation engine—a rewrite-based system capable of covering the space of possible language modifications in a standardized, invertible manner. We argue that this “tip of the spear” architecture enables rapid language development and productive feedback loops across the domains in which it may be applied. Finally, we situate the significance of such a heuristic approach by considering the central role of language in communication, cognition, machine interfaces, and beyond, underscoring how new features have, and can continue, to impart transformative capabilities onto their operators.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers usually make sense of regression models by interpreting coefficient estimates directly. This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

This paper is the first to connect the GLM to extremism. This paper explores the general, etiological, and treatment assumptions of the GLM, connecting these to the wider literature surrounding extremism. No one path into extremism has been identified in the literature, with no specific profile of those who engage in radicalisation, extremism and/or terrorism existing. The GLM allows for a focus on individuality and identity, accounting for the variation of individual’s found to hold extremist views.

          "abstract": "Background: Explanatory frameworks for mental disorders have an important effect on stigmatisation and clinical attitudes, with mechanistic biological explanations often yielding mixed or negative effects on prognostic optimism and empathy. Evolutionary framings may offer functional, non-pathologizing explanations which could reduce stigma and empower patients, but few attempts have been made to test this empirically.\n\nAims: This study aimed to experimentally test whether a brief educational intervention based on an evolutionary explanation of anxiety, compared to a genetic explanation, would influence clinicians’ attitudes in directions consistent with anti-stigma goals.\n\nMethod: In a pre-registered, multi-site, double-blind experiment, 171 practicing mental health clinicians across the UK and Ireland were cluster-randomised by session to receive a 30-minute educational presentation on either evolutionary or genetic explanations for anxiety. Pre- and post-session questionnaires assessed clinicians’ optimism regarding patient recovery, the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, expected patient willingness to share diagnoses and engage in help-seeking behavior, and the perceived usefulness of the information. Data were analysed using Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression and linear regression.\n\nResults: Compared to the genetic explanation, clinicians rated the evolutionary explanation as substantially more useful for patients (Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.05, 95% Credible Interval [CI] [2.46, 10.28]) and for clinicians (OR = 3.10, 95% CI [1.62, 5.81]). These showed very large mean effect sizes, of 1.07 SD (95% CI [0.65, 1.50]) and 0.76 SD CI (95% CI [0.38, 1.17]). In comparison to the genetic explanation, the evolutionary explanation was also anticipated to increase public willingness to seek psychiatric help (OR = 1.79, 95% CI [0.93, 3.35]) and share a diagnosis (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.88, 2.97]). It also increased optimism about patient recovery (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [0.71, 3.46]), and the perceived effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.84, 3.10]). Furthermore, it increased clinicians’ belief in the functional usefulness of negative emotions (β = 0.25 SD, 95% CI [0.49, 0.01]).\nConclusions: Distinct explanatory frameworks may be a potent determinant of clinicians' and patients’ attitudes. This study provides robust evidence that framing anxiety through an evolutionary lens can be a powerful tool to foster more optimistic and destigmatized perspectives, compared to a genetic explanation. In particular, clinicians overwhelmingly rated evolutionary explanations of anxiety as highly useful in comparison to genetic explanations. Integrating evolutionary explanations into mainstream clinical education presents an under-explored opportunity with numerous potential benefits.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal motor interactions are central to social life, yet it remains unclear how social cues relevant to detecting engagement are encoded in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that regions traditionally associated with mentalizing, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), co-activate with nodes of the Action Observation Network (AON) during motor engagement with others, pointing to a synergistic role in the processing of action features during interaction. Using fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we examined brain responses to reach-to-grasp actions varying in Goal (passing vs. placing), Perspective (2nd vs. 3rd person), and Gaze visibility, creating a gradient of perceived engagement. Our results show that the TPJ and premotor cortices, but not the dmPFC, displayed convergent neural geometry during action observation. Model- and cluster-based analyses further linked TPJ and AON regions in multiple representational spaces: left-hemisphere regions aligned with goal encoding, whereas right-hemisphere regions aligned with an Engagement model capturing first-person interaction. Critically, we demonstrate that the rTPJ and left premotor cortex share representational geometry for action perspective, directly coupling mentalizing and sensorimotor systems in the encoding of directional cues. By contrast, the dmPFC appeared representationally isolated from both TPJ and AON regions, with response patterns showing no similarity to Goal or Engagement models. This is consistent with accounts of its recruitment under richer interactive demands rather than selectivity for abstract action features. Together, these findings support a distributed, sensorimotor account of engagement encoding and reveal new functional links among key social cognition areas.",

          "abstract": "Successful coordination of infant attention and parent speech during free play supports infants' language development. Parents' responsive linguistic input reduces uncertainty in label-referent associations and provides information at moments of infants' increased attention and receptiveness. While infants frequently lead the dyads’ focus of attention, parent speech has been shown to scaffold infants’ attention towards fixated objects. So far, however, little is known about the qualitative characteristics of parent speech during such interactions, and their effects on infants' attention. Here, we analysed the role of the content and communicative intent of caregivers' speech to their 18-month-old infants (N = 31) during free play when infants or parents led an interaction, and when parent speech sustained infant attention. Interactions were most likely to be infant-led, both temporally and topically, and parents' topically aligned, but not misaligned speech sustained infants' attention. Qualitative analysis of speech types revealed mostly object- and play-focused speech in interactions with familiar objects, but a broader range of speech types and more questions in interactions with novel objects. We hypothesize that speech in interactions with familiar objects is structured by shared experience, whereas the lack of common ground with novel objects induces parents to use more varied speech to engage their infants.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) equipped with general learning algorithms, but no linguistic knowledge, can learn to associate words with objects in naturalistic scenes when trained on head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experience. Similarly, ANNs can master syntax when trained on a similar amount of linguistic data a child experiences in a few years. These findings have been taken to challenge the view that innate linguistic priors play a role in child language acquisition. Here I show that the training environments and learning resources of ANN and humans are poorly matched, and accordingly, conclusions regarding human language priors are not merited. I also review three sets of findings that strongly suggest ANNs are missing human inductive biases: (1) children (but not ANNs) create new well-structured languages when only exposed to degraded ones; (2) ANN (but not humans) learn impossible and possible human languages in similar ways with similar facility; and (3) humans (but not ANNs) show a critical period for language learning. In this last case, adding an “innate” inductive prior to the ANN results in better ANN-human alignment. Just as is the case regarding claims of ANN-human alignment in the domain of vision, conclusions regarding ANN-human alignment in the domain of language is characterized by a lack of severe testing of hypotheses.",

Workplace conditions can either safeguard or intensify these challenges, with implications for maternal mental health and wellbeing. Aim: To explore the psychosocial experiences of mothers returning to work following maternity leave, focusing on the experience with workplace support and sleep deprivation. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using an open-ended online survey. Twenty-five mothers in the UK with an infant under two years of age who had recently returned to work or were return following maternity leave. Participants were recruited via mother-and-baby groups, social media, and personal networks using purposive sampling. Reflexive thematic analysis was used, with analytical attention to maternal mental health, workplace structures, and sleep-related challenges. Findings: Five interrelated themes were developed as follows: Making Ends Meet, Losing Myself; The Bittersweet Return; Workplaces That Work (or Don’t); Running on Empty; and This Isn’t Just My Struggle. Conclusions: Returning to work within the first two years postpartum is shaped by financial necessity, identity negotiations, disrupted sleep, and highly variable workplace support. Findings highlight the need for compassionate, flexible, and inclusive workplace policies that recognise the ongoing caregiving demands of new mothers and support their health and wellbeing during this transition.",

Study 1 (N=973) shows that undergraduates who endorse IIB are more likely to pursue careers benefiting future generations, with legacy concerns mediating this link. Study 2 (N=795) finds that professionals with greater intergenerational concern report higher job satisfaction via legacy motivation and work meaningfulness. Finally, a pre-registered experiment (Study 3; N=1,240) demonstrates that reflecting on one’s intergenerational impact increases legacy motivation, meaningfulness, and, in turn, job satisfaction. Findings highlight prosocial, future-oriented framing as a psychological anchor for sustaining workplace meaningfulness amid uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

Of cognitive factors, pseudoscientific beliefs, lower scores on the actively open-minded thinking scale, and higher preference for anecdotal information were related to increased tendency to believe in epistemically suspect claims related to COVID-19. Of social factors, lower trust in governmental institutions and science and scientists, and the use of alternative media were associated with the endorsement of epistemically suspect claims about COVID-19. Men were more likely to endorse epistemically suspect claims than women, and the support decreased with age. The present results suggest that epistemically suspect beliefs about COVID-19 are not generally common among the Finnish population. The results suggest that battling the spread of health-related misinformation, like COVID-19 conspiracy theories, may require actions that target different cognitive and social factors, such as the thinking style of individuals; trust felt towards governmental institutions, science, and mainstream media; and the content circulating in social and alternative media.",

          "abstract": "Effective self-regulated learning depends on metacognitive monitoring and control abilities, which allow learners to recognise what they do not know and adjust their learning behaviour to address knowledge gaps. However, children’s metacognitive abilities are still developing, which can hinder their ability to select relevant information effectively. This work examines whether providing feedback on children’s knowledge tests can assist their metacognitive monitoring and control processes, improving their ability to target information-seeking to fill knowledge gaps. In two experiments, 5-9-year-old children (N=203) completed a word-learning task on a tablet. They were then tested on their knowledge of the novel word-object associations and asked to report their (un)certainty in their answers. In the first experiment, children received feedback after each test trial. In both experiments, children received summary feedback at the end of the test. Afterwards, they could select some of the objects to hear their labels again and were tested on their recognition of the label-object associations once more. In both experiments, feedback boosted children’s ability to strategically seek information to fill their knowledge gaps. Moreover, when given feedback after each test trial, children based their uncertainty judgments on their previous performance. While this resulted in younger children’s uncertainty judgments to better reflect their performance, older children’s judgments were less accurate than without feedback. Importantly, children’s information-seeking was better guided by feedback than by their own subjective uncertainty, indicating that feedback provides a valuable external means for metacognitive control. Overall, the findings underscore the role of feedback in fostering the development of metacognition and self-regulated learning in childhood.",

          "abstract": "Intelligent systems—from autonomous vehicles to decision support tools—are reshaping everyday activities, yet their adoption is often tempered by users’ perceived risk. Perceived risk significantly influences users' decisions to adopt or reject such systems, highlighting the critical need to understand and mitigate them. However, existing measurement tools for assessing perceived risk remain inadequate, limiting effective intervention and research efforts. To address this gap, we developed and validated a multidimensional scale of perceived risk in intelligent system interaction, focusing on three representative safety-critical domains: autonomous vehicles, medical decision support systems, and financial decision support systems. Step 1 involved item generation based on literature analysis. Step 2 employed exploratory factor analysis to refine the scale structure (N = 644). In Step 3, confirmatory factor analyses and additional validation procedures (N = 639) confirmed a robust six-factor model: Third-Party Risk, Operational Cost Risk, Social Appraisal Risk, Probability and Severity Risk, Affective Risk, and Performance Integrity Risk. The final scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including reliability, discriminant validity, and predictive validity for user trust, satisfaction, and intention to use. This scale offers researchers and practitioners a rigorously validated instrument for diagnosing perceived risk in safety‑critical intelligent systems and guiding targeted mitigation strategies that can enhance acceptance, usability.",

Think-Aloud protocols, where participants verbalize their reasoning, offer a more direct probe but have long been criticized as unreliable and difficult to scale. Here we revisit this debate using one of the largest Think-Aloud datasets to date—44,038 paired transcripts and choices in risky decision-making. Our results make three contributions. First, concurrent Think-Aloud analyzed with large language models (LLMs) surpasses classic cognitive models and neural networks in predicting behavior, showing that verbal reports contain generative information beyond behavior alone. Second, Think-Aloud generalizes across individuals with only a few examples, reflecting shared cognitive patterns. Third, Think-Aloud guides LLMs toward more human-like reasoning. Together, these findings position Think-Aloud as a scalable complement to behavioral measures, reopening a foundational debate in cognitive science and informing human-aligned AI.",

          "abstract": "Although absolute pitch (AP) is often celebrated as a rare musical gift, Western tonal music relies on relative pitch (RP), where meaning depends on intervals to the tonic. This contrast furnishes a natural test bed for cognitive control: AP is an automatic, stimulus-bound code, whereas RP requires context-dependent computation. We tested 50 non–music-major students spanning the AP proficiency continuum on a movable-Do solfa-naming task under three tonal contexts of rising difficulty (fixed C major, fixed B major, randomly shifting keys). AP gave an overall advantage, yet error pattern and response time analyses showed systematic strategy switching among AP possessors: (i) AP use in C major, (ii) pitch name transposition in B major, and (iii) interval/chord listening in random keys, with individual differences. Non AP participants relied on RP across conditions. Thus, scale note identification recruits adaptive strategy selection governed by AP proficiency, tonal context, and cognitive load, illustrating cognitive control in a naturalistic musical task and motivating tailored ear training in music education.",

          "abstract": "People often predict how they might feel in the future, with varying degrees of accuracy.  Such affective forecasts can centre around periods of time (e.g., tomorrow, next week) and/or specific events (e.g., an upcoming meeting). Affective forecasts for quotidian events or periods of time are the building blocks of everyday decision-making. Yet, most affective forecasting research has focused on forecasting accuracy for rare and consequential events, such as election results and romantic break-ups. Therefore, in two intensive longitudinal datasets, we tested everyday forecasting accuracy in general and in relation to specific unpleasant events. In Study 1—a week-long experience sampling study—participants (N=209) provided (i) one weekly forecast about their feelings over the next week, and (ii) daily forecasts about their feelings the next day. Participants also rated their (i) daily affect each evening, and (ii) their momentary affect nine times each day. In Study 2—a two-week daily diary—participants (N=69) nominated an upcoming unpleasant event each day and forecasted their affect in relation to that event. Each evening, participants rated how they felt when this event occurred. We found that participants could predict when a day/event would make them feel better/worse than usual, showing relative accuracy, but sometimes made small errors in forecasting their absolute affect levels, showing absolute inaccuracy. These findings suggest that people make smaller forecasting errors in everyday life than for major events, which likely aids everyday decision making, for example by informing the use of future-oriented affect-regulation strategies (e.g., situation selection).",

          "abstract": "Objective. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer scalable solutions to traditional barriers in mental healthcare. Acceptability of DMHIs might differ among patients with differing level of symptoms and relational difficulties. This study investigated how a person’s psychological profile, including their level of mental health symptoms, epistemic trust, and attachment security, predicts their acceptance of AI-based interventions (avatars, chatbots) versus human-delivered teletherapy. \nMethod. Using cluster analysis on survey data from 1,612 (potential) patients and clinicians recruited via Prolifc, we identified three distinct psychological profiles: “Avoidant-not trusting,” “Secure-trusting-healthy,” and “Young-anxious-gullible-symptomatic.”\nResults. Results showed a paradoxical pattern: Individuals in the two most vulnerable clusters (“Avoidant-not trusting” and “Young-anxious-gullible-symptomatic”) demonstrated significantly higher acceptance of AI-based DMHIs. In contrast, the psychologically healthier “Secure-trusting-healthy” cluster showed the lowest AI-based DMHI acceptance and the highest acceptance of teletherapy. Also, having therapy experience as provider or patient was associated with lower AI acceptance in general. \nConclusion. These findings suggest that AI-based interventions may be uniquely suited to reach individuals who struggle with human-to-human therapeutic relationships, thereby serving as a critical entry point to care for those who need it most. However, those vulnerable people might also miss out on the relational learning that takes place in human-based therapies.",

          "abstract": "As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item–skill pairs in grades K–5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83–94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.",

          "abstract": "Background: Explanatory frameworks for mental disorders have an important effect on stigmatisation and clinical attitudes, with mechanistic biological explanations often yielding mixed or negative effects on prognostic optimism and empathy. Evolutionary framings may offer functional, non-pathologizing explanations which could reduce stigma and empower patients, but few attempts have been made to test this empirically.\n\nAims: This study aimed to experimentally test whether a brief educational intervention based on an evolutionary explanation of anxiety, compared to a genetic explanation, would influence clinicians’ attitudes in directions consistent with anti-stigma goals.\n\nMethod: In a pre-registered, multi-site, double-blind experiment, 171 practicing mental health clinicians across the UK and Ireland were cluster-randomised by session to receive a 30-minute educational presentation on either evolutionary or genetic explanations for anxiety. Pre- and post-session questionnaires assessed clinicians’ optimism regarding patient recovery, the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, expected patient willingness to share diagnoses and engage in help-seeking behavior, and the perceived usefulness of the information. Data were analysed using Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression and linear regression.\n\nResults: Compared to the genetic explanation, clinicians rated the evolutionary explanation as substantially more useful for patients (Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.05, 95% Credible Interval [CI] [2.46, 10.28]) and for clinicians (OR = 3.10, 95% CI [1.62, 5.81]). These showed very large mean effect sizes, of 1.07 SD (95% CI [0.65, 1.50]) and 0.76 SD CI (95% CI [0.38, 1.17]). In comparison to the genetic explanation, the evolutionary explanation was also anticipated to increase public willingness to seek psychiatric help (OR = 1.79, 95% CI [0.93, 3.35]) and share a diagnosis (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.88, 2.97]). It also increased optimism about patient recovery (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [0.71, 3.46]), and the perceived effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.84, 3.10]). Furthermore, it increased clinicians’ belief in the functional usefulness of negative emotions (β = 0.25 SD, 95% CI [0.49, 0.01]).\nConclusions: Distinct explanatory frameworks may be a potent determinant of clinicians' and patients’ attitudes. This study provides robust evidence that framing anxiety through an evolutionary lens can be a powerful tool to foster more optimistic and destigmatized perspectives, compared to a genetic explanation. In particular, clinicians overwhelmingly rated evolutionary explanations of anxiety as highly useful in comparison to genetic explanations. Integrating evolutionary explanations into mainstream clinical education presents an under-explored opportunity with numerous potential benefits.",

          "abstract": "Access to mental health care is shaped by two interdependent dimensions: availability and affordability. Prior research has emphasized shortages of psychiatrists and provider counts, but has rarely considered affordability alongside availability or included the broader psychotherapy workforce. This study addresses these gaps by analyzing over 460,000 psychotherapists listed in the Psychology Today directory, which provides consumer-facing data on fees and insurance acceptance. We constructed county-level indices of availability (providers per 100,000 residents) and affordability (ten-session cost relative to disposable income) across 2,565 U.S. counties. Results show persistent rural–urban disparities: provider density was highest in metropolitan cores and lowest in rural and conservative counties, while financial burdens were systematically greater outside large metropolitan areas, especially in the South. Although availability and affordability frequently overlap, important divergences emerge, including counties with providers present but financially inaccessible. Regression analyses reveal that income is the strongest predictor across both indices, with political partisanship and racial/ethnic composition also shaping access. By integrating supply and cost, this study empirically reframes accessibility as multidimensional and identifies regions most affected by dual disadvantages. Findings highlight affordability as a distinct axis of accessibility and underscore the need for targeted workforce and financial interventions, including Medicaid expansion.",

Guided by Chaffee’s (1991) concept explication framework, this study explores the historical, psychological, sociocultural, and technological foundations of online infidelity.

Romantic partners can support dealing with emotional and physical stress, yet their role in dealing with menstrual distress specifically remains underexplored. Adopting a biopsychosocial perspective, this qualitative study aims to shed light on the experience of menstrual distress within romantic relationships. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 individuals (aged 19-59, living in Austria), who were in romantic relationships (n = 23 heterosexual, n = 2 homosexual, n = 5 open, n = 6 committed, n = 17 monogamous, n = 3 queer, n = 1 casual). Indeed, romantic partners play a crucial role in shaping both the impact of and coping mechanisms for menstrual distress. Due to the intimate nature of romantic relationships, partners influence experiences of menstrual distress, whether actively engaging with the topic or not. Supportive relationships fostering authenticity, communication, and teamwork enhance coping, whereas negative partner responses can perpetuate negative stereotypes, stigma, and symptom trivialisation. To enhance individuals’ and couples’ well-being, educational campaigns should raise menstrual health awareness early, and couples may benefit from guidance in managing the challenges effectively.",

          "abstract": "In a recent landmark effort, an international collaboration of cognitive scientists produced Psych-101, the largest behavioral dataset on human cognition described in natural language, comprising over 10 million human decisions across 160 psychological experiments. Building on this resource, the authors fine-tuned a pretrained large language model (LLM) to predict human choices in these experiments, called Centaur. While Centaur demonstrates impressive predictive performance—especially compared to domain-specific cognitive models—we find that much of its advantage stems from leveraging sequential dependencies in human choices. Over-reliance on such dependencies risks marginalizing the task-driven mechanisms that are also central to explaining human behavior. By reanalyzing the original Centaur model through controlled experiments that isolate task information and choice history, we find that Centaur outperforms domain-specific cognitive models even when no psychological task is provided, yet underperforms in other tasks where choice history is removed. These findings suggest that Centaur may have learned a shortcut that is insensitive to psychological tasks.",

          "authors": "Domenic Groh",
          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 20th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i.e., perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, despite the fact that their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the foundations of these assump-tions and examines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreasing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Additionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable. More fundamentally, when these assumptions are violated, the TRC becomes underidentified, meaning that multiple, substantively different data-generating process-es can yield the same coefficient, thus undermining its interpretability. These findings call into question the TRC’s suitability for applied settings, especially when traits fluctuate over time or measurement conditions are uncontrolled.

          "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including teletherapy and artificial intelligence (AI) powered mental health interventions, such as chatbots and AI avatar-based therapies, have become increasingly prominent, enhancing accessibility and continuity of care while reducing costs. Although these tools are technically feasible and more widely available, the real-world uptake relies on the support of clinicians. Research suggests that factors such as clinicians’ demographic information, professional experience and general attitudes towards technology, influence therapists’ acceptance of DMHIs. The study investigated clinicians’ attitudes toward these DMHIs. A total of 678 clinicians participated, completing various measures on demographics, professional background, AI usage, and acceptance of AI-based intervention formats. Results indicated that technological factors, especially positive attitudes towards AI and previous mental health chatbot experience, were the most significant predictors of clinicians’ levels of acceptance, explaining a substantial portion of the variance in the acceptance of both AI chatbot (34%) and AI virtual therapist (38%) interventions. Understanding these predictors of clinicians’ acceptance is crucial for developing effective digital therapeutic tools and encouraging clinicians to integrate emerging technologies into mental healthcare. Further training and exposure to new technologies should be provided in graduate programs.",

Whereas certain anxieties in neurodivergence (e.g., social and general anxiety) have received much attention, scant research has considered mathematics and statistics anxiety. In this study, 1,383 university students (679 neurotypical, 704 neurodivergent individuals) – matched on age, gender, education level, and country of origin – completed measures assessing various types of anxiety (including mathematics and statistics anxiety), attitudes toward mathematics, self-efficacy, and cognitive reflection. Results showed that neurodivergent students exhibited higher anxiety levels across measures, including mathematics and statistics anxiety. However, only cognitive and somatic anxiety and social anxiety explained individual variance in neurodivergent status after taking into account the effects of other measures. Despite differing anxiety levels (which showed variability between different neurodivergences), neurodivergent and neurotypical students were equivalent in cognitive reflection scores, suggesting similar levels of analytic thinking skills (including reasoning about mathematical content). In both the neurotypical and neurodivergent groups, higher levels of cognitive reflection were associated with male gender, less fear of negative evaluation, and lower mathematics and creativity anxiety, replicating and extending previous work. Our findings have implications for instructors across sectors with respect to supporting neurodivergent individuals.",

          "abstract": "Core features of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., low empathy, lack of guilt, callousness) are underpinned by emotion processing deficits including dysfunction in emotion reactivity (ERc) and emotion regulation (ER). Additionally, recent research has suggested the presence of heterogeneity in CU traits, such that the primary variant is biologically rooted and marked by hypoarousal, whereas the secondary variant is thought to develop as a response to maltreatment and is marked by hyperarousal. To date, physiological measurement of ERc and ER processes via the parasympathetic nervous system have focused on static methods of measurement; however, dynamic approaches may provide a more nuanced picture of reactive and regulatory processes. The current study sought to identify whether CU trait variants differed on ERc and ER as indexed by both static and dynamic objective physiological markers with the goal of improving our understanding of CU trait development and informing future treatment targets. Participants consisted of 636 youth ages 12-18 recruited from juvenile detention centers. A latent profile analysis identified CU variants using CU traits, anxiety, and posttraumatic arousal and avoidance. Groups were subsequently compared on static and dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) indices of ERc and ER. Only one dynamic measure of ER (i.e., RSA inertia) uniquely differentiated primary and secondary groups, whereas static measures provided little discriminative utility. The current findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of CU trait heterogeneity with respect to emotion processing, allowing us to more effectively target variants in the treatment context.",

An online experiment with UK Premier League supporters (N = 900) tested the effects of ingroup versus outgroup identity appeals on recycling intentions. Across all conditions, reported intentions were high (&gt;88%), with no consistent advantage for ingroup appeals. To assess real behavior, we tested the same group identity-based recycling interventions in a football season-long field experiment at a Norwegian Premier Division stadium (N = 5,712), where visiting fans from 14 clubs were exposed to either an ingroup or an outgroup appeal. Results showed that ingroup appeals alone did not significantly increase recycling rates. However, when combined with a visible group-level social comparison framed as inter-club competition, recycling rates nearly tripled. Two follow-up experiments (N = 3,063) confirmed the key psychological mechanism: a motivation to contribute to the ingroup's success. These findings demonstrate that leveraging social identities can increase PEB in public settings, offering a novel theoretical link and practical strategies to encourage sustainable consumer behavior.",

We employ a multiverse approach to assess the influence of two central temporal dimensions in intensive longitudinal media effects research: Time frame and time lag. We combine mobile experience sampling (T1 = 2,859, T2 = 7,708) and log data (K1 = 71,807, K2 = 259,004) from N1 = 84 and N2 = 192 participants. Building on theorizing on time in media effects research, we propose four patterns of how short-term effects on situational well-being unfold: they may follow processes of ephemerality (fleeting effects), inertia (delayed onset), reversal (changing directions) – or there are no changes over time. We discuss theoretical implications and give recommendations for future studies.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive skills tend to grow and change in interdependent ways across development, yet it remains unclear whether (a) early patterns of cognitive coupling depend on social-skill development and (b) whether individual differences in such coupling have predictive value for later behavioral outcomes. We addressed these questions using eight repeated assessments from the NICHD–SECCYD longitudinal study, tracking children from early childhood through adolescence. Using continuous-time structural equation models, we modelled dynamic, reciprocal interactions among cognitive (e.g., vocabulary, attention, memory, executive functioning) and social (e.g., assertion, cooperation, responsibility, self-control, peer competence) domains from age 4.5 to 15 years. Cognitive traits showed stronger overall growth and rank-order stability than social traits, whereas social-emotional skills displayed tighter internal coupling. Executive functioning emerged as a central connector across domains, showing robust cross-domain associations with multiple social skills. Children who exhibited more behavioral problems at age 15 had weaker early cross-domain trait correlations—particularly between (rather than within) cognitive and social domains—indicating lower early developmental integration. By adolescence, these children showed increased cohesion within the cognitive domain but reduced coupling with social traits, suggesting a shift toward domain-specific rather than integrated development. These findings highlight how early differences in the co-development of cognitive and social abilities may shape later behavioral adjustment, supporting a dynamic, systems-level view of developmental risk and adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Effective visual perception surmounts noise, partial information and dynamic changes in stimuli, resulting in perceptual completion that is often studied using illusory contour (IC) stimuli. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from humans yield a characteristic response – the ICeffect – the VEP difference between responses to the presence vs. absence of ICs with multiple phases at ~150-200ms and ~240-400ms post-stimulus onset. To address how motion signals and an individual’s capability to discriminate motion may contribute to perceptual completion as indexed by the ICeffect, we recorded 128-channel VEPs from 20 healthy adults. On each trial, they indicated which of two stimulus arrays was perceived to move (through linear changes in stimulus size), independently of the presence/absence of ICs. Participants were sub-divided based on a median split in task performance: those “adept” and “non-adept” at detecting moving stimuli.  Over the 240-329ms post-stimulus period, responses from “adept” individuals were characterized by distinct topographies depending on whether stimuli were moving, whereas for “non-adept” individuals the same topography characterized responses to both moving and static stimuli. Furthermore, the VEP topography characterizing responses to moving ICs positively correlated with an individual’s motion discrimination accuracy. Source modelling of this ICeffect included regions of the lateral inferior occipital cortices, parahippocampal cortices extending into the insula, the precentral cortex, and middle frontal cortex and underscores the role of both low-level and high-level cortices in IC perception.  Collectively, these data highlight the interplay between motion discrimination and perceptual completion processes.",

          "authors": "Matthias Borgstede",
          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

          "abstract": "Visual foraging lies at the intersection of visual perception, decision-making and action planning. An attractive feature of this paradigm is that it generates a rich stream of sequential decision data. However, this presents a number of challenges for analysis. To this end, we have developed FoMo, a robust and flexible generative model for spatial-sequential data. Building upon initial work by Clarke et al. (2022b), we present FoMo 2.0, which incorporates spatial structure allowing us to model organised spatial behaviours. We test the model over a range of secondary data sources and show that incorporating these parameters improve model accuracy, predominantly due to improvements for a subset of participants who use grid-following strategies. FoMo therefore allows us to explain results that would previously have been categorised as outliers. A real strength of this generative modelling approach is that it can account for individual differences across the wide range of summary statistics that have previously been used to explore human and non-human animal behaviour, providing a unified framework for analysing these data.",

          "abstract": "Single-graded submissions are the norm for undergraduate level writing assignments. These do not allow for students to take feedback into consideration to refine their literacy skills, leading to modest progress during post-secondary education. Feedback may be seen as judgmental, with no way to improve their writing. Last, this style of writing does not reflect the real-world editorial process like peer-review. ESL students or those from marginalized demographics may be at a further disadvantage when graded on their writing. To address this, we developed and implemented a standardized writing assignment structure that modelled scientific peer review, dubbed the incentivized improvement method (IIM). Student submitted an initial draft that was evaluated based on the effort of submission, irrespective of errors. The rubric was open-ended and students received very little guidance on their initial submission, but were rather told to explore what they believed was appropriate to include in their work, which fostered creative and student-driven learning. Initial submissions received extensive comments from graders and students revised their work for an additional set of marks. After piloting this system in smaller courses, the IIM was implemented in two large undergraduate statistics courses (total N = 361). An anonymous survey recorded feedback from students (N = 143) across both classes. Overwhelmingly, students agreed that the IIM assisted in improving their writing, critical thinking, and developing additional literacy skills relative to single-submission assignments. Graders also noted that the quality of revised submissions exceeded expected academic performance. Notably, ESL students found the IIM quite effective in developing their English language skills. Importantly, many students’ qualitative feedback indicated that they would prefer the IIM in other STEM-related courses. In conclusion, the IIM, a standardized revision-based writing assignment, is an effective method to improve literacy skills in a diverse undergraduate student population.",

          "abstract": "The success and failure of human coordination critically depend on the ability to anticipate and adapt to both one’s own and others’ actions. While theoretical models emphasize the central role of predictive mechanisms, empirical studies often rely on simplified tasks that do not capture the sensory, motor, and social complexity of real-world joint action. Consequently, it remains unclear which among the many behavioral, cognitive, physiological, demographic, and relational factors truly contribute to coordination success.\nHere, we introduce a quantitative framework to address this gap by identifying key predictors of performance in a fast-paced ball-hitting task, performed both individually (individual-action) and in a turn-taking format with a partner (joint-action). Using high-resolution multimodal tracking of eye and body movements and heart rate, combined with machine learning and Bayesian modeling, we show that coordination success is primarily associated with the similarity in predictive styles between partners, rather than with general anticipatory ability alone. Well-coordinated pairs—defined by sustained, accurate ball exchanges—exhibited similar timing and patterns of anticipatory saccades in the individual-action task and were more synchronized in their predictions of both their own and their partner’s actions during joint performance. In contrast, demographic and relational variables (e.g., gender, height, familiarity), as well as global physiological and motor activity (e.g., overall movement, heart rate), showed minimal association with coordination outcomes.\nBy reverse-engineering the behavioral signatures of successful coordination, our study highlights alignment in action anticipation as a key mechanism and offers a data-driven foundation for improving joint performance in both human–human and human–robot interaction.",

Statistical Learning (SL) is a learning mechanism that drives speech segmentation and word learning through computation of transitional probabilities between syllables. Individual differences in SL ability are predictive of further language development, and the current study investigated whether Rhythmic Ability (RA; beat/meter perception in rhythmic stimuli) is a mechanism correlating with SL in six- to nine-month-old infants. We further explored whether RA of the parents predicted infant RA and/or SL.\n\tWe used EEG to measure infants’ neural entrainment in two conditions: (1) a speech segmentation SL condition in which transitional probabilities between syllables were the only cue to segment the speech stream into words; (2) a RA condition exposing infants to a syncopated rhythm, yielding a 4/4 meter. We correlated neural entrainment to the words in the SL condition with the meter in the RA condition. Parents completed standardized tasks measuring RA and were asked about their solo and joint (parent-child) engagement with music.\n\tResults revealed a relationship between neural entrainment indexing SL and RA in infants, which was unaffected by infant age. This relationship was specific to neural entrainment to words and meters, suggesting overlapping neural mechanisms for processing items at hierarchically similar levels. We found no evidence that parental RA predicted infant RA or SL. However, frequency of parent-child joint musical engagement appears to have a positive effect on infant RA, paving the way for further studies on this topic.",

TeTraCom+ thus offers a reliable, evidence-based tool for systematic self-reflection, supporting targeted professional growth in teacher education and providing a valuable resource for educators.",

          "authors": "Nathan Leroy; Arnaud D'Argembeau",
          "abstract": "Remembering past events usually takes less time than their actual duration—events are temporally compressed in memory. A recent study found that this compression is not systematic but emerges when continuous events exceed approximately 9 s. Unexpectedly, however, remembering shorter events (3-6 s) took more time than their actual duration. Here, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms behind this increased replay duration of short events. In Experiment 1, we developed a corrected measure accounting for recall initiation time – the time needed to access the beginning of the event. With this correction, the longer replay times for short events disappeared, suggesting the effect was partly due to unmeasured recall initiation time. In Experiment 2, we examined the potential role of a central tendency bias by exposing participants to different ranges of event durations. Replay duration was influenced by the event’s relative position within the duration range, consistent with a central tendency bias. However, for events longer than 9 s, temporal compression occurred consistently across all conditions. Together, these findings suggest that while central tendency influences replay duration, temporal compression systematically emerges when events exceed a few seconds, likely reflecting memory capacity limits in representing continuous experiences.",

          "authors": "Andrea De Bartolo; Yuying Huang; Hamza Qayumi; Kaja Kinga Jasińska",
          "abstract": "Canada has welcomed over 100,000 Syrian refugees since 2015, many of whom have faced displacement-related challenges that shape their socio-emotional well-being. Refugee children, in particular, are at heightened risk for socio-emotional difficulties due to their developmental sensitivity to adversity, exposure to traumatic events, and resettlement stressors. Assessing children’s socio-emotional well-being often relies on both parent-reports and child self-reports; however, discrepancies between these reports commonly occur, and the factors influencing such discrepancies are not well understood, particularly in displaced populations. The present study examined predictors of parent-child discrepancies in reports of socio-emotional well-being and explored whether such discrepancies were associated with children’s learning outcomes. Participants were Syrian refugee children (N = 55, Mage = 14.42) who were resettled in Canada for an average of six years. Results revealed that children consistently self-reported more socio-emotional problems than their parents reported. Moreover, an extended period of displacement significantly predicted greater parent-child discrepancies, suggesting that resettlement-related factors and acculturation influence parent-child discrepancies. Interestingly, discrepancies were not associated with children's learning outcomes. The findings suggest that, while parent-child communication barriers may contribute to discrepancies, differences in how socio-emotional constructs are understood and reported by parents and children. These findings underscore the importance of including multiple informants in socio-emotional well-being assessments and carefully considering cultural and contextual factors when designing assessments, specifically given the complex dynamics in displaced families. Future research is important to advance the literature to determine whether assessments of socio-emotional well-being should be adapted for specific population, as suggested by the present findings.",

Here, participants chose between cups based on an\nactor's pointing cue, either while being addressed or witnessing an interaction between two\nactors. Participants were primed about the actor's cooperative or competitive intent.\nExperiment 1 found no significant interaction between these factors. However, Experiment 2,\nconsidering spatial attention (cue direction), revealed nuanced effects. In addressed\ninteractions, more social cues led to faster responses, especially during spatially congruent\ncooperative trials. In witnessed interactions, responses were faster to spatially incongruent\ncues in cooperative trials and vice versa in competitive trials.

          "abstract": "Attention plays a critical role in reading and lies at the core of the theoretical debate between parallel and serial processing. However, direct measurements of attention have long remained elusive. Recently, Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) has shown promise in directly measuring covert attention allocated to parafoveal words. RIFT involves flickering the background of the target word(s) at an imperceptible frequency (≥60Hz), but imperceptibility does not necessarily equate to the absence of a cognitive effect. The current study examined the potential impact of the RIFT paradigm on eye movements. High- and low-frequency target words were embedded in one-line sentences and displayed randomly in three condition blocks: no tagging, invisible tagging at 60Hz (i.e., RIFT) and visible tagging at 30Hz. Linear Mixed-Effect modelling and Divergence Point Analysis revealed a robust frequency effect, with high-frequency words processed faster than low-frequency words, but no significant differences across the three conditions in terms of its magnitude or onset latency. Overall fixation durations (irrespective of lexical frequency) did not differ between the no tagging and RIFT conditions, but were significantly longer in the visible tagging condition, suggesting that deliberately drawing attention to the tagging area actually slowed down reading. Furthermore, a post-experiment questionnaire indicated relatively low RIFT awareness. These findings suggest that RIFT is a valid tool for measuring attention during that does not interfere with word processing and highlight its potential for application in ecologically valid settings involving eye movements.",

          "abstract": "Cultural products share information from which people can derive knowledge. From this knowledge, a common vision can emerge to achieve a goal. Information shared by cultural products can concern topics related to the natural world and, benefitting from scientific knowledge, could contribute to the achievement of the so desired sustainable development. However, information about nature in cultural products may also have negative effects and accentuate the psychological distance from environmental issues. This article aims to review and discuss studies that highlight both the positive and negative effects of nature-related communications in the cultural entertainment products of visual mass media. The focus is on visual media because they have the potential to effectively and intuitively communicate complex concepts such as environmental issues. We essentially point out the negative psychological effects related to the representations of nature disseminated by such products, and propose a classification of these effects based on the Model of the undesirable effects of communication campaigns. Our results highlight a categorization of a wide range of negative psychological effects, of social and personal character, that can be generated by cultural products that aim to raise awareness of environmental problems. The present review provides a new dimensional perspective that can be used, on the one hand, by researchers of nature representations to frame the phenomenon and, on the other hand, by producers of visual cultural products to avoid the inclusion of involuntary messages with potentially negative effects.",

Such methods rely on the application of researcher-defined parameters, which can significantly affect outcomes. Multiverse analysis, applying multiple analytical strategies to the same dataset, reveals how parameter choices influence results, thus mitigating possible bias and enhancing transparency and reliability of results. \nIn this study, we used a multiverse approach to reanalyse - through Windowed Cross-Correlation (WCC) - a dyadic ECG dataset from participants involved in a Joint Action task as well as simulated data generated via Kuramoto models (mathematical models used in describing synchronyzation) . We explored how the combination of i) window size, ii) window overlap, iii) prewhitening and iv) use of Peak-Picking (PP) algorithm affected several indices of IPS strength and stability, as well as their ability to discriminate between real and surrogate dyads. \nThe original results of the stufy were overall replicated, with all IPS indices successfully discriminating genuine from surrogate synchrony regardless of parameter selection. By contrast, the selection of parameters had a greater influence when distinguishing between task and baseline IPS. Moreover, the PP algorithm tended to overestimate synchrony strength, thereby hindering discrimination. Importantly, measures of synchrony stability proved effective in distinguishing genuine from surrogate synchrony. Based on our multiverse results, we provide recommendations for researchers applying WCC analysis to study cardiac IPS synchrony.",

A neuropsychological battery assessed verbal memory, attention, processing speed, executive function, working memory, and verbal fluency. Fatigue, anxiety-depression, and sleep quality were measured through standardized self-report instruments.\nMG patients showed impairments in immediate and delayed verbal memory, sustained attention, and concentration. Hierarchical regression identified concentration as the strongest predictor of memory performance, while physical fatigue significantly predicted concentration. Mediation analysis showed that concentration fully mediated the relationship between fatigue and verbal memory. Among clinical variables, only glucocorticoid treatment was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes.\nThe findings confirm cognitive impairments in MG, influenced by fatigue, emotional symptoms, and sleep quality, highlighting the need for integrated clinical approaches.",

Further questions relate to interindividual differences (who?), and the specific foods (what?) around which EE occurs. To address ‘how’, we investigate whether reaction time-based food approach biases – reflecting motivational tendencies – covary with affect in daily life. To address ‘who’ and ‘what’, we consider trait EE alongside hedonic and goal-related food characteristics. In 76 participants with dietary goals, we measured positive and negative affect and approach bias towards goal-congruent and -incongruent foods on nine midday assessments using ecological momentary assessment and a mobile approach-avoidance task; hedonic food characteristics were assessed with food-specific craving ratings in the evening. Trait EE was assessed using the Salzburg Emotional Eating Scale. There was no direct association between affect and approach bias, nor one moderated by goal-congruency. Instead, affect and approach bias covaried on days with high craving: negative affect was linked to higher approach bias, while positive affect was linked to lower approach bias, especially in participants reporting more intake during negative affect or less intake during positive affect (trait EE), respectively. Our results indicate temporally dynamic relationships between affect and approach biases (how?) that did not emerge as a function of specific food characteristics (what?) but on high craving days (when?) – particularly in trait emotional eaters (who?). Hence, eating behavior might be altered through food approach tendencies during hedonic states opening avenues for mechanistic research and context-sensitive eHealth treatments.",

In this validation effort, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, convergent and discriminant validity assessment, and invariance testing were conducted. Foreign Language Curiosity Scale (FLCS) revealed to be a unidimensional measure with nine items loading onto a single latent variable. Evidence was offered for the validity, reliability, and invariance of FLCS items across gender, proficiency, and L1 groups.

Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature.

A sample of 401 adult students (Mage = 20.81, SD = 2.24) reported perceived awareness, sharing intention, and sharing tendency for pro-right, pro-left, anti-right, and anti-left misinformation content on social media. Descriptive analyses revealed a selective diffusion tendency of misinformation rather than a uniform spread. Pro-right narratives were largely disregarded, whereas anti-right claims attracted the greatest engagement, consistent with negative partisanship. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that prior exposure to ideologically congruent content significantly predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond demographic controls, supporting the view that exposure fosters normalization of falsehoods. Right-wing authoritarianism predicted greater willingness to share pro-right and anti-left misinformation, while left-wing authoritarianism selectively predicted anti-right sharing, indicating asymmetrical dispositional pathways. Importantly, effect sizes from chi-square tests were modest, and many participants refrained from sharing content even when they judged it credible. These findings challenge alarmist accounts of an unchecked misinformation epidemic and dismiss assumptions that misinformation is primarily right-driven. Instead, results suggest that misinformation often functions less as mass persuasion than as a tool of strategic antagonism, warranting theoretical frameworks that extend beyond simple left–right dichotomies.",

          "abstract": "During the processing of linguistic dependencies, the presence of a non-dependent word—referred to as a distractor—can sometimes complicate the identification of the correct subject. This phenomenon, known as similarity-based interference, provides a valuable testing ground for competing theories of sentence processing and has garnered significant interest in the field of psycholinguistics. One prominent theory, cue-based retrieval, suggests that the parser initiates a search for the relevant linguistic dependent at the retrieval site (e.g., the verb) based on a set of retrieval cues. In this work, we explore the use of lexicon-specific cues set by classifiers in the retrieval of noun dependents in Mandarin Chinese to provide evidence for the cue-based retrieval mechanism. A further open question is whether the distractor must intervene between the co-dependents (so-called retroactive interference) or whether the distractor can appear to the left of the dependent elements (so-called proactive interference). Previous work has suggested that proactive interference is weaker than retroactive interference, i.e., that the distractor has to intervene between the co-dependents to influence the dependency completion process. Using self-paced reading and A-Maze tasks, and Bayes Factors for hypothesis testing, we found robust evidence for a predicted interference effect in retroactive configurations, but no interference in proactive configurations. We discuss the theoretical implications of the current work for theories of retrieval and sentence processing in general.",

          "abstract": "Among the cognitive impairments characteristic of schizophrenia, deficits in cognitive control are particularly prominent. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined the spatial patterns and task-induced blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) changes associated with attentional control deficits in participants with schizophrenia relative to neurotypical participants. We employed a cognitive paradigm that required participants to alternated between three judgment tasks (i.e., identifying colours, parity, or letter case), while being presented with stimuli comprised of  one (univalent), two (bivalent), or three (trivalent) dimension(s). Three cognitive modes were detected: (1) Multiple Demand (MD), (2) Language (LAN), and (3) Default mode B (DM-B). Participants with schizophrenia showed impaired task performance, muted but sustained activations of the MD mode, hypo-activations of the LAN mode, and hyper-deactivations of the DM-B mode relative to neurotypical participants. Thus, attentional control impairments in individuals with schizophrenia are likely due to disrupted activity of the MD, LAN, and DM-B modes. Additionally, in participants with schizophrenia, the sustained activation of the MD mode in the Trivalent condition was associated with higher scores on positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), while the reduced activation of the LAN mode in the Trivalent condition and the pronounced deactivation of the DM-B mode in the Univalent condition were associated with higher scores on negative symptoms (i.e., poverty of speech and flattened affect). Our findings highlight the contributions of fMRI to individualized medicine due to symptom-specific effects, and identifying potential targets for neuromodulation techniques that aim to restore BOLD activity and improve cognitive function in schizophrenia.",

Identifying such responses is a time-consuming yet necessary process to ensure robust results but also remains challenging to automate. We explore the efficacy of transformer language models (TLMs) for automatically detecting invalid creativity responses, using only the text prompt and response and no other metadata about the experimental session. We train a suite of transformers to detect invalid data for two creativity assessments: the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a design problems task (DPT). We find that transformers generally outperform other baselines for both tasks. Further, we show that TLMs’ predictions are well calibrated to the quality of the participant response, ensuring that model failures will occur in a predictable way and that high-quality responses are unlikely to be labeled invalid. Finally, we conduct a fairness analysis based on language background—using an adversarial study where participants attempt to “break” the model by coming up with invalid responses that are nonetheless labeled valid. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods for cleaning creativity assessment data, using solely participant responses, in a reliable and unbiased way.",

Across three studies (N = 444; between 2023 and 2024), we address this issue by examining the role of prior beliefs in reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy common to many types of psychological interventions. In Studies 1 and 2, we instructed participants to reappraise negative stimuli in a way that was consistent with different beliefs. We found that more belief-congruent (versus less belief-congruent) reappraisals were more believable and more effective for regulating emotions. In Study 3, we asked participants to rank sets of standardized reappraisals. We found substantial heterogeneity in which reappraisals were preferred, and this heterogeneity was partially explained by people’s prior beliefs. This work suggests that, in the context of US-based participants, beliefs may be leveraged to systematically personalize reappraisal interventions.",

          "abstract": "The intensity of mental states varies over time. Within a given instance of a cognitive or emotional state, the strength of that state’s hold on the mind ebbs and flows. Although different instances of the same state will exhibit different temporal dynamics, certain states are associated with certain dynamics. For example, surprise tends to arise sharply, whereas tiredness generally accumulates gradually over time. This paper investigates the structure and correlates of people’s beliefs about these mental state dynamics. We measure these beliefs using a freeform drawing task in an online sample (Sample 1; N = 457), and preregistered replication sample (Sample 2; N = 1435). We observe that people attribute consistent, differentiable intensity dynamics to a wide range of mental states. These beliefs are optimally characterized by a replicable 3-dimensional structure. We go on to examine the correlates of these beliefs about intra-state dynamics (Study 2). We find that they are associated with variability in mental state similarity judgements, transition probability ratings, and natural language use. Together these findings show that people hold robust, structured beliefs about mental state dynamics, and that these beliefs are reflected in other facets of mental state understanding.",

          "abstract": "The value of herding dogs depends on how effectively they perform their job. Improving the rate of success for herding dogs requires understanding which dogs succeed and why. The present study determines whether dog personality and behavioral traits can be used to predict herding performance. We began by replicating Wilson and colleagues (2022), who found that personality traits predict herding ability in Australian kelpies. We asked American owners of herding dogs to complete an online survey about their dog’s (n = 335) personality traits, behavioral traits, and herding ability. We grouped related personality traits together in a principal components analysis to create dog personality profiles. Next, we determined whether any dog personality profiles predicted herding ability. We partially replicate Wilson et al.’s (2022) findings, with similar personality profiles predicting herding ability. We then expanded on the previous study by creating a new set of profiles that also included behavioral traits. We found that both personality and behavioral traits predicted herding ability. We propose that herding dog handlers and breeders should focus on key personality and behavioral traits when making decisions about herding dog career paths and training efforts.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive aging is characterized by declining memory and reduced segregation of large-scale brain networks. While memory training and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) each show potential to support neurocognitive function in older adults, their combined effect on cognitive outcomes remains an active line of research and effects on whole-brain network modularity remain unclear. Additionally, recent studies suggest that tDCS may accelerate the cognitive benefits of memory training. We tested whether five days of training working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM), paired with anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, would enhance these memory domains and increase resting-state functional network modularity. 62 healthy older adults were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham stimulation during adaptive WM and LTM training, with resting-state fMRI collected at baseline, post-test, and follow-up 2-4 months after training. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in WM or LTM over time, and stimulation condition did not reliably modulate performance. Similarly, resting-state modularity did not change significantly across the training period, nor were there differences between stimulation groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that task-based modularity increased from post-test to follow-up in the active group, though this effect was not accompanied by behavioral gains. Further exploratory analyses revealed that across all outcomes, baseline measurements (irrespective of condition) emerged as strong moderators of change over the training period, emphasizing the importance of interindividual variability. By integrating memory training with tDCS and longitudinal fMRI, this study adds to the growing literature on stimulation-augmented cognitive training protocols and underscore the need for research on interindividual differences.",

          "authors": "Daniel Mark Low; Osiris Rankin; Daniel D.L. Coppersmith; Kate Bentley; Matthew Nock; Satrajit S Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Researchers often want to measure a variety of constructs such as anxiety, discrimination, or loneliness in text data from surveys, interviews, social media, and electronic health records. Using large language models (LLMs) --while optimal for text classification-- remain infeasible for many researchers due to concerns around computational expertise, cost, privacy, and compute requirements. Therefore, some researchers prefer to use lightweight models for large datasets or interpretable models to avoid mistakes in high-stakes scenarios such as suicide risk detection. Lexicons offer simple baselines to LLMs by searching for relevant phrases --and can be used together with LLMs to guarantee capturing specific keywords in a deterministic way. However, building new lexicons is resource intensive. In this study, we found that GPT-4 turbo was able to automatically create a lexicon for 49 known risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which we release as the Suicide Risk Lexicon. This approach quickly measures most constructs relevant for this application, resulting in high content validity. This lexicon was able to accurately predict risk in crisis counseling conversations. After validating the lexicon with clinical experts, the lexicon outperformed the LIWC lexicon --which has low content validity for mental illness-- and performed similarly to some black-box deep learning models. Due to using an interpretable approach with high content validity, we discovered that active suicidal ideation and direct self-injury were stronger indicators of imminent risk than passive suicidal ideation and depressed mood in this ecological setting. To simplify creating new lexicons for other research domains, we introduce a Python package, construct-tracker, that works with a variety of LLMs. In sum, while we recommend using LLMs for text classification, they remain out of reach for many researchers. Our work demonstrates that LLMs --despite being black-boxes that might be challenging to use-- can counterintuitively create interpretable models by generating lexicons, when this is preferred. Furthermore, we highlight the broader application of lexicons beyond measurement, including their use in benchmarking LLM performance.",

          "authors": "Natalie Renata Stearns; Patricia Kerig; Alexander; Kristel Thomassin; Stephanie Gayle Craig",
          "abstract": "Core features of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., low empathy, lack of guilt, callousness) are underpinned by emotion processing deficits including dysfunction in emotion reactivity (ERc) and emotion regulation (ER). Additionally, recent research has suggested the presence of heterogeneity in CU traits, such that the primary variant is biologically rooted and marked by hypoarousal, whereas the secondary variant is thought to develop as a response to maltreatment and is marked by hyperarousal. To date, physiological measurement of ERc and ER processes via the parasympathetic nervous system have focused on static methods of measurement; however, dynamic approaches may provide a more nuanced picture of reactive and regulatory processes. The current study sought to identify whether CU trait variants differed on ERc and ER as indexed by both static and dynamic objective physiological markers with the goal of improving our understanding of CU trait development and informing future treatment targets. Participants consisted of 636 youth ages 12-18 recruited from juvenile detention centers. A latent profile analysis identified CU variants using CU traits, anxiety, and posttraumatic arousal and avoidance. Groups were subsequently compared on static and dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) indices of ERc and ER. Only one dynamic measure of ER (i.e., RSA inertia) uniquely differentiated primary and secondary groups, whereas static measures provided little discriminative utility. The current findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of CU trait heterogeneity with respect to emotion processing, allowing us to more effectively target variants in the treatment context.",

          "abstract": "Groups often outperform individuals in cognitive tasks. However, there is little consensus on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie effective teamwork. Here we propose that metacognitive awareness—an individual’s ability to understand and reflect on their own cognitive processes as well as those of their peers—plays a critical role in facilitating effective group work. This ability includes recognizing not only one’s own strengths and weaknesses but also understanding the knowledge states, skills, and needs of fellow group members. Metacognitively aware team members can leverage each other’s expertise, adjust their communication styles appropriately, and collaborate more efficiently. However, interaction can also have deleterious consequences, such as when one member chooses to dominate, when social conditions make group members reluctant to contribute or to evaluate others’ contributions frankly, or when the coordination among group members is sufficiently burdensome that it interferes with individual performance. Here we propose that effective group work results from harnessing the knowledge that is held in many minds by creating conditions for optimal sorting and evaluation of group suggestions through the effective exchange of metacognitive information. We examine the existing literature on group cognition across a number of fields, including psychology, cognitive science, organization, and management, and identify a number of key metacognitive strategies that exemplify this strategy and enhance group performance.",

A popular form of personalized feedback concerns people’s positive affect in different environments and activities. The goal of this type of feedback is to provide participants insight into contexts that are associated with particularly high or low positive affect. Then, they may seek these contexts out more or less often respectively. However, the extent to which participants gain insight from this type of personalized feedback has not yet been quantified. In this study, we tested whether participants indeed gained insight from personalized feedback about their average positive affect in different contexts. We did this using a pre-post design, in which we compared estimates that participants made of their average positive affect in different contexts before and after receiving their personalized feedback to their respective personalized feedback (N = 133). For a subsample of participants (n = 77), we mistakenly provided feedback that was consistently higher than the actual average of their EMA data. We found that participants generally changed their estimates in the direction of both the ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ personalized feedback. These findings suggest that people may be inclined to adjust their perception towards their personalized feedback, even when the feedback is flawed.",

Confirmatory analyses supported the S-DERS four-factor structure, with evidence against a general shared difficulty factor, and we provide validated 4-, 8-, and 18-item EMA versions with practical recommendations. Emotion regulation difficulties showed both stability and meaningful fluctuations, increasing after stressors, co-occurring with negative affect, and predicting impaired affective recovery. These effects were stronger among individuals high in trait DERS and neuroticism. Findings position emotion regulation difficulties as dynamic, context-sensitive processes that can be robustly measured in daily life to inform clinical science and intervention.",

Members of Congress have plenty of reasons to involve themselves in American nuclear policy and may be less willing to defer to the president’s geostrategic aims in the current era of increasing polarization, party competition, and divided government. Thus, we ask how do these domestic political factors affect American nuclear nonproliferation efforts abroad? In this project, we address these questions through a multi-method approach that combines an original large-n data collection of congressional involvement in nuclear weapons policymaking and an experiment using functional MRI (fMRI) to examine the psychological and neural underpinnings of elite decision making in the context of nuclear policy under different situational constraints.

          "abstract": "The modulation of cognitive control by threat of punishment has been under-characterized relative to examinations of reward, with mixed findings reported in the literature. Across two experiments, we examined the balance of proactive and reactive control in the AX-CPT under several negative affect and punishment manipulations. In Experiment 1, we compared cognitive control performance between two task phases: an Affect phase, in which emotionally evocative images were used to induce either Fear, Anger, or Neutral affect, and a Punishment phase, in which the threat of receiving mild electric shocks was either performance-contingent, or unavoidable. In Experiment 2, we examined cognitive control under punishment that was both unavoidable and uncertain, and whether effects of such punishment varied by individual differences in trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Across both experiments, we observed that threat of punishment was associated with increased proactive control, and that this effect was heightened when punishment was performance-contingent. In contrast, punishment uncertainty did not appear to modulate cognitive control outcomes at the group level. However, exploratory analyses suggested that punishment uncertainty might interact with individual variability in trait anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and threat-related physiological arousal responses to shape control outcomes. Together, our findings support an account in which the presence of a motivator, regardless of valence, facilitates increased proactive control. In contrast, the relationship between negative affect and cognitive control outcomes may be more complex, and vary both with contextual factors and individual differences.",

Leveraging a micro-task design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students (N=184, timepoints=9,248), we show that within person upswings in domain-general information processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal achievement across domains, even after controlling for other factors. A one standard deviation change in this cognitive capacity translated to the behavioral equivalent of ~40 minutes of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness.

          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

It is unclear, however, whether these mechanisms generalize to more complex domains such as fake news detection. Here, we tested whether confidence also drives information seeking in the context of fake news, whether seeking information improves fake news detection and sharing intentions, and whether we find confidence-driven confirmation biases. In an online study, 314 US citizens indicated whether news headlines were true or fake and could request additional information before finalizing their decision. First, in line with findings from perceptual decision-making, confidence was the main driver of information seeking for both fake and true news. Yet critically, whereas confidence lawfully scaled with decision accuracy for true news items, we found a U-shaped relationship for fake news items: decision accuracy was lowest for intermediate confidence, indicating that for fake headlines confidence is not a reliable signal of headline veracity. Second, while information seeking increased decision accuracy for true news items, for fake news items decision accuracy remained at chance level even after information seeking. Sharing intentions for fake news remained equally unaffected by information seeking, and mostly increased for belief-congruent true items. Finally, we found a confidence-driven confirmation bias for beliefs, but not for sharing intentions.

          "abstract": "Science-in-the-open has the potential to redefine the traditional scientific framework and greatly accelerate high-impact research. It usually involves a large team of volunteer researchers asynchronously working together in a public Discord server. This approach allows one to harness crowd-sourced intelligence to tackle ambitious problems collaboratively and attract specialized expertise and creative approaches you might not find in a traditional lab. Unfortunately, in practice, the benefits are often outweighed by management challenges. With an open invite, you’ll likely have a heterogeneous group of contributors: different backgrounds, skill levels, time zones, and commitment levels. Coordinating a larger, decentralized team is hard. There’s a risk of wasting time onboarding people who later disappear, or trying to mentor enthusiastic novices at the expense of research progress. Newcomers may find it impossible to figure out the project status or how to contribute amidst the chatter. Progress can stall as volunteers are under no obligation to stay or finish tasks. Below, I outline strategies that have worked in my experience to optimally steer open science collaborations.",

Providing DSDP information on AI products in an easily accessible and quick-to-process format could, however, help instill appropriate levels of (dis-)trust in (potential) users. Here, participants were presented with hypothetical AI products paired with different labels (graphical vs. text-based) conveying low to high DSDP levels. Expectedly, trust increased and anxiety decreased when an AI product reached a higher DSDP level. That is, labels effectively communicated DSDP differences. Text-based labels were associated with increased trust and decreased anxiety compared to graphical labels. Interestingly, when not provided with DSDP information via a label, participants attributed an intermediate level of (dis-)trust to AI products. These findings illustrate the importance and potential of introducing easy-to-process labels to convey information about AI products, for instance, DSDP information.",

          "abstract": "Across cultures, humans reason about others’ mental states as being either phenomenal, reflecting shareable experiences, or intentional, reflecting agentive goals. Might our dissociated judgments of others’ mental states be linked to dissociated judgments of others’ gaze direction, one of our earliest social cues from infancy? We presented adults (N = 600) and 6- to 8-year-old children (N = 200) with direct, definitional descriptions as well as descriptions of example phenomenal or intentional mental states and asked them to choose whether a face with averted or straight-ahead gaze better matched the character in each description. Adults and older children chose the averted-gaze face for the direct phenomenality description but the straight-ahead-gaze face for the direct intentionality description. Adults showed the same pattern of responses for the indirect descriptions, but children chose the straight-ahead-gaze face for both types of indirect descriptions. A link between straight-ahead gaze and phenomenality present from human infancy may thus impact children’s judgments of others’ gaze direction. But by adulthood, language may come to evoke particular contexts in which a character’s inner experience may be more strongly linked to averted gaze. If, in adulthood, our social concepts have indeed been built on such prelinguistic intuitions and language, then these intuitions may continue to affect our mature, linguistically driven social reasoning.",

This study explored reported outcomes of use of Brain in Hand (BiH), an individualised digital support tool for neurodivergent people, using a mixed-methods design. Materials and Method: Eighteen employed neurodivergent adults (autistic and/or with ADHD) completed measures of anxiety and workplace productivity at baseline and 6 months. Qualitative interviews were conducted at both timepoints. Data were integrated with participant-defined goals and interpreted BiH engagement levels. Results: Many participants reported improvements in psychological wellbeing, daily structure and independence, and work outcomes. These changes aligned with reduced anxiety and increased self-rated productivity, particularly for those who engaged fully and whose pre-study goals were mostly met. Support-seeking confidence also emerged as a benefit for some participants. However, barriers to engagement limited positive outcomes for others. Conclusions: Findings suggest that BiH may effectively support many neurodivergent employees, but benefits depend on sustained engagement and enabling workplace environments. Person-centred integration of qualitative and quantitative data enhanced interpretive depth, helping to capture the varied workplace experiences of neurodivergent people engaging with digital interventions.",

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) targets transdiagnostic mechanisms such as cognitive fusion and low self-compassion, which may be particularly relevant for AjD.\nObjective: This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of a brief, guided, asynchronous internet-delivered MBCT (iMBCT) for AjD during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with internet-delivered progressive muscle relaxation (iPMR) and a waitlist control (WLC).\nMethods: Adults meeting ICD-11 criteria for AjD (N = 301) were randomized to iMBCT, iPMR, or WLC for four weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in AjD symptoms (ADNM-20) and remission rates. Secondary outcomes were changes in depression, anxiety, cognitive fusion, experiential avoidance, and self-compassion. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up. Mediation analyses tested cognitive defusion and self-compassion as mechanisms. \nResults: iMBCT produced greater reductions in AjD symptoms than WLC (η² = .17) and higher remission rates. Compared with iPMR, iMBCT yielded larger decreases in depression and anxiety. Cognitive defusion fully mediated iMBCT effects on depression and anxiety. Gains were maintained at follow-up.\nConclusions: A brief, minimally guided, asynchronous iMBCT is an effective and scalable intervention for AjD, targeting cognitive and self-regulatory mechanisms.

It is not the case that everyone else before was wrong about decline but this time we are finally right. We highlight how intuitions of the generational decline are due to researchers being odd. Judgments are further distorted by misperceptions of the present, idealized memories of the past, presentism, all producing comparisons between reality and fiction. Historical examples and contemporary data illustrate how technologies and practices unfamiliar to older cohorts are over-indexed as the villain and often misassigned. We argue that credible claims about secular changes require (a) broad time horizons that avoid arbitrary cutoffs; (b) preregistration to curb confirmation bias; and (c) strict tests of measurement invariance, broadly construed to include shifting diagnostics, reference groups, reporting norms. Re-analyses that honor invariance overturn canonical narratives (e.g., “reverse Flynn effects,” a “narcissism epidemic”). While people and societies do change, many trends are cyclical rather than monotonic. We conclude with a practical framework: before inferring decline, ask whether the change is measured, whether the past benchmark is accurate, whether the metric is comparable across time.",

          "abstract": "There is a long-standing debate about the role of visual mental images in reasoning. Knauff and Johnson-Laird’s (2002) Visual Imagery Impedance Hypothesis (VIIH) suggests visual imagery can hinder abstract reasoning, as evidenced by slower responses to visual compared to spatial and control problems. Aphantasia — reduced or absent visual imagery— offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. In an online version of the reasoning paradigm used in VIIH studies, aphantasic and control participants completed three problem types (visual, spatial, control), while reaction time and accuracy scores were measured. In addition, a second classification, based on the Object-Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ), was employed to differentiate participants according to their cognitive style and explore possible performance differences between the visualiser, spatialiser and verbaliser clusters. Our study replicated the findings of Knauff and Johnson-Laird (2002), as a slowdown for visual problems in comparison to spatial and control ones was demonstrated in typical imagers. In aphantasics, this effect was less marked, but the difference between the groups is not substantial enough to be conclusively established. More in-depth analyses distinguishing “complete aphantasia” and hypophantasia revealed a more significant slowdown within the latter group, suggesting that visual imagery, even in its weakest form, influences performance on such tasks. Finally, our OSIVQ classification-based analyses showed that participants in the visualiser cluster are the most impaired in this task. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of considering the influence of mental images and cognitive styles in theories of reasoning.",

In Experiment 2, we applied bilateral continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) over the DLPFC and a control site to assess whether the DLPFC is critical for this attentional modulation.\nMethods: In Experiment 1, a within-subjects design was used with two simultaneous adaptive staircases for valid and invalid trials to control task difficulty, while reaction times, signal detection theory metrics and metacognitive efficiency were measured. In Experiment 2, the same task was performed in two sessions spaced by a week following cTBS over the DLPFC or control cortices, adding non-parametric metacognitive and cognitive control measures.\nResults: In Experiment 1, objective performance was successfully stabilized while leaving subjective responses unconstrained. Reaction times, response bias, and metacognitive efficiency were all impaired following invalid cues. In Experiment 2, the same pattern was observed after S1-cTBS, but critically, DLPFC-cTBS erased these attentional effects, indicating that DLPFC disruption selectively impairs the modulation of metacognitive monitoring. Trial-history analyses further corroborated that the DLPFC supports conflict-adaptation across trials.\nConclusion(s): These findings suggest that the DLPFC does not generate perceptual contents directly but is essential for the top-down processes that shape metacognitive monitoring. Disrupting DLPFC function reduces attentional benefits and conflict-adaptation in metacognition, highlighting its critical role in linking expectations to self-evaluative awareness.",

          "abstract": "Empathy is a core feature of the human social experience, underpinned by the sharing of and understanding of others’ states. However, we know relatively little about its early development. Here, we used the emerging technique of infrared thermography, combined with behavioural observations, to investigate how young children (1-3 years old) respond to others’ distress. We measured the emotional reactions – including changes in facial skin temperature and behavioural responses – of N=30 typically developing children from British nurseries while they watched short video-vignettes of familiar and unfamiliar caregivers displaying emotional distress or neutral expressions. We hypothesised that children’s facial temperature change and behavioural responses (including facial expressions and self-directed behaviours) would be stronger to distress than to neutral stimuli. Based on the social bias of empathy, we hypothesised that responses would be stronger towards familiar individuals as compared to unfamiliar. Results confirmed that children’s thermal response at the nose bridge was stronger when observing someone in distress compared to the neutral control. Although model familiarity had only a weak effect, there was an effect of age, with younger infants showing stronger thermal responses to distress stimuli compared to older children. We found no effect on behavioural responses. We discuss implications of these results, including whether thermal-imagery may be a more sensitive measure of affective responding than behavioural measures, and the importance of using multiple methods. By combining physiological and behavioural measures, this study contributes to theoretical and methodological advances into understanding how internal affective processes map onto external measures in early childhood, shedding light on the development of empathy.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",

It is unclear, however, whether these mechanisms generalize to more complex domains such as fake news detection. Here, we tested whether confidence also drives information seeking in the context of fake news, whether seeking information improves fake news detection and sharing intentions, and whether we find confidence-driven confirmation biases. In an online study, 314 US citizens indicated whether news headlines were true or fake and could request additional information before finalizing their decision. First, in line with findings from perceptual decision-making, confidence was the main driver of information seeking for both fake and true news. Yet critically, whereas confidence lawfully scaled with decision accuracy for true news items, we found a U-shaped relationship for fake news items: decision accuracy was lowest for intermediate confidence, indicating that for fake headlines confidence is not a reliable signal of headline veracity. Second, while information seeking increased decision accuracy for true news items, for fake news items decision accuracy remained at chance level even after information seeking. Sharing intentions for fake news remained equally unaffected by information seeking, and mostly increased for belief-congruent true items. Finally, we found a confidence-driven confirmation bias for beliefs, but not for sharing intentions. Together, our results clarify that while confidence-driven information seeking adaptively increases decision accuracy for true news items, it is entirely ineffective in the context of fake news.",

          "abstract": "Students with poor quality relationships (e.g., those lacking parent/carer support, peer support, and/or who are bullied by their peers) typically report lower wellbeing than their peers. Support from school staff may play a compensatory role for these vulnerable learners, but current evidence is meagre. Using data from N=25,977 adolescents (aged 12-15; 50.1% girls) from the #BeeWell study in Greater Manchester, England, we fitted a series of linear regression models to estimate the association between school staff support and psychological wellbeing; optimism; self-esteem; and, life satisfaction. These models were subsequently extended to explore potential moderation effects (i.e., whether the association between school staff support and wellbeing varies based on students’ level of parent/carer support, peer support, and/or exposure to bullying). Analyses revealed that higher levels of school staff support are significantly associated with higher levels of all four student wellbeing outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed a complex picture, with the nature and magnitude of effects varying by relationship and wellbeing outcome.  For example, for self-esteem and life satisfaction, the association with school staff support is stronger for students reporting low (vs high) parent/carer support or who are exposed (vs unexposed) to bullying. In contrast, for psychological wellbeing and optimism, it is smaller for students reporting low (vs high) social support from peers. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of having supportive school staff for promoting student wellbeing. They also suggest that increasing school staff support is a potentially useful mechanism for bolstering the wellbeing of vulnerable students (e.g., those who are bullied).",

This study investigates both general and workplace FoMO across three culturally distinct countries: Poland, China, and the United States, focusing on their relationships with job satisfaction and alternative job search. Online survey data (N = 626) revealed unexpected cross-country differences: Poland reported the highest general FoMO, while China reported the highest workplace FoMO. Moreover, general FoMO negatively predicted job satisfaction, particularly among individuals who viewed their jobs as personally undesirable. Contrary to expectations, workplace FoMO positively predicted job satisfaction, especially for those in roles perceived as less desirable, suggesting that FoMO may function as a compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, workplace FoMO positively predicted alternative job search, while general FoMO did not. A mediation analysis showed that job satisfaction indirectly buffered the link between workplace FoMO and job search behavior. These findings underscore the complex, context-dependent nature of FoMO in professional settings and offer practical implications for managing digital engagement and employee retention in increasingly connected workplaces.",

          "abstract": "Semantic cognition (use of acquired world knowledge to guide behaviour) is critical in everyday life. Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",

Despite its promise, oxytocin research has been marked by inconsistent results concerning its therapeutic applications and underlying mechanisms. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis is a popular approach to shed light on mixed findings in a body of literature; however, they can become quickly outdated as new evidence becomes available. Given these challenges, research on oxytocin and its biobehavioural outcomes is ideally positioned for the adoption of ‘living’ meta-analyses, which allow for the continuous integration of new data and updated conclusions. Here we introduce the Active Monitoring of Oxytocin Research Evidence (AMORE) platform (https://amore-project.org), which is a hub that aggregates articles and materials associated with living meta-analyses for biobehavioural oxytocin research. Developed through consensus among 24 expert researchers, a standardized framework was established that either requires or recommends practices ensuring transparency and rigor in living meta-analyses featured on the AMORE platform. Overall, AMORE has been designed to advance oxytocin biobehavioural research by the timely integration of emerging evidence through transparent living meta-analyses",

          "abstract": "The issue of “imposter” participants within qualitative research has become increasingly prevalent. The problem raises specific concerns for qualitive research around research inclusivity and diversity, alongside the challenge to data integrity and methodological rigour. Existing literature is dominated by case studies and commentaries with a need for multi-disciplinary guidelines that reflect the specific challenges and context of qualitative research. This study adopted a two-stage expert and evidence-based approach to develop guidance for researchers and organisations. Stage 1 was a mixed-method study with 184 qualitative researchers to establish the reach and impact of the problem, perspectives on the associated issues and potential solutions across disciplines, career stage and locality. Stage 2 involved a series of researcher and public workshops to develop and refine guidelines through an iterative analytical process. The resulting guidance for researchers and organisations is a flexible, supportive tool to enable a systematic and evidence-informed approach within their research practice. The guidance provides a framework for considering ethical, epistemological, methodological and practical considerations when determining how to mitigate the risk of imposter participants within qualitative research. It is hoped that the guidelines will inform wider understanding of the issue and encourage the adoption of evidence-based policies and processes.",

          "authors": "Nadav Neumann; Michal Pinhas",
          "abstract": "The Arabic number system links number length with magnitude: longer numbers represent larger values. In numerical comparisons, interference arises when physical and numerical dimensions are misaligned, and processing improves with greater numerical distance. While ERP studies have dissociated numerical processing effects, evidence for early encoding of numerical information remains inconclusive due to confounding visual properties. In two ERP experiments, we examined whether number length influences early multi-digit number processing, independent of visual size, by using scribbled line patterns to control physical length. Experiment 1 (N=27) compared digit values in tie numbers to standard “555”, ignoring number length. Experiment 2 (N=27) judged number length, ignoring digit identity. Targets varied in number length and numerical distance, creating congruent and incongruent conditions. ERP results revealed enhanced parieto-occipital N1 negativity (~120–150 ms) for longer numbers, indicating early number length encoding regardless of visual confounds. Central P2p (~150–190 ms) reflected refined numerical distance processing. Centro-parietal P3 (~300–360 ms) showed congruity effects only when numerical magnitude was task-relevant. These findings reveal three distinct processing stages: early encoding (N1), refined magnitude comparison (P2p), and conflict resolution (P3). This novel neurophysiological evidence showcases the unique influence of number length and numerical syntax on magnitude evaluation.",

This study aimed to validate its French version and use it to identify emotional profiles among young French people (18-30 years old, N=1650). Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature. This study thus provides a validated instrument assessing climate emotions in French-speaking contexts, with potential applications in interventions and research settings – including the study of climate emotion profiles.",

A central contention is that many people hold false beliefs about transgender men’s and women’s membership in the categories “male” and “female,” and, separately, view nonbinary gender identities themselves as illegitimate. Both discounting transgender men’s and women’s membership in the categories “male” and “female” and discounting the validity of nonbinary gender identities are forms of bias, and studying them will be essential to build a more nuanced understanding of stereotyping and prejudice. The authors review the literature on bias against transgender people and bias against nonbinary people, discuss the methodological and theoretical challenges in studying these biases, propose an approach for interpreting results in light of common (mis)categorization processes, and consider avenues for future research.",

Experimental studies have demonstrated that imagining a sustainable future increases pro-environmental intentions and support for environmental activism. However, the impact of these imagined futures depends on subjective appraisals—individuals who view a sustainable world positively are more likely to act. Additionally, emphasizing “co-benefits” of sustainable futures, such as stronger communities and increased well-being, enhances support for climate solutions. Other key features determining the effectiveness of interventions are a sense of collective efficacy and hope in creating the imagined future, and a sense of identification with a movement striving towards positive change.

In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human–machine\ninteraction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we\nrigorously measure these biases?\nWe address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test &amp; Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling,\npre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks. We illustrate STAMP-LLM on racial bias using one explicit and two implicit measures.",

This highlights the need to consider alternative psychotherapeutic\napproaches to integrate with MDMA for the treatment of PTSD. We propose that the evidencebased cognitive behavioral therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), is particularly\nwell-suited to be paired with the administration of MDMA for PTSD. Specifically: 1) the\nsubjective effects of MDMA directly support key ACT processes; 2) ACT methods could help\nprepare patients for MDMA administration, increasingly the likelihood of efficacy and\ntolerability; 3) ACT provides a “process-directed” approach to assist the therapist and help the\npatient during MDMA administration sessions; and 4) ACT may help optimize the integration of\nMDMA experiences to shape adaptive functioning and promote quality of life following\ntreatment. We provide examples of how ACT methods could be used for many of these goals.

Prior research has frequently investigated the neural correlates of FA and OM states utilizing electroencephalographic (EEG) methods, focusing on changes in spectral power within theta and alpha bands. Yet the functional significance of these neural changes has remained unclear. Here we utilized a fully-within subject state induction protocol to more directly test whether EEG spectral power during FA and OM is differentially associated with subjective ratings of state mindfulness.  \nMethods: While continuous EEG was recorded, participants engaged in audio-guided FA and OM practices, as well as an active control condition (C), and then self-reported their state mindfulness afterwards. Linear mixed effects models were used to rigorously assess how condition-level variation in spectral power predicted state mindfulness scores across the three inductions. \nResults: Validating the approach, participants reported higher state mindfulness and decreased theta power during both FA and OM relative to C; additionally, reduced alpha power was found in OM relative to FA. Most importantly, increased theta power was associated with higher state mindfulness in FA and even more strongly in OM, whereas reduced alpha power was linked to higher state mindfulness selectively in OM. \nConclusions:  These findings add to the growing literature suggesting that FA and OM represent distinct mindfulness states. We further establish that the functional significance of theta and alpha power is context-dependent, clearly linking these neural measures to the subjective quality of specific meditation states and practices.",

In this work, we explore how recognition of items is impacted when temporal context change is operationalized implicitly through the order of presentation during the study phase. 57 participants, were exposed to a rotation judgment cover task for 15 randomly generated polygon items. Around half of the participants were presented with these items in a random order. The other half were presented with items such that 6 items formed ‘boundaries’ that led in and out of 3 temporal clusters. Similar to findings where boundaries are explicitly operationalized, we show that implicit boundaries are also better remembered than non-boundary items.",

With the roots of computational psychiatry more in theoretical and neuroscience than clinical fields, research has often focused on the identification of symptomatic correlates of computational processes.

          "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is the ability to shift between mental sets in response to changing goals or environments, and it is known to decline across the adult lifespan. Competing accounts attribute this decline either to weaknesses in specific abilities such as inhibition or memory, or to more global challenges in managing the interaction between them. Efforts to disentangle contributing processes through targeted, single-function tasks have produced mixed findings, potentially due to confounding variability in stimuli and task demands.\nThe current work contributes to the field's understanding of cognitive flexibility decline by focusing on \\emph{inhibition} as both a subcomponent and as an independent process, given its central role in both specific-deficit and integrative theoretical accounts. In particular, we designed a unified task that engages both 1) cognitive flexibility through shifting requirements to encode task-relevant mental sets and inhibit them once they become outdated; and 2) discrete item-level inhibition of perceptual distractors. We tested 86 adults aged 18–73. Accuracy analyses revealed asymmetric interaction effects between aging and these two operations: while learning after a rule-switch worsened as age increased, inhibition of perceptual distractors inhibition improved. We then applied a computational model to quantify how memory precision and the inhibition of previously-relevant sets each contributed to performance. Model fits indicated that age-related decline in learning across rule-switches were driven primarily by reduced memory precision, not by deficits in inhibition.",

          "abstract": "The present study investigated predictors of individual differences in linguistic knowledge and spontaneous language use in adults. Specifically, we examined the role of domain-general cognitive abilities—working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and processing speed—alongside implicit motivational factors, including achievement, power, and affiliation motives and activity inhibition. Linguistic knowledge was assessed through multiple tests covering receptive and productive vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and comprehension of fixed expressions, whereas language use was examined through participants’ written narratives in the Picture Story Exercise (PSE), analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework. Network and path analyses revealed that auditory working memory positively predicted linguistic knowledge and analytic language use, highlighting its role in the sequential organization and consolidation of verbal material. Visual working memory was unrelated to knowledge but predicted more authentic language use, suggesting a link to imagery-based and self-referential expression. Nonverbal reasoning supported knowledge but was negatively related to authenticity, indicating a trade-off between systematic abstraction and spontaneity. Processing speed, while crucial in early language development, did not predict knowledge in adults and was negatively associated with narrative word count, suggesting that efficiency may reduce elaboration in spontaneous production. Contrary to our predictions, implicit motives and activity inhibition were unrelated to both linguistic knowledge and language use. Together, these findings underscore how distinct domain-general abilities shape static linguistic knowledge and dynamic language use, highlighting the need for integrative models of adult language skills.",

          "abstract": "When individuals collaborate, they often rely on momentary estimates of their own and their partner’s confidence (decision confidence) to guide collective decisions and achieve their goals. Through interaction, these confidence estimates tend to align over time. This  process is known as confidence matching. More stable, dispositional trait confidence is also emerging as a key factor shaping the dynamics and outcomes of collaborative action. We examined how trait confidence and type of communication impact the accuracy of dyadic decisions, decision confidence, and the dynamics of decision confidence, including confidence matching. \n\nIn this study, 210 participants completed general knowledge tests individually and collaboratively, forming 105 dyads. The tests were completed under three communication conditions: isolated (no interaction), passive (viewing the partner’s response and numeric confidence rating), and active (verbal discussion). Participants assessed as high-trait or low-trait confidence (controlling for cognitive ability) were allocated to three types of dyads: low-trait (two low-trait members), mixed-trait (one low-trait and one high member), or high-trait (two high-trait members) confidence dyads.\nTrait confidence moderated decision accuracy and decision confidence gains: dyads with mixed-trait or high-trait confidence showed greater decision accuracy improvements in the active than the passive communication condition compared to their individual decisions. Whereas low-trait confidence dyads benefited equally from active and passive communication. Collaboration increased decision confidence overall, especially for high-trait confidence dyads under active communication. Confidence matching occurred rapidly in both passive and active communication but predicted decision accuracy gains only in the passive condition where participants had limited social information. \n\nAlthough active verbal communication led to the greatest overall decision accuracy, these gains were not driven by confidence matching. Our findings highlight the critical role of trait confidence in shaping collaborative outcomes in dyads and extend previous research by showing that confidence matching occurs naturally during verbal communication.",

          "abstract": "A collective intelligence factor (CI) was introduced by prior research to characterize the cognitive ability of groups. Surprisingly, individual intelligence did not predict CI. Instead, it correlated with individual social sensitivity, the equality of conversational turn-taking and the proportion of females in a group. However, these findings may depend on the type of tasks completed by groups. Our study re-examined these relationships by (1) testing the robustness of the CI factor in dyads using well-structured tasks guided by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence; (2) exploring the relationship between dyadic CI and metacognitive confidence, which is known to influence group processes and outcomes; and (3) identifying the psychological characteristics of distinct dyad types using Latent Profile Analysis.\nWe measured CI in 105 undergraduate dyads using three group tasks aligned with the broad abilities of the CHC model. Individual intelligence was assessed using Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices. We also measured social sensitivity, proportion of females, equality of turn taking, working memory, and personality.\nResults indicated that individual intelligence and confidence were the strongest predictors of dyadic CI for well-structured tasks, contrasting with previous findings emphasizing social factors. While we replicated the relationship with social sensitivity, we did not replicate the findings for equality of turn taking or gender composition. Latent Profile Analysis identified three psychological profiles: dyads performing consistently high individually and collectively, those performing consistently low, and those performing better collectively than individually. Our ‘smarter’ dyads consisted of intelligent and confident individuals with higher social sensitivity.\nThese findings suggest that, in dyads performing well-structured tasks, individual cognitive abilities and confidence play significant roles in CI. This challenges the emphasis on social factors and underscores the importance of task selection.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

We investigated whether this may be because the harm caused by unfairness is less salient than the harm caused by more prototypical moral transgressions. We found that both 4-year-olds and adults rated unfairness more seriously when the harm caused by the unfairness was emphasized rather than not emphasized. When asked to categorize unfairness as either moral or conventional, 4-year-olds did not systematically choose either category. Most adults, on the other hand, categorized unfairness with conventional transgressions. These findings suggest that perceptions of unfairness exist along a continuum and are influenced by the salience of the harm caused by unfairness. Highlighting the harm inflicted by unfairness may be an important way to move people, from an early age, to notice and correct it.",

The so-called zero potential at infinity is clarified physically by focusing on the electric field, an unambiguously real physical entity.\nMeasures of functional connectivity like coherence are affected by reference, volume conduction, and the spatial scale of description. Nonetheless, the common average reference (CAVE or CAR) yields robust information, even though coherence between specific electrode pairs is uncertain. CAVE’s strength lies in treating all electrode sites equally, without prior assumptions about brain sources or volume conductor models. \nCAVE may benefit more from increased electrode density and reduced inter-electrode spacing than from extending electrode array coverage to lower head locations. With average center-to-center spacing below about 2.5 cm, CAVE accurately represents recorded potential relative to the average potential over the underlying scalp—without implying that this average is zero. Electric field measurements can usefully supplement CAVE measurements, the proposed parallax view. \nHigh-density recordings enable accurate estimation of scalp tangential electric fields, an extension of simple bipolar recording to the entire array. Such measure provides estimates of electric field magnitudes and directions, expressed as contour maps and streaming vector maps, respectively. Field magnitude maps sometimes resemble Laplacian maps depending on sources; streaming vector maps provide directions and strengths of scalp currents.  Because electric fields are inherently reference-free, only volume conduction remains as a barrier distorting coherence and other measures of dynamic source behavior.",

          "abstract": "Violence and delinquency have been central topics in criminology, with a growing body of research examining risk factors for violent behavior and recidivism. The increasing volume of studies highlights the need for systematic, scalable meta-analytic approaches to identify patterns across risk factors, behavioral outcomes, and psychosocial domains.This study introduces an automated text-mining approach to analyze the relationships between predefined risk factor terms and their associations with violence and recidivism. We curated dictionaries of terms spanning familial, cognitive, peer, personality, and substance-related factors, among others. Using these, we systematically collected scientific articles and measured co-occurrence probabilities to generate data-driven profiles of risk factors. This large-scale dataset enables the exploration of key associations, comparative analyses, and novel insights into how risk factors interact across behavioral and social contexts. By providing an openly available dataset, this study serves as both a pedagogical tool and a foundation for advancing criminological ontology, emphasizing the need for standardized terminology and a structured framework for risk factor classification.",

          "authors": "Seungju Kim; Weiman Xu",
          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While a growing body of literature has sought to understand factors connected to LGBQ+ acceptance and support by religious individuals, these factors remain understudied in religious leaders. Extant findings on LGBQ+ support among non-religious and even religious individuals may not directly apply to religious leaders, given leaders’ unique roles as religious and spiritual authorities. METHOD: Using a nationally representative sample of religious leaders from the 2020 National Survey of Religious Leaders (N = 1,600), we tested preregistered hypotheses to examine overall levels of LGBQ+ support and psychosocial, religious, and spiritual correlates, as well as potential congregational moderators. RESULTS: Results reveal overall low LGBQ+ support among U.S. religious leaders, with psychosocial factors (e.g., identifying as White, woman, higher education, income) and religious/spiritual struggles associated with greater support, while greater religious fundamentalism and prayer are associated with lower support. Religious fundamentalism emerged as the strongest predictor of lower LGBQ+ support across all analyses. Although congregation size did not moderate this relationship, congregational racial composition and religious tradition did influence the strength of the fundamentalism and LGBQ+ support association. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Religious leaders represent a key stakeholder group in the pursuit of increased rights and support for LGBQ+ people, yet this study reveals a significant disconnect between their attitudes and broader population trends toward acceptance. Community and policy stakeholders should collaborate with religious institutions, denominations, and theological seminaries to promote interpretive frameworks that encourage theological nuance, which emerged as the primary barrier to LGBQ+ support.",

While the effect has been shown in static stimuli of person identity, such as faces, it is unclear if it applies to dynamic person identity representations such as human voices. In two studies (NS1 = 238 with spoken sentences, NS2 = 88 with spoken words) university students engaged in exposure, rating, and validation tasks. We observed increased liking of voices with 8 initial repetitions for the sentences. Voices initially presented 2 and 5 times were liked less than unfamiliar voices and recognised as familiar with less confidence than voices initially presented 8 times, forming an inverted “U” in likeability and familiarity. Less experience with the speaker’s accent weakened the inverted “U” in liking. Our words data are insufficient for inferential conclusions, but the sentences results indicate an uncanny valley of “familiarly unfamiliar” voices, which are more familiar than never heard stimuli but not familiar enough for the mere exposure effect of increased liking.",

Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) procedures could also affect in trial results due to electrode location, current strength, and stimulation duration. Because of the small sample size and lack in the follow-up, more study is needed. Due to the disparity, tDCS and approaches need more research.

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is to dissociate perception from awareness using\nrigorous, bias-free methods. Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight. The work offers a new framework for studying visual consciousness beyond\nthe limits of traditional single-target paradigms.",

Across two preregistered studies (N = 504, 158) and a re-analysis of previously published data (N = 50), we rigorously examined outcome-irrelevant learning under conditions of explicit instruction and extensive training. In both cases, automatic value updating persisted even when participants clearly understood which features were non-predictive of reward, and reliance on these irrelevant values led to suboptimal choices. Moreover, working-memory capacity, known as a key regulatory resource, predicted the magnitude of this automatic outcome-irrelevant learning. Collectively, our results broaden the concept of automatic cognitive processing beyond the selective-attention literature to encompass reinforcement-learning mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "In this article, I raise serious ethical concerns about the integrity of the peer-review process surrounding a recent virtual special issue (VSI), which features updated and shortened versions of chapters from a book published almost simultaneously. Both the book and the VSI are largely authored, peer-reviewed, and edited by individuals affiliated with an NGO. A central issue addressed throughout the paper is the rationale for transforming book chapters into articles for a peer-reviewed journal. The motivation, perhaps, can be found in the editors’ own words, expressing their intent to use this “peer-reviewed and published” evidence to influence “policy-makers and practitioners across the world.” It is evident that articles published in peer-reviewed journals carry significantly more weight in shaping public policy than a book released by an NGO. This does not imply that the book or the special issue contain research of poor quality; however, it raises important questions about the transparency and rigor of the peer-review process.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain is a complex and persistent condition that is influenced by psychological, behavioral, and social factors. Emerging research suggests that long-term pain is not only driven by nociceptive inputs, but also by maladaptive cognitive processes, emotional dysregulation, and unhelpful behavioral patterns. Additionally, patient expectations and clinician communication significantly influenced treatment outcomes. This scoping review synthesizes interdisciplinary findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and empirical studies published over the past two decades and identified through databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Only English-language studies involving human subjects were included. The findings reveal that cognitive distortions, such as catastrophizing and attentional bias, along with affective disturbances, such as anxiety and depression, are consistently associated with heightened pain perception and poorer recovery. Maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and reduced activity further contribute to disability. Patient satisfaction and treatment efficacy are strongly influenced by the alignment of expectations and the quality of provider communication. Integrated theoretical models, including the biopsychosocial model, fear-avoidance theory, and mindfulness-based approaches, offer a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing chronic pain. These psychosocial mechanisms highlight the importance of patient-centered strategies that address cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal dimensions. Future research should prioritize underrepresented groups, such as older adults, low-income populations, and culturally diverse communities, and focus on scalable theory-driven interventions tailored to their needs.",

Thematic analysis revealed themes related to general changes after retirement, including shifts in identity, the desire to balance social connection and alone time, as well as themes concerning factors that shape solitude experiences, such as personal autonomy and financial stability. While some participants embraced solitude as an opportunity for personal growth and well-being, others faced challenges such as boredom and isolation.

Our analyses revealed that participants (n = 210 from the US/UK) with higher subjective well-being, particularly those with more frequent positive affect, generated thoughts semantically more similar to 'friend,' but not to 'money.' A similar pattern was also found in an independent sample (n = 350 from South Korea), showing consistency of the findings across different cultural contexts. Notably, the semantic similarity of participants’ generated thoughts to 'friend' predicted the extent to which participants prioritized social relationships over monetary gains in a realistic dilemma task.

Private practice mental health providers (i.e., psychologists, marriage and family therapists, mental health counselors, and social workers) completed an online survey containing two behavioral economic tasks. In the Criteria Ranking Task, providers (n = 326) ranked their most important barriers to not accepting insurance, reporting insufficient reimbursement rates as the most important, followed by administrative burdens. In the Hypothetical Demand Task, providers indicated the likelihood of accepting Medicare at various reimbursement rate increases with and without hypothetical administrative assistance. Doctoral providers (n = 188) reported considering accepting insurance if reimbursement rates increased 83% (Pmax = $188.97), while master’s-level providers (n = 112) reported 118% (Pmax = $168.51). If provided administrative assistance, participants indicated they would accept insurance following 100% rate increases (Pmax = $206.28) for doctoral providers and 169% rate increases (Pmax = $207.90) for master’s-level providers. Results support existing research findings that insufficient reimbursement rates and administrative burdens are the primary barriers to mental health providers accepting insurance.

HRRs and HRR-like representations have been used to model human\nmemory, to model understanding analogies, and to model the semantics of natural\nlanguage. However, in previous research, HRRs are restricted to storing and retrieving\nvectors of random numbers, limiting both the ability of HRRs to model human\nperformance in detail, and the potential applications of HRRs. We delve into the theory of\nHRRs and develop techniques to store and retrieve images, or other kinds of structured\ndata, in an HRR.

I evaluate each model’s ability to account for consistency effects, serial effects, syllable effects, and phonological effects. Consistency effects pose a problem for the rule-based pronunciation of the DRC. Serial effects pose a problem for the purely parallel PDP models. Phonological effects pose a problem for all models save CDP. All models suffer from the distribution problem, weakening each model’s ability to learn spelling-to-sound relationships. LEX is the only model that handles polysyllabic words. As none of the models provide a complete answer to the question of ‘how do we read?’, ‘how do we pronounce?’, or ‘how do we recognize words?’, I outline a set of principles as guidelines for future model development. Models of reading should learn, include a visual attention mechanism, be sensitive to phonology, and account for meaning and spelling in addition to recognizing words and pronouncing them.",

Over the years, mediation analysis has become one of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences.

We review common mediation models and discuss various approaches for estimation and inference, including their implementation in software packages. Moreover, we present robust alternatives, thereby clarifying different notions of robustness. We further consider a setting where the mediation model holds in a latent space but where measurement issues create deviations from normality assumptions in the observed variable space, which is a setting not commonly considered in the literature on robust mediation analysis, and we obtain preliminary results via a simulation study. Finally, we highlight the mechanics and relevance of robust methods in an an illustrative empirical application.",

However, most existing research has examined these associations using single parenting behaviors or predefined parenting styles, thereby neglecting the complex co-occurrence of different parenting practices. To address this limitation, the present study applied a person-centered approach using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify distinct parenting profiles and explore their associations with child socioemotional skills. Based on reports of parenting behavior from parents of N = 254 kindergarten children (51.2% female, M = 6.0 years, SD = 0.62), three parenting profiles emerged: supportive (66%), engaged-disciplinary (22%), and harsh (12%). Associations with teacher-rated outcomes showed that children exposed to engaged-disciplinary parenting displayed more peer problems. In comparison, children assigned to the harsh parenting group showed more behavioral problems and, unexpectedly, stronger emotion regulation skills. The findings underscore the need to tailor support to specific subgroups of parents with distinct parenting behaviors, to strengthen positive parenting behaviors, and, in turn, promote the development of children.",

          "abstract": "To navigate the ever-changing and information-overladen environment it is crucial to selectively process relevant information and ignore distraction. Recently, the salient-signal-suppression hypothesis has stimulated much research and theoretical debates in attention research. It claims that – under certain conditions – salient distractors are suppressed at the search-guiding priority map and therefore speed-up search as compared to neutral (non-suppressed) non-targets. An alternative interpretation claims that these salient distractors are simply ignored. Using a novel paradigm to control search order and measure search speed, we here provide evidence that this speed-up is neither due to suppression on the priority map nor simple ignoring, but instead due to speeded processing and rejection of the salient distractor relative to each non-target. In particular, we show that the speed-up occurs only when the distractor is processed before the target and that distractor processing takes less time than processing a non-target. These findings not only call into question the predominant explanations of the distractor-speed-up effect and thereby shed new light on the attentional-capture debate, but also provide striking evidence that not all searches are guided by the priority map.",

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, a total of 207 individuals were selected as the study sample through convenience sampling, considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. The research instruments included Neff’s Self-Compassion Scale (2003), the Belief in a Just World Scale for self and others developed by Sutton and Douglas (2005), and the Proactive Coping Inventory by Greenglass et al. (1999).\nFindings: The results indicated that proactive coping significantly influenced all components of self-compassion: it had negative effects on self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification, while showing positive effects on self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Moreover, proactive coping exerted a positive and significant effect on all three dimensions of belief in a just world.\nConclusion: These findings provide valuable insights for professionals working with hemodialysis patients. By addressing and strengthening psychological factors such as proactive coping, tailored interventions can be designed to improve patients’ quality of life.",

While these tools can amplify productivity, they risk eroding the cognitive foundations of expertise by simulating the very tasks through which scientific competence is developed, from synthesis to experimental design to writing.

To counter this, we propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills—strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration—that constitute a new form of scientific literacy distinct from traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we propose how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy.

          "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that anorexia nervosa (AN) may be characterized by subtle alterations in learning that could relate to symptom maintenance and treatment outcomes. However, findings in this area have been mixed, and there have been few efforts to date to summarize this literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to analyze existing literature that tested different facets of learning in samples of individuals with AN compared to other groups. In line with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an initial search in April 2024 on PSYCInfo and PubMed and an updated search in July 2025, yielding an initial sample of 1,831 articles, of which 194 were fully assessed for eligibility. Our final review included 130 articles; coding, extraction, and synthesis of results occurred from April 2024 to August 2025. Included studies predominantly were cross-sectional in nature, tested group differences between those actively ill with AN and control subjects who had no history of psychopathology, and used neuropsychological tasks primarily gauging episodic learning (e.g., verbal or visuospatial learning) or associative learning (e.g., reversal learning). Qualitative synthesis of these findings suggests that while there appear to be alterations in learning among individuals with AN compared to controls, the significance and specific pattern of learning differences is inconsistent. It is likely that heterogeneity exists within AN and other eating disorders across development, stage of illness, and clinical phenotypes. Future research that begins to characterize meaningful heterogeneity and adopts methods such as computational modeling may offer promising methods for improving the characterization of and treatments for this devastating condition.",

Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts.

          "abstract": "This essay employs a critical cultural analysis to examine Beres Hammond’s Putting Up Resistance as a thematically complete reggae composition. Grounded in Afro-Caribbean philosophy, Black radical thought, and Rastafarian epistemology, the analysis positions the song not merely as entertainment but as a cultural text and sonic archive of resistance. By engaging with Hammond’s lyrics, delivery, and thematic structure, the paper argues that the song exemplifies reggae’s emancipatory ethos through its synthesis of systemic critique, emotional and familial love, and a spirit of resilience. Methodologically, the paper combines lyrical close reading with historical and philosophical contextualisation, drawing on Caribbean and diasporic cultural studies to highlight reggae’s role as both critique and affirmation. Autobiographical reflection is incorporated not as a confession but as a methodological stance consistent with postpositivist traditions, situating the scholar within the interpretive framework of Caribbean intellectual praxis. Ultimately, Putting Up Resistance is presented as more than a song: it is a site of lived cultural production and a testament to reggae’s continuing capacity to articulate hope, resistance, and communal survival in the face of ongoing injustice.\nKeywords: Reggae music, Cultural resistance, Rastafarian epistemology, Caribbean cultural studies, Afro-Caribbean philosophy",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and risk volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that options are equity bonds. Our examples show how to compute a firm’s debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theory.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We suggest that the risk-free rate approximately reflects the expected inflation effect, and that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or investment opportunity cost. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a factor constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics represent the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets.",

          "authors": "Kazuhito Kitamura",
          "abstract": "Persistent macroeconomic imbalances, long‑run deflation, and entrenched inequality are often interpreted as outcomes of market incompleteness or failures. This paper offers an alternative perspective by developing a dynamic equilibrium framework for open economies that incorporates asset‑side mechanisms. Within this framework, and by re‑examining the transversality condition (TVC) as an asset‑valuation criterion, such persistent imbalances can emerge as structural outcomes of optimal behavior rather than anomalies. The model yields the relationship:Rt-ρ=n+Da-U(θa)/Uc; This relationship shows that the gap between the asset return (Rt) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the combined effects of capital diffusion (Da), population growth (n) and preference terms (U(θa)/Uc). This reinterpretation explains how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist, and frames equilibrium as a dynamic configuration shaped by interdependence across economies and agents, beyond the traditional price‑clearing mechanism. The results align theory with observed realities and offer tools for policy design, including structural selection of the steady state, policy control of capital flows, and asset‑dynamics‑based policy reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "This paper, based on three research vignettes featuring methodological reflections from visual and multisensory research on international migrations conducted in Norway and Poland, introduces the concept of multisensory positionality. Grounded in the theoretical discussions around positionality developed in migration studies (Anthias 2002, 2008, 2020; Yuval-Davis 2006), and supported by sensuous scholarship (Stoller 2010; Howes 2020), multisensory positionality is a holistic, intersectional approach that recognises the body and senses as crucial aspects of positionality for both the researcher and participants. The paper highlights how these embodied experiences actively shape the negotiation of meaning between people and spaces, both in a research context and as part of the migration experience. As an analytical concept, multisensory positionality addresses the opportunities and limitations arising from the embodied, multisensory experiences of the research participants. It bridges migration and sensory studies by situating the sensory aspects of people’s identities within their broader life-worlds, including the impact of structures and power relations. \nKeywords: Multisensory Positionality, Migration, Positionality, Creative Research, Visual Methodologies.",

          "authors": "Bas Chatel; Geeske Peeters; Marcel Olde Rikkert; Vítor V. Vasconcelos",
          "abstract": "Loneliness is a growing public health concern with a wide-range of impacts on mental and physical well-being. While most interventions adopt a uniform, one-size-fits-all approach, emerging evidence suggests that the effectiveness of loneliness interventions depends on individual psychological traits and the structure of social environments. Previous work has shown that mental health outcomes are shaped not only by personal vulnerabilities but also by complex feedback processes embedded in social networks. However, it remains unclear which types of interventions work best for which individuals, and how social context modulates these effects. We develop and apply an agent-based model that simulates mental health on a continuum with loneliness as a latent state at its lower end. The model is shaped by baseline resilience, self-reinforcement, and social influence mechanisms, across a realistic synthetic population. We target these mechanisms for specific individuals and varying proportions of their social networks. Outcomes for the individual and sequential neighbors are compared to a counterfactual. We use a random forest model and compute SHAP values that identify which features of the individuals and their social networks predict intervention success.\nWe show that interventions improving baseline resilience consistently benefit individuals, particularly those with low socioeconomic status embedded in moderately diverse networks. In contrast, interventions targeting self-reinforcement or peer influence exhibit greater variability and may produce adverse effects in overly homogeneous or fragmented contexts. Surprisingly, classical network centrality metrics fail to explain these patterns; instead, similarity in baseline and mental health traits across social layers emerges as a strong predictor of intervention efficacy.\nThese findings suggest that personalization based on social and psychological similarity is more informative than topological metrics when designing interventions for loneliness. The results challenge assumptions about “scaling up” interventions and highlight the importance of tailoring to social context and individual vulnerability. \nMore broadly, our approach demonstrates how computational models  can capture the complex interplay between individual traits and cumulative, self-consistent social feedbacks, offering a concrete framework for designing socially aware, targeted public health interventions.",

          "abstract": "Social norms, understood as shared expectations of appropriate behavior, can help resolve collective action problems by making salient collectively beneficial equilibria. However, achieving long-lasting behavior of this type has so far challenged policymakers. To make progress, we need a deeper understanding of the dynamics of people’s normative expectations regarding collectively beneficial behaviors. This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment to collect panel data on individuals’ normative expectations regarding contributions in a public goods (PG) game. Using the Krupka &amp; Weber’s 2013 method, we elicit participants’ normative expectations at three stages: before playing a repeated standard PG game, after completing the repeated PG game, and after playing a repeated PG game with social incentives activated through the threat of exclusion from non-financial group activities. By comparing these stages, we examine whether and how experienced group behavior in PG games within two distinct structured social contexts—one without and one with social incentives—shapes individuals’ normative expectations. Our findings indicate heterogeneity in how social norms are perceived and how normative expectations change in response to experienced group behaviors in the PG games. Normative expectations for socially beneficial actions tend to emerge when such group behavior conveys a normative signal (i.e., when non-financial social incentives lead to increased and sustained contributions), particularly when the social norm is initially perceived as being loose. This work contributes to the growing body of research on social norms by offering experimental evidence that advances our understanding of the factors that determine beneficial normative change.",

At the\nmicro-level, parental socialization of traditional gender values significantly shapes girls’ participation\nbut only partially mediates cultural legacy influences from origin countries.

          "abstract": "The substantial number of food-insecure households in Nigeria and the problem of regional and socioeconomic disparities in food security are raising issues of food system transformation and justice. While knowledge of the gap is of public interest, the empirical validation of the gap is scant and the components of the gap linked to differences in socioeconomic characteristics and income inequality have not been investigated for Nigeria. This paper investigated the socioeconomic disparity in food security and a child’s diet quality. The specific objectives were (1) to profile the socioeconomic inequalities in food security and a child’s diet quality, and (2) to determine the relationship between food insecurity and a child’s dietary quality. The study employed Round 6 of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS6) data for Nigeria. A model was specified using a two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression and analyzed using Stata MP Version 14. Results revealed 80.53% of households were food insecure, with a more pronounced estimate for the rural sector (81.95%) compared to the urban sector (78.08%). This was found to be statistically significant. As wealth ranking of households increased from poorest to richest, the proportion of households in food insecurity declined for the rural sample and for the pooled. The regression result showed that food insecurity decreased the likelihood of children having a quality diet and was statistically significant for rural areas and for the pooled sample (National). Thus, promoting programmes that enhance food access, availability, and utilization, targeted at the rural and urban poor, as well as diverse diets for children, are paramount",

Based on original survey data collected from 2019 to 2022 (three pooled cross-sections, random samples of the adult population), the study reveals substantial social (by class) and political (by partisanship) divides regarding how redistributive ambitious and socially inclusive the welfare state should be, challenging assumptions of strong sociopolitical consensus. Welfare chauvinism is found to be more politically divisive than approval of income differences, with the sharpest divides emerging in the exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness held by voters of the non-mainstream (radical) right party, the Sweden Democrats. The results suggest that conflicts over inclusivist versus exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness could become central in Swedish politics, potentially shifting away from the universalist principles that underpin its social democratic welfare state model.",

Overall, the paper found that labour use in the farm sector was 17% less productive than labour in the nonfarm sector.  From the regression results, factors such as years of schooling, age as a measure of experience, household size, land size, access to social infrastructure and urbanization, and technical change contributed to driving the labour productivity gap in rural Nigeria. From the results, education, social capital, and infrastructure matter for labour productivity and earnings convergence between farm and nonfarm sectors.

The objective is to uncover potential cultural narrative risks and pathways of external influence. Methodologically, the study combines Competitive Hypothesis Analysis (CHA) with red team logic modelling, embedding the STEMPLES framework (Symbols, Timing, Events, Information, Processes, Leadership, Externalities, Structure) to conduct a multidimensional analysis of the event's symbolic risks, narrative imbalances, process vulnerabilities, and leadership behaviour. Findings indicate that the Wuhan University Party Committee's high-frequency exchanges with Japan between 2019 and 2025, coupled with the semi-autonomous operational mechanism of the Japanese alumni association, provided ‘soft influence pathways’ for cultural infiltration and misinterpretation of public discourse. The ‘red circle + white chair’ design, interpreted by the public as symbolising the ‘Japanese flag,’ exposed deficiencies in political sensitivity oversight during major ceremonies. Although no conclusive hostile intelligence networks or financial irregularities were identified, evidence indicates that uncontrolled symbolism and narrative gaps amplified opportunities for external narrative manipulation. In conclusion, this paper advocates establishing cross-departmental risk mitigation mechanisms to strengthen political security reviews of visual and narrative design. This should form a closed-loop system comprising ‘pre-event screening, in-process intervention, and symmetrical post-event responses’ to prevent symbolic missteps from strategic exploitation. Such measures offer valuable insights for universities' security governance in international cooperation and cultural exchange.",

          "abstract": "Master’s thesis submitted to Jagiellonian University (CEERES Erasmus Mundus MA Program), 2025. \n\nIn contemporary Poland, the politics of memory have emerged as a key site of national identity formation and political legitimacy. The Law and Justice Party (PiS) has emerged as a pivotal political force in shaping historical narratives, rendering collective memory a tool of governance, a means of exclusion, and a device for populist mobilisation. While attempts to post-communist European memory politics have continued to rise, comparative, digital, and discourse analyses of how mnemonic narratives evolve within the same political party over time remain rare. This thesis examines how PiS has served as a \"mnemonic warrior\" during the 2015 and 2023 election campaigns by analysing how narratives of victimhood, betrayal, and national purity are constructed, reinterpreted, and disseminated through both traditional and new media. Using a mixed-methods design combining Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Digital Ethnography, the study examines party manifestos, media coverage, and social media accounts. The research employs the Discourse-Historical Approach to CDA and uses tools such as 4CAT and Zeeschuimer for gathering and analysing online material. Through examination, clear consistency in PiS's practices of memory is identifiable, and these hinge upon selective victimhood, elite delegitimisation, and historical revisionism. But the 2023 campaign demonstrates an intensification of digital approaches, particularly on X (formerly Twitter), where previous stories are re-authored in emotive, moralising, and exclusionary narratives aimed at constructing a closed memory community. The study contributes to the understanding of right-wing populist actors weaponising memory to advance polarisation and suppress pluralism. It highlights the necessity of temporally comparative and interdisciplinary study of memory politics, particularly in relation to increasing influence.",

We fielded an original survey experiment to understand the ways in which a politician's response to violent threats can affect public tolerance for and perceived severity of these threats as well as support for the politician in the aftermath of the threat. We posit that after experiencing a threat of violence politicians can either (1) express their personal fear/concern regarding the threat, (2) express their strength/resilience in light of the threat, or (3) not comment on the threat. We also investigate which approach proves most impactful for women politicians, who often face heightened threats. We find that strong responses are beneficial for both men and women politicians and women face a bind as vulnerable and strong responses garner different effects on public opinion. Overall, our results provide insight into how elected officials might best respond to threats and harassment, with additional attention paid to gender differences in strategy effectiveness.",

By examining case studies from both the countries, focusing on innovation and local resources, these policies should empower communities to harness their potential, leading to sustainable economic growth and enhanced quality of life. The research aims to identify the potential factors that led to the successful implementation of cases, creating a sustainable development based on branding a cultural commodity and testing its scalability and adaptability for policy formulations in countries facing acute depopulation or considering similar initiatives to rejuvenate rural economies.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to explore an astrobiological genealogy of the concept of the\nPlanetary vividly discussed in contemporary environmental humanities and social sciences,\nand to offer a framework for an articulation of political-economic models based on this\nconcept. Following Bentley Allan, we propose to treat the Planetary as an example of\nscientific cosmology, thus emphasizing how astrobiology supports a much broader philosophical worldview that shines a new light on persistent problems related to organizing\nhuman inhabitation of the Earth. Starting with the analysis and speculative elaboration\non Allan’s theory of cosmological shifts in international orders during Western modernity,\nwe associate the Anthropocene discourse as an inaugurating moment in the consolidation of the Planetary’s scientific cosmology, grounded in the astrobiology’s metabolic perspective on complex adaptive systems. The narrative of the paper offers a genealogy of\nthis perspective, including the most recent research about information metabolisms and\nbiosphere-technosphere coupling in astrobiology, which paves the way for the explanation\nof the economy itself as a metabolic entity. After the review of adjacent philosophical positions associated with ecological economics and the theory of complex adaptive systems,\nthe paper concludes with remarks on the Planetary as a cornerstone of an international\norder that yields economic imperatives governed by a generic view of the Earth as a member of a potentially large and diverse category of habitable planets.",

          "abstract": "Studies about the transition to a circular economy (CE) often focus on high-level questions of resource use and consumption, addressing questions of technical innovation and industrial production. Yet a transition to a circular economy is a societal issue. In this study, we respond to criticisms that the CE often portrays individuals as passive user-consumers, and investigate how smaller-scale actors - people working in the CE at the local level - are engaging in the transition. We present findings from empirical data gathered through thirty semi-structured interviews with professional CE practitioners working in public (local government), private (SMEs – small-medium sized enterprises) and third sector (charities/social enterprises) organisations in the UK. Drawing on insights from sustainability transitions and intermediary actors, we find that individuals working within organisations and small businesses adopt a role as intermediary actors at the smaller scale. We call these actors ‘everyday intermediaries’ and demonstrate how they take on a role to mediate the CE to wider society, working to connect actors, resources and skills across the CE, and to translate the behaviours and practices necessary for a successful transition to CE to the everyday context. We add to the growing body of literature about the contributions of social science in understanding the transition to the CE and empirically demonstrate the active and engaged role of smaller-scale actors in bringing change.",

We examined whether different climate beliefs, the cognitive component of climate anxiety, were associated with symptoms of psychological distress. We also tested whether political efficacy moderated the potential associations between climate beliefs and psychological distress, as perceptions of inadequate government response may amplify climate anxiety. We applied longitudinal data and cross-lagged panel network models in the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N =61,761). Our results showed that 1) the association between climate beliefs and psychological distress was bidirectional, 2) belief in consequences was most clearly associated with increased distress while associations between beliefs in responsibility and inevitability and the distress symptoms were more mixed, and 3) those who perceived that individuals can affect political decisions seemed to be most vulnerable to the negative effects of climate crisis on mental health.",

          "abstract": "The risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) is closely tied to attitudes justifying IPV at individual, couple and societal levels. We analysed how women’s IPV risk varies with their own and their spouse’s attitudes, local community acceptance and country-level gender equality. Using data from 148,421 couples across 30 low- and middle-income countries and 34 Indian states, we estimated Bayesian regression models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with uninformative priors. IPV justification and IPV experience varied significantly across and within countries. Women’s risk was more strongly associated with their own attitudes than with their husbands’ attitudes. Community-level justification independently increased risk, while higher country-level gender equality was linked to lower IPV exposures. The association between neighbourhood norms and women’s risk was moderated by spousal attitudes, with the association strongest among couples in which neither partner justified IPV. Country-level gender equality consistently reduced women’s risk regardless of couples’ attitudes. These findings suggest that focusing solely on couples where husbands perpetrate IPV is insufficient. Sustainable prevention efforts must also address community norms and structural gender inequality.",

We use three LLMs to measure the degree of incivility and character attacks used by each candidate, and provide evidence of the validity of these measures. We find that both incivility and (especially) character attacks are robustly associated with lower vote share, controlling for factors found to be relevant to these elections in prior research and several new factors including LLM measures of ideological extremism and populism. The effects continue to be significant with controls for early and mid-campaign polls, indicating the negative relationship between hostile rhetoric and vote share does not just reflect underdog candidates strategically going negative early in campaigns.",

          "authors": "Valeriia Hett; Didier Ruedin",
          "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to present initial findings from an ongoing empirical study of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, living under temporary protection Status S, notably their socio-economic integration, interaction with public services, and future aspirations. Data are drawn from an ad-hoc online survey started in March 2025, which includes N=1470 participants to date and demonstrates reasonable levels of representativeness across demographic and labour indicators. Findings indicate that despite the persistent uncertainty and structural limitations imposed by the temporary legal framework, many Ukrainian refugees are actively seeking employment, learning local languages and participating in education. These trajectories reflect not only functional participation in host society government structures, but also strategic forms of adaptation under conditions of legal ambiguity. The absence of a clear path to permanent residence does not stop integration efforts, but it influences their form, embedding them within a framework of temporariness and limited planning horizons. At the same time a lack of accessible and consistent information, particularly regarding administrative procedures and about support services, continues to be a significant barrier. In practice, however, Ukrainian refugees tend to compensate for institutional complexity through informal networks and self-navigation strategies. While more respondents express a desire to remain in Switzerland, their capacity to plan for the future is fundamentally shaped by the temporary and conditional nature of their legal status. Although Swiss institutional resources are generally perceived as more trustworthy than Ukrainian ones when it comes to accessing support, many refugees face barriers in reaching these sources, including linguistic and administrative complexity. The inability to access stable, long-term institutional frameworks reinforces a mode of existence defined by limited predictability and fragmented engagement with the state. These preliminary findings contribute to understanding how temporary protection operates not only as a legal category, but also a socio-political condition that determines access, restricts belonging and structures the temporal and institutional aspects of movement.",

          "authors": "Fabian Rüsenberg; Nadine Fleischhut",
          "abstract": "Climate services and co-production efforts aim to support adaptation by making climate information useful and usable. Yet many services and research projects prioritize improving data quality over understanding decision-making needs. This limits insights into what we define as true demand: the actionable need for information that would improve decisions, if conditions allowed. Here, we present a systematic sectoral analysis grounded in behavioral theory exploring whether, where, and how better climate predictions could improve decisions. We apply this approach to two climate-sensitive sectors in Germany: agriculture and forestry. Using expert focus groups (N = 24), we identify key adaptation decisions and analyze current decision strategies. Drawing on the COM-B model for behavior (B) change, we examine the capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M) necessary to use climate predictions in practice. Our findings reveal that foresighted adaptation is often constrained by gaps in knowledge, lack of opportunity, or limited motivation. These constraints diminish the perceived importance of climate predictions on the subseasonal to decadal timescale or prevent their use, with decision-makers instead relying on past experience and heuristics such as worst-case planning. Nevertheless, experts expressed interest in improved predictions---particularly for variability and extremes across intra-annual to multi-year timescales---that could inform decisions. True demand may remain masked, blocked, or unexpressed if decision-makers lack the capabilities, opportunities, or motivation to recognize, act on, or articulate it. Our approach provides a systematic way to assess where and how predictions could improve decisions, shifting the focus from better data to better decisions.",

          "authors": "HAO-CHUN CHENG; Philip N. Cohen",
          "abstract": "This study examines the variability of age at first marriage across birth cohorts, genders, education levels, and races. The argument for the deinstitutionalization of formal marriage suggests that formal marriage has become more individualized over the past few decades, and people have more autonomy in deciding the timing of their first marriage as the cultural conformity pertaining to marriage as an institution decline. This may contribute to a growing variability of age at first marriage in recent cohorts. However, as the process of deinstitutionalization differs across genders, education levels, and races, the changes in cultural conformity regarding formal marriage may also differ, leading to divergent changes in the variability of age at first marriage among these social groups. Using the 2008-23 American Community Survey (ACS) data (n=13,737,325) and OLS regression models, our results show a U-shaped trend over cohorts: the variability was least diverse among cohorts born between 1925 and 1949. In addition, we find an interaction effect of gender and race. Further, highly educated people tend to have less variability in marriage age than those with less education. This study contributes to our understanding of the heterogeneous changes in cultural conformity regarding the timing of first marriage and the deinstitutionalization of formal marriage in the United States.",

In five replication studies, we found limited evidence of persuasive effects of three highly cited strategies (N=3,216). We then conducted a registered report megastudy (N=13,544) testing the effects of the 10 most-cited climate change messaging strategies on Americans’ pro-environmental attitudes and behavior. Six messages significantly affected multiple preregistered attitudes, though effects were small (≤ 15% of the Democratic-Republican gap) and similar in magnitude across messages. Persuasiveness varied little across party lines, contradicting theories predicting heterogeneous effects for targeted messages. No message increased pro-environmental donations, highlighting the challenge of influencing costly behaviors through messaging alone. The most impactful messages influenced multiple mediating variables, limiting identification of the specific mechanisms driving effects. Taken together, these results identify several persuasive strategies, yet also highlight important limits of short-form messages for increasing Americans’ support for action to address climate change.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how Filipino TikTok users negotiate the viral “Diploma o Diskarte” debate through humor, revealing ambivalence as a constitutive modality of digital participation. Using multimodal critical discourse analysis of widely circulated videos and reception analysis of audience comments, we show that diskarte—Filipino resourceful agency—is neither a fixed trait nor a simple binary of compliance and resistance. Instead, it emerges as a communicative repertoire enacted across a continuum of survivalist, strategic, relational, entrepreneurial, and subversive practices. Humor operates as both critique and camouflage, allowing users to surface structural inequities while preserving social harmony. From these patterns, we inductively generate the Diskarte Continuum Framework, a culturally grounded model that theorizes ambivalence as central to communicative agency in precarious conditions. By foregrounding vernacular epistemologies, this study demonstrates how qualitative theorizing from the Global South advances broader debates in communication about media ambivalence, agency, and digital culture.",

          "abstract": "A quarter of a century has passed since the late Terry Crowley summed up the academic consensus that the creole language Bislama poses no immediate threat to any of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. Does this remain true today? Since that time, evidence both quantitative and qualitative has been accumulating that indicates Bislama is indeed gaining ground at the expense of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. In a targeted review of this evidence, this article brings together and assesses the insights of linguists, ethnographers, and others on the causal mechanisms that explain an ongoing shift towards Bislama. It thereby provides both a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and a provisional causal framework for understanding current threats, predicting future threats and, potentially, intervening to prevent future threats. Language endangerment and extinction is a global issue with devastating implications for communities worldwide—one which Vanuatu, the world’s most linguistically diverse country, has thus far remained resilient in the face of. However, this review of the available evidence warns that Bislama will continue to disrupt intergenerational transmission of Indigenous languages unless a suite of inter-related mechanisms can be counteracted.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on three large-scale pre-registered survey experiments (N=3516) in the UK, this article investigates how perceived asylum-seeking legality, public preferences for refugee relocation, and inclusionary attitudes are shaped by symbolic and strategic boundaries. We first show that the authenticity of identity documents, identity markers, flight reasons, origin, and family ties drive perceived legality. The second experiment reveals that relocating refugees to participants’ local areas while maintaining high levels of residential segregation dampens willingness to welcome them. Further, respondents differentially welcome refugees depending on their origin, occupation, religion, and language skills. We term this layered moral calculus “bounded humanitarianism”, illustrating how symbolic boundaries translate into social and spatial exclusions. Finally, through a third experiment, we test two interventions: perspective-taking and loss-framed cost-information, finding that only perspective-taking boosts support for asylum seekers’ rights (e.g., right to work and expedited decisions), whereas loss-framed information treatment fails to reshape inclusionary attitudes. Our findings bridge boundary-making theory and asylum policies by showing how symbolic boundaries around identity and meritocratic worth shape attitudes towards asylum seekers and refugees and how perspective-taking interventions can challenge the potential exclusions.",

Using a large language model, we analyze video transcripts from social media platform Parler, measuring message intensity across four domains: hostility to outgroups, claims of conservative injustice, negative emotions, and violence. We link these to county-level right-wing event data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project. Event-history analysis using proportional hazard models estimated the effects on right-wing activity rates in U.S. counties, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and other demographic factors. The results support our conjecture that counties with more intense postings across all four domains would have significantly higher rates of right-wing activity.",

Prior to the rise of generative AI, automation primarily affected routine-intensive occupations, driving employment polarisation and disproportionately exposing certain groups—particularly women—to displacement risks. While training can mitigate these risks by facilitating reskilling, access is highly unequal: employer-sponsored programs often favour workers whose skills complement technology, and mothers face additional constraints due to time poverty from unpaid care. Using the 2022 EU Labour Force Survey Job Skills module covering 26 European countries, we investigate how exposure to automation influences training participation, with a focus on gender and motherhood. We further explore whether access to formal childcare alleviates barriers to training and reduces participation gaps.",

Ecotourism is seen as a solution towards balancing development and environmental conservation. I investigate the potential for effective ecotourism initiatives and alternative livelihood options that cause minimum damage to the local environment and promote greater understanding of indigenous cultures among tourists from across the world. \nI identify four major activities that include nature based tourism, homestays, trekking and \nsale of handicrafts and other locally made items. To understand the challenges involved in implementing some of these initiatives, I also visited successful sites in Sikkim and West Bengal to study their best practices. The complexities of each activity and the potential challenges uncovered through this study demonstrate the need for detailed field research on ecotourism potential before their actual implementation.",

          "abstract": "How has the nationalization of news consumption changed the general sentiment received by news consumers? This study examines the sentiment differences between local and national newspaper coverage in the United States from 2000 to 2019. Using a sample of front-page articles from 12 local newspapers across different circulation tiers and 3 national newspapers, the research analyzes sentiment scores and issue coverage. I find that local newspapers, especially those with smaller circulations, consistently employ a more positive tone compared to national newspapers overall and on specific issues. Contrary to expectations, local newspapers became more positive over time, widening the sentiment gap with national outlets. The study suggests that the decline of local news and increased reliance on national sources may expose readers to more negative content overall. These findings have implications for understanding how changes in the media landscape could impact public perceptions and civic engagement. They also suggest greater attention should be paid to low-circulation local newspaper, who are often excluded from content analyses of local news.",

          "abstract": "Relational values, care, and stewardship actions fundamentally shape human-wildlife coexistence, yet there is a gap between understanding and explicitly incorporating these approaches in conservation practice. \nIn this study, we co-produce a relational framework with various research partners, including Indigenous communities, to demonstrate how relational values and care can be more effectively understood and applied through conservation policy/strategy.  \nThis study adopts a relational approach, acknowledging the diverse values, perceptions, and interactions that shape coexistence. Using a transdisciplinary methodology, the study examines human-wildlife coexistence in two contrasting social-ecological systems in South Africa: the Garden Route and the Kalahari. We engage local actors as research partners and develop participatory workshops, collaborative timelines, and focus group discussions to identify the relational values underpinning coexistence, explicitly focusing on the dimensions of care, knowledge, and agency associated with stewardship actions. \nDistinct stewardship positions emerged, reflecting different visions of human-wildlife interactions and conservation. Indigenous research partners notably highlighted transformative stewardship, promoting an inclusive worldview that integrates humans and wildlife through mutual respect and cultural recognition. Conversely, other research partners demonstrated varied stewardship positions ranging from adaptive to sustainability-focused action.\nThe findings underscore the need to explicitly incorporate relational values and care dimensions into conservation strategies, highlighting their potential to enhance legitimacy, credibility, and effectiveness in addressing social-ecological complexity. This relational framework supports practical, inclusive, and context-sensitive conservation actions that consider and leverage the diversity of human-nature relationships.",

Rather than treating algorithms as neutral tools, it situates them as infrastructures that co-produce desire, mediate affect, and govern social relations across labor, consumption, and everyday interaction. Drawing on historical genealogies, ethnographic insights, and conceptual innovation, the article introduces new terms—ontological modulation, preemptive intimacy, algorithmic atmospheres, probabilistic description, computational affect, and ethical resonance—to capture the lived experience of computational mediation. It argues for anthropology’s critical role in understanding algorithms as constitutive of social worlds, demanding fresh theoretical and methodological vocabularies.",

          "abstract": "Technological innovations have signaled a shift in the journalistic field, enabling a wider\nrange of actors to participate in public discourses and challenge the hegemonic power\nstructures of traditional journalism from the outside. Consequently, historical notions of\nalternative media have expanded to encompass a variety of new actors within and beyond the\nboundaries of the journalistic field, with some explicitly claiming to focus on issues of\ndiversity. This study examines the role orientations of peripheral journalistic actors who\nprioritize journalistic diversity in their work. It also explores how they use their role\norientations to position themselves within the journalistic field and its periphery. Based on 18\nin-depth interviews with Austrian peripheral actors, the study finds that while their role\norientations diverge from those of more traditional media, they share similarities with\nlongstanding normative ideas of progressive alternative media. Further, they employ their\ncognitive and normative role orientations as boundary markers to distinguish themselves from\nthe practices of more traditional media.",

Prior to the rise of generative AI, automation primarily affected routine-intensive occupations, driving employment polarisation and disproportionately exposing certain groups—particularly women—to displacement risks. While training can mitigate these risks by facilitating reskilling, access is highly unequal: employer-sponsored programs often favour workers whose skills complement technology, and mothers face additional constraints due to time poverty from unpaid care. Using the 2022 EU Labour Force Survey Job Skills module covering 26 European countries, we investigate how exposure to automation influences training participation, with a focus on gender and motherhood. We further explore whether access to formal childcare alleviates barriers to training and reduces participation gaps.",

Activist organizations have emerged from cybercriminal networks, including subversive groups that intervene in international affairs and espouse radical political ideas. To explain this phenomenon, I argue that hacking networks can become politically activated through individual interaction within the context of networks. I develop a theory of political mobilization in illicit digital networks, which explains how strong ties can form in the context of online and anonymized settings. To test this argument, I build a novel dataset of website defacements conducted by hacking groups. I construct this dataset by scraping over 394,000 self-reported defacements. Using these data, I show how political ideas and activities diffuse through hackers’ social networks. This research contributes to our understanding of how political activity emerges from online networks, showing that illicit digital activity can foster political mobilization and radicalization.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories are widespread, varied, and socially consequential. While research has identified psychological and social correlates of conspiracy endorsement, debate continues over whether there is a general predisposition toward conspiratorial thinking and whether it should be treated as pathological. We argue that dominant theoretical efforts overlook the cultural dynamics that sustain conspiratorial worldviews. By reviewing empirical and philosophical work, we propose that conspiracy theories are best understood as culturally evolved epistemologies—frameworks that can prescribe what counts as evidence, who is trustworthy, and how to handle disconfirmation. Drawing on cultural evolutionary theory and network psychometrics, we show how this perspective can explain the persistence of conspiracy subcultures, their diversity, and their integration with broader belief systems. Finally, we discuss how artificial intelligence can accelerate the spread of conspiracy narratives, increasingly become the subject of new conspiracy theories, and at the same time offer novel tools for mapping, analyzing, and countering them.",

          "abstract": "This is working paper and I would like to find collaborators with data for future papers. \n\nDespite the growing relevance of digital platforms, many academics remain hesitant to fully embrace social media for scholarly communication. Institutional discouragement, limited time, privacy concerns, misinformation, reputational risks, and fears of cancellation or censorship are among the key barriers.\n\nThis reluctance represents a missed opportunity, especially for institutions with limited resources. Universities without repositories, those unable to afford expensive journal subscriptions, struggling to support open-access publishing, or lacking dedicated communications staff could benefit significantly from the accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and global reach of social media.\n\nThis paper presents an international literature review, drawing insights from editorials and scholarly articles. It highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of social media as a rapid and effective tool for disseminating scientific knowledge.\n\nThree case studies, including two research projects at the University of Cambridge, demonstrate the potential of social media to mobilise findings and amplify research impact.

          "abstract": "The article offers an integrated historical–philosophical reconstruction of the evolution of the philosophy of science from its ancient foundations to post- nonclassical and contemporary approaches in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). It shows how the ontology/epistemology/axiology triad structures the field, while successive methodological paradigms (rationalism, empiricism, positivism, neo- Kantianism, logical empiricism/neo-positivism, and post-positivism) repeatedly rearticulate the criteria of scientificity. Particular attention is paid to global evolutionism and synergetic as integrative frameworks for understanding open, non- linear, and far-from-equilibrium systems. The analysis argues that digital transformation and the diffusion of AI require a clarified ontology of cognition, a principled distinction between computation and thinking, and an ethical infrastructure (virtue ethics, responsibility, relationality, and algorithmic participation) to safeguard human dignity within hybrid human–algorithm decision loops. The practical upshot is an orientation toward explainability, reproducibility, accountability, and open procedures of truth assessment that secure science as a public practice rather than a collection of statistically adequate outputs.",

Extending previous research providing mixed findings on mathematical and verbal competencies after age 5, we examine cognitive and non-cognitive child development between ages three and nine. Results from OLS-models show small but statistically significant associations between mothers’ highly specialised, analytical job skills and children’s vocabulary scores, while links with math, science, and socio-emotional behaviour were modest. Other types of job tasks showed only small associations with any child outcome. Additional fixed-effects models provide little support that changes in maternal occupations influence child development. Overall, our findings suggest a limited role of occupation-specific skills in the intergenerational transmission of educational inequalities.",

          "abstract": "Ottoman miniature collections represent a layered cultural heritage that combines artistic, historical, social, and intellectual dimensions. Yet, access to their content is often limited by catalogue records that provide only minimal descriptive information. This discussion paper explores how computational access can expand the study and reuse of such collections by presenting a dataset of 435 Ottoman miniatures, enriched with detailed bibliographic metadata and expert-assigned thematic tags. An original multi-level classification scheme was developed. Tagging was carried out through a custom web interface, preparing the dataset for analysis through thematic network analysis, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.\nThematic co-occurrence analysis revealed clusters such as political figures, religious motifs, and urban settings, demonstrating the interpretive value of tagging beyond traditional cataloguing. Supervised learning with MobileNetV2 achieved 63% training accuracy and 49% validation accuracy, showing the model’s capacity to identify dominant themes while also exposing the limits of small and imbalanced datasets. Unsupervised clustering produced visually coherent groups, but low Silhouette scores and high Davies-Bouldin indices confirmed that thematic boundaries were not strongly separable through visual features alone.\nThe findings highlight the need to combine computational methods with expert knowledge. While supervised approaches support targeted classification and unsupervised approaches enable exploratory insights, both benefit from integration with rich metadata. This study demonstrates how Ottoman miniatures can serve as a model for applying machine learning and network analysis to cultural heritage collections, offering transferable lessons for digital humanities research.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically examines AI-driven learning personalization, identifying seven interconnected problems: technological determinism, widening educational disparities, privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, neglect of human relationships, trivialization of learning, and commercialization. These challenges represent fundamental issues affecting educational values and social equity rather than mere technical difficulties. Adopting a sociotechnical systems perspective, the study reveals that current AI-driven personalization often reflects commercial priorities over pedagogical expertise, resulting in pseudo-personalization that undermines authentic learning. The research proposes a hybrid educational model that leverages AI for basic skill acquisition while preserving human-centered aspects including creative thinking, critical analysis, and emotional support. Key recommendations include reaffirming public education values, promoting open-source educational technology, establishing educational data sovereignty, and redefining educator roles. The findings emphasize that genuine learning individualization cannot be resolved through technological solutions alone. The future of education depends on careful integration guided by educational philosophy and value judgments that prioritize human development over market-driven metrics, requiring educators to critically evaluate technology rather than accepting commercial solutions uncritically.",

          "abstract": "Using longitudinal data from the Houston Independent School District, this study examines the role of English learner (EL) status in predicting college enrollment and completion. Drawing from the sociological frameworks of categorical inequality and leveled tracking, we argue that EL status serves as a label that may limit students’ college-level course-taking in high school, specifically Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and dual credit courses, and postsecondary opportunities. We compare four groups of students: students never classified as EL, ELs who were reclassified in elementary school, ELs who were reclassified in middle school, and ELs who were reclassified in high school or never reclassified. We find that EL–never-EL gaps in postsecondary outcomes vary by the timing of reclassification, but are largely explained by sociodemographic, academic, and school-level factors. We also show that ELs reclassified in later grade levels take fewer college-level courses in high school than never-EL students and ELs reclassified in earlier grade levels. Finally, through nonlinear variance decomposition, we determine that a substantial portion of EL gaps in postsecondary outcomes is explained by EL gaps in college-level course-taking during high school. We conclude by sharing potential strategies from district staff that may enable EL students to complete college-level coursework during high school, with the goal of expanding their postsecondary opportunities.",

Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

          "authors": "Aziz Tuffi Saliba; Mariana Ferolla Vallandro do Valle",
          "abstract": "In the time since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several states have closed their borders and imposed travel restrictions to contain the proliferation of the disease, which, in turn, has left hundreds of thousands of people unable to return to their countries of nationality or residence. This Article analyzes the compatibility of these measures with the right to return to one's country and the right to family and private life, to the extent that these rights may obligate states to allow a person to reenter a country. Part I analyzes who is entitled to claim said rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European and American Conventions on Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. After this delimitation, this Part further assesses how international travel restrictions adopted in response to the pandemic interfere with these rights, as well as what obligations states have to secure them. Part II evaluates whether these interferences might qualify as lawful limitations and derogations under human rights law and concludes that they most likely do not. The satisfaction of the requirement of necessity, indispensable for lawful limitations and derogations, is disputable, since the scientific evidence available does not seem to support the efficiency of travel bans in containing the spread of disease. Moreover, there are several cases of persons stranded for long periods or in dire material conditions, putting into question the proportionality of these measures. There is thus a strong case for invoking state responsibility in these situations.",

          "abstract": "Kenya stands at a critical demographic inflection point, transitioning from a young, rapidly growing population \ntoward an aging society with declining fertility rates. This paper examines the nascent demographic crisis in \nKenya through the lens of inadequate social security systems and their cascading effects on reproductive \nbehavior, family formation, and long-term economic sustainability. Drawing on comparative analysis with \nGreece, Japan, and South Korea; nations that have already experienced severe demographic transitions, this \nstudy argues that Kenya's current trajectory toward population decline represents a preventable crisis requiring \nimmediate policy intervention. Through analysis of demographic data, economic indicators, and social welfare \nstructures, this research demonstrates that strengthening social security systems represents the most effective \nintervention to reverse declining birth rates and prevent the economic stagnation experienced by aging societies \nglobally. The paper proposes innovative financing mechanisms, including a dedicated retirement savings \ncomponent within Kenya's VAT structure, to create sustainable social security that can break the cycle of \npoverty-driven demographic decline. This research contributes to the growing literature on demographic \ntransitions in sub-Saharan Africa while providing actionable policy frameworks for preventing demographic \ncollapse in developing economies. \n\nKeywords: Demographic transition, social security, population decline, Kenya, aging society, fertility rates, \neconomic development",

          "abstract": "In this article, we provide an updated complement to Hout and DiPrete’s (2006) influential review of RC28 scholarship, offering an analysis of contributions from the RC28 community since the early 2000s. Drawing on topic models of conference presentations, highly cited articles and books presented at RC28 conferences and written by RC28 board members, RSSM edited volumes, a qualitative survey of RC28 members, and plenary session feedback from two RC28 conferences, we identify 21 recent key contributions to social stratification and mobility research. We show that\nRC28 scholars have increasingly emphasized educational, income and wealth, and gender inequality, while placing less focus on social class. Some of the most highly cited research over the last two decades include studies on the consequences of income inequality, differential economic returns to college, family background effects on children’s achievement, gender gaps in educational achievement, persistent inequality in educational attainment, changes in\nintergenerational mobility patterns, and the importance of wealth inequality. The community’s methodological focus has shifted from log-linear models to methods for causal inference. Despite improvements in participation from Asia, the field would benefit from broader global inclusion. We conclude that to remain relevant and impactful, RC28 must not only continue producing highquality research but also actively engage with policymakers, practitioners, and the public to ensure that its insights help shape more equitable societies.",

          "title": "Evaluating Post-Retirement Quality of Life Through the CASP Lens: Evidence from the ELSA Study",
          "authors": "Ishan Durve",
          "abstract": "As global retirement ages rise in response to financial insecurity, demographic shifts, and increased life expectancy, questions emerge about how these changes affect the quality of later life. While much research has focused on the economic sustainability of delayed retirement, fewer studies have examined whether retiring at or after the statutory age impacts subjective well-being in comparison to early retirement. This study addresses that gap by investigating whether retirement timing, specifically early versus at statutory-age, shapes quality of life in later years. Using cross-sectional data from Wave 7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), retired individuals aged 50 and over were focused upon. The CASP-19 scale (Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation, Pleasure), a validated measure of older adults’ quality of life based on control, autonomy, self-realisation, and pleasure, was used as the central outcome variable. Using non-parametric statistical comparisons and unsupervised clustering techniques, differences in CASP scores and associated social, financial, and health variables between early and timely retirees were examined. Analysis reveals that early retirees, despite potentially shorter working lives, tend to report better quality of life, particularly in the autonomy and pleasure subscales of CASP. Additionally, we identify distinct post-retirement profiles through cluster analysis, highlighting the importance of relational closeness and financial preparedness in shaping subjective well-being. This study contributes to ongoing debates in social gerontology by offering a nuanced understanding of how retirement timing intersects with psychosocial outcomes in later life. As policies increasingly favour later retirement, these findings underscore the need to consider not just economic sustainability but also the lived experience and perceived quality of life of older adults.",

          "authors": "Lisette Jong; Thomas Franssen; Stephen Pinfield",
          "abstract": "Excellence is omnipresent in the research ecosystem but the narrow focus on excellence is increasingly controversial. One of the key actors in the research ecosystems are research funding organizations, yet their activities are comparatively little studied in relation to excellence. This paper aims to contribute to the excellence debate through an empirical study of how notions of excellence are used, and what functions they serve, in eight research funding organizations. Our study shows research funding organizations have recognized critical voices and are taking steps to address some of the problematic aspects of excellence. However, because research funding organizations are shaped by the excellence regime, and constrained by both governmental policy and scientific elites, research funding organizations cannot simply resort to a debunking critique and do away with excellence altogether. In their efforts to navigate their ambiguous relationship to excellence we show that in many of our case study sites the approach to excellence has shifted from it being taken as a ‘matter of fact’, that is rather taken for granted, to a ‘matter of concern’, that needs to be unpacked and reconfigured. We find funders resort to three mitigation strategies, patching, pluralizing and transforming, in their attempts to reconfigure excellence. Our findings suggest, however, that the current mitigation strategies adopted by funders aimed at reconfiguring excellence leave underlying assumptions about competition and meritocratic ideals largely unquestioned. A transformation of the research ecosystem is unlikely to happen when these ideals are not also problematized.",

          "abstract": "Political stereotypes — beliefs about the attributes of politically defined groups — can deepen polarization by obscuring commonalities among citizens. Yet little is known about their nature outside the United States. Using open-ended survey responses from Brazil, the UK, Germany, and Poland (N=5,381), we analyze how citizens describe political adversaries in their own words — focusing on issues, social groups, and traits. Combining deductive and inductive coding, we uncover both cross-national patterns and context-specific dynamics. Our content analysis shows that issue- and trait-based stereotypes dominate, but boundaries between categories are blurred. Respondents often conflate politicians and voters, use group labels to suggest traits or views (and vice versa), and deploy trait language to express moral condemnation. These tendencies vary by country, reflecting\nsalient debates and historical cleavages. Our findings suggest treating political stereotypes as webs of associations that go beyond discrete categories, with implications for the comparative study of stereotypes and polarization.",

However, extant studies have only partially considered the role of gender in this process. To reduce this gap in the literature, this study examines gendered genetic influences on educational attainment in Germany before and after reunification. Drawing on Gene-SOEP data (N=1,573), we analyze polygenic risk scores across cohorts (1943 to 1992) in East (German Democratic Republic, GDR) and West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, FRG) using stepwise OLS regression with three-way interactions. Our findings reveal that genetic influences on educational attainment increased over time, thereby reducing gendered educational inequality in both regions. However, this positive trend was more gradual in the FRG. Although the GDR promoted gender equality, its policies alone were insufficient to eliminate gender-based differences in genetic educational attainment.",

          "authors": "Emanuele Ferragina; Luca Pappalardo",
          "abstract": "Since the 19th century, the coevolution of humans and machines has transformed the political economy of production, value creation, and consumption across multiple historical stages. The most recent chapter in this ongoing story is the coevolution between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) – a social phenomenon whereby humans and AI-driven online platforms evolve in tandem, each influencing the evolution of the other, producing complex and unintended collective outcomes. At the heart of this process lies the human-AI feedback loop, its core mechanism, that significantly exacerbates economic inequalities through preferential attachment and marginalization processes. The article draws a political economy of this emerging phenomenon considering the study of Very Large Online Platforms as a vantage point. It contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it considers jointly classical processes of capital accumulation and those emerging as a result of human-AI coevolution, elaborating the concepts of ‘privatization of the general intellect’ and ‘accumulation of the means of recommendation’. Second, it discusses the phenomenon of economic inequality amplification due to the human-AI feedback loop on the basis of empirical evidence from computer science. Third, it explores potential regulatory frameworks aimed at limiting the unintended collective outcomes of the human-AI feedback loop. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the article associates social and hard sciences to open a debate at the intersection between technology, society and political economy.",

          "abstract": "Perceptions of procedural justice and legitimacy are important for cooperation, trust, and confidence in the police. However, how individuals form their procedural justice judgments varies and remains unclear. Group membership and feelings of belonging are important aspects of social life, which can in turn influence attitudes and perceptions of fairness. Presumably also the perceptions of the police. The current paper uses the European Social Survey (wave 5) to investigate the role of social exclusion on procedural justice perceptions and in turn police legitimacy in 27 European countries (N = 41,696). The results show that socially excluded citizens perceive the police to be more procedurally unjust, and that procedural justice positively influences police legitimacy. The results contradict the group value model and social bond theory, which state that the relationship between procedural justice and police legitimacy is weaker for socially excluded citizens. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of social exclusion, and especially perceived discrimination, on perceived police fairness and its association with broader perceptions of the police, such as police legitimacy.",

These “chatbot interviewers” can be used to (a) collect large-scale in-depth opinion data and (b) run prompt experiments with personalized conversational interventions. In this work, we use the open-source Python package boterview, designed for social scientists, to conduct chatbot interviews in an experimental setting. To investigate whether chatbot interviewers can develop theoretical sensitivity, we ran a pilot interviewing experiment on 26 university students and staff, compared to a group of 12 student interviewers, on the topic of a Universal Basic Income. Based on a content analysis of interviewer questions, we find that chatbot interviewers provided with theoretical background information are more likely to ask theoretically relevant questions, and are more likely to pick up theoretically relevant cues from interviewees. On the other hand, compared to (in-person) human interviewers, responses to (written) chatbot interviewers are shorter and less informative, and chatbots tend to more strongly stick to the script. We conclude by discussing avenues for improving the technical abilities and theoretical sensibilities of chatbot interviewers.",

          "authors": "Fabian Rüsenberg; Nadine Fleischhut",
          "abstract": "Climate services and co-production efforts aim to support adaptation by making climate information useful and usable. Yet many services and research projects prioritize improving data quality over understanding decision-making needs. This limits insights into what we define as true demand: the actionable need for information that would improve decisions, if conditions allowed. Here, we present a systematic sectoral analysis grounded in behavioral theory exploring whether, where, and how better climate predictions could improve decisions. We apply this approach to two climate-sensitive sectors in Germany: agriculture and forestry. Using expert focus groups (N = 24), we identify key adaptation decisions and analyze current decision strategies. Drawing on the COM-B model for behavior (B) change, we examine the capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M) necessary to use climate predictions in practice. Our findings reveal that foresighted adaptation is often constrained by gaps in knowledge, lack of opportunity, or limited motivation. These constraints diminish the perceived importance of climate predictions on the subseasonal to decadal timescale or prevent their use, with decision-makers instead relying on past experience and heuristics such as worst-case planning. Nevertheless, experts expressed interest in improved predictions---particularly for variability and extremes across intra-annual to multi-year timescales---that could inform decisions. True demand may remain masked, blocked, or unexpressed if decision-makers lack the capabilities, opportunities, or motivation to recognize, act on, or articulate it. Our approach provides a systematic way to assess where and how predictions could improve decisions, shifting the focus from better data to better decisions.",

It also discusses the concept of intersectionality as a framework to understand the compounded forms of discrimination faced by women in Iran. Ultimately, this study underscores the significance of the #MeToo movement in Iran as a transformative force that is pushing for a deeper, systemic change towards gender equality and social justice.",

          "abstract": "This study presents a structured attempt at deciphering the Voynich Manuscript, focusing on folio 78r (from the so-called balneological section depicting bathing women), folio 70v (the Zodiac Capricorn or “Goat” folio from the astrological section), and three herbal folios. The central hypothesis is that the text represents an existing language—most plausibly an archaic form of Basque—recorded phonetically and written with unfamiliar symbols in place of ordinary letters.\n\nThe analysis combines identification of vowels and recurring letter patterns with systematic comparison to Basque vocabulary and morphology, yielding partial but consistent matches. Evidence also points to contact with Old French, Castilian, Gascon, and Latin, reflecting the multilingual environment of late medieval Navarre.\n\nThe herbal folios align with descriptive plant entries typical of medieval herbals, mentioning stems, joints, sap, bitterness, and preparations such as decoctions. Folio 78r, usually interpreted as part of the balneological section, is here read as a description of water channels, basins, and flowing currents, consistent with the illustrations of bathing women. Folio 70v, traditionally identified with Capricorn in the zodiac cycle, is interpreted as a text describing cyclical or seasonal processes, in line with its astrological imagery.\n\nAlthough the translations remain provisional, the findings suggest that the manuscript is unlikely to represent an invented language. Instead, it may be a distorted record of existing speech and knowledge, intentionally obscured through phonetic variation and a disguised script.\n\nThis version integrates methodological refinements and interpretive notes into the main text, while earlier draft material has been removed. The results provide linguistic leads, structural insights, and a testable framework that may serve as a foundation for further philological and contextual research.",

Scholars are debating the potential of filtering to significantly alter the supply of affordable housing in the medium-term. We explore the effectiveness of filtering in St. Louis City, a midsized city that has experienced disinvestment, depopulation, and other challenges common in neoliberal cities. We employ a repeat-sales model, spatial mapping, and a best-fit multilinear regression model to investigate the connections between aging housing stock and market prices. We observe that the filtering process is not uniform across St. Louis City. The effects of filtering oscillate between inconclusive or powerful, depending on housing submarket dynamics. Evidence of downward filtering, in certain submarkets, is apparent in St. Louis and potentially boosting current and future affordable housing supply.",

          "authors": "Steve Hill",
          "abstract": "The United Kingdom’s counter-terrorism strategy is caught in a tragic impasse, forcing a choice between the punitive, exclusionary act of citizenship revocation and the state’s use of lethal force against its own citizens. While extensive scholarship critiques citizenship stripping as discriminatory and rights diminishing, it offers no resolution to this dilemma. This paper addresses this critical gap by advancing a novel, albeit contentious, argument: that in specific, narrowly defined circumstances, citizenship revocation can be reconceptualised not as a punitive tool but as a protective, life-preserving measure. The central thesis is that for individuals with access to an alternative nationality who are on a foreseeable path to a lethal confrontation with the state, pre-emptive revocation of their UK citizenship could serve to uphold their most fundamental human right, the right to life, by removing them from the jurisdiction where that life is in imminent peril. Grounding this claim in a critical re-evaluation of Arendt’s right to have rights and a radical inversion of the principle of non-refoulement, this paper argues for a situational hierarchy where the biological right to life must precede the institutional right to nationality. This theoretical intervention reframes revocation as the fulfilment of prospective duty of care. It disrupts the established binary of state power versus individual rights, offering a pragmatic, albeit ethically complex framework for reconciling the state's security duties with its most basic human rights obligations in an era of intractable terrorist threats.",

The results reveal significant disparities in coverage: nearly three-quarters of the journals are indexed in OpenAlex, almost half in DOAJ, fewer than a quarter in Scopus, and fewer than a fifth on the Web of Science Core Collection. From a global perspective, university journals are heavily clustered to a few countries, notably the United States, Indonesia and Brazil. University journals are characterized by strong linguistic diversity, with more than a third publishing exclusively in non-English languages. The social sciences and humanities dominate the disciplinary profile. This study establishes a baseline for further research into bibliodiversity, equity and the role of universities in scholarly communication.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a contentious possibility to minimise close proximity injuries sustained between the public and police resources including horses and dogs during outbreaks of serious public disorder in Great Britain. The use of standard police shield tactics could be supplemented or even replaced with the use of CS smoke which is already a tactical option for the police service within the United Kingdom. CS smoke is used throughout the world to quell outbreaks of serious disorder although the tactic is controversial. Whether or not this tactical option is suitable for use in Great Britain is considered, outlining a suggested implementation model for analysis of the success, or otherwise, of its use.",

          "abstract": "The professionalisation of policing in the UK has evolved significantly, especially since 2012, with structural changes like the establishment of the College of Policing and the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners, although recent changes in police entry routes could challenge this professionalisation journey. This paper explores the role of critical thinking in UK policing and its   potential to enhance police professionalism. It examines professionalism aligning the National Decision Model used in policing with selected academic frameworks. The paper argues that embedding critical thinking within police training enhances ethical decision making, problem solving, and adaptability, thereby reinforcing professionalism. Ultimately, the integration of critical thinking into  policing  is deemed essential for advancing UK policing's professionalisation.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to explore the potential role and pathways for transforming social sciences within the national security and strategic competition landscape. Its objectives address pressing challenges including the inadequate alignment between social sciences and national strategy, insufficient conversion of academic findings into policy and practical tools, intensifying disinformation offensives and countermeasures, and uneven allocation of research resources. Methodologically, this study combines strategic intelligence analysis with policy evaluation, employing comparative case studies, interdisciplinary literature reviews, and institutional design frameworks. It draws upon the DARPA ‘Heilmeier Eight Questions’ and the EU's mission-oriented innovation model for its arguments. Findings indicate that by establishing a national-level social science research platform, optimising research funding mechanisms, fostering closer alignment between academic pursuits and strategic imperatives, and developing deepfake forensics alongside cognitive immunity systems, social sciences may evolve from traditional knowledge accumulation into resources serving strategic decision-making and cognitive competition. This transformative trajectory enhances political narrative power and cognitive dominance, bolsters institutional adaptability, and furnishes nations with combined soft and hard competitive advantages on the international stage. The conclusion posits that the strategic utilisation of social sciences is not a singular pathway but a multi-layered, multi-stage exploratory process, offering significant reference value for enhancing national security and international influence.",

          "title": "Eco-digital Posthumanism: Definition, Genealogy, and Research Agenda within the EcoAI Framework",
          "authors": "Gianfranco Rubino",
          "abstract": "The concept of Eco-Digital Posthumanism stands as a theoretical horizon within the EcoAI (Rubino, 2025) Framework, envisioning a posthumanist orientation through which humanity, non-human entities, and technological infrastructures co-constitute shared worlds. \nGrounded in a relational ontology, this perspective refuses ontological separations between ‘human’, ‘environment’, and ‘technology’; instead, it frames them as intra-acting, constitutive elements in dynamic assemblages. Drawing on Karen Barad’s notion of intra-action (Barad, 2007), Donna Haraway’s concept of sympoiesis (Haraway, 2016), and Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethics of relationality (Braidotti, 2013), Eco-Digital Posthumanism offers a robust ontological and ethical basis for reconsidering human-technology-environment relations as fundamentally entangled.\nThe related EcoAI framework proposes that emergent eco-technologies — including sensing infrastructures, AI-driven environmental monitoring, and digitally mediated communal platforms — are not mere tools, but active mediators that shape both material reality and collective subjectivity. In this light, humans are reconceived as eco-technological intra-agents: their agency is neither purely individual nor detached but arises in dyadic and poly-nodal entanglements with environments and technologies. The ethical imperative intrinsic to this view is to design infrastructures and learning ecologies that foster mutual care, multispecies attentiveness, and distributed co-agency.\nA vital tension animates the formation of the Eco-Digital Humanism theory: on one side, the ecological system demands renewed forms of relationality between humans, environments, places, and presences. This demand emphasizes physical co-presence, material engagement, and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledge, embodied awareness, and ecological responsiveness. Here, educational media play a key role: Antonio López defines ecomedia literacy as the critical capacity to comprehend and engage with the reciprocal ecological “footprint” and cultural “mindprint” of media systems (López 2020, DOI:10.4324/9780203731109). This socio-pedagogical pillar grounds the theory in media-ecological practice. It calls for pedagogies and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledges, somatic awareness, and ecological attunement.\nOn the other hand, stands the rise of an immaterial relational geographies: social media, algorithmic platforms, influential digital narratives, ephemeral trend dynamics, and hyper-mediated connectivity craft relational spaces that lean toward an individualistic massification which often replace embodied interaction with curated digital self-expression and mediated connectivity with risks of disembedding relationality. These forces often substitute co-present engagement — with its embodied gestures, proxemics, and spontaneous nonverbal communication — with curated digital self-expression and algorithm-driven interaction. The communication shifts from embodied co-construction to performative self-branding, from tangible immediacy to mediated simulacra. José van Dijck and colleagues analyse how these platforms shape public life and values through infrastructural power (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal 2018, DOI:10.23860/MGDR-2018-03-03-08). Moreover, scholars like Couldry and Mejias warn of data colonialism, where personal data are appropriated in ways akin to digital exploitation (Couldry &amp; Mejias 2019, DOI:10.1177/1527476418796632). These critical sociological perspectives highlight how algorithmic systems can erode embodied co-presence and place-based relationality. This tension must be at the heart of Eco-Digital Humanism: it calls for technologies, pedagogies, and AI systems that restore and augment embodied, place-rooted relational ethics, rather than further eroding them.\nEco-Digital Posthumanism therefore envisions a middle path: techno-ecological designs and curricular frameworks that honour the ecological imperative for reciprocity, material co-presence, and affective attunement, while resisting the flattening of relationality that results from algorithmic mass individualism. In this, Eco-Digital Posthumanism embeds both philosophical depth and sociological grounding (López, van Dijck, Couldry &amp; Mejias), extending ecological posthumanism (as developed by Oppermann, 2016;) and material ecocriticism (Iovino &amp; Oppermann, 2014), by providing a mediation-centred, operational lens for guiding education, ethical design, and the governance of AI-mediated environments.\nIn sum, Eco-Digital Humanism posits that humans, non-humans, and technological systems co-create worlds; that ecological instances of sustainability necessitate relational, place-embedded forms of being and that the rising immaterial relational geographies without proper literacy threaten to separate us from those embodied ecologies. The theory thus demands a reconfiguration — through EcoAI Framework — of pedagogy, policy, and design, so that the digital infrastructures serve ecological relationality rather than displace it.",

          "authors": "Caleb Scoville; Razvan Amironesei; Lily Xu; Melissa Chapman; Nicholas R Record; Carl Boettiger",
          "abstract": "How does stakeholder participation in natural resource management change when conservation rules are grounded in near real-time data? Recent technological advances have increased the feasibility of the ‘dynamic management’ of natural resources, which promises to align the spatiotemporal scales of management with ecological variability and resource use. Drawing on Kelty’s (2020) concept of ‘contributory autonomy,’ this article offers a critical comparison of how participation is conceived of in the more established context of static conservation areas and planning versus the emergent field of dynamic management. A systematic review of the dynamic ocean management literature reveals a varied, but shallow engagement with the topic of stakeholder participation in that context. Whereas static management regimes are governed by relatively intuitive and contestable maps, dynamic management is governed by models and data flows. Overall, the decision-making stakeholder of participatory mapping processes under static management is displaced by the stakeholder conceived as an ‘end-user’ of a dynamic management product and consultant in its design. Yet, these shifts also open up potential points of contestation, which may pattern the future theory and practice of participation in dynamic management: counterdata, countermodeling, and data chokepoints. Beyond the empirical focus on oceans, this article contributes to broader conversations about the political stakes of environmental data, and algorithmic and artificial intelligence-driven natural resource conservation by considering how possibilities for participation are foreclosed, enabled, and reconstituted by new spatiotemporal and technological conditions.",

          "authors": "Kajwan Ziaoddini",
          "abstract": "Few visitors can leave Sanandaj, in Iran’s Kurdistan province, without encountering assertions that it is “The City of Music.” This scene, however, did not exist before 2019, when the city joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) in the field of music. Since then, the local UCCN secretariat and the municipality of Sanandaj, have tried both to promote music as a brand for the city and to involve the public and private sectors in integrating culture in urban development plans. In this context, some Lotis—professional musicians who are usually recruited to play in wedding ceremonies—have made the streets their new performance venue. After the pandemic deprived them of their usual livelihoods performing at weddings, they began performing on pedestrian thoroughfares and in other public, high-traffic locations. These performance settings would seem to align perfectly with the UCCN’s agenda, yet Lotis have also faced continued marginalization by city authorities. Drawing on ethnographic research among Lotis, their audiences, and local authorities, and on documentation from the Sanandaj UCCN secretariat, I argue that although the UCCN’s partnership with Sanandaj has provided Lotis with new professional opportunities, police control on the streets has limited these musicians’ creative abilities they are renowned for, i.e., engaging mere observers in the process of merrymaking. By examining how Lotis have reconciled their practice with the municipality’s strategic plans in Sanandaj, I contribute to ethnomusicological research on interrelations between sound and public space, as well as UNESCO intangible heritage programs.",

          "abstract": "Drought threatens the agricultural livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Nowhere is this risk larger than in India, where agriculture still employs 275 million people, by far the world’s biggest farming workforce. Here we present results from a new village-level panel that links agricultural employment data for 450,000 villages to 0.05° daily climate grids, enabling us to track each village’s drought exposure month by month. Every single month of drought during the June–October growing season reduces the share of people working in agriculture the following year by 1.2 percentage points. Nationally, this translates to ~3.3 million fewer people working in farming for each extra month of drought (95 % CI: 2.1– 4.5 million). Because rural India offers few alternative jobs, such losses are likely to trigger surges of circular labor migration to India’s towns and cities. Using CMIP6 mid-century projections, we estimate that by 2050 the average village will experience 1.5–2.0 more drought months each year, equivalent to a further ~5.0–6.6 million lost farm jobs, likely amplifying those rural-to-urban migration flows and further straining urban labor markets.",

While financial incentives are often effective in enhancing productivity, they may be less feasible in environments such as public administrations, where job security and rigid compensation structures limit their impact. Using a controlled experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of two main treatments and divided into workers and managers. In the baseline treatment, workers received a fixed payment to complete one of two tasks: (i) finding letters or (ii) adding numbers. Managers, who had no assigned tasks, earned their payoff based on the workers' performance. In the Competitive Rotation Treatment (CRT), workers competed for the opportunity to choose their preferred task. The findings show that performance-based task rotation significantly increases productivity and maintains this improvement over time. Additionally, top-performing workers often remained in their tasks, fostering more stable group dynamics.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a narrative review and theoretical synthesis of betrayal trauma through the lenses of memory reconstruction, identity disruption, and recovery. Drawing on psychological literature, including foundational work by Freyd, Herman, van der Kolk, and others, the paper maps the subjective experience of betrayal trauma-particularly in narcissistic abuse-as a nonlinear process of healing, akin to walking a labyrinth. The methodology employed is a synthesis of empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and lived experience. The analysis highlights the collapse of perceptual trust, the reorganization of autobiographical memory, and introduces the novel concept of the \"grey phase\"-a distinct period marked by emotional numbness, psychic detachment, and dissociation. While this phase has been described implicitly in trauma literature, this paper explicitly names and frames it as a neurobiological and psychological intermission essential to recovery. This layered, compassionate, and academically grounded model enhances understanding of how trauma ruptures narrative identity and how healing entails its gradual reconstruction. The paper concludes that recovery reflects complex psychological integration rather than pathology. Note on Perspective While acknowledging the importance of lived experience in understanding betrayal trauma, this paper is primarily an academic synthesis of peer-reviewed psychological research.",

It also discusses the concept of intersectionality as a framework to understand the compounded forms of discrimination faced by women in Iran.

The model identifies six distinct types of agencies: operative, reflective, joint, material-mediated, sign-mediated, and symbolic. Each level is examined in detail to elucidate the semiotic mechanisms and the cognitive architecture underlying the emergence of collective agencies. The model conceptualizes collective agency as an enhanced capability for action, incorporating artifacts to constitute sociotechnical systems. Within this framework, both institutional and non-institutional forms of collective agency are explored. In contrast to institutions, the collective agency of non-institutionalized social organizations generates dense networks of interaction within horizontal structures, facilitating the convergence between shared norms and individual values. This bottom-up view on agency recognizes individuals as agents of change and their crucial role in collective agency. Consequently, I underscore the importance of examining the interactions between individual and collective agency, proposing the Layered Model of Agency as a relevant tool for investigating these issues.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the environmental and infrastructure determinants of respiratory disease mortality (TRD) across European nation-states through an original combination of econometric, machine learning, clustering, and network-based approaches. The primary scientific inquiry is how structural environmental variables, such as land use, energy mix, sanitation, and climatic stress, co-interact to affect respiratory mortality across regions. Although prior literature has addressed individual environmental predictors in singleton settings, this paper fills an integral gap by using a multi-method, systems-level analysis that accounts for interdependencies as well as contextual variability. The statistical analysis draws on panel data covering several years and nation-states using fixed effects regressions with robust standard errors for evaluating the effects of variables such as agricultural land use (AGRL), access to electricity (ELEC), renewable energy (RENE), freshwater withdrawals (WTRW), cooling degree days (CDD), and sanitation (SANS). We employ cluster analysis and density-based methodology to identify spatial and environmental groupings, while machine learning regressions—specifically, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—are utilized for predictive modeling and evaluating feature importance. Lastly, network analysis identifies the structural connections between variables, including influence metrics and directional weights. We obtain the following results: Consistently, across all regressions, AGRL, WTRW, and SANS feature importantly when determining the effect for TRD. Consistently across all networks, influencer metrics identify AGRL, WTRW, and SANS as key influencers. Consistently across all models, the best-performing predictive regression identifies the nonlinear (polynomial or non-monotone), context-sensitive nature of the effects. Consistent with the network results, the influencer metrics suggest strong connections between variables, with a particular emphasis on the importance of holistic environmental health approaches. Combining the disparate yet complementary methodological tools, the paper provides robust, understandable, yet policy-relevant insights into the environmental complexity driving respiratory health outcomes across Europe.",

          "abstract": "Under conditions of authoritarian neoliberalism, associational space and institutional redress are structurally foreclosed, limiting the capacity of labor and social movements to become counter-hegemonic in the sense defined by existing literature. This presents a theoretical impasse when analyzing labor movements in contexts such as Iran. To address this, I develop a Gramscian framework introducing the concept of embryonic counter-hegemony: organizational efforts that enact counter-hegemonic logics and practices but remain fragile, structurally constrained, and temporally limited. This article examines two landmark cases of autonomous labor organizing in Iran: the Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Company (HTSC) and the Iran National Steel Industrial Group (INSIG). In both cases, workers bypassed state-controlled institutions and formed alternative organizational structures—general assemblies—to contest privatization, demand democratic control over production, and resist state repression. While these formations did not consolidate into stable counter-hegemonic blocs, they embodied embryonic practices of democratic governance and oppositional consciousness. Drawing on four years of content analysis of Telegram posts, public interviews with worker organizers, and archival protest coverage, I show how these labor assemblies developed participatory procedures, resisted co-optation, and articulated alternative political imaginaries. By theorizing these formations as embryonic rather than failed or merely reactive, I reorient counter-hegemonic analysis toward the organizational practices and strategic contradictions of resistance under authoritarianism. This study contributes to Gramscian labor studies and critical organizational scholarship by illuminating how subaltern actors construct alternative organizations within repressive regimes—and what such efforts reveal about the possibilities and limits of organizing under constraint.",

The International Review is based on country notes from each participating country, prepared by members of the network and edited by a team of network members. Each country note follows a standard format: details of different types of leave; the relationship between leave policy and early childhood education and care policy; recent policy developments; information on take-up of leave. The International Review also includes definitions of the main types of leave policies; and cross-country comparisons. These comparative overviews cover: each main type of leave; the relationship between leave and ECEC entitlements; and policy changes and developments since the previous review. We also include a technical appendix. The 2025 International Review covers 52 countries. These are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay and Vietnam.
