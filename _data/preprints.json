          "title": "Tracking transformative agreements through open metadata: method and validation using Dutch Research Council NWO funded papers.",
          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer; Jeroen Sondervan",
          "abstract": "Transformative agreements have become an important strategy in the transition to open access, with almost 1,200 such agreements registered by 2025. Despite their prevalence, these agreements suffer from important transparency limitations, most notably article-level metadata indicating which articles are covered by these agreements. Typically, this data is available to libraries but not openly shared, making it difficult to study the impact of these agreements. In this paper, we present a novel, open, replicable method for analyzing transformative agreements using open metadata, specifically the Journal Checker tool provided by cOAlition S and OpenAlex. To demonstrate its potential, we apply our approach to a subset of publications funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and its health research counterpart ZonMw. In addition, the results of this open method are compared with the actual publisher data reported to the Dutch university library consortium UKB. This validation shows that this open method accurately identified 89% of the publications covered by transformative agreements, while the 11% false positives shed an interesting light on the limitations of this method. In the absence of hard, openly available article-level data on transformative agreements, we provide researchers and institutions with a powerful tool to critically track and evaluate the impact of these agreements.",

          "title": "A meta-analyst should make informed decisions: Issues with Bayesian model-averaging meta-analyses",
          "authors": "Rafael Román-Caballero; Miguel A. Vadillo",
          "abstract": "When synthesizing the results of multiple studies, meta-analysts typically assess publication bias using different models. However, none of those methods clearly outperforms the others and the inferences drawn from them are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty. One approach proposes to solve discrepancies between publication-bias methods by favoring results of methods that perform reasonably well under the specific conditions of the meta-analysis. A recent proposal known as robust Bayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA) has become an influential alternative. RoBMA uses Bayesian model averaging with different publication bias models and is presented as a method that absolves the meta-analyst from the difficult decision of having to choose which publication-bias model to apply. Unfortunately, we have noted from replication projects that the combination of heterogeneity and well-informed sample size planning might result in small-study effects that meta-analysts might misinterpret as a sign of bias, named here as the power analysis–bias paradox. In the present study, we tested the performance of RoBMA with simulated meta-analyses where publication bias was absent, but some proportion of studies based their sample size on power analyses. Under those conditions, RoBMA identified evidence of publication bias and underestimated the effect. As preregistration and power analyses become widespread in research and given that scientific results are heterogeneous for reasons that are not always known, meta-analysts should become increasingly careful in their use and interpretation of methods based on funnel plot asymmetry. Our findings suggest that publication-bias analyses require informed decisions by the meta-analyst and no data-driven approach can replace their expertise.",

          "abstract": "Drift diffusion models (DDMs) are pivotal in understanding evidence accumulation processes during decision-making across psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Hierarchical drift diffusion models (HDDM), a Python library for hierarchical Bayesian estimation of DDMs (Wiecki et al., 2013), has been widely used among researchers, including those with limited coding proficiency, in fitting DDMs and other sequential sampling models. However, issues of compatibility in installation and lack of support for more recently Bayesian modeling functionalities poses serious challenges for new users, limiting broader adaptation and reproducibility of HDDM. To address these issues, we created dockerHDDM, a user-friend computational environment for HDDM with new features. dockerHDDM brings three improvements: (1) easy-to-install once docker is installed, ensuring reproducibility and saving time for researchers; (2) compatible with machine with apple chips; (3) seamlessly integration with ArviZ, a state-of-the-art Bayesian modeling library. This tutorial serves as a practical, hands-on guide for researchers to leverage dockerHDDM’s capabilities in conducting efficient Bayesian hierarchical analysis of DDMs. The notebook presented here and within the docker image will enable researchers with various programming levels to model their data with HDDM.",

          "abstract": "This paper revisits the Age of Acquisition (AoA) norms of Kuperman et al. (2012). Three studies were conducted. Study 1 reports a crowdsourcing 'megastudy' obtaining 790,024 estimates from participants providing the age they could first read and write 11,074 early acquired words from Kuperman et al. (2012). The study aimed to differentiate between oral language receptive AoA and print AoA. The results correlate well with the original estimates and offer slightly higher AoA values for print knowledge. They are released as useful supplements to the original norms. Study 2 explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, to replicate these new crowdsourced AoA norms. The findings indicated a strong correlation between AI-generated estimates and human judgments, showing the utility of AI in generating AoA estimates. The results confirm that AI is a valuable resource of norms for psycholinguistic and educational research, of particular value for under-resourced languages and researchers with limited resources. Based on the successful application of AI in Study 2, Study 3 extended the method to the entire set of words in the English Crowdsourcing Project (ECP), producing AI-generated AoA estimates for approximately 62,000 English words. This provides a substantial database of AoA norms that are found to correlate very highly with human-generated estimates (r =.86) and perform well in accounting for word processing times in regression analyses. The AI generated results have some important limitations, including overestimating the vocabulary acquired at some ages.

However, the degree to which their findings would generalise to other speakers of their languages remains unclear. We will test the replicability of Ozaki et al.’s findings using matched singing and conversational speech audio recordings from 15-30 participants per language in 26 sites around the world (collected as part of a broader study of global song/speech relationships [Savage et al., In Principle Accepted]). Using Peer Community In Registered Reports (PCI-RR)’s “Programmatic” track will allow us to replicate and extend Ozaki et al.’s original findings in a rigorous and equitable manner by allowing each local research team to lead its own separate first-authored Stage 2 Registered Report based on a single shared Stage 1 protocol. This will allow us to test the replicability of Ozaki et al.’s original findings across diverse languages while also giving each team the flexibility to pursue their own exploratory analyses in directions most relevant to their local context.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety and depression are highly comorbid. Across species, depression-related phenotypes have been linked to reduced willingness to expend effort to pursue rewards. Effortful threat avoidance has been less extensively studied. Work in rodents suggest that reduced effortful threat avoidance characterizes depressive phenotypes and is responsive to antidepressant medications, while increased effortful threat avoidance characterizes more anxiety-like phenotypes and is responsive to anxiolytic medications. A parallel dissociation in humans would have clear clinical implications.  Here, we investigated whether dimensions of depressed and anxious affect do indeed differentially impact effortful reward pursuit versus threat avoidance in humans. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling revealed that component decision-making mechanisms underlying effortful reward pursuit were differentially impacted by latent dimensions capturing the depressive symptoms of apathy versus anhedonia. Meanwhile, only the latent dimension tapping worry-related symptoms significantly impacted effortful threat avoidance, increasing willingness to exert effort to avoid threat and reducing sensitivity to threat magnitude.",

This suggests that communicators could create more durable persuasion by adding explicit moral claims (i.e., stating that the issue is a matter of right vs. wrong) to persuasive messages. Here, using animated videos about the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we conducted a three-stage longitudinal experiment (N = 4,488) to test whether messages with explicit moral claims have more durable persuasive effects than similar messages without. We replicated this test across two distinct moral dimensions: harm to innocent people and contamination of nature’s purity. Our findings show that all message versions had strong immediate persuasive effects relative to a control condition, and much of those effects remained after a three-week period. However, there were no clear advantages—in immediate effects or in durability—from adding explicit moral claims to the messages.",

No study has used the dimensions and facets of the latest integrated stereotype framework to describe their stereotype and compare it with other groups. In Study 1 among university students (n = 241), we show that unemployed people are rated lower than employed people on the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of their stereotypes, as well as on the facets of capacity, assertiveness, morality and friendliness. We show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In Study 2, we replicate these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanized when compared to the same targets. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on both dimensions and facets, but not on morality. Overall, we conclude that unemployed people have a highly destructive stereotype that is lacking in every dimension and facet, and that they are overly despised.",

          "abstract": "How do people come up with funny ideas? Profanity—the language’s rich panoply of obscenity, vulgarity, and indecency—is a ubiquitous comedic device deployed in creative humor. The present research explored variation in profanity use when generating jokes. A sample of adults (n = 618) completed a creative humor production task, and text-mining methods detected and coded the appearance and severity of profanity. Random forest models were used to identify potentially important predictors, such as variables relevant to profanity generally (e.g., age, gender, and personality traits) and variables specific to humor creation (e.g., humor self-concepts and self-ratings of their jokes’ funniness). Profanity in the jokes was reasonably common, used by 22% of the sample, diverse in type, and generally mild in severity. The random forest models identified a set of uniquely important predictors. Profanity use and severity were marked by being younger, identifying as male, rating one’s own jokes as funny, and expressing more confidence in one’s ability to be funny and make others laugh—a true profile in boorishness. The discussion explores roles for personality in indecorous humor and the broader question of strategic aspects of humor creation.",

Methods: Separating within-person effects from between-person effects, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) was applied to three annual waves of data (T1, T2, T3) on social media use, gaming and internalising symptoms among N=25,629 adolescents (51% girls, average age 12 years, 7 months (SD = 3.58 months) at baseline) in Greater Manchester, England. Results: Longitudinal relationships varied by gender, such that more frequent gaming at T2 predicted less time spent on social media use at T3 in girls (but not boys) and, more frequent internalising symptoms at T2 predicted reductions in gaming frequency at T3 in boys (but not girls). There was no evidence that time spent on social media or gaming frequency predicted later internalising symptoms among girls or boys. Sensitivity analyses which distinguished active versus passive social media use replicated these findings. Conclusions: The findings of this study do not support the widely held view that adolescent technology use is a major causal factor in their mental health difficulties.",

Method: Propensity score matching and difference-in-differences estimation were used in a pre-test/post-test control group design to assess the impact of FBB on the mental wellbeing (assessed via the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, SWEMWBS) of participants designated at-risk (N=46 aged 12-14, 81.6% boys), passive learners (N=72, aged 12-14, 84.7% boys), and role models (N=35, aged 12-14, 85.7% boys), with matched control samples derived from a subset of the #BeeWell cohort study (N=8,015). Results: A significant intervention effect was observed for at-risk youth, with FBB leading to an increase of approximately 2.4 SWEMWBS points (d = 0.44).  No intervention effects were observed for passive learners or role models. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence indicates that FBB can improve mental wellbeing of at-risk youth.

Framing norms as dynamic (changing over time) rather than static (fixed in the present) can encourage individuals to adopt counter-normative behaviors and attitudes. We investigated whether dynamic norm interventions reduce ideological polarization (divergence in policy attitudes between groups) and affective polarization (hostility toward opposing parties). In a pilot study (N = 50), we identified credible dynamic bipartisan norms (e.g., increasing bipartisan support for poverty assistance). In Study 1 (N = 389), Democrats and Republicans underestimated in-party and out-party support for these norms and misperceived trends, believing Republican support had declined when it had actually grown. In Study 2 (N = 1,187), exposure to dynamic bipartisan norms reduced ideological polarization but did not significantly reduce affective polarization, suggesting that shifting policy attitudes does not necessarily foster cross-party goodwill. Understanding these distinctions may inform interventions to bridge ideological divides.",

          "abstract": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has been criticised for numerous social, political, and environmental issues. While an important call to boycott the tournament spread worldwide, research has yet to document the motives underlying a boycott of such a mega sporting event. We investigated fans’ intentions to boycott the 2022 FIFA World Cup in four countries of the Francophonie engaged in the World Cup (N = 1,635). We found that being highly identified with the team and enjoying football for aesthetic pleasures predicted rejection of the boycott, while the most robust predictor of boycott intentions was a concern for environmental issues. When assessing actual boycott behaviours among fans after the World Cup (N = 286), we found a significant decrease compared to boycott intentions. Importantly, this intention–behaviour gap was true even for politicised fans with high awareness of social and environmental issues who initially planned to boycott the tournament. We discuss the paradox of calls to boycott mega sporting events: Unlike other consumption products, these events often have no alternatives, which influences fans’ decisions not to boycott. As a consequence, boycott behaviours mirror one’s fandom rather than political values, and boycotters are those barely interested in these events in any case.",

We call this the social turn in delusions research. It suggests that paranoia is the purview of a specialized mechanism for coalitional cognition – thinking about group membership and reputation management. Here we suggest instead that a simpler, parasocial, learning mechanism may underwrite persecutory and other delusions. We make our case in terms of computations (prediction, not coalition), algorithm (association rather than recursion), and implementation (dopaminergic domain-general rather than social-specific regions). We conclude with suggestions for adversarial collaboration that will clarify the contributions of domain-general versus social-specific processes to delusions.",

(1) reported that so-called ‘problem gambling,’ as they defined it, is associated with monetary spending on video game mechanics that involve randomisation (e.g., gacha mechanics (2,3) and loot boxes (4)) amongst young Hong Kong players of games containing such mechanics. At face value, that assertion is not surprising as a consistent line of research has previously established that relationship in Western countries (5–7), which has been relied upon in policymaking (8,9). Research conducted subsequent to Tang et al. in Mainland China has also replicated the relationship (10).\n\nHowever, unfortunately, Tang et al. suffered from a fundamental flaw. That study did not, in fact, measure ‘problem gambling’ as traditionally defined because Tang et al. significantly modified the measurement scale. Instead, Tang et al. measured only ‘problematic participation in gacha mechanics’ and proved various relationships existed between that construct and other variables, which arguably is less meaningful (11,12). The development of that new scale lacked transparency and evidence of reliability and validity. It is unclear whether that new measure is related to ‘problem gambling’ and, if so, to what extent. In any case, it is not, and cannot be used as, a direct replacement without further validation\n\nTang et al. could not in fact have been able to report on any issues concerning ‘problem gambling’ because by definition, they did not measure ‘problem gambling.’ They should not have claimed to have been able to test or comment on any psychological relationships concerning ‘problem gambling.’ The current framing of that paper and its conclusions are misleading to readers whose attention are not specifically drawn to this highly significant measurement modification. This comment intends to correct that misimpression. Simply put, Tang et al. did not prove what its title suggested.

In two pre-registered studies, we tested whether negative affect increases approach bias and craving for chocolate and alcohol, with strongest effects expected in individuals with self-reported emotional intake.\nMethods: In Study 1 (N = 87), negative or neutral affect was induced on separate days, followed by an approach-avoidance-task and craving ratings. Study 2 used a more potent affect induction, included a larger sample, and nested affect induction sessions within a single day (N = 132). \nResults: In Study 1, affect was unsuccessfully induced, so we analysed the effect of self-reported sadness. Approach biases and cravings to chocolate and alcohol were stronger during sessions with higher self-reported sadness. Study 2 replicated and extended this finding by showing that also induced negative affect increased biases and cravings. Further, emotional eaters showed a stronger affect-related increase in chocolate bias, while emotional drinkers exhibited consistently stronger biases independent of affect. \nConclusion: Craving and approach bias increases may explain self-regulation failures during negative affect. While these mechanisms were similar for both appetitive substances, affect-related increases in approach bias may be especially relevant in emotional eating but not in emotional drinking.",

In this paper we (1) conducted an exploratory cluster analysis on their textual justifications of their moral responsibility ratings using word-embeddings and (2) investigated the correlation between moral responsibility ratings and the proportion of words participants use from each cluster. We found that participants who used more words from the “event detection” cluster were more likely to attribute higher moral responsibility to the humanoid robot. Conversely, those who used more words from the “mechanistic properties” cluster tended to attribute less moral responsibility to the humanoid robot.

Two pre-registered experiments (Study 1: N = 461; Study 2: N = 444) found that, for the same hotel review, third-party reviewers were perceived more favorably than self-reviewers (i.e., hotel managers), leading to more positive evaluations of the hotel. Reviews attributed to AI writers negatively impacted impressions of the reviewer and diminished the review’s impact, with third-party reviewers more negatively affected by AI writer labels than self-reviewers. AI labels of user-generated content can therefore move people out of their default impression formation state. We demonstrate theoretical advancements for warranting theory and AIMC.",

          "abstract": "*This is a preprint and has been accepted for publication by Cognitive Development* Children’s metacognitive monitoring is typically considered as a domain general skill that can be applied in different tasks and situations. However, this assumption lacks empirical evidence as few studies tested whether children’s accuracy of monitoring judgments as well as their monitoring behaviours are consistent across tasks. It is also not clear if children who provide more accurate monitoring judgments also show more frequent monitoring behaviours. In the current research study 53 elementary school children’s metacognitive monitoring was assessed with four tasks: on the one hand, the accuracy of children’s monitoring judgments was assessed with two computer-based tasks (one task required monitoring of memory and the other task required monitoring of reaction times); on the other hand, the frequency with which they engaged in monitoring behaviours was assessed with two construction tasks. Correlational analysis showed that there was no significant association between children’s monitoring judgment accuracies. In turn, children’s monitoring behaviour on two construction tasks was significantly positively associated. Intercorrelations between children’s monitoring judgment accuracies and monitoring behaviours showed that children who more accurately monitored their reaction time showed significantly more monitoring behaviour when working on construction tasks. Conversely, children’s monitoring judgment accuracy on a memory task was not associated with their monitoring behaviour. These findings suggest that the processes underlying children’s monitoring judgments may be task specific, whereas their tendency to engage in monitoring behaviours may be domain general.

However, participants might perceive the repetitive self-reporting in these data collection techniques as burdensome and demotivating, resulting in decreased compliance rates. In this tutorial paper, we present a user-centered approach aimed at making participation in experience sampling and daily diary studies a meaningful and fun experience for adolescents. Methods. In three major research projects that took place between 2019 – 2023, more than 4,000 Dutch adolescents participated (12 - 25 years old). To improve the participants’ user journey, adolescents were invited to co-design our studies and share their expertise in interviews (n = 459), focus groups (n = 101), design decisions (i.e., A/B tests, n = 107), pilots (n = 163), exit interviews (n = 167), and by answering user experience questionnaires (n = 2,109). Results. Across projects, we discovered five different main intrinsic and extrinsic motives to participate in intensive longitudinal studies: (1) rewards, (2) fun and interest, (3) helping science or the greater good, (4) helping the scientist or another person, and (5) gaining self-insight. We provide concrete examples of how we tailored our study designs to address these specific motives to optimize youth engagement. Conclusions. The engagement of adolescents in intensive longitudinal studies can be enhanced by making it a meaningful and enjoyable experience, aligned with their own motives.",

          "abstract": "The fashion industry is a major environmental polluter, and behavioral scientists can investigate strategies to reduce obstacles to second-hand sustainable solutions. We propose an evolutionary framework rooted in the Parasite-Stress Theory of Values as a comprehensive explanation for the cultural, individual, and situational differences in second-hand clothing, postulating that second-hand clothing triggers evolved pathogen-avoidance mechanisms that form a barrier to second-hand purchases. This barrier can be mitigated by hygiene-related sensory cues, like a clean-laundry odor. In a field study (N = 257), we counterbalanced three odor conditions (clean-laundry, citrus, and regular store odor), and found that clean-laundry scent significantly boosted purchasing behavior by overriding the negative effect of germ-aversion. Indeed, among store’s customers, higher levels of pathogen avoidance resulted in less spending and more negative attitudes toward second-hand clothing. Further support for our mechanistic model is provided by the lab pilot study—where clean-laundry scent was shown to significantly reduce pathogen concerns, while enhancing garments’ perceived value and appeal—and by experimentally increasing pathogen saliency in survey responders, resulting in more negative second-hand clothing attitudes. This research highlights the critical role of pathogen avoidance mechanisms and cleanliness cues in overcoming psychological barriers to effectively promote sustainable consumer practices.",

Several studies have demonstrated that increased perceptual fluency, induced by high versus low color contrast of presented statements, results in higher truth judgments. According to the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, the unexpected switch from several low-fluency stimuli to a high-fluency stimulus is assumed to enhance perceived truthfulness. In two online studies (one preregistered), we aimed to replicate the central finding by Hansen, Dechêne, and Wänke (2008; Journal of Experimental Social Psychology) that discrepancies in color contrast influence truth judgments. Additionally, we extended the original design by varying the length of stimulus blocks presented in low or high color contrast. Contrary to previous findings, neither the level of perceptual fluency nor unexpected discrepancies in fluency affected truth judgments even though high-contrast statements were read faster than low-contrast ones, indicating that processing fluency was successfully manipulated. A meta-analysis combining our two experiments with published studies shows that the effect of perceptual fluency induced by color contrast on truth judgments may not be as robust as previously thought.",

          "authors": "Robin Gerrits",
          "abstract": "Although word production is considered a strongly left hemispheric lateralized function, its cerebral asymmetry varies among individuals. The most popular way of determining hemisphere dominance is to calculate a laterality index (LI) by comparing brain activity between the two hemispheres. Large LIs can readily be classified as left or right dominant, but there is no consensus on how to treat bilateral LIs indicating (near) symmetrical activity. The problem with interpreting very small LIs is perpetuated by a lack of reliability, stemming from the challenge of systematically investigating these uncommon cases \n(usually ≤ 10% of a sample). To address this gap, we performed two studies that investigated the reliability and across-methods generalizability of bilateral LIs obtained from functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCDS), an ultrasound-based approach that measures cerebral blood flow velocity. In Study 1, we compared reproducibility of bilateral LIs (n=35) and clearly lateralized LIs (n=32) during a letter verbal fluency fTCDS task across two sessions. While left-lateralized classifications were highly replicable (97% reproduced), poorer reproducibility was observed for bilateral classifications (51% reproduced). In fact, dichotomous left-right categorization yielded more reliable outcomes than assigning participants with bilateral LIs to a separate category (80% reproduced). Study 2 assessed whether small fTCDS asymmetry extended to other instruments for determining cerebral laterality (visual half field method and fMRI). Participants consistently classified as bilateral by fTCDS (n=18) also exhibited reduced group-level asymmetry in these other methods. Based on these results, we suggest that LIs reflect a combination of idiosyncratic cerebral asymmetry, state-dependent fluctuations, and measurement noise. Our findings also indicate that a subset of the population has a neural system for word production that is inherently weakly lateralized, although true hemispheric equivalence is likely extremely rare. Finally, we offer recommendations for classifying asymmetry in clinical and research contexts.",

          "abstract": "It is common in behavioural sciences to require subjects of an experiment to sign an informed consent form. The form explains the procedures and risks, and the signature certifies that the subject is aware and consents. The motivation for this requirement – protection of the subject – is noble and uncontroversial, but the implications do not all align with that motivation. I argue that the subject's signature is often unnecessary. Signature commits – rather than protects – the subject, and produces a trace with sensitive personal information that prevents full anonymization and puts a burden on the investigator and institution to protect and curate that information. Trust based on shared norms is replaced by a contract that has to cover every eventuality and thus may be hard to understand. Those downsides are absent when a signature is not gathered. Signed consent might protect the investigator or institution, but that is distinct from protecting the subject. The decision to gather a signature should be justified to the IRB by the investigator, rather than the decision to not gather it. A well-designed informed consent form, unsigned, can protect both subject and investigator.",

          "abstract": "Recent developments suggest that Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach for approximating empirical correlation matrices of item responses by utilizing item embeddings and their cosine similarities. In this paper, we introduce a novel tool, which we label SEMbeddings. This tool integrates mpnet-personality (a fine-tuned embedding model) with latent measurement models to assess model fit or misfit prior to data collection. To support our statement, we apply SEMbeddings to the 96 items of the VIA-IS-P, which measures 24 different character strengths, using responses from 31,697 participants. Our analysis shows a significant, though not perfect, correlation (r = .67) between the cosine similarities of embeddings and empirical correlations among items. We then demonstrate how to fit confirmatory factor analyses on the cosine similarity matrices produced by mpnet-personality and interpret the outcomes using modification indices. We found that relying on traditional fit indices when using SEMbeddings can be misleading as they often lead to more conservative conclusions compared to empirical results. Nevertheless, they provide valuable suggestions about possible misfit, and we argue that the modification indices obtained from these models could serve as a useful screening tool to make informed decisions about items prior to data collection. As LLMs become increasingly precise and new fine-tuned models are released, these procedures have the potential to deliver more reliable results, potentially transforming the way new questionnaires are developed.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia, characterized by absent or reduced visual mental imagery, has been associated with alexithymia and negative mental health outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these associations remain unclear. Since mental health is closely linked to interoception, we examined whether interoceptive processing plays a role in these relationships, assessing self-reported imagery vividness (VVIQ), subjective interoceptive accuracy and attention, alexithymia, and mental health, including anxiety and depression, in individuals with (n = 153, VVIQ = 16–32) and without aphantasia (n = 680, VVIQ = 33–80). The results revealed distinct patterns between these groups. In the aphantasia group, higher VVIQ was associated with greater alexithymia and poorer mental health outcomes, suggesting that individuals with weak imagery (hypophantasia) exhibited more emotional difficulties than those with almost no imagery (core aphantasia). In contrast, in the non-aphantasia group, VVIQ correlated negatively with alexithymia and positively with mental health, aligning with previous research indicating a protective role of vivid imagery. Structural equation modelling confirmed that alexithymia strongly mediated the link between VVIQ and negative mental health outcomes in both groups, reinforcing alexithymia as a mediator between imagery ability and well-being. Another key factor in these relationships was the ratio between subjective interoceptive accuracy and attention, which mediated the relationship between VVIQ and alexithymia and mental health outcomes. These findings highlight the heterogeneity within aphantasia, distinguishing hypophantasia from core aphantasia and revealing distinct interoceptive and mental health profiles.",

We present meta-analytic insight of relationships between FWSS and various antecedents and outcomes derived from the Career Construction Model of Adaptation (CCMA) based on K = 74 studies, k = 80 independent samples, and N = 27,643 individuals. FWSS is strongly associated with the adaptivity constructs proactive personality and psychological capital (both rc = .43). Additionally, it is is moderately related to supports (rc = .37).

Regarding adaptation results, FWSS is moderately related to employability (rc = .31) and occupational well-being (rc = .26), while showing a strong relationship with general well-being (rc = .39) and meaning in life (rc = .54). FWSS is also strongly associated with work engagement (rc = .39). The relative weights analysis confirms the distinct relationship between FWSS and PCBs. Additionally, the mediation analysis indicates that career adaptability acts as a mediator between FWSS and PCBs, offering deeper insights into the role of FWSS within the CCMA. Finally, demographic and contextual variables, such as age and cultural individualism, influence some of the examined relationships. The meta-analysis contributes to a refinement of the CCMA and future research on the role of FWSS in career development.",

          "abstract": "In three experiments (n = 20 each), we investigated the mechanisms by which the metacognitive system produces the confidence serial dependence (CSD) effect in a series of perceptual decisions. We found that confidence ratings were systematically attracted to those in preceding trials (similar to “confidence leak”), even with matched performance. We further found that CSD required explicit confidence judgments in preceding decisions and was largely independent of preceding motor response patterns. By comparing a factorial combination of computational models, we found that CSD arises from the jittering of a fixed decision criterion template based on past information instead of from dynamically updating criteria across trials. As our study focuses on decisions on a lab-based visual motion task, our model needs to be tested against data from other tasks and scenarios. Our results suggest that our metacognition adapts in response to recent perceptual decisions.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption can pose health risks and cause social problems, hence harmful drinking is a global health concern. Acculturation has been theorized and examined as a key driver for drinking behaviors. In this State of the Science article, we define sociocultural and psychological acculturation, and describe three causal theories associated with socialization and learning, stress and coping, and accessibility and opportunity. Data have shown small-to-moderate associations linking acculturation factors to drinking outcomes. Many existing studies measure acculturation with demographic proxies and static cultural orientation indicators. Underlying causal mechanisms are typically inferred rather than tested directly, with limited focus on key proximal factors such as stress responses, drinking motives, and cultural norms. Furthermore, current alcohol interventions lack alignment with acculturation science and fail to target modifiable, drinking-related factors. To advance the field and bridge research-to-practice gaps, studies should move beyond broad demographic markers and examine systematically the psychological and social pathways linking acculturation to alcohol use. We advocate for the adoption of context-specific measures, daily life study methods to capture acculturation’s dynamic effects on drinking, and research across diverse global populations. We call for the field to integrate the acculturation framework into broader alcohol research and interventions to address individual and cultural variations in drinking behaviors, incorporate sociocultural influences into existing models of alcohol use to bridge gaps in generalizability, and enhance intervention effectiveness.",

Across six studies, we tested the possibility that simulation affects decisions by making people more likely to choose options they simulate. Study 1 first established a correlation between how much people naturally simulated an option for an upcoming personal decision over one week and the likelihood that they would choose that option. Studies 2a and 2b demonstrated that simulation caused a small but significant increase in the likelihood a person would choose the simulated option for their personal decision relative to a non-simulated option. Finally, Studies 3, 4a, and 4b, revealed that simulation shapes decisions in controlled laboratory experiments where options were matched on initial preference. This work suggests that episodic simulation may contribute to a feedback loop, reinforcing preferences by making people more likely to choose options they simulate.",

By drawing on and extending warranting theory, this paper examined how source roles (self vs. third party) and writer labels (AI vs. human) interact to affect impression formation and message effects in the AIMC setting of hotel reviews. Two pre-registered experiments (Study 1: N = 461; Study 2: N = 444) found that, for the same hotel review, third-party reviewers were perceived more favorably than self-reviewers (i.e., hotel managers), leading to more positive evaluations of the hotel. Reviews attributed to AI writers negatively impacted impressions of the reviewer and diminished the review’s impact, with third-party reviewers more negatively affected by AI writer labels than self-reviewers. AI labels of user-generated content can therefore move people out of their default impression formation state. We demonstrate theoretical advancements for warranting theory and AIMC.",

The phenomenological gap between culture-level ecological variables and individual complexity is large, and yet socio-ecological theory suggests the larger cultural context could systematically influence individual thought complexity. The present 3 studies evaluate this relationship by using culture-level ecological stressors to predict individual integrative complexity of political speeches (Studies 1 and 2) or a survey of socioecological stressor recognition to predict the complexity of open-ended opinion statements from laypersons (Study 3). Specifically, Study 1 evaluated political speeches across 9 nations from 1990 to 2023, and Study 2 evaluated political speeches across 50 U.S. states from 2000 to 2023. Increased culture-level resource scarcity was associated with lower individual-level complexity in both Studies 1 and 2, but increased economic inequality/diversity was associated with lower complexity only across nations in Study 1. Using a nationwide survey of American participants, Study 3 showed that increased awareness of socioecological stressors decreased complexity. Analysis of complexity subtypes suggest these effects are likely due to both cognitive strain (all three studies) and strategic defensive of beliefs (Study 3). This multi-method, multi-national set of findings suggests that socio-ecological theories can be better applied to understand the ecological origins of complex thought.",

Yet our scientific understanding of how we express positive emotions is largely based on posed displays. Here, we empirically test how 22 positive emotions are expressed on the face using the participant-negotiated episodic recall method. European respondents (n = 163) narrated emotional events from their lives (data collected from 2018 to 2020). Frequency analyses of the extracted facial expressions (67, 279 datapoints) mostly supported our pre-registered hypotheses for each of the 22 emotions. The results from our confirmatory analyses are illustrated with the aid of animated videos: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pTz_cObpFEYs5hsGUGOPVjUd0nq0Acgt?usp=drive_link. We also applied network models to exploratorily probe whether discrete positive emotions would be associated with specific patterns of facial behaviors. Consistent patterns of facial expressions were found for 19 positive emotions; some were simple (e.g., hope, interest), while others were highly complex and involved multiple facial actions (e.g., amusement, triumph). Together, these results provide a tentative map of what specific positive emotions look like when spontaneously shown on the face. Importantly, none of the positive emotions were expressed merely by smiling alone, demonstrating that people show that they feel good in a wide range of qualitatively different ways.",

While social context influences prosocial behavior in healthy individuals, its role in the development of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. We hypothesized that situation-specific prosocial behaviors would predict long-term psychiatric symptoms in individuals with common psychiatric disorders. \n\nMethod. In a 1-year longitudinal cohort study (n = 4484 at baseline), we followed a population sample with self-reported psychiatric disorders to investigate if six situation-specific prosocial behavior subtypes were associated with and predictive of alcohol use, substance use, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Prosocial behaviors were assessed at baseline, while psychiatric symptoms were measured at baseline and monthly. Multiple regression and latent class linear mixed models were used to identify associations and predictions.\n\nResults. Reduced anonymous prosociality at baseline was associated with (β = -.250, p = .007) and predictive of (β = -.025, p = .005) later alcohol use. Increased public prosociality was associated with (β = .226, p = .011) and predictive of later substance use (β = .024, p = .002), and increased emotional prosociality was associated with (β = 1.17, p &lt; .001) and predictive of later anxiety symptoms (β = -.128, p &lt; .001). No predictive effects were found for depressive symptoms.\n\nConclusions. Situation-specific prosocial behaviors predict subsequent alcohol use, substance use, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatric disorders. Our findings suggest that prosocial subtypes may inform both risk and resilience factors and can guide prevention efforts and mental health treatments.",

Language is conceptualized as a dynamic system balancing conventional semantics with context-related pragmatic functions. We discuss the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying semantic construction and pragmatic inference, emphasizing their interdependencies. Findings on the neural correlates of pragmatic processes, such as speech acts and conversational implicatures, challenge traditional distinctions and reveal fluid boundaries across the continuum. Case studies on turn-taking and gesture pragmatics illustrate the utility of integrating annotated naturalistic data with neurophysiological methods to investigate communicative language use. By leveraging multimodal frame-semantics based annotation of naturalistic datasets, this work provides critical tools to understand how meaning emerges and operates at the interface of linguistic form, meaning, and social interaction, paving the way for refined neurophysiological mapping methods of linguistic phenomena.",

Two studies reveal unique patterns for each construct in predicting IWAH across levels (i.e., community, country, &amp; all humanity): while perceived moral similarity predicts IWAH across levels, social hope predicts IWAH within community and country, and PSSA predicts IWAH globally. Study 2 experimentally manipulated each construct and found that the social hope task increased IWAH across levels. Both perceived moral similarity and PSSA tasks increased IWAH within community, with smaller but similar effects on global IWAH.

The current research builds theory regarding when and why the business case for diversity increases versus decreases support for diversity. Drawing on Prospect Theory, we first demonstrate that increasing diversity is viewed as risky because diversity is perceived as having more upsides, but also more downsides, compared to homogeneity. Next, we theorize that, although the business case for diversity is typically framed in terms of the benefits that diversity offers (i.e., gain-frame), the business case is more likely to boost support for diversity when framed in terms of the losses that diversity can prevent (i.e., loss-frame). Finally, we theorize that because risk perceptions are the underlying mechanism, the differential effects of a gain versus loss framing for the business case are more likely to emerge when people have stronger perceptions of diversity as risky. Seven multi-method studies, including surveys, archival analyses, and experiments, support our model of diversity as risky and offer important insight into how to increase support for diversity.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the experience of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth varies across regions with high and low levels of stigma (e.g., laws, policies, and cultural norms that limit the lives of individuals with stigmatized identities). Some evidence suggests that stigma can undermine response to individual-level psychosocial interventions among youth, creating the need to identify factors that may buffer against minority stressors’ effects in high-stigma contexts. Social support may be one such factor. Therefore, among LGBTQ+ youth who received a digital, single-session intervention (SSI) focused on minority stress, we investigated whether structural and internalized stigma and social support predicted intervention response, independently or interactively. Specifically, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth in environments characterized by high stigma would report weaker SSI responses. Further, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth who perceived higher social support would report stronger SSI responses. We also tested structural stigma and social support as moderators. Using data from a previously-completed randomized evaluation, we analyzed data from 244 LGBTQ+ adolescents, aged 13 to 16 years, across 181 counties in 46 U.S. states, who engaged with the SSI. We created a factor representing structural stigma using confirmatory factor analysis at the county level. No evidence emerged for structural stigma or social support as a moderator of intervention effects on internalized stigma, identity pride, or mental health-related outcomes, either at post-intervention or at 2-week follow up. Results speak to the potentially broad utility of the SSI tested in this trial for LGBTQ+ youth with limited access to mental health support.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Extant survey measures of subjective response to alcohol, an important risk factor for alcohol problems, query the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects but do not consider how intensely individuals experience them. We tested whether new measures of the intensity of alcohol effects, alongside the “number of drinks,” contributed uniquely or interactively in predicting alcohol problems. We examined associations among these subjective response variables with race and sex assigned at birth. Method: Participants (N=246; 18-50 years; 44.3% Black; 55.7% White; 58.4% assigned female; 41.6% assigned male) were oversampled for alcohol-related risk and completed an online survey. Participants reported the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects (ASQ; Fleming et al., 2016), the intensity of these alcohol effects, alcohol-related problems, and covariates (heavy drinking frequency, tolerance, demographics). Results: According to confirmatory factor analyses, two factors underlay the ‘number of drinks items (“stimulation-number of drinks,” “sedation-number of drinks”), and the same for the alcohol effect intensity items (“stimulation intensity,” “sedation intensity”). Stimulation intensity and sedation-number of drinks were significantly associated with, and interacted to predict, alcohol problems; individuals reporting both greater stimulation intensity and needing more drinks to experience sedation showed greatest risk. Black relative to White individuals reported greater intensity of, and needing more drinks to feel, stimulation. Male relative to female individuals reported needing more drinks to feel sedation. Conclusions: Participants’ self-reports of the intensity of alcohol effects may capture an important aspect of subjective response that could improve existing survey-based measures of this important alcohol-related risk factor.",

          "authors": "Annika Boldt; Yishu Sun; Kobe Desender",
          "abstract": "When assessing our decisions, the normative strategy involves giving equal weight to each evidence sample when computing confidence. However, recent findings suggest that the brain tends to overweight decision-congruent information when forming confidence judgements (i.e., positive-evidence bias). Here, we re-analyzed nine datasets from human participants who judged the average color of eight shapes and gave their confidence. This task precisely allowed us to disentangle the impact of choice-confirming and choice-conflicting evidence on the formation of confidence. Strikingly, participants overly relied on evidence that conflicts with their choice, contrary to the normative model and the PEB. To explain this response-incongruent evidence effect in the computation of confidence, we fitted an extended log-posterior-ratio for confidence model to our data and show that the same robust averaging principle that influences decisions also accounts for these confidence effects: incongruent evidence receives a stronger weight in the computation of confidence because it lies closer to the category boundary around which there is heightened sensitivity. In a preregistered experiment, we then empirically demonstrate that an experimentally induced shift in the category boundary affects the computation of confidence in otherwise identical stimuli. We conclude that confidence depends on dis-confirmatory evidence due to downstream consequences from decision-making mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Recent years have seen multiple reports of disruptive behaviour at live music events, leading many to question the capacity of audiences to regulate their behaviour. This matters both for positive audience experience and for crowd safety. Whilst some previous studies have examined violence in music audiences, there is almost no research looking at the current phenomenon of varied forms of disruption, the psychological antecedents of disruptive behaviour, and potential mitigations. We report three studies addressing these questions experientially, observationally, and statistically, with interviews (n = 27), an ethnographic field study (n performances = 13, n interviews = 44), and a pre-registered questionnaire survey (n = 2,025). Results suggest that audience perceptions of disruption are partly contingent upon perceived group norms. Reports of disruption are more likely to occur where there is normative misalignment between disparate groups in attendance at the same event. Audience members do attempt to regulate each other’s behaviour, based on expectations of support and normative alignment, but some interventions can themselves be disruptive. We offer recommendations to venues and event organisers on how to reduce disruptive behaviour, based on social identity and group norms.",

          "abstract": "Cybersickness, or sickness caused by virtual reality (VR), represents a significant threat to the usability of VR applications. Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

          "abstract": "The capacity of music to alleviate stress has been the subject of extensive research. Yet, findings from laboratory studies remain inconsistent, which has been linked to heterogeneity of the music stimuli used. To address the need for standardized, pre-tested music stimuli, we developed the Music for Stress Alleviation (MUSA) playlists and conducted an initial validation of their effectiveness. Six playlists were curated for stress reduction, containing instrumental music with a low tempo, low arousal, and neutral to positive valence, and representing various genres (piano, ambient, jazz, lounge, guitar, and lo-fi). Sixty healthy female participants were assigned to one of the six playlists. Pre- and post-listening, we measured participants’ affective states using the Relaxed Positive Affect (RPA) and Safe/Content Positive Affect (SCPA) scales of the Types of Positive Affect Scale, and the Good-Bad and Calm-Nervous dimensions of the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire. All playlists led to significantly increased RPA (medium-to-large effect sizes), while a subset also enhanced SCPA, Calm, and Good mood. Participants rated the playlists as highly relaxing. These findings provide initial evidence of the effectiveness of the MUSA playlists for music-induced stress relief. Further studies in larger and stressed samples are needed to confirm and expand on these findings.",

The present work explores the relationship between identification with all humanity (IWAH) and three constructs largely overlooked in related work: perceived moral similarity across humanity, perceived similarity of oneself to animals (PSSA), and hope for society (i.e., social hope). Two studies reveal unique patterns for each construct in predicting IWAH across levels (i.e., community, country, &amp; all humanity): while perceived moral similarity predicts IWAH across levels, social hope predicts IWAH within community and country, and PSSA predicts IWAH globally. Study 2 experimentally manipulated each construct and found that the social hope task increased IWAH across levels. Both perceived moral similarity and PSSA tasks increased IWAH within community, with smaller but similar effects on global IWAH. These findings provide novel insight into causal mechanisms underlying IWAH, with implications for interventions fostering global human identification.",

A key conundrum is why their prognoses are often poorer than children with evidenced brain lesions. How can children with early focal lesions acquire language so well compared with children with DLD who do not present with gross neurological abnormalities? A possibility raised by Dell and Chang (2013) is that learning is fundamentally derailed by an exemplar-based learning style. Such a process has been robustly demonstrated in studies of artificial neural networks. This theoretical article discusses exemplar theory, the role exemplars may play in language development, and surveys evidence suggesting an exemplar-based learning style in DLD. It concludes that this provides an interesting new approach to both explaining the condition, and designing new therapies.",

We present a large-scale cross-cultural study examining aesthetic preferences across five distinct modalities extensively explored in the literature: shape, curvature, colour, musical harmony and melody. Our investigation gathers 401,403 preference judgements from 4,835 participants across 10 countries, systematically sampling two-dimensional parameter spaces for each modality. The findings reveal both universal patterns and cultural variations. Preferences for shape and curvature cross-culturally demonstrate a consistent preference for symmetrical forms. While colour preferences are categorically consistent, relational preferences vary across cultures. Musical harmony shows strong agreement in interval relationships despite differing regions of preference within the broad frequency spectrum, while melody shows the highest cross-cultural variation. These results suggest that aesthetic preferences emerge from an interplay between shared perceptual mechanisms and cultural learning.",

Participants completed measures of dark personality traits and made decisions about sharing others' personal information in pre-test and post-test conditions with varying levels of incentives. Results indicated no significant relationship between dark triad scores and decisions to share information in the initial introduction stage or in the presence of incentives. Additionally, no significant difference in dark triad scores was found between individualistic and prosocial groups based on social value orientation.

          "abstract": "Objective: Extant survey measures of subjective response to alcohol, an important risk factor for alcohol problems, query the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects but do not consider how intensely individuals experience them. We tested whether new measures of the intensity of alcohol effects, alongside the “number of drinks,” contributed uniquely or interactively in predicting alcohol problems. We examined associations among these subjective response variables with race and sex assigned at birth. Method: Participants (N=246; 18-50 years; 44.3% Black; 55.7% White; 58.4% assigned female; 41.6% assigned male) were oversampled for alcohol-related risk and completed an online survey. Participants reported the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects (ASQ; Fleming et al., 2016), the intensity of these alcohol effects, alcohol-related problems, and covariates (heavy drinking frequency, tolerance, demographics). Results: According to confirmatory factor analyses, two factors underlay the ‘number of drinks items (“stimulation-number of drinks,” “sedation-number of drinks”), and the same for the alcohol effect intensity items (“stimulation intensity,” “sedation intensity”). Stimulation intensity and sedation-number of drinks were significantly associated with, and interacted to predict, alcohol problems; individuals reporting both greater stimulation intensity and needing more drinks to experience sedation showed greatest risk. Black relative to White individuals reported greater intensity of, and needing more drinks to feel, stimulation. Male relative to female individuals reported needing more drinks to feel sedation. Conclusions: Participants’ self-reports of the intensity of alcohol effects may capture an important aspect of subjective response that could improve existing survey-based measures of this important alcohol-related risk factor.",

          "abstract": "The subordinate meaning of a homonym becomes temporarily more accessible after it is encountered, an effect termed word-meaning priming. Over the longer-term, word-meaning priming is better maintained across periods of sleep compared with wakefulness. This has been explained as sleep actively consolidating episodic memories related to recent linguistic events (Gaskell et al., 2019). Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating whether word-meaning priming can be boosted following sleep using targeted memory reactivation (TMR), a technique of biassing specific memories for sleep-based consolidation by presenting information-associated sensory cues during sleep. Experiment 1 confirmed that word-meaning priming is elicited with the inclusion of encoding instructions that are necessary for a TMR manipulation. In Experiment 2, 40 (of 80) homonyms were primed toward their subordinate meaning in an exposure phase via a sentence, which was also associated with an auditory cue (the homonym) for TMR. Participants then took a ~2 hour nap, where half of the cues from exposure (memory cues) were replayed with the aim of strengthening the subordinate sentence meaning, along with 20 cues that had not been encountered previously (control cues). After sleep, there was an overall word-meaning priming effect, however there was no additional benefit of TMR on priming, nor did TMR benefit the recall of contextual information. Interestingly, there was an increased sleep spindle/beta band power response to memory cues relative to control cues, indicating cue-evoked memory reprocessing during sleep. These findings imply a bounded role of sleep in actively consolidating linguistic-related memories.",

This study translated and validated the Touch Experiences and Attitudes Questionnaire (TEAQ) in an Italian sample with the aim of offering a culturally appropriate tool to assess diverse touch-related behaviors and attitudes. The Italian TEAQ was administered to 301 participants aged 20 to 66 years (M = 31.78, SD = 10.02). A multidimensional graded response model and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to establish construct validity, while convergent validity was assessed through correlations with the Touch Avoidance Measure (TAM) and Touch Avoidance Questionnaire (TAQ). Discriminant validity was evaluated using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), and associations with mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS) were also examined. Gender differences in touch attitudes and experiences were assessed.\nResults demonstrated good fit indices and supported the original six-factor structure: Friends and Family Touch (FFT), Current Intimate Touch (CIT), Childhood Touch (ChT), Attitude to Self-Care (ASC), Attitude to Intimate Touch (AIT), and Attitude to Unfamiliar Touch (AUT). Internal consistency was high across subscales (Cronbach’s α: 0.81–0.92). Significant correlations between TEAQ subscales and TAM/TAQ scores indicated good convergent validity, while generally low correlations with BFI traits supported discriminant validity, aside from expected associations with Extraversion and Agreeableness. Significant correlations between TEAQ subscales and MTS screening tool scores underscored the role of sensory processing in touch experiences. Gender differences were consistent with cross-cultural findings, with females scoring higher on FFT, CIT, and ASC, and males scoring higher on AUT.\nThese results confirm the reliability and validity of the TEAQ within the Italian context, underscoring its utility for assessing touch attitudes and experiences. Future research should explore broader applications across varied demographics and clinical populations, especially because of the possible post-pandemic changes of attitudes towards touch.",

          "abstract": "Creative ideas often stem from a deliberate process involving the exploration and exploitation of our existing knowledge. This study explores the cognitive mechanisms behind creative problem-solving, focusing on the phases of idea generation and evaluation in the Remote Associates Test (RAT). Generating novel ideas relies on an effective, goal-directed search through semantic memory, while evaluation requires the careful assessment of potential ideas for their appropriateness. These phases are analogous to semantic control processes, which manage the search, manipulation and selection of knowledge in line with specific goals. The current work investigates how individual differences in these cognitive processes relate to performance in divergent and convergent thinking tasks, by deconstructing the standard RAT to isolate generation and evaluation processes. Further, we examined the role of retrieval strategies, specifically clustering (grouping related concepts) and switching (moving between different areas of semantic space), in creative thought. Our findings indicate that the ability to generate ideas under multiple constraints predicts fluency in divergent thinking tasks, while strong evaluation skills may inhibit originality. Furthermore, the analysis of clustering and switching strategies reveals that effective semantic search involves a balance between deep exploration of specific conceptual areas and broad exploration across different semantic clusters. These findings suggest that multiple strategies can lead to creative success, underscoring the importance of flexible cognitive strategies in navigating the semantic space during creative problem-solving.",

Health professionals are seeking specific evidence-based education to equip them with the knowledge needed to advise, and recommend community-based programmes and creative arts therapies. The current review seeks to understand ‘What is known about how visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing are embedded in health and medical education?’. Given that Creative Health is a general term that can be applied to a vast array of activities the current scoping review focuses on visual and performing arts, to facilitate more specific discussions.\n\nMethods\nA systematic search across six different databases [CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, AMED, Proquest Dissertations, and Web of Science] identified 6090 papers. The core search terms were 1. Visual arts; performance arts and creative writing 2. Tertiary education and 3. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the characteristics learning activities. Thematic analysis was used to identify the intended learning outcomes from visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing in health professional education. \n\nResults\nOf the 6417 articles originally identified, 284 studies were included in the analysis from 34 different countries. Nursing was the most represented profession, followed closely by medicine. An extremely wide range of art practices were identified including graffiti, sculpture, clowning, cinematic arts, music, creative writing, poetry, dance, photo, and art viewing. The review characterises how visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing are currently being used, including the group size, setting, engagement style, and collaboration with creative practitioners. Surprisingly, only 10% of studies identified educated professionals on the evidence base underpinning creative interventions and therapies, and no mention of social prescribing was identified. Finally this review highlights that professional development (promoting empathy, communication, preparedness for practice, negative attitudes), clinical practice (critical thinking, specialist knowledge, clinical skills), and personal development (self-awareness, wellbeing) are the intended learning outcomes from visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing in health professional education.\n\nDiscussion\nThis review highlights the need for more educational provision in relation to patient-focussed outcomes, in community arts, creative arts therapies, and social prescribing. Future curricula could engage arts practitioners and cultural spaces more directly to support experiential learning approaches and evaluate creative techniques to identify if they can enhance student learning. Together these findings will equip medical educators and creative practitioners to join forces to develop engaging opportunities for authentic creativity, that are matched to specific learning outcomes mandated by professional registration bodies.",

          "abstract": "A metacognitive learner acts in a planful way, monitors their progress, flexibly adapts their strategies, and reflects on their learning. Unsurprisingly, a metacognitive approach to learning is an important predictor of children’s academic performance and many attempts have been made to promote metacognition in young children. The current meta-analytic study evaluates the impact of such metacognition interventions on outcomes related to self-regulated learning and academic achievement in typically developing pre- and elementary school children. Structural, content-related, and methodological moderators were tested in this study including 349 effect sizes from 67 studies. An overall effectiveness of metacognition interventions was evidenced at immediate post-test g = 0.48 (95% CI [0.35, 0.61]), and at follow-up g = 0.29 (95% CI [0.17, 0.40]). Interestingly, metacognition interventions effectively enhanced children’s self-efficacy only at follow-up, suggesting that the positive impact of these interventions can unfold over a protracted period. For the first time, children’s executive functions were considered as outcome variables and results indicated a positive impact of metacognition interventions on these variables. One notable finding was that interventions that were delivered by teachers or task materials were more effective than interventions that were delivered by researchers for two outcomes related to self-regulated learning. This finding may reflect recent improvements in how teachers and researchers collaborate to develop intervention programs. The study supports and extends existing evidence that young learners benefit from metacognition interventions in myriad ways and provides novel insights relevant for pedagogical practice and theories of self-regulated learning.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between family affluence, an indicator of socio-economic status, and the mental well-being of approximately 20,000 children and young adults in Flanders, using data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. To understand this relationship, we assess the mediating roles of physical activity and dietary behavior.\n\nTraditional mediation analysis approaches, such as the parallel mediation model within the Baron and Kenny framework, have been criticized for producing path-specific effects that lack clear causal interpretation. In contrast, the counterfactual framework for causal inference introduced natural direct and indirect effects, enhancing clarity around the assumptions required for effect identification. However, natural effects face practical limitations: they may provide limited insights into real-world interventions and are difficult to identify when multiple mediators share unmeasured common causes or when the causal structure is unclear.\n\nIn this paper, we address these challenges using interventional direct and indirect effects, which require fewer assumptions for identification and offer greater relevance for policy interventions. Our analysis demonstrates robust evidence for the mediating role of physical activity in the association between family affluence and mental well-being. In contrast, the mediating role of dietary behavior is less substantiated. These findings indicate that interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity among children and young adolescents with low socio-economic status could potentially improve their mental well-being.",

Answering this question can help to identify the building blocks of a happy life, but little is known about what makes some days better than others. To identify the ingredients of a good day, we used interpretable machine learning techniques to assess how time spent on over 100 activities predicted whether Americans rated their day as typical or “better than typical.” Using data from the 2013 (N = 9286) and 2021 (N = 6196) waves of the American Time Use Survey, we identified clear tipping points that distinguish better days from typical ones. Socializing was one of the most important activities for having a good day, but beyond 2 hours, additional socializing had little impact. Time spent with friends, in contrast, had an almost boundlessly positive effect. The impact of working was also highly time contingent. We found that working for up to six hours had no impact on whether people rated their day as better than usual. When individuals worked for more than six hours though, the effects rapidly turned negative. Taken together, our results suggest that good days emerge from the constantly shifting value of time; each minute in a day represents a choice between competing opportunities, with clear tipping points when benefits diminish and costs mount.",

          "authors": "Nivedita Bhaktha; Henning Silber; Clemens M. Lechner",
          "abstract": "Self-administered surveys are widely used in research across diverse disciplines. One of the major concerns for researchers working with self-administered surveys is the quality of the survey responses. Low-quality responses threaten the validity and replicability of studies and can lead to spurious within-group variability, lower reliability, and potential errors during hypothesis testing. To characterize response quality in a given dataset and detect potentially problematic responses or respondents, the recent literature has proposed many response quality indicators. However, this literature is scattered and suffers from a lack of conceptual and terminological clarity, which limits the practical utility of the indicators that have been proposed. This paper aims to contribute to overcoming these problems. Based on a structured review of existing response quality indicators, we propose a unifying conceptual framework for response quality issues in multi-item surveys. This framework proposes a tripartite distinction between (1) response styles, (2) insufficient effort responding, and (3) invalid responding. It also delineates the relationship between different response quality indicators and the response quality issue(s) they measure. The framework thus establishes a common theoretical point of reference and unified terminology for future work on response quality.",

The present study examined the extent to which age is associated with perceptions of good human and device teammates using latent factor analyses of responses to a large-scale survey. Results indicate that perceptions of good characteristics of technology, but not human, teammates change with age, particularly for aspects related to objective task performance and interpersonal communication. We demonstrate that these relationships are related to factors such as individual differences in anthropomorphism across the lifespan. These results underscore the importance of accounting for individual differences in perceptions of technology related to age.",

A neurobiological account of these prosodic rhythms is thus likely to benefit from insights on the neural coding principles underlying co-speech gestures. Here we consider a role for the information processing capacity of the vestibular system, a sensory system that encodes movements of the body, in the neural representation of prosody. Careful review of the vestibular system’s functional organization as a hierarchical and predictive system, its relevance for rhythmic sound sequences, dynamic attention, and its involvement in vocalization suggests vestibular codes may be important for the neural tracking of speech. As the kinematics and time course of co-speech movements mirror prosodic fluctuations in spoken prosody, we argue that the vestibular system helps encode and decode these prosodic features in multimodal discourse and possibly during auditory speech processing alone.",

In this study, we simultaneously recorded data from eight EEG channels using the low-cost OpenBCI Cyton and the high-cost, state-of-the-art Brain Vision BrainAmp. We analyzed three well-studied event-related brain potential (ERP) components (P3b, N4, ERN) and found that there were no significant differences between the signals recorded from the BrainAmp and Cyton, and that both amplifiers adequately captured all three components.

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts, but the extant literature repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. Researchers did not distinguish between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence, which may explain their somewhat unexpected results. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionism (i.e., perfectionistic standards) and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionism should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionism. We concluded that pursuing excellencism rather than perfectionistic standards should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Our results support the need to separate the pursuit of high and perfectionistic standards to better understand the sport motivation of perfection strivers. Our findings with sport participants are relevant to recreational sporting activities in which people participate mostly out of autonomous motivation.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

Although this method of data collection offers notable benefits such as access to more diverse samples and lower study costs, it is possible that rates of inattentive or otherwise invalid response patterns are more common when survey completion occurs without any oversight. To answer this question, undergraduate student participants (final n = 678; 65% women, 76% White/European American) were randomly assigned to complete a battery of self-report surveys either in a typical laboratory administration setting (in person) or remotely from the location of their choosing. Following a preregistered analytic plan, data from both conditions were screened using multiple methods for self-report data validation, including the use of embedded and stand-alone validity scales, response timing, and identification of multivariate outliers. Results showed null-to-small differences between survey administration conditions. However, differences between screening methods in the proportion of data flagged as “invalid” emerged.

Collective narcissism predicts (1) intergroup violence in escalating conflicts between antagonistic groups of comparable power (e.g., religious, political); (2) resistance or progressive violence, in which historically disadvantaged groups mobilize to challenge existing power structures; and (3) reactionary, supremacist, or state violence, in which traditionally advantaged groups seek to preserve and expand their dominance.

This study aimed to address this gap and deepen our understanding of how autistic youth experience loneliness. Specifically, the study investigated how autistic young people conceptualise loneliness, how they experience loneliness across different contexts, and what strategies they employ to cope with this feeling. Eleven autistic participants, aged 10 to 16, were interviewed online. The study used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to analyse the data. Four Group Experiential Themes (GETS) and twelve subthemes emerged. The four themes included: (1) conceptualisation of loneliness, (2) subjective experience of loneliness, (3) communicating feelings of loneliness, and (4) social interactions and networks. Findings revealed that participants distinguished between loneliness and aloneness, experienced various emotions and physical sensations linked to loneliness, and perceived their experiences differently at home and school. Most felt misunderstood if they shared their loneliness and preferred coping alone through enjoyable activities. The study highlights the need for clinicians to engage young autistic people in discussions about loneliness, offer safe spaces to share experiences, and design interventions specifically for their needs.",

Utilizing a leading AI detection tool, we analyzed over 1 million complaints and identified a significant increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. We establish a causal relationship between LLM usage and an increased likelihood of obtaining relief by employing instrumental variables to address endogeneity in LLM adoption. Experimental data further support this link, demonstrating that LLMs enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of consumer narratives. Our findings suggest that facilitating access to LLMs can help firms better understand consumer concerns and level the playing field among consumers.

Recent work by Mislavsky &amp; Gaertig (2022) shows that people sometimes employ different strategies when combining verbal versus numeric forecasts about the likelihood of future events. Specifically, likelihood judgments based on two verbal forecasts (e.g., “rather likely”) are more often extreme (relative to the forecasts) than are likelihood judgments based on two numeric forecasts (e.g., “70% probability”). The goal of the present research was to investigate whether advice-takers’ use of combination strategies can be sensitive to advice independence when differences in independence are highly salient and whether sensitivity to advice independence depends on the format in which advice is given. In two studies, we found that advice-takers became more extreme with their own likelihood estimate when combining forecasts from advisors who use separate evidence, as opposed to the same evidence. We also found that two verbal forecasts generally resulted in more extreme combined likelihood estimates than two numeric forecasts. However, the results did not suggest that sensitivity to advice independence depends on the format of advice.",

While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a real-time method for capturing dynamic changes in behavior, traditional tasks and surveys are often too lengthy and demanding for repeated use in clinical settings. Integrating EMA with computational approaches offers a promising solution to predict smoking behavior dynamically while addressing the practical limitations of conventional assays, paving the way for more effective and scalable interventions. To evaluate the predictive value of computational markers derived from decision-making tasks and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data for short-term (daily smoking behavior) and long-term (cessation success) outcomes, and to assess the timing and amount of data collection needed for prediction. 79 daily smokers (mean age 25.64 years, 83% male) took part in a longitudinal experimental study involving EMA surveys of psychological states and decision-making tasks, delivered daily via a smartphone app, while undergoing a 5–6 week smoking cessation program. Using a machine-learning methodology (adaptive design optimization, ADO) to effectively generate task variables, we estimated computational markers from just 20 to 30 trials per day, reducing task length and participants burden. A time-lagged model incorporating both computational markers and self-reported daily psychological states provided the most accurate prediction of next-day smoking behavior. Higher levels of craving, depression, and ambiguity tolerance in decision-making on the previous day were significantly predictive of increased smoking amount the following day. Smoking cessation status at the end of treatment was most strongly predicted by lower discounting rates, reduced craving and stress, a longer smoking history, and greater engagement in treatment (AUC = 0.76). Notably, models based on data collected during the first week of follow-up, either on the decision-making tasks (AUC = 0.74) or psychological variables (AUC = 0.73), demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy for end-of-treatment smoking cessation. Combining computational markers with EMA data offers a dynamic and efficient approach for predicting smoking behavior and cessation success and holds promise for clinical applications.",

In the current work, using a photo elicitation method, we prioritize the perspectives of gender-diverse perceivers (N = 44) to answer fundamental questions about the representation of gender diversity in psychological stimuli. Participants overall indicated that existing stimuli failed to represent naturalistic gender diversity, and that the representation of gender diversity in stimuli is an important goal. However, participants voiced concerns about how this representation might be executed in the research context.

          "authors": "Luca Bischetti",
          "abstract": "When language is used for comic purposes, it often results in shared laughter at material which, presented in another form, could be considered unfortunate or even tragic. Moreover, various forms of humor can elicit negative emotions, such as discomfort and embarrassment. This is the case for cringe humor, which blends amusement with aversive reactions. Similarly, humor related to Covid-19 carries a bittersweet tone that, in part, mirrors the emotional complexity of cringe humor. While both forms have garnered widespread popularity, the emotional impact of their combination – and whether Covid-19 humor is as challenging to watch as traditional cringe humor – remains underexplored. For this chapter, we reanalyzed data from two large-scale studies on the reactions elicited by Covid-19 humor conducted in Italy and the US during 2020. Using the k-means bottom-up clustering technique, we examined how ratings of funniness and aversiveness align instances of pandemic-related humor with cringe humor. We also explored the role of individual and cultural factors. Our semi-automatic classification revealed the existence of a cringe humor space, consistent with theoretical models of cringe humor. Relative to other heterogeneous sets of humorous instances, cringe humor is characterized by relatively low perceived funniness and high perceived aversiveness, corresponding to a predominantly negative emotional response characteristic of this type of humor. The items that share these features are analyzed through pragmatic categories developed in the General Theory of Verbal Humor, detailing the targets of humorous critiques that made their recipients humorously cringe. Additionally, our findings highlight a complex relationship between age and the experience of cringe humor: while both young and old adults had similar responses to different situations, they tended to distance themselves from specific position(s) represented and/or mocked in the cringe humor items.",

          "abstract": "Background. Antisocial behavior is a known risk factor for substance use in adolescence, but the combined effects of antisocial and prosocial behaviors are unknown. This study examined whether five types of anti- and prosocial behaviors are associated with subsequent alcohol and substance use.\n\nMethods. A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 3817 adolescents (55.3% females) aged 15 at baseline (T1) and 17 at follow-up (T2). Self-reports at T1 measured antisocial behaviors (criminal behavior, conduct problems) and prosocial behaviors (global prosociality, general trust, institutional trust). T2 measures included alcohol use (hazardous use, alcohol use disorder), drug use, and nicotine use. \n\nResults. Antisocial behaviors positively predicted all types of substance use (X2 = 5.79 to 59.07, p &lt; .001), while prosocial behaviors negatively predicted most substance use measures (X2 = -5.64 to 86.14, p = .862 to &lt; .001). After adjusting for covariance between antisociality and prosociality, it was found that conduct problems (X2 = 5.54 to 32.22, p = .005 to &lt; .001), criminal behavior (X2 = 3.61 to 33.77, p = .007 to &lt; .001), and institutional trust (X2 = -3.92 to 27.56, p = .262 to &lt; .001), were the most important predictors. \n\nConclusions. Antisocial behaviors and deficits in institutional trust at age 15 are strong and unique predictors of substance use and alcohol use disorder by age 17. This specific spectrum of social behaviors during the critical phase of adolescence is of relevance from a prevention perspective to minimize the risk of later development of substance abuse.",

In 1996, world leaders agreed to limit this temperature rise to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while aiming to keep warming below 1.5°C. In order to achieve this, changes the consumption behaviours of households and individuals are needed. To encourage such change, websites have emerged which attempt to persuade individuals to adopt more sustainable behaviours.  This study explores twenty participants’ experiences using such websites.  The study employs a qualitative, longitudinal design, and utilises the think aloud method to examine the experience of using two web-based tools, Get-Greener and Climate Hero.  The study also investigates participants’ reflections on the sustainable behaviours recommended by these tools. During the two-week period, eight participants made small behavioural changes, six of which were recommended by the tools.  Key findings highlight the importance of persuasive design elements: feedback on current behaviour via footprint calculations, customised recommendations that consider personal circumstances, and ongoing support are valued by participants.  Participants preferred small, easy-to-implement ideas, highlighting barriers to larger-scale changes such as cost, limited access to sustainable alternatives, logistical issues, and a lack of clarity about what is sustainable.  Despite a general desire to adopt sustainable practices, intrinsic motivations such as convenience and financial considerations often outweighed pro-environmental intentions. Additionally, government leadership and social norms significantly influenced attitudes toward sustainability.  Participants expressed a need for clearer guidance and collective societal support to overcome these challenges.",

          "authors": "Fleur Corbett; Nejra Van Zalk",
          "abstract": "Bilateral cochlear implantation is the typical intervention for children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss intended to support development of skills across language, cognitive, social, behavioural and academic domains. However, speech-perception outcomes post-implantation remain variable. This scoping review explores which contextual factors relate to speech perception and hearing outcomes following paediatric bilateral cochlear implantation based on themes aligned with Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory: 1) individual; 2) microsystem; 3) exosystem; 4) macrosystem; and 5) chronosystem. Twenty-three research articles met the criteria for inclusion, and the contextual factors identified ranged from the proximal context, such as individual cognitive and social development, cochlear implant usage and the home environment, to the distal context, such as socio-economic health determinants. Contextual factors were explored with a narrative synthesis approach, with methodological limitations discussed. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) criteria. Our results indicate that research on outcomes related to bilateral cochlear implantation should actively integrate and examine contextual factors in prospective, longitudinal designs. This approach will facilitate the development of interventions to target specific levels of the bioecological system, thereby improving outcomes for the paediatric bilateral cochlear implant recipient.",

          "abstract": "The Faux Pas Recognition Test (FPT) is a popular Theory of Mind (ToM) measure, which has previously been used with an open-answer format. The scoring and interpretation of this format is time-consuming and challenging. Additionally, there is currently no consensus on the correct scoring algorithm. We developed a closed answer format and compared various scoring algorithms to optimize this ToM measure. To assess the convergent and divergent validity, we compared correlations between the improved FPT and another ToM measure (the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition; MASC) and an emotion recognition test (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test; RMET). Further, we used a ROC analysis, to test which scoring algorithms could best differentiate between a community sample and three clinical samples. The results indicated that the empathy score suggested by Stone et al. (1998a) showed the highest convergent validity and lowest divergent validity. Further, it optimally differentiated between clinical and community samples. Thus, this scoring algorithm showed good construct validity, while at the same time identifying ToM impairments. Based on theoretical considerations, we also suggest to include the intention score. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting validated algorithms for more reliable and valid results.",

          "abstract": "Executing go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses toward objects can increase people's choices of go over no-go items, and of approach over avoidance items. Some theoretical accounts explain these effects as the results of merely executing these responses (i.e., action execution), while others propose that these choice effects stem from interpreting these motor responses as valenced actions (i.e., action interpretation). To test the role of action execution versus action interpretation in both go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses, we employed a recently developed training that combined both dimensions orthogonally. Participants either pressed a key or not (i.e., go/no-go) to control a shopping cart on screen, to either collect or not collect certain food items (i.e., approach/avoidance). After the training, they repeatedly chose between food items (i.e., candies) for real consumption. When the instructions framed the responses as approach/avoidance actions, participants (N = 98) preferred approach items over avoidance items, but did not show preferences between go and no-go items in their choices. In contrast, when the instructions framed the responses as go/no-go actions, participants (N = 98) preferred go items over no-go items, but did not show preferences between approach and avoidance items. Despite making the same actual responses in both instruction groups, action interpretation determined whether go/no-go or approach/avoidance actions influenced food choice. Disambiguating the interpretation of motor responses as clearly valenced and meaningful actions may therefore be a fruitful way to maximize the effectiveness of response-based behavioral interventions.",

Higher education programmes may approach this goal through content integration, meaning the extent to which instructional materials incorporate diversity content and represent minority cultures and groups in examples, data and information. This mixed-methods study explored the relation between diversity-related learning goals, content integration and students’ individual academic performance over eight consecutive first-year courses of a pedagogical sciences programme in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis of 76 instructional materials yielded that, in line with learning goals, most diversity content in instructional materials addressed ethnic and socioeconomic differences in society and education. Notably, courses with many nuanced representations of minority cultures and groups in examples (i.e., non-stigmatising representations) were also more likely to entail generalising or stigmatising examples (i.e., biased representations) in instructional materials. Next, Generalized Additive Modeling and Bayesian multilevel regression with data from 93 students (Mage = 19.88; 90% female) revealed that despite a linear relationship, neither diversity content nor diversity representation in instructional materials were related to students’ academic performance over the first year in higher education. We discuss the added value of exploring the alignment of the intended and implemented diversity-related curriculum and we recommend academic success indicators beyond academic performance for researching and creating more equitable learning environments in higher education.",

          "abstract": "Rumination has been identified as an important transdiagnostic factor in psychopathology. Traditionally studied as an intrapersonal cognitive process, rumination significantly impacts and is impacted by people’s relationships. In the present article, we propose a dynamic interpersonal approach to studying rumination, asserting that it is best understood by considering the interpersonal context in which rumination occurs. We start by outlining the traditional approach to rumination, and then provide evidence for how interpersonal processes affect rumination and vice versa. After explaining our dynamic interpersonal model of rumination (DIM-Rum), we suggest implications and future directions that require expanding current methods and collaborations. By considering people’s (intimate) relationships in the study of rumination and vice versa -the role of rumination in people’s relationships- we can develop more effective clinical interventions to improve both mental health and relationship quality.",

The most widespread explanation of this phenomenon is minority stress theory, which attributes poor mental health to stigmatization and discrimination by the rest of society. In this paper I argue that minority stress theory is not a sufficient explanation of poor mental health in sexual minorities. My arguments are based on four observations: 1) other social groups which experience or historically experienced discrimination do not suffer from poor mental health; 2) sexual minorities suffer from worse than average mental health even when they experience a low level of discrimination; 3) the quasi-experimental studies best suited to support this theory suffer from serious methodological errors; 4) a meta-analysis of genetic-biometric studies shows that most (although not all) of the disadvantage of sexual minority members disappear once familial factors are controlled for. Alternative theories are explored to explain the etiology of mental health problems in sexual minorities.",

          "abstract": "Semantic knowledge plays an active role in many well-known false memory phenomena, including those emerging from the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) task. In this experimental paradigm, indeed, humans tend to falsely recognize newly presented words via activation of other previously shown stimuli. In the present study we aimed to test what happens in cases in which no apparent prior semantic knowledge is available, like in the case of entirely novel lexical stimuli. To do so, we evaluated semantic similarity effects in a DRM task with lists entirely composed by pseudowords (or “novel words,” i.e., letter strings resembling real words but lacking assigned meanings). Semantic similarity between pseudowords were established through a distributional semantic model able to represent in a vector space, not only attested words but also unmapped strings as bags of character n-grams. Participants were instructed to memorize those lists and then to perform a recognition task. Results showed that participants false and veridical recognition increased with increasing semantic similarity between each stimulus and the stimuli comprising its list, as estimated by the distributional model. These findings extend previous evidence indicating that humans are sensitive to the semantic (distributional) patterns elicited by novel words by showing that this sensitivity can even induce humans to falsely recognize stimuli that they have never encountered in their entire lives.",

As social targets moving farer away from the center of the two-dimensional space representing prototypical humanness, they may be de(super)humanized according to the magnitude and direction of the deviation. Whereas a deviation within a certain range may not be seen as a sign of de(super)humanization, a substantial deviation may suggest subtle or even blatant de(super)humanization. Although not without limitations, the DPH model of de(super)humanization offers a new perspective to examine de(super)humanization and tackles some questions that remained unsolved in previous theoretical frameworks of dehumanization. Viable measures to capture de(super)humanization and future directions to advance the line of research on de(super)humanization are suggested.",

          "abstract": "Split-brain subjects can consciously perceive and identify two stimuli presented simultaneously but separately in opposite hemifields. Yet, they seem to lack a conscious experience of the two stimuli together, as they cannot judge whether these are the same or different. Such breakdowns in experiential or phenomenal unity would carry important implications for philosophical reflection on the essential properties of conscious experience, as well as for scientific theorising about consciousness’ neural and functional bases. Extant models support the preserved unity of split-brain subjects as subjects or agents but nonetheless admit that their right- and left-side conscious experiences are not unified in the problem cases. Here, I offer a new model that supplies the missing phenomenal unity. Based on the construct of layers of conscious experience, my model acknowledges breakdowns in local experiential layers but warrants preserved unity in global ones. A supporting argument draws on the preserved attentional capacities of split-brain subjects. My proposal goes beyond extant research in that it focuses on the conjoint phenomenology of simultaneous right- and left-side experiences, highlights the conceptual connections of phenomenal unity to attention, and discusses the impact of specific split-brain attentional capacities on the unity of right- and left-side experiences.",

While prior research has focused on the\nindependence of hemispheric function, the possibility of indirect communication via\nbodily cues remains unexplored (Gazzaniga, 2014; Haan, 2020). Previous studies on\ninterhemispheric cue-based signaling have only been conducted on individuals with an\nintact corpus callosum, leaving uncertainty as to whether such cues arise purely from\nbodily pathways or residual neural connections (Schiff, 1999; Ravignani, 2022).\nAdditionally, studies on hemispherectomy patients (individuals with only one functioning\nhemisphere) demonstrate that a single hemisphere can gradually assume control over both\nsides of the body (Vining, 1997; Pulsifer, 2004; Danelli, 2013) , raising the question of\nwhether split-brain patients retain any degree of weak ipsilateral limb control due to\nsimilar neuroplastic mechanisms (Nudo, 1996; Taub, 1999).\nThis study aims to investigate whether each hemisphere retains weak influence over\nits ipsilateral limbs and whether reaction time disparities provide evidence of an indirect\nsignaling loop. The first experiment examines motor execution accuracy when only one\nhemisphere perceives a sequenced set of limb movements, assessing whether ipsilateral\nlimb actions exhibit above-random consistency. The second experiment measures\nreaction time differences when responding to visual stimuli under ipsilateral versus\ncontralateral hemisphere dominance, testing whether indirect signaling delays motor\nresponse.\nThe expected results include measurable but weaker ipsilateral limb control, a\nsignificant delay in reaction times for ipsilateral hemisphere-initiated movements, and a\ntwo-phase response pattern indicating an initial weak cue followed by a stronger\ncompensatory signal. These findings would provide the first quantifiable evidence of\nindirect interhemispheric communication through bodily pathways, refining current\nmodels of split-brain cognition and offering new insights into neuroplasticity, particularly\nfor understanding compensatory mechanisms in both split-brain and hemispherectomy\npatients.",

While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a real-time method for capturing dynamic changes in behavior, traditional tasks and surveys are often too lengthy and demanding for repeated use in clinical settings. Integrating EMA with computational approaches offers a promising solution to predict smoking behavior dynamically while addressing the practical limitations of conventional assays, paving the way for more effective and scalable interventions. To evaluate the predictive value of computational markers derived from decision-making tasks and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data for short-term (daily smoking behavior) and long-term (cessation success) outcomes, and to assess the timing and amount of data collection needed for prediction. 79 daily smokers (mean age 25.64 years, 83% male) took part in a longitudinal experimental study involving EMA surveys of psychological states and decision-making tasks, delivered daily via a smartphone app, while undergoing a 5–6 week smoking cessation program. Using a machine-learning methodology (adaptive design optimization, ADO) to effectively generate task variables, we estimated computational markers from just 20 to 30 trials per day, reducing task length and participants burden. A time-lagged model incorporating both computational markers and self-reported daily psychological states provided the most accurate prediction of next-day smoking behavior. Higher levels of craving, depression, and ambiguity tolerance in decision-making on the previous day were significantly predictive of increased smoking amount the following day. Smoking cessation status at the end of treatment was most strongly predicted by lower discounting rates, reduced craving and stress, a longer smoking history, and greater engagement in treatment (AUC = 0.76). Notably, models based on data collected during the first week of follow-up, either on the decision-making tasks (AUC = 0.74) or psychological variables (AUC = 0.73), demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy for end-of-treatment smoking cessation. Combining computational markers with EMA data offers a dynamic and efficient approach for predicting smoking behavior and cessation success and holds promise for clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Pedagogy is a powerful way to learn about the world, and young children are adept at both learning from teaching and teaching others themselves. Theoretical accounts of pedagogical reasoning suggest that an important aspect of being an effective teacher is considering what learners need to know, as misconceptions about learners’ beliefs, needs, or goals can result in less helpful teaching. One underexplored way in which teachers may fail to represent what learners know is by simply “going through the motions” of teaching, without actively engaging with the learner’s beliefs, needs, and goals at all. In the current paper, we replicate ongoing work that suggests children are sensitive to when others are relying on automatic scripts in the context of teaching. We then look at the potential link to two related measures. First, we hypothesize that sensitivity to a teacher’s perceived automaticity will be linked to classic measures of pedagogical sensitivity and learning – specifically, how children explore and learn about novel toys following pedagogical versus non-pedagogical demonstrations. Second, we hypothesize that the development of Theory of Mind (and age differences more broadly) relate to these pedagogical sensitivities. Our online adaptation of the novel toy exploration task did not invoke pedagogical reasoning as expected, and so we do not find robust links between these tasks. We do find that Theory of Mind predicts children’s ability to detect automaticity in teaching when controlling for age. This work thus highlights the connections between sensitivity to teaching and reasoning about others’ knowledge, with implications for the factors that support children’s ability to teach others.",

These simultaneous demands can be exhausting and one strategy is to reallocate attention towards a pressing demand at the expense of others. Choosing how to allocate limited cognitive resources is the basis of many psychological theories but few have directly investigated the cognitive mechanism that drives the resource allocation process. In this paper, we present a novel joint-computational approach that highlights the central role of attentional resource allocation in dual-task environments. We present two paired experiments where participants simultaneously complete a Multiple-Object-Tracking task (MOT) alongside a Detection Response Task (DRT). In breaking with previous modeling investigations, our computational framework unites separate decision-making models under the control of a single allocation process that makes accurate predictions under a range of cognitive demands. Foremost, the current investigation provides a framework for quantifying the subjective and latent processes involved in divided attention. We discuss the theoretical implications of our approach and highlight the flexibility of decision-makers to adjust where resources are spent under dynamically shifting workloads.",

          "abstract": "Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where victims are led to doubt their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories. Despite the growing popularity of the term and purported harmful implications, empirical efforts to operationalize and define gaslighting remain sparse. This study aimed to define common features and themes of self-reported gaslighting experiences. Young adults (N=250) completed several questionnaires and open-ended prompts relating to gaslighting experiences. Using a variety of natural language processing techniques, we explore the gaslighting construct using a data-driven approach from the perspective of self-reported targets of gaslighting. These data confirm that gaslighting is a type of interpersonal manipulation aimed at making a person feel 'crazy' or doubt their memories. Romantic partners were reported to be the most common perpetrators of gaslighting, and both beneficial (e.g., awareness of manipulative people) and detrimental (e.g., self-doubt) consequences of experiencing gaslighting appear to be long-lasting. Additionally, we found that more severe, frequent, and long-lasting gaslighting experiences are associated with broader subjective memory deficits, even extending to other memories outside of the gaslighting event itself. This study highlights pervasive cognitive and psychological impacts of gaslighting, and underscores the need for further empirical research and informed clinical strategies.",

          "abstract": "A doubly-quantified sentence like 'Every bear approached a tent is ambiguous': Did every bear approach a different tent, or did they approach the same tent? These two interpretations are assumed to be mentally represented as logical representations, which specify how the different quantifiers are assigned scope with respect to each other. Based on a structural priming study, Feiman and Snedeker (2016, Cognitive Psychology) argued that logical representations capture quantifier-specific combinatorial properties (e.g., the specification of every differs from the specification of each in logical representations). We re-examined this conclusion by testing logical representation priming in Dutch. Across four experiments, we observed that priming of logical representations emerged if the same quantifiers are repeated in prime and target, but also if the prime and target contained different quantifiers. However, logical representation priming between quantifiers emerged less consistently than priming within the same quantifier. More specifically, our results suggest that priming between quantifiers emerges more robustly if the participant is presented with quantifier variation in the prime trials than if they are presented with the same quantifier in all prime trials. When priming between quantifiers emerged, however, its strength was comparable to priming within the same quantifier. Therefore, we conclude that logical representations do not specify quantifier-specific biases in the assignment of scope.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Individual differences in oral reading fluency exist beyond what can be explained by\nindividual differences in word reading accuracy. Yet there are still many unknowns about what contributes to these differences. The purpose of this study was to explore whether change in word reading accuracy from fall to winter explained additional variance in winter oral reading fluency after controlling for winter word reading accuracy.\nMethod: Fall and winter word reading accuracy and winter oral reading fluency data were collected from 215 first grade students and 119 third grade students.\nResults: Multiple regression showed that change in isolated word reading accuracy from fall to winter was a significant predictor of winter oral reading fluency above concurrent word reading accuracy in both first and third grade. Change in word reading accuracy from fall to winter was negatively associated with fluency after controlling for winter word reading accuracy such that for a given current word reading accuracy score, students were faster readers if they had smaller change from fall to winter.\nConclusion: These results suggest that for a given word reading accuracy score, it is more beneficial to reading fluency if they had been consistently achieving at that accuracy level since fall rather than showing large gains from fall. The influence of historical change even after accounting for current scores suggests the importance of early word reading accuracy proficiency in the development of automaticity above simply current accuracy levels. Future research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this association.",

Developing a digital adaptation of BAM has the potential to increase its accessibility and fill a critical gap in existing digital ED interventions, which to date have not specifically targeted anti-fat bias or fatphobia. This study applies a human-centered design approach to inform the development of a digital version of BAM.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 participants, including 17 college students with elevated ED psychopathology and 14 past BAM participants. College students with elevated ED psychopathology shared experiences with fatphobia and anti-fat bias, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Past BAM participants shared experiences with BAM, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a critical realist lens.\n\nResults: College students with elevated ED psychopathology described pervasive and harmful experiences of anti-fat bias and fatphobia, coupled with difficulties accessing action-oriented mental health support, underscoring a gap in care that a digital adaptation of BAM could address. Both groups expressed strong interest in a hybrid digital format that combines synchronous and asynchronous components for a balance of social connection and flexibility. \n\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that a digital adaptation of BAM could address unmet needs in ED prevention by providing accessible, action-oriented content focused on anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Incorporating synchronous social connection within a flexible, interactive framework may promote engagement and impact. A critical next step will involve designing and pilot testing this digital adaptation of BAM to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Background. Prevalence rates for anxiety and depression are increasing globally, outpacing the capacity of traditional mental health services. Digital Mental Health Interventions (DMHIs) offer a cost-effective solution, but user engagement is poor. Integrating AI-powered conversational agents could enhance engagement and the user experience, though AI technology is rapidly evolving, and the acceptability of these solutions remains uncertain. \n\nObjective. This study aims to understand the acceptability, engagement and usability of a conversational agent-led DMHI with human support for generalized anxiety by exploring patient expectations and experiences using mixed methods.  \n\nMethods. Participants (N=299) were offered a DMHI for up to 9 weeks and completed self-report validated measures of engagement (User Engagement Scale, UES, N=190), usability (System Usability Scale, SUS, N=203) and acceptability (Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire, SUTAQ, N=203) post-intervention. To explore patients’ expectations and experiences with the digital program, a sub-sample of participants completed qualitative semi-structured interviews before the intervention (N=21) and after the intervention (N=16), analyzed using inductive Thematic Analysis.  \n\nResults. Participants found the digital program engaging (mean UES total score = 3.7, 95%CI [3.5,3.8]), rewarding (mean UES rewarding subscale = 4.1; 95%CI [4.0-4.2]) and easy to use (SUS total score = 78.6, 95%CI [76.5, 80.7]). Participants were satisfied with the program and found it increased access to and enhanced their care (mean SUTAQ subscales = 4.3-4.9, 95% CI [4.1-5.1]). Insights from both pre and post-intervention qualitative interviews highlighted four key themes important for the acceptability of this digital program: 1) easy access to practical and effective solutions leading to tangible mental health improvements (“Accessing Effective Solutions”); 2) a personalized and tailored experience (“Personal Experience”); 3) being guided with a clear structure yet control over their journey (“Guided but in Control”); 4) fostering a sense of support facilitated by humans (“Feeling Supported”). Overall, the DMHI met expectations for theme 1, 3 and 4 yet participants wanted more personalization and felt frustrated when the conversational agent misunderstood them. \n\nConclusions. Incorporating factors important for patient acceptability into DMHIs is essential to maximize their global impact on mental healthcare. This study provides quantitative and qualitative evidence for the acceptability of a structured, conversational agent-driven digital program with human support for adults with generalized anxiety. Findings emphasize the role of design, clinical and implementation factors in enhancing engagement, highlighting opportunities for continued optimization and innovation. Scalable models with stratified human support and the safe integration of generative AI are poised to transform patient experience and enhance the real-world impact of conversational agent-led DMHIs.",

          "abstract": "People often rely on simulating the other person’s state of mind when trying to understand and predict their behaviour. Likewise, converging evidence suggests similar cognitive and neural processes are engaged when making decisions for ourselves and when predicting the decisions of others, pointing towards mental simulation as the underlying mechanism of prediction. In this study, we tested this hypothesis directly, leveraging the fact that, under the simulation hypothesis, any predictions made with a biased decision-making process should also be biased. We first induced a bias in participant’s risk perception by adapting them to contexts with high or low risks, and then asked them to predict decisions of a risk-seeking and risk-averse agent in a mediumrisk context. Our findings provide partial support for the simulation hypothesis; the adaptation manipulation resulted in biased predicted decisions, suggesting that these predictions were made with participants’ own (biased) decision-making system. Surprisingly, this behavioural effect only emerged during predictions for a risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Modeling predictions with the drift-diffusion model suggested that the prediction bias mapped onto a group difference in the risk tendency parameter when predicting for the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Furthermore, participants’ risk tendency when deciding for themselves correlated with predicted behaviour of the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent, suggesting the perceived similarity of the other agent as a mediating factor. Altogether, our findings support the view that people engage in simulating others’ decisions with their own mind, but also suggest that the perceived similarity with the other person may determine their prediction strategy.",

          "abstract": "Protecting others from harm is critical for societal well-being but is often effortful. How individuals weigh the costs of exerting effort against the benefits of avoiding harm to others is currently unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated how individuals (N = 50) decide to exert physical effort to reduce the number of painful shocks delivered to themselves and to another person. Results showed that individuals are similarly motivated to incur effort costs to reduce their pain and the pain of another person.  Specifically, we found no credible evidence that participants’ willingness to put in effort and the actual force they exerted to reduce pain differed when helping the other person versus helping themselves. Further, using computational modeling we showed little credible evidence of a difference in discounting of pain reduction by effort between self- and other-related choices. These results contrast with prior research indicating that individuals are less motivated to exert effort to gain (or avoid losing) monetary rewards for others than for themselves and demonstrate that protecting others from harm shifts individuals’ effortful behavior from prosocially apathetic to prosocially motivated. Our findings shed light on the motivational processes underlying interpersonal harm avoidance and effortful prosocial behavior and highlight the importance of the type of benefit at stake for motivating prosociality.",

Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos. However, very little is currently known about their long-term effectiveness and the mechanisms by which such treatment effects decay over time. We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (Ntotal = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms. We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions. Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.",

Peer relationships play a fundamental role in shaping students' motivation, engagement, and academic development. Explicit investigation of the interplay between motivation and peer relationships is scarce, with especially the reciprocal and dynamic nature of these interactions still being little understood and of subject of the present issue.\nAims: This special issue aims to bridge theoretical and methodological gaps in understanding how peer relationships shape and are shaped by student motivation. We explore key questions regarding the relevance of peer relationships in motivation research, the theoretical and methodological approaches applicable to this intersection, and cultural considerations in studying these dynamics.\nSamples and Methods: The special issue comprises 22 empirical and conceptual studies from diverse cultural and educational contexts, including primary, secondary, and higher education settings from multiple countries. Contributions employ varied methodologies, including longitudinal designs, social network analysis, qualitative interviews, and experience sampling, and experimental designs. \nResults: Findings highlight the bidirectional nature of peer relationships and motivation. Studies reveal that peer support, social norms, and network positioning influence motivation and academic outcomes, while students' motivational orientations also shape their peer interactions. Cultural variations suggest that the impact of peer dynamics on motivation differs based on sociocultural contexts. We synthesize these different pathways into a conceptual model.\nConclusion: This special issue underscores the need for an integrative, interdisciplinary approach to studying peer relationships and student motivation. Future studies should explore their reciprocal nature using dynamic methodologies. Understanding these interactions can inform interventions to foster motivation and engagement in educational settings.",

          "abstract": "Generalising information from ourselves to others, and others to ourselves allows for both a dependable source of navigation and adaptability in interpersonal exchange. Disturbances to social development in sensitive periods can cause enduring and distressing damage to lasting healthy relationships. However, identifying the mechanisms of healthy exchange has been difficult. We introduce a theory of self-other generalisation tested with data from a three-phase social value orientation task - the Intentions Game. We involved individuals with (n=50) and without (n=53) a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and assessed whether infractions to self-other generalisation may explain interpersonal (in)stability. Healthy controls initially used their preferences to predict others and were influenced by their partners, leading to self-other convergence. In contrast, individuals with borderline personality disorder maintained distinct self-other representations, generating a new neutral prior when learning about others. This allowed for equal predictive performance compared to controls despite reduced updating sensitivity. Furthermore, we explored theory-driven individual differences underpinning contagion. Overall, the findings provide a clear explanation of how self-other generalisation constrains and assists learning and how childhood adversity is associated with separation of internalised beliefs. Our model makes clear causal predictions about the mechanisms of social information generalisation concerning both joint and individual reward.",

In the past two decades, psychologists have made considerable progress in defining lay concepts of free will. We present the first systematic review of primary psychological evidence on how ordinary folk conceptualise free will, encompassing folk concepts, beliefs, intuitions, and attitudes about free will. A total of 1,384 records were identified following a pre-registered protocol. After abstract and full-text screening, 18 articles published from 2008 to 2020 were eligible for inclusion, comprised of 36 studies and 10,176 participants from regions including the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, and Germany. A narrative synthesis of results showed that for ordinary folk, especially the more educated population from the United States, free will is a dynamic construct centred on the ability to choose following one’s goals and desires, whilst being uncoerced and reasonably free from constraints. Results suggesting metaphysical considerations regarding consciousness, dualism, and determinism were inconclusive. Our findings provided preliminary support for a psychological model of folk conception of free will, and elucidated potential pathways mediating the effects of consciousness and dualism on free will attributions. Further research is needed to explicate the distinction between having free will and having the ability to exercise free will, as well as the cross-cultural generalizability and differences of findings on folk conceptions of free will.\nKeywords: free will, choice, folk concepts, lay beliefs, systematic review, open science",

          "abstract": "Some individuals persist in behaviors that incur harm to themselves or others. While adaptive decision-making requires integrating such punishment feedback to update action selection, the mechanisms driving individual differences in this capacity remain unclear. Here, in a sample spanning 24 countries, we used a conditioned punishment task to identify how individuals learn from and adapt to punishment. We identified three, behaviorally robust phenotypes: (1) Sensitive, who correctly inferred punishment causality and adaptively updated decisions through direct experience of punishment; (2) Unaware, who failed to correctly infer punishment causality from direct experience but corrected their decisions following an informational intervention clarifying consequences; and (3) Compulsive, who persisted in harmful decisions despite both punishment and informational intervention. These phenotypes were driven by distinct cognitive mechanisms: (1) causal inference deficits, where individuals misinterpreted punishment causality, impairing correct knowledge acquisition (remediable via targeted informational intervention); and (2) integration failure, a deficit in synthesizing causal knowledge, action valuation, and action selection that rendered decision-making inert to punishment feedback, even after targeted informational intervention. Remarkably, these phenotypes predicted longitudinal outcomes (learning trajectories, choice behavior) six months later. By identifying the cognitive mechanisms driving variation in human punishment learning, this work provides a new framework to understand why individuals persist in harmful behavior and highlights the need for approaches to address these distinct cognitive barriers to adaptive decision-making.",

The present study (N = 76,320) examined the relationship between national economic inequality and citizens' views on who is responsible for climate change mitigation. Across 72 countries, we found that citizens living in nations with greater (vs. lower) levels of economic inequality were more likely to attribute responsibility for climate change mitigation to individual people rather than governments (and businesses). This relationship was independent of GDP per capita, individuals’ belief in climate change, their perceived importance of climate change, and demographic factors. These findings may be explained by economic inequality eroding public trust, leading individuals to lose faith in the ability of governments and other institutions to implement effective systemic change. As such, economic inequality may pose a barrier to systemic climate action.",

          "authors": "Yosef Sokol",
          "abstract": "Psychological assessment using self-report Likert items suffers from numerous inherent biases. These biases limit our capability to assess complex psychological constructs such as Future Self-Continuity (FSC), i.e. the perceived connection between one's present and future self. However, recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for psychological assessment. In this paper, we introduce a novel method of psychological assessment applied to measuring FSC that uses an LLM for NLP of transcripts from self-recorded audio of responses to 15 structured interview prompts developed from FSC theory and research. 164 whitelisted MTurk workers completed an online survey and interview task. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to process the transcripts and generate quantitative scores. The resulting FSC scores (including total score, and the similarity, vividness, and positivity components) showed significant correlations with scores on the Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire (FSCQ), a well-validated Likert item measure of FSC, supporting the new method's convergent validity. A Bland-Altman analysis indicating general agreement with standard FSCQ scores, replication using an updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, and the strong correlations between NLP-based FSC scores using the two models supports the new assessment method's validity and robustness. This measurement approach can inform treatment planning and interventions by providing clinicians with a more authentic FSC assessment. Beyond FSC, this NLP/LLM approach can enhance psychological assessment broadly, with significant implications for research and clinical practice.",

While we failed to\nreplicate the specific findings from Trafimow and Hughes (2012), we did demonstrate that it is\npossible to prime death-related thoughts, and that priming is more effective when there is no\ndelay between the priming and outcome measure. Implications for future research and terror\nmanagement theory are discussed.",

          "authors": "Jinhee Kim; Meeseung Lee; Jihwan Chae; Gahyun Lim; Minyoung Kim; Hackjin Kim",
          "abstract": "Previous studies have reported automatic approach-avoidance tendencies toward various stimuli such as words, face expressions, and images in the appetitive or aversive valence domain. This work investigates whether self-relevant evaluative feedback affects theses behavioral tendencies using a touchscreen-based approach and avoidance task, in which participants responded to two-colored fish icons either by swiping down or by push away. Evaluative feedback on participants' personality traits provided by the fish served as a task-irrelevant feature. A pronounced valence-congruence effect for positive feedback relative to negative feedback was observed. Interestingly, higher social desirability ratings of social feedback were associated with faster RTs for approach trials and slower RTs for avoidance trials. Personality traits were associated with approach tendencies and avoidance tendencies: higher BFNE scores predicted a slower approach for both positive and negative feedback compared to neutral feedback, whereas higher depression symptoms predicted faster avoidance of negative feedback. This study demonstrates automatic approach and avoidance tendencies toward self-relevant social feedback, indicating a behavioral predisposition that may be automatically triggered by social feedback. Additionally, this study lays the groundwork for the development of touchscreen-based approach-avoidance tasks for measuring individual differences in the sensitivity of social feedback information and the strength of behavioral predispositions.",

          "authors": "Mario Giulianelli; Sarenne Wallbridge; Ryan Cotterell; Raquel Fernández",
          "abstract": "This study introduces a new information-theoretic model of predictive uncertainty in incremental language comprehension, which builds on and extends the computational framework of Surprisal theory. Incremental Alternative Sampling (IAS) posits that a comprehender's predictive uncertainty over upcoming linguistic units in a given sentential or discourse context is proportional to the units' representational distance from her expected alternative continuations. We formally define the information measure derived from this model—incremental information value—and situate it within the broader family of uncertainty measures. This formalism offers greater flexibility for characterising incremental prediction than the classical measure of surprisal. Our analysis focuses on the representational domain and forecast horizon of prediction; however, the theoretical framework provides a practical foundation for investigating a wide range of aspects of prediction. Results indicated that estimates of incremental information value—computed via Monte Carlo sampling of alternatives using artificial neural network language models—possess significant predictive power across various behavioural and neural responses. These include explicit predictability judgements, cloze probabilities and surprisals, as well as signatures of processing effort like eye-tracked and self-paced reading times, and event-related brain potentials. Perhaps more importantly, IAS offers insights into the potential predictive processing strategies underlying these responses: different psycholinguistic measurements are better predicted by distinct combinations of representational and temporal resolutions, as captured by different IAS models. Beyond serving as a robust cognitive model of human comprehension, IAS also provides a window into language models' predictive processing. Analysis of language model estimates of next-word surprisal through the lens of incremental alternative sampling reveals that, despite its seemingly narrow focus on the immediate next unit, next-word surprisal estimates implicitly encode predictive uncertainty over multiple future lexical items across varying levels of representation.",

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather than more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we investigate whether individuals are more willing to exert effort when surrounded by high-effort peers and less willing with effort misers. Across eight studies (N = 1,473), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally shun effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Interestingly, individuals’ effort preferences were not influenced by the behaviour of others when those others completed an unrelated task. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, there are limits to our laziness. We might be effort misers, but this miserliness appears to have a ceiling.",

This perspectives piece focuses on discussions at the colloquium about the need for more nuanced understanding about trust in science, and what research tells us about barriers and opportunities to bridge divisions in science and society. Specifically, in this piece, we highlight the potential for intellectual humility (i.e., willingness to revise one’s views and admit that one might be wrong) to ameliorate both the public’s biases toward scientists and scientists’ biases toward the public. We provide evidence that intellectual humility not only increases public engagement with science but can also reduce scientists’ (mis)conceptions about the public and one another, and we conclude with a discussion of how to foster mutual intellectual humility in science communication.",

          "abstract": "Previous research indicates that conservatives exhibit stronger disgust sensitivity than liberals, especially regarding moral disgust, but recent findings suggest that physiological responses alone do not account for differences in subjective disgust experiences. Given the role of interoception in better body-awareness and emotion regulation, we investigated whether the relationship between disgust and political ideology is moderated by interoceptive sensibility (i.e., one’s ability to be attuned to their physiology). Using survey data from 632 U.S. participants (321 Democrats, 311 Republicans), we found that high interoceptive sensibility eliminated differences in disgust sensitivity between Democrats and Republicans. In contrast, low interoceptive sensibility amplified these differences: high disgust sensitivity predicted Republican identification, while low disgust sensitivity predicted Democrat identification, especially for moral disgust.\nWe propose that when people’s ability to detect physiological changes is low, they may rely more on cognitive predictions and learned expectations to interpret their experiences. This reliance on top-down processing can lead to heightened disgust sensitivity, particularly in conservatives, due to their stronger association between moral concerns and disgust sensitivity. This research highlights the importance of interoception in political psychology, offering a novel perspective on the psychophysiological underpinnings of political attitudes, paving the way for replicable and causal studies.",

Across two experimental studies (Total N = 1,576), we examined whether these players exhibit biased judgments of researchers' competence and friendliness and whether they demonstrate selective exposure to further research. In Study 1, participants were presented with fictional, standardized research summaries that varied only in their conclusions about the effects of VVGs. In Study 2, real published studies were used to provide ecological validity. Results from both experiments revealed that habitual players formed more negative perceptions of researchers when the researchers’ conclusions conflicted with their beliefs. Causal inference and mediation analyses showed that these judgments were causally driven by participants' agreement with the conclusions, independent of the researchers’ methods or credentials. Furthermore, habitual players demonstrated selective exposure, showing less interest in engaging with research that concluded VVGs increase aggression. This disengagement was partially explained by their negative evaluations of researchers' competence. These findings reveal a reinforcing cycle in which biased perceptions of VVG researchers drive avoidance of opposing evidence, ultimately reducing engagement with the broader body of VVG research.",

Results in both studies (overall N = 1576) showed that at low VVG exposure, participants in both conditions updated their beliefs to align with the research. However, at high VVG exposure, participants maintained their belief that VVGs do not increase aggression, and at very high exposure levels, positive-effect studies led participants to believe the opposite: that VVGs reduce aggression.

          "abstract": "Objective: With two experiments (N = 1,576), we examine the causal effect of frustration on the immediate inclination to play violent video games (VVGs) and the moderating role of long-term VVG exposure.\n\nMethod: Frustration was experimentally manipulated through designated \"frustrated\" and \"not frustrated\" conditions with a novel riddle paradigm. Participants' long-term exposure to VVGs was measured to assess its moderating effect on the relationship between frustration and the inclination to play VVGs. We measured the immediate inclination to play VVGs as the outcome variable.\n\nResults: Building on the theory that players might seek catharsis in VVGs, particularly when experiencing negative emotions, we hypothesized an interaction effect, predicting a greater inclination towards VVGs among frustrated participants, especially those with higher levels of VVG exposure. In Study 1, contrary to our hypothesis, the results revealed no interaction effect between frustration and VVG exposure on the inclination to play VVGs. Instead, frustration was found to reduce the inclination to engage with VVGs across all participants, regardless of their level of exposure to such games. Hence, to replicate this finding, in Study 2, we hypothesized a negative effect of frustration, with no moderation. This hypothesis was supported by the data.\n\nConclusion: Our findings challenge the notion that frustration might increase the motivation to play VVGs for cathartic purposes. In light of our findings, we provide a critical discussion of the theory. We argue that our findings contribute to the cumulative knowledge about frustration as a specific emotion and offer new perspectives for future VVG research.",

          "authors": "Luca Bischetti",
          "abstract": "When language is used for comic purposes, it often results in shared laughter at material which, presented in another form, could be considered unfortunate or even tragic. Additionally, various forms of humor can elicit negative emotions, such as discomfort and embarrassment. This is the case for cringe humor, which blends amusement with aversive reactions. Similarly, humor related to Covid-19 carries a bittersweet tone that, in part, mirrors the emotional complexity of cringe humor. While both forms have garnered widespread popularity, the emotional impact of their combination – and whether Covid-19 humor is as challenging to watch as traditional cringe humor – remains underexplored. In this chapter, we reanalyze data from two large-scale studies on the reactions elicited by Covid-19 humor conducted in Italy and the US during 2020. Using the k-means bottom-up clustering technique, we examined how ratings of funniness and aversiveness align instances of pandemic-related humor with cringe humor. We also explored the role of individual and cultural factors. Our semi-automatic classification revealed the existence of a cringe humor space, consistent with theoretical models of cringe humor. Relative to other heterogeneous sets of humorous instances, cringe humor is characterized by relatively low perceived funniness and high perceived aversiveness, corresponding to a predominantly negative emotional response characteristic of this type of humor. The items that shared these features were analyzed through pragmatic categories developed in the General Theory of Verbal Humor, detailing the targets of humorous critiques that made their recipients humorously cringe. Additionally, our findings highlighted a complex relationship between age and the experience of cringe humor: while both young and old adults had similar responses to different situations, they tended to distance themselves from specific position(s) represented and/or mocked in the cringe humor items.",

In this paper, it will be argued that disorders can provide confident insights on how language evolved but only if discussed from an Eco-Evo-Devo perspective and within a general theory of language evolution. This claim will be illustrated by the consideration of the self-domestication account of human evolution and the evolutionary hypothesis for language that builds on it, and two prevalent cognitive disorders entailing language problems, namely, autism and schizophrenia. This approach linking ontogenetic damage to evolutionary novelty, and construing language evolution as the outcome of complex feedback loop effects between gradual changes in our body, cognition, behavior, and the environment is expected to also clarify the etiology and the symptomatology of human-specific disorders impacting on language.",

          "abstract": "Psychopathology is often characterized by intense negative emotions. Understanding how these emotions are expressed through language can provide valuable insights on emotional processing and reveal linguistic patterns associated with mental health conditions. Sentiment, or the emotional tone of language, has been linked to affective states and wellbeing, suggesting it could serve as a marker of psychopathology and therapeutic progress. However, the versatility of different approaches to measuring sentiment makes it unclear which methods are best, and they have not yet been deployed in a longitudinal therapeutic setting. This study examined whether changes in client sentiment, therapist sentiment, or their divergence tracked clients' internalizing symptoms using a large dataset of text-based psychotherapeutic exchanges. We compared 11 commonly used sentiment analysis measures across exploratory (N=3,729) and validation (N=2,500) datasets. Both client and therapist sentiment became more positive over time, mediating the link between time in therapy and decreased internalizing symptoms. Client and therapist sentiment diverged over time, with therapists becoming more positive than clients, and on months when therapists were more positive than clients, clients reported fewer internalizing symptoms. Diverse sentiment measures mostly behaved similarly, although approaches that estimate word-level sentiment and treat positivity and negativity as separate constructs tended to yield more consistent and nuanced results. These findings suggest that language sentiment can be a marker of internalizing symptoms and therapeutic progress, highlighting the potential of sentiment analysis as a tool for monitoring treatment outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities contribute to altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest combining empathy and reasoning often yields the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results highlight complementary roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

The enfacement illusion, resulting from interpersonal synchronous multisensory stimulation, causes individuals to update their facial self-representation by incorporating another person's facial features. The discovery of this illusion is not far behind us, but plenty of studies have been conducted since then. Taking into account the numerous variations in the experimental implementation and measures, the overall picture of findings on enfacement seems intricate at first sight. In order to provide a systematic summary of the overall effect of the enfacement illusion, there is time for a meta-analysis. We identified 44 publications that described experiments consisting of at least one synchronous and one asynchronous multisensory facial stimulation condition. Our aim was to (a) determine the overall effect size of the enfacement illusion, (b) evaluate the moderating effects of methodological variability, and (c) assess the presence of publication bias. The results demonstrated a robust overall medium effect size, regardless of the experimental procedures and measures employed. Despite the risk of potential undocumented methodological variation and slight publication bias, the result of this meta-analysis provides evidence that the enfacement illusion is a replicable phenomenon and that human facial self-representations are indeed malleable.",

          "authors": "Yosef Sokol",
          "abstract": "Psychological assessment using self-report Likert items suffers from numerous inherent biases. These biases limit our capability to assess complex psychological constructs such as Future Self-Continuity (FSC), i.e. the perceived connection between one's present and future self. However, recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for psychological assessment. In this paper, we introduce a novel method of psychological assessment applied to measuring FSC that uses an LLM for NLP of transcripts from self-recorded audio of responses to 15 structured interview prompts developed from FSC theory and research. 164 whitelisted MTurk workers completed an online survey and interview task. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to process the transcripts and generate quantitative scores. The resulting FSC scores (including total score, and the similarity, vividness, and positivity components) showed significant correlations with scores on the Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire (FSCQ), a well-validated Likert item measure of FSC, supporting the new method's convergent validity. A Bland-Altman analysis indicating general agreement with standard FSCQ scores, replication using an updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, and the strong correlations between NLP-based FSC scores using the two models supports the new assessment method's validity and robustness. This measurement approach can inform treatment planning and interventions by providing clinicians with a more authentic FSC assessment. Beyond FSC, this NLP/LLM approach can enhance psychological assessment broadly, with significant implications for research and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.",

It remains an open question, therefore, whether the boundary between speech and song can shift based on the context surrounding a stimulus. In Experiment 1 participants categorized stimuli which varied along a continuum from speech to song. These ambiguous stimuli were preceded by adaptor stimuli which were either unambiguous song or speech. Stimuli preceded by a speech adaptor were rated as more song-like, while stimuli preceded by a song adaptor were rated as more speech-like. In Experiment 2 data from a previous study on transformation from speech to song with repetition were re-analyzed to examine contextual effects. After hearing a stimulus which transformed into song, participants were more likely to rate the next stimulus as sounding more speech-like, compared to after hearing a stimulus which continued to sound like speech when repeated. These findings show that when listeners decide whether a stimulus is speech or song, they do not only use acoustic information but also take into account contextual information. Thus, the perceptual boundary between speech and song is not fixed.",

          "abstract": "We live in a surprisingly violent world. We experience physical assault, emotional and psychological attack, and even the intellectual violence of manipulation and indoctrination. Psychology is becoming increasingly aware not only of the prevalent violence but also of the profoundly deleterious impact of said violence on the human mind and body; however, sociology lags behind. Socialization, or our experiences at the hands of agents of socialization, is a key concept in sociology. Every introductory sociology text that is printed devotes and entire chapter to a discussion of socialization and related concepts. However rarely, if at all, is there any indication that sociologists are aware of the profoundly deleterious impact of toxicity (violence, neglect, etc.) in the socialization process. This paper seeks to alleviate this lacuna by providing concepts (toxic socialization the 5Ds of Toxic Existence) by which psychologists, sociologists and others (e.g., psychologists, parents, teachers, and anybody involved in the socialization of human beings) can more readily discuss the problem of a violence and neglect in our socialization processes.",

          "abstract": "Eye tracking has become an increasingly important tool in cognitive and developmental research, providing insights into processes that are difficult to measure otherwise. The majority of eye tracking studies depend on accurate identification of fixations and saccades in the recorded raw data through fixation filters. Subsequently, it is common to analyze whether fixations or saccades fall into specific areas of interest (AOI). \nThe choice of algorithms can significantly influence study outcomes, especially in populations with noisy data such as young children or individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. It is therefore crucial to compare and validate potential fixation filter algorithms as part of the eye tracking analysis. Here, we introduce the kollaR package, an open-source R library for performing the main steps of an eye tracking analysis from event detection, to AOI based analyses and visualizations of individual or group-level data for publications. The kollaR package was specifically designed to facilitate selection and validation of fixation filter algorithms through visualizations. \nIn a validation analysis, we show that results from fixation filtering in kollaR is consistent with the output from Tobii Pro Lab, a commercially available software. Through the use of real data from typically developed controls and participants with Fragile X syndrome and intellectual disability, we demonstrate the use of kollaR to evaluate fixation filters and identify potential threats to data validity.",

          "abstract": "Recent breakthrough advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have led to widespread concern about the proliferation of deepfake content—artificially-generated images, audio, videos, and text—that is now readily available on the internet and beyond. Highly sophisticated technologies that produce AI-generated, or synthetic, images of human faces are of particular concern because people struggle to distinguish these images from photographs of real human faces. Indeed, people are more likely to judge some synthetic faces to be human than some real human faces—a phenomenon termed AI hyperrealism. Furthermore, people trust synthetic faces more than real human faces. In this paper, we present our intervention, termed DISCERN-AI, and show how it can substantially improve people’s ability to distinguish between synthetic and real images of human faces, effectively eliminating AI hyperrealism. The intervention provides users with explicit instructions about which visual features are diagnostic for classifying real and synthetic images, while also providing comprehensive training of such classifications. Our results provide support for an easily scalable intervention that meaningfully improves detection of real and synthetic facial images.",

          "abstract": "The existence of free will has been a subject of fierce academic debate for millennia, still the meaning of the term “free will” remains nebulous. In the past two decades, psychologists have made considerable progress in defining lay concepts of free will. We present the first systematic review of primary psychological evidence on how ordinary folk conceptualise free will, encompassing folk concepts, beliefs, intuitions, and attitudes about free will. A total of 1,384 records were identified following a pre-registered protocol. After abstract and full-text screening, 18 articles published from 2008 to 2020 were eligible for inclusion, comprised of 36 studies and 10,176 participants from regions including the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, and Germany. A narrative synthesis of results showed that for ordinary folk, especially the more educated population from the United States, free will is a dynamic construct centred on the ability to choose following one’s goals and desires, whilst being uncoerced and reasonably free from constraints. Results suggesting metaphysical considerations regarding consciousness, dualism, and determinism were inconclusive. Our findings provided preliminary support for a psychological model of folk conception of free will, and elucidated potential pathways mediating the effects of consciousness and dualism on free will attributions. Further research is needed to explicate the distinction between having free will and having the ability to exercise free will, as well as the cross-cultural generalizability and differences of findings on folk conceptions of free will.\nKeywords: free will, choice, folk concepts, lay beliefs, systematic review, open science",

          "abstract": "The view that language disorders are informative of previous stages in the evolution of language is controversial. In this paper, it will be argued that disorders can provide confident insights on how language evolved but only if discussed from an Eco-Evo-Devo perspective and within a general theory of language evolution. This claim will be illustrated by the consideration of the self-domestication account of human evolution and the evolutionary hypothesis for language that builds on it, and two prevalent cognitive disorders entailing language problems, namely, autism and schizophrenia. This approach linking ontogenetic damage to evolutionary novelty, and construing language evolution as the outcome of complex feedback loop effects between gradual changes in our body, cognition, behavior, and the environment is expected to also clarify the etiology and the symptomatology of human-specific disorders impacting on language.",

          "authors": "Rebecca Emma Norman; Jennifer M Rodd; Joanne S H Taylor",
          "abstract": "Research into the effects of contextual diversity on lexical processing has flourished in the past 20 years, encompassing diverse tasks, populations, and languages, and underpinning influential theories of word learning (Nation, 2017). This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the field. Eighty-six articles (145 experiments) met our preregistered inclusion criteria, comprising three distinct experiment types; behavioural studies (N=111), computational modelling studies (N=20), and corpus validations (N=14). Across these experiments, the terminology used to refer to different diversity metrics has been applied inconsistently and somewhat arbitrarily. Behavioural studies have largely focused on word form processing (i.e., lexical decision tasks), showing consistent processing benefits for high-diversity words, regardless of the metric used. Effects of diversity on word-meaning processing were more mixed. We also review findings from a wide range of other tasks that are often overlooked (e.g., recognition memory). Computational modelling studies suggest that metrics that quantify the distinctiveness of contexts in which words are used better predict behaviour than metrics that simply count those contexts. Performance of these metrics is further improved by accounting for social patterns of language use across individuals or topics. Corpus validations show that diversity effects are consistent across languages. This review confirms that diversity in linguistic experience is a key organizational principle of the lexicon, but highlights that diversity effects vary across types of linguistic knowledge and task demands. We highlight key areas where more data is required, and make specific recommendations for improving future research based on a structured research cycle.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories are universal and have been present throughout human history, as far as we know. These facts suggest that an evolutionary account of conspiracist thinking is appropriate. This paper discusses some recent evolutionary accounts and proposes a view which builds on them, but adds a distinctive focus on the morality of cooperation. It argues that elite cover up conspiracies evolved in part as communications about the reputations of that elite concerning their credibility and trustworthiness, with the intention to persuade them to change their behaviour to be more cooperative with the rest of the population. This general picture is argued to interact with local cultural values and practices around cooperation. Applying the model to China involves considering the relations between power distance and guanxi in determining whether cases of elite collusion are viewed as morally problematic conspiracies, with the implication that many cases would not. Implications for the COVID-19 conspiracy theories in China are noted.",

Capitalizing on the availability of massive lexical databases, we evaluate the frequency with which specific number words and their combinations (e.g. “twenty-four”, “quatre-vingt-douze”) are used in six different languages. We use these data to probe the hypothesis that complex concepts arise as syntactic combinations of simpler ones in a language of thought. First, we confirm our previous report of a regular and reproducible profile of decrease in frequency with number size, with local peaks for round numbers. Second, we show that frequency varies with the simplicity of the decomposition of a number into small prime factors. Third, we demonstrate that the entire frequency profile, including its overall decrease and local peaks, can be modeled by a grammar of algebraic combinations, whereby each number arises from addition and multiplication operations on smaller numbers. Those findings strengthen the hypothesis that compositionality in a language of thought underlies the emergence of exact number concepts.",

          "abstract": "Social media is the place where most people report experiencing toxicity. While existing research has documented the prevalence and predictors of toxic behaviors, less is known about how individuals who engage in toxicity perceive and justify their actions, especially on mainstream platforms. This study addresses this gap by conducting 25 in-depth interviews with individuals who were toxic in political discussions on Facebook and Twitter. Contrary to the common depiction of toxic individuals as apolitical “trolls,” the findings reveal that many view their toxicity as a form of political participation. Three distinct justifications for using toxicity were identified: Venting political frustrations, pursuing truth through blunt deliberation, and seeking to persuade or mobilize others. These findings suggest toxicity as a deliberate, though hostile, form of political engagement and highlight the diverse functions social media serves for politically motivated users. The study calls for targeted interventions to address the distinct motivations underlying toxicity.",

          "authors": "Anandita Sabherwal",
          "abstract": "To address the multifaceted problem of climate change, individuals must perform a range of individual and collective actions. To aid this process, research has sought to understand behavioral spillover—how one action impacts the likelihood of performing other actions. Recent theorizing emphasizes environmental identity, social norms, and affect and efficacy as key psychological mechanisms underlying positive spillover. Yet, spillover effects remain small and heterogenous. This review posits that driving positive spillover at the scale needed to mitigate climate change requires social and societal scaffolding. Emergent research leverages collective processes including interpersonal and social interactions, and institutional practices to further amplify these psychological mechanisms, and bolster positive behavioral spillover. For instance, workplaces can prompt the internalization of in-role pro-environmental behavior, resulting in positive spillovers to advocacy and household behaviors. Embedding psychological processes of behavioral spillover within collective processes presents a promising avenue to drive spillover between individual and collective climate actions.",

          "abstract": "Network models are well-suited for phenomena detection, and most empirical network studies have been exploratory so far. Yet, due to the close connections between (Gaussian) networks and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), confirmatory testing and SEM fit indices are readily applicable to network modeling as well. However, no study to date has evaluated how SEM fit indices perform in confirmatory network analysis (CNA), and what criteria should be applied. This study examined the applicability of SEM fit indices and their conventional cutoff values in CNA. We employed a panel graphical autoregressive model for its generalizability to network models in both cross-sectional (Gaussian graphical models) and N = 1 time-series cases (graphical autoregressive). Using simulations, we analyzed the performance of fit indices to test hypothesized network structures and evaluate stationarity, under varying number of variables (nodes), sample sizes, and waves. Most fit indices performed well, except that Type I incremental fit indices showed high false rejection rates. Conventional SEM cutoffs are largely generalizable to CNA as preliminary assessment criteria when dynamical cutoffs are unavailable. However, we recommend using stricter cutoff values (e.g., 0.03/0.04 RMSEA and 0.96/0.97 incremental fit indices) in hypothesis testing or direct replication studies, and stricter RMSEA cutoffs (0.03/0.04) to detect network structure non-stationarity. This study validates the use of SEM fit criteria for confirmatory network psychometrics and encourages theory-testing and replication studies in network research, providing practical recommendations for using SEM fit indices in confirmatory network testing.",

          "abstract": "The increasing use of the internet for various activities has led to a rise in cybersecurity threats, placing user accounts at greater risk of compromise. To mitigate this, two-factor authentication (2FA) schemes have been implemented across various online services as an additional security layer. However, previous research has shown that setting up two-factor authentication methods is not particularly usable, resulting in a significant number of user errors. These usability challenges undermine the security benefits of 2FA by discouraging users from adopting it or leading to poorly configured setups that frustrate users, ultimately causing them to opt out. Importantly, it is not known how these challenges may vary across age groups, with older users potentially facing greater difficulties in navigating setup processes. In this study, Google’s 2FA set-up interface is redesigned using both young and older users, with a particular focus on error reduction. The results show that the new interface resulted in notably less errors and higher system visibility when compared to the previous version across both sample groups. However, errors were still made, particularly among younger participants, who had a higher error rate than the older participants. On the other hand, the older participants took longer to complete the account setup than the younger participants. Our findings suggest that users’ mental models and their familiarity with specific authentication methods may play a role in the types and frequency of errors they make during the setup process.",

          "abstract": "Particular features of the stimuli that predict significant outcomes tend to capture our attention in a rather automatic and inflexible way. This form of attention has been described as a Pavlovian bias that mimics the phenomenon of sign-tracking described in animals, where reward-predictive cues become motivational magnets. In humans, Value-Modulated Attentional Capture (VMAC) refers to a phenomenon where distractors that signal high-value outcomes receive higher attentional priority. VMAC is particularly difficult to extinguish, showing a similar persistence often described in animal sign-tracking. In the present study, we evaluated to what extent VMAC would persist using a more specific extinction procedure than previous research, where instead of removing the possibility of obtaining rewards, the different discriminant stimuli that signal reward equate its value. Furthermore, we manipulated between experiments whether the high-value distractor predicted high-reward and high-punishment contingent to response accuracy (mimicking previous research; Experiment 1) or only high-reward (Experiment 2), and also explored the association of VMAC and its persistence with measures of emotional impulsivity employed in past research. Our results show that when both rewards and punishments are possible, VMAC does not extinguish after an extensive extinction stage, nor is it associated with measures of emotional impulsivity. When punishments were removed, we showed that VMAC gradually extinguished both in response times and accuracy and that the persistence of VMAC was significantly associated with positive urgency. We discussed these results on the potential of punishments to qualitatively alter learning and response strategies employed by participants.",

This study investigated the relationship between microstates and cardiac activity by simultaneously recording EEG and electrocardiograms from 103 healthy participants during resting state. Our analysis revealed temporal associations between specific microstates and cardiac events: microstates A, D, and E showed distinct probability of occurrence throughout the cardiac cycle, with microstate A exhibiting increased probability during R and T waves of the electrocardiogram. Furthermore, the occurrence probabilities of microstates A and E varied with the phase of low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV). These findings provide evidence for the coupling between peripheral cardiac processes and central brain activity, suggesting that EEG microstate patterns reflect cardiac-related activity.",

Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a popular choice as a first approximation of within-person dynamics. The VAR model of each person and the heterogeneity across persons can be jointly modeled using a hierarchical model that captures heterogeneity as a latent distribution. Currently, the most popular choice for this is the multilevel VAR model, which models heterogeneity across persons as quantitative variation through a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, we discuss an alternative, the latent class VAR model, which models heterogeneity as qualitative variation using a number of discrete clusters. While this model has been introduced before, it has not been readily accessible to researchers. We change this with this paper, in which we provide an accessible introduction to latent class VAR models; evaluate, in a simulation study, how well this model can be estimated in situations resembling applied research; introduce a new R package ClusterVAR, which provides easy-to-use functions to estimate the model; and provide a fully reproducible tutorial on modeling emotion dynamics, which walks the reader through all steps of estimating, analyzing, and interpreting latent class VAR models.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

          "abstract": "This scoping review explored the application of predictive processing in sport and exercise science, examining how cognitive and computational models have been used to understand perceptual-motor skills, decision-making, and physical performance. The review provides a tutorial introduction to key concepts in the predictive processing literature and maps the extent of research in this area, identifying key domains of application and the level of empirical support. A systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus databases was performed, adhering to JBI methodology and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. Eighteen relevant empirical studies were discovered across all domains of sport and exercise science. Despite promising evidence, the review also uncovers significant gaps, particularly in comparing predictive-processing-specific mechanisms to alternative theories and exploring the broader implications of predictive processing for skill acquisition and training interventions. Based on these findings, the review outlines recommendations for future research, calling for more targeted investigations that empirically test predictive processing predictions and an expansion of this approach to new areas of sport science.",

          "abstract": "Research into the construct of statistical learning, the ability to learn structured patterns in the environment, has been exploding in recent years. Despite the plethora of studies, critical reviews have highlighted challenges facing this area of research, including confusion about what statistical learning is, what cognitive and neural mechanisms support it, how these mechanisms map onto different laboratory tasks, and how it relates to other forms of learning, memory, and cognition. These challenges are not unique to statistical learning research but in fact are difficulties confronting the psychological sciences more broadly. In this paper, we use recent conceptual advances regarding the nature of the “theory crisis” in psychology to provide a roadmap for developing a theoretical framework that can provide meaningful and valid conceptualizations of the various phenomena that statistical learning touches upon. First, we describe three important challenges to statistical learning research: a lack of robust phenomena to constrain theories, issues with construct validity, and challenges with establishing causality. Next, we discuss each issue in relation to several research phenomena that have been examined in some detail in the statistical learning research. Finally, we offer recommendations that we believe can help address the theory crisis in statistical learning research to help move the field forward in fruitful directions.",

          "abstract": "Placebo and nocebo effects illustrate the profound influence of cognitive-affective processes on symptom perception and treatment outcomes, with the potential to significantly alter responses to medical interventions. Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored. In this preregistered study, we used a within-subject design in 104 healthy to investigate and directly compare the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain. Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a one-week follow-up. Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on day 1 and day 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days. Sustained effects after one week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1. Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy. These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "We show how e-values simplify the design and the conduct of experiments. These e-values yield anytime-valid tests and confidence intervals that preserve type I error guarantee regardless of the sample size. This enables real-time monitoring of evidence as data are collected, permitting early termination of experiments without intolerably inflating the risk of making a false discovery. Early stopping not only preserves resources, but also mitigates risk for participants in clinical settings. Anytime-valid tests always allow for optional continuation, that is, the extension of an experiment regardless of the motivation. For instance, if more funds become available, or if the evidence looks promising and the funding agency, a reviewer, or an editor urges the experimenter to collect more data. Analogously, a researcher can be assured that a 95% anytime-valid confidence interval will, with at least 95% chance, cover the true effect size regardless of how, or even if, data collection is stopped. We use the free and open-source software library safestats implemented in R to illustrate the practical benefits of this novel inference framework.",

          "abstract": "Background: Symptoms of social anxiety and depression often co-occur, but many questions remain about symptom-level co-occurrence and the heterogeneity of symptom presentations across individuals, as well as their emotional functioning. Method: This study used a person-oriented approach, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), to identify distinct profiles (i.e., subgroups) in a UK adult sample (N = 222) varying in presentations of social anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further analyses examined between-profile differences in emotional functioning, including daily affect and emotion regulation. Results: Four profiles were identified: Comorbid, Dysphoric, Socially Anxious, and Low Distress, replicating the four-profile solution revealed in prior research on adolescents. The Comorbid subgroup reported the most pronounced emotional dysfunction, with higher daily negative affect, lower positive affect, and greater emotion dysregulation than the other three subgroups. The Low Distress subgroup reported the best emotional functioning. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design limits our ability to assess the stability of the identified profiles over time. Conclusion: Despite its limitations, this study sheds light on the varied ways social anxiety and depression co-occur, reinforcing the need for transdiagnostic interventions that address diverse symptom patterns and emotional functioning.",

          "authors": "Anton Karl Georg Marx; Maike Eisen",
          "abstract": "There seems to be substantial scientific, clinical, and practical interest in the act of playing and its important role in human development and everyday life - from infancy to adulthood. However, for the purpose of standardizing play situations for (experimental) research on dyadic parent-child interaction or child psychotherapy, there seems to be no appropriate theory-based and/or empirically validated framework, as of yet. The present contribution aims at closing this gap and promoting systematic and reproducible research by proposing a descriptive model to categorize and organize play situations based on their potential for subjective experiences and actions while playing. In its current version, our model entails eight categories to describe a given play situation's potential for individual and dyadic experiences and actions in a standardized way. The proposed categories can be used to either (1) rate an existing play situation (or game) on the proposed dimensions (e.g., on a defined response scale) to transparently and systematically describe its profile of potential experiences and likely actions or (2) to organize and design a future play situation in an at most standardized and reproducible way prior to playing. In conclusion, we argue that our model can be a useful and valid tool to, on the one hand, experimentally control specified play situations in an empirical study, while, on the other hand, allowing an at most authentic and naturalistic play interaction between two individuals.",

Multiple probe designs were the most prevalent study method, with frequent reliance on non-standardized measures. Reporting on theoretical frameworks was limited, and adherence to open science practices, including data sharing and ethics statement reporting, was minimal. The findings highlight the need for improved methods to synthesize prevalent single-case evidence in this field.

          "abstract": "Assortative mating – the tendency to choose partners similar to oneself – is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mate choice. Despite numerous proposed explanations, a parsimonious mechanism has been overlooked: when individuals choose mates based on heritable traits and preferences, offspring inherit a trait and the corresponding preference from each parent, creating genetic correlations that link having a trait to preferring that same trait. We evaluated this mechanism with an agent-based model simulating 100 generations where agents, with traits and preferences each uniquely determined by 40 loci, chose reproductive partners based on preferences. Genetic correlations formed between preferences and preferred traits, as well as between partner traits (i.e. assortative mating), demonstrating that heritable variation in preferences and preferred traits is sufficient to drive assortative mating. We presented a toy model here, which cannot speak to the robustness of such genetic correlations, nor the relative explanatory power of this mechanism over others.",

          "abstract": "To resolve moral dilemmas, people often rely on one of two decision strategies: cost-benefit reasoning versus following moral rules. Previous studies on moral learning show that people learn to use the decision-making strategy that led to the best outcomes in the past. Do they learn this by constructing a mental model of what outcomes would result from using either strategy (i.e., model-based learning) or by assigning value directly to each strategy (i.e., model-free learning)? To answer this question, we adapted the two-step task to a trolley-type dilemma between following moral rules (saving a colleague) versus cost-benefit reasoning (protecting a larger group). In each of the 125 trials, participants’ choices led to either a common or a rare transition, which probabilistically led to good versus bad outcomes. Computational modeling and pre-registered analysis of behavioral data provided converging evidence that participants apply both model-based and model-free learning.",

Across two pre-registered studies (Study 1: Spring 2019, n = 132; Study 2: Spring 2020, n = 133) we assessed associations between self-reported BSD risk and mood symptoms with overall, positive-valence, and negative-valence MW-frequency four times a day across 14 consecutive days. No significant associations emerged between overall MW-frequency and BSD risk or mood symptoms across both studies. In Study 1, BSD risk was associated with increased positive MW-frequency, which held when controlling for current symptoms. In Study 2, mania symptoms were associated with greater positive MW-frequency, and both depressive and manic symptoms were associated with greater negative MW-frequency. These findings suggest mood-congruent associations between positive-valence MW and BSD-relevant risk and mood symptoms, whereas negative-valence MW was associated with both depression and mania mood severity.

Liu, Li, Theeuwes, Wang (2022) presented evidence that even when WM is near capacity, LTM items could still be reported. They argue that retrieved LTM items can bypass WM. We investigated this further by introducing continuous reporting of retrieved information and WM contents to their paradigm. If retrieval bypasses WM, then there should be no impairment of report accuracy to either WM contents or LTM-retrieved information. In the first experiment, WM reports suffered when an LTM item was retrieved. In the second, we found that when WM was near capacity (4 items), the fidelity of LTM reports suffered compared to when WM was not (2 items or no items). Additionally, WM contents were reported with lower fidelity when an LTM item was retrieved compared to a WM-only condition, under both 2-item and 4-item WM load. We conclude that LTM retrieval does not bypass WM.",

Second, we explore the role of the brain’s emotional and decision-making systems in motivating climate action.

Using graph theoretical approaches within a network neuroscience framework, we examined how the developmental timing of displacement (age of displacement, duration of displacement) related to functional integration, segregation, and small-worldness. Syrian refugee children (n=61, MAge=14 Range = 8-18), completed a resting state scan using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. Data were analyzed to assess the link between neural network properties and developmental timing of adversity. Results indicate that prolonged displacement experienced earlier in life was significantly linked with neural network organization, impacting the balance between the brain's functional integration and segregation as quantified by the overall reduced small worldness in comparison to experiencing displacement at an older age. This study leverages the experiences of refugee children to advance our understanding of how the timing of adversity affects development, providing valuable insights into the broader impacts of early adversity on neurodevelopment.",

In contrast, research about the capacity to compare numerosity ratios has received less attention. In this paper, we directly contrasted linear and logarithmic distance models in the context of a visual ratio comparison task. We present data from a task where adult participants compared two sets of red and blue dots and selected the one with a larger ratio of a given color. At the group level, the logarithmic distance model provided a better fit for participants' responses and response times compared to the linear model. At the individual level, the results favored again the logarithmic model for participants’ responses but not for response times. Overall, our findings suggest that visual ratio comparison follows psychophysical laws similar to those observed in numerosity comparison, contributing to disentangling the possible underlying cognitive mechanisms processes.",

          "abstract": "Personality trait similarity among ordinary relatives is surprisingly low, with parent-offspring and sibling-sibling correlations usually r ≤ .15. We explain why these correlations are biased in typical single-method studies and argue that this problem can only be addressed with multi-method designs. We also explain why ordinary relative comparisons can provide a more generalizable way of estimating (additive, narrow-sense) heritability than the better-known twin comparisons. In a sample of parent-offspring (Npairs = 522), sibling-sibling (Npairs = 388), and second-degree relative pairs (Npairs = 476), who rated their Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction and were each rated by an independent informant (Nparticipants = 2,258 + informants), we found that parent-offspring and sibling correlations were about one-third higher than typically shown (r ≈ .20). Based on the ordinary relative comparisons, the heritability of personality traits and life satisfaction was about 40%, compared with about 26% typical to self-report studies. Life satisfaction was as heritable as personality traits, sharing about 80% of its genetic variance with neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. About half of life satisfaction’s phenotypic correlations with neuroticism and extraversion and its entire correlation with conscientiousness were explained by shared genetic factors. Using data from a larger sample of relatives with only self-reports (Nparticipants = 32,004; Npairs = 24,118), we provide further evidence that growing up together does not make people more similar. The results were consistent for both aggregate traits and individual items. Only multi-method designs can accurately reveal traits’ similarity among relatives, and their genetic and environmental transmission.",

          "abstract": "The Buddhabrot, a fractal visualization of the Mandelbrot set, has emerged as a recurring motif in psychedelic and schizophrenic art, suggesting a deep-rooted connection between altered states of consciousness and archetypal imagery. This paper explores how individuals experiencing psychedelic visions or schizophrenia spontaneously produce imagery that mirrors the Buddhabrot’s recursive, fractal-like structure. Drawing on Jungian psychology, we argue that this phenomenon is not coincidental but indicative of the Buddhabrot as a psychoid archetype, existing at the threshold of psyche and matter. Through comparative analysis of artwork from psychiatric archives, online psychedelic art communities, and historical visionary artists, we demonstrate that the Buddhabrot's manifestation. The findings suggest that altered states of mind allow access to deep fractosymbolic realities embedded within the psyche, where fractal geometry and archetypal symbology are one and the same.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Antenatal depression (AD) affects 7-13% of pregnant women and has adverse implications for both mother and child. Treatment of AD often requires pharmacological intervention, typically with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, it remains unclear whether SSRI interventions introduce developmental complications in children that are distinct from those associated with AD. This systematic review aims to investigate the current literature on the effects of AD and prenatal SSRI exposure and its behavioral and neurological consequences for child development.\nMethods: A systematic review of databases PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus were conducted using the PICO framework. Studies utilizing at least two participants groups, one group of children exposed to AD and another exposed to AD and in utero SSRI exposure, were eligible for inclusion. Screening yielded 14 articles on neurodevelopmental and/or behavioral outcomes.\nResults: Studies report effects of both prenatal SSRI exposure and AD-only exposure on several measures. Notably, when compared to non-exposed both SSRI and AD-only exposed children displayed alterations in the corticolimbic system, abnormal language development, and increases in internalizing and externalizing problems. Specific to SSRI-exposed children were alterations in the corticothalamic system, lower full-scale IQ, and impairment of psychomotor functioning.\nConclusion: This systematic review presents updated information relevant to professionals involved in clinical decision-making. Importantly, potentially confounding effects of AD phenotype, environmental factors and maternal care are difficult to entangle from the effects of SSRIs. Ultimately, more studies with multimodal methods and longitudinal measurements are needed to precisely understand how SSRIs and AD influence development.",

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable negative events yield increased stress responses compared to situations over which we have control. Previous studies have assessed the impact of uncontrollability of threat on stress reactivity. Less is known about whether and how acute stress exposure influences how we react to uncontrollable threats. Until now, research has primarily focused on investigating the lack of control despite the idea that losing control may cause greater distress and be more clinically relevant. The current study aims to investigate whether acute stress exposure impacts reactivity to a subsequent loss of control over threat. Ninety-six participants will be equally and randomly allocated to a stress or a no-stress group. Participants will undergo an acute stress induction or a non-stressful procedure, followed by a behavioral loss-of-control task. The loss-of-control task is designed to effectively induce control followed by a subsequent loss of control over aversive electrical stimulation. We hypothesize that participants exposed to acute stress will show stronger biological and psychological responses to the loss of control over threat than those in the no-stress group, as expressed in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase assays, blood pressure measurements, and self-report ratings. In addition, we will assess biological sex, general perceived stress, and childhood adversity as factors that might moderate the relation between acute stress exposure and reactivity to loss of control. Investigating the sensitizing effect of acute stress on the reaction to a loss of control could offer valuable insights into their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",

          "authors": "Isaac T. Petersen; Zachary Demko; Philipp Doebler; Loreen Sabel; Jacob Oleson; Robert Krueger",
          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "abstract": "During the first years of life, functional brain networks undergo significant reconfiguration. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown that maturation is driven by both the segregation of nearby functional areas (weakening of short-range functional connections) and the integration of distant regions (strengthening of long-range functional connections). While fMRI provides high spatial resolution, it does not capture rapid neural activity. Therefore, neuroimaging techniques with high temporal resolution, such as EEG, can complement fMRI data. To date, few cross-sectional studies have explored electrophysiological network development, yielding mixed results. Our study addressed these limitations by registering baseline EEG activity in a longitudinal sample of participants who were followed from 6 to 36 months of age. We computed network connectivity using different connectivity parameters (coherence, PLI, and dwPLI), in both binary and weighted networks, separately for oscillatory activity in alpha, theta, and beta frequency bands. The coherence-based connectivity networks showed the most significant age-related changes and consistent results. Specifically, we found that the small-world topology and modularity were prominent from 6 months of age, although the clustering properties and integration of the network increased with age in all frequency bands. These changes occurred in both weighted and binary networks but with opposite directions regarding network integration.",

          "abstract": "Abstract:  The “hard problem” of the origin and nature of intelligence (cognition/“mind”) in the cosmos and its relation to symmetry and symmetry breaking goes back to the Pre-Socratic Parmenides who claimed true reality (ontology) was a state of perfect symmetry and the world of change we know an illusion.  Parmenides problem was that his ideal symmetry was broken ab initio by the cognitive act of him asserting it. This incommensurable separation of the time-asymmetric cognitive part of the world and physics came into modern science with Cartesian dualism and the time-symmetric equations of Newton and then with the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.  The aporia is also found in the belief that unifying the forces of nature under a single symmetry would provide a “theory of everything”.  Cosmology shows, however, it is symmetry breaking rather than symmetry that has brought the universe into being. Irreducible to the time-reversal symmetry of classical and quantum mechanics, an expanded thermodynamics, specifically the addition of the fourth law of thermodynamics, provides a universal explanation.  Coupled with a first-law time-translation symmetry account of information the origin and nature of cognition is readily seen as a direct manifestation of universal law rather than somehow sitting impossibly outside it.",

Associations were examined between maternal and paternal smoking at preconception (3 months pre-pregnancy), periconception (conception to pregnancy awareness), and during pregnancy (trimesters one, two and three), with hospital recorded infant birth statistics (low birth weight, prematurity, small head circumference, small-for-gestational age (SGA), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission).\n\nResults: Smoking was reported by 20% of mothers prior to conception, reducing to 10% post-pregnancy awareness. The frequency of partner smoking was stable across preconception and pregnancy (24%).  Maternal preconception and periconception smoking were both associated with higher odds of infant admission to NICU (aOR = 1·74; aOR = 1·80, respectively). Periconception smoking was also associated with higher odds of prematurity (aOR = 2·05).  Smoking in pregnancy was associated with higher odds of infant low birth weight (aOR = 2·77 to 3·53), prematurity (aOR = 2·79 to 3·78), SGA (aOR = 2.52 to 2·76), and admission to NICU (aOR = 2·21 to 2·40). Limited evidence was found for associations between maternal smoking and small head circumference. There was also limited evidence that perinatal smoking in fathers was associated with adverse infant outcomes, however, our sample of fathers comprised fewer daily smokers which may have impacted power to detect effects. \n\nConclusion: Findings underscore the importance of earlier smoking cessation support for parents prior to, and during the early weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the harmful impacts of smoking on families.",

Prior to colonisation in the late 18th century subsections of these groups were in long-term close contact, their languages co-existing within a local small-scale egalitarian multilingual ecology. Post-colonially reflexes of this system persist, with continued daily interactions between the groups and both languages common within local multilingual repertoires. Other languages of significance in the local space are Bininj Kunwok, Rembarrnga, Ndjébbana, Gurr-goni and Na-kara, as well as English and Kriol in contemporary times.

          "abstract": "Background: Threat-related behavior is associated with substantial functional impairment in anxiety-related, trauma-related, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. While there is a wealth of research on threat-related behavior involving binary approach-avoidance decisions, other threat-related behaviors are less well-modeled by existing paradigms. In the present study, we describe and provide initial validation for a novel paradigm designed to elicit repetitive threat-neutralization (RTN) behavior.\nMethods: Adults age 18-65 (n=23) completed the Tap-To-Safety task, a novel experimental paradigm designed to elicit RTN. Task stimuli include a threat-cue (CS+) paired with shock, safety-cues CS- never paired with shock, and generalization stimuli (GSs) forming a continuum of similarity between CS+ and CS- which are also never paired with shock. During an extinction phase, the CS+ is no longer paired with shock. The task involves passive trials, in which participants passively view stimuli and/or receive shock, and choice trials, in which participants may tap a button repeatedly to gain protection from shock (i.e., RTN). The amount of tapping on each choice trial is associated with greater protection from shock, but also provides fewer reward points.\nResults: Threat-expectancy, anxiety, and RTN behavior tracked with threat-relevance of cues throughout the task (ps&lt;.001, ηp2 &gt;.38). During the RTN-Extinction phase, threat-expectancy to the CS+ gradually decreased across trials (p&lt;.001, ηp2=0.23). Decreases in anxiety ratings (p=0.172) and RTN (p=0.064) across trials were not significant. Greater RTN was associated with decreased post-RTN threat-expectancy across the task (ps&lt;.015, ηp2&gt;.26); effects on post-RTN reductions in anxiety were significant in early (p=.005, ηp2=0.21), but not later (ps&gt;.051) phases of the task.\nConclusions: The Tap-To-Safety Task represents a promising new probe for compulsions in OCD and other repetitive threat-related behaviors.",

          "authors": "Sahba Saberi",
          "abstract": "Emotion science struggles to establish a unified definition of emotion, arguably largely due to differing perspectives on its constituent components. Traditional theories often conflate cognitive appraisal and interoception under the term ‘emotion.’ We propose a nomenclature shift by delineating interoception from appraisal. Acknowledging that cognition can trigger, interpret, label, or influence emotional experiences, we argue this interaction does not necessitate including cognition as a component of emotion. Instead, defining these components separately enhances understanding of their individual mechanisms and interactions. To support our framework, we examine the current literature, concluding that no strong theoretical or empirical justification exists for combining interoception and appraisal into one construct. Reserving 'emotion' for interoceptive responses alone enhances theoretical clarity, research precision, and clinical effectiveness.\n\nPublic Significance Statement: This paper proposes an approach to redefining 'emotion' as the experience of internal bodily sensations (interoception), distinct from thought processes or interpretations (cognitive appraisal). Through the delineation of these processes, this perspective aims to refine emotion theory and expand its applications in research and practice.",

Across seven studies (N=3,316), we find that concern for future generations correlates with greater meaning, life satisfaction, and flourishing, even after accounting for self-focused future-oriented constructs. These associations are primarily driven by impact-oriented legacy motivation––the desire to make a meaningful contribution––rather than reputational concerns about being remembered. Individuals displaying impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB)––a sustained concern for all future generations––exhibit particularly strong engagement with impact-driven legacy concerns, which in turn predict well-being. As intergenerational concern was not associated with lower anxiety or depression, deep concern for the far future may reflect both an emotional burden and a source of fulfillment.",

          "abstract": "Background: Changes in motivational biases appear at the heart of many psychiatric disorders. Alterations in motivational biases, in the form of invigorated responding when promised rewards, and holding back when threatened with punishment, have been observed in many psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. However, the specificity of these changes remains unclear. Here, we relate the (in)ability to suppress (maladaptive) motivational biases, to continuous, dimensional measures of psychiatric symptom levels in a sample from the general population focusing on mood-anxiety and impulsive-compulsive symptoms.\n\nMethods: We recruited an online sample from the general population (n = 500) through Prolific Academic, that performed a motivational Go/NoGo task, a cognitive test and a clinical questionnaire battery. We used factor analysis, mixed-effects regressions and computational modelling to link transdiagnostic symptom dimensions to the ability to adaptively suppress motivational biases. \n\nResults: We observed a double dissociation. Higher anxious-depressed symptoms predicted more suppression of motivational biases on trials on which these were incongruent with instrumental demands, resulting in better overall performance. Using a novel computational model, we show that this behaviour might arise from enhanced learning to flexibly suppress the impact of motivational biases. In contrast, higher compulsive symptom scores were associated with overall worse performance, likely reflecting a more general performance deficit.\n\nDiscussion: We speculate that anxious-depressed individuals, showing heightened rumination and anxiety, might recruit excessive cognitive effort for suppressing motivational biases. This more ‘controlled’ mode of decision-making might lead to improved performance in tasks such as this one, but on the other hand exhaust participants and contribute to their symptoms.",

          "abstract": "We use response time decision models to determine whether visual working memory (VWM) is best described by a fixed-capacity `slot' model or a continuously allocated `resource' model. We used a double-decision paradigm that combined continuous-outcome recall and two-choice recognition to characterize performance in a VWM task. Participants viewed one to six colored items, recalled the color of a cued target using a color wheel, and then identified the target color from two options in a recognition task. We used continuous-outcome and two-choice EZ diffusion models to analyze the speed and accuracy of the two decisions. The models provided estimates of the latent cognitive parameters of drift rate and boundary separation, with the former providing measures of the memory strengths in the two decisions. We found significant correlations in both drift rate and boundary separation for the two decisions, indicating that continuous recall and two-choice recognition tasks engage similar memory and decision processes. Removing responses within the highly inaccurate `heavy-tails' of the recall distribution reduced rather than increased these correlations, particularly for drift rates at larger set sizes, implying that the tail responses represent meaningful low-precision memory traces rather than guesses. This finding is consistent with a variable precision or resource account of VWM and inconsistent with a slot model account of VWM. Our findings underscore the value of joint modeling response time and accuracy data, and highlight the utility of double-decision tasks in clarifying theoretical accounts of memory processes.",

Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "authors": "Michael Höfler; Robert Miller",
          "abstract": "Bayesian inference allows researchers to evaluate whether a hypothesis on an effect (e.g. effect &gt; 0, effect &gt; Δ) is credible given data and a prior distribution that expresses how an analyst assesses other evidence beyond the data. However, the recipients of an analysis may have different priors, so it remains unclear whether the hypothesis is credible to them. For normally distributed estimates and priors, the ‘sufficiently sceptical prior’ and the associated ‘critical prior interval’ address this problem by asking how strongly one must believe in the absence of an effect in order to be convinced otherwise by the data. Scepticism is expressed in the prior by an expected effect of 0, while the largest standard deviation that makes an effect credible is calculated from the data. We extend this one-dimensional approach by also addressing sensitivity against the second dimension, the prior expectation to vary, that is, including advocacy priors that favour a positive or negative effect. We present a visual tool, called the Region of Evidence (RoE), which shows all normal priors for which the posterior probability that a hypothesis is true exceeds the critical value 1 - α. By requiring only a data estimate and its standard error, it can be applied to any published result. The article describes an open source implementation in R and a standalone web application for use outside of R. Its use is demonstrated with a simple hypothetical example and a real data example of Esketamine treatment in patients with severe major depression.",

          "authors": "Kaja Damnjanović",
          "abstract": "Numerous psychological models of the rationality of human thinking have been developed since the middle of the last century within the line of research known as the heuristics and biases approach, descriptive theory of rationality or decision-making, complex cognition, or the psychology of rational thinking. The focal processes or phenomena are reasoning, decision-making, judging, and inferencing. Families of models revolve around the formal (cumulative) prospect theory, the cognitivist fuzzy trace theory, ecological rationality, and dual process theories. Regarding complex cognitive processing, there is a limited set of principles that researchers in the psychology of rationality implicitly, and sometimes uncritically, attribute to the human cognitive system. These principles may be called “boundary conditions” of the validity of psychological rationality theories, meaning that all psychological models of rational thinking, including currently dominant dual process theories, belong to a set constrained by the postulated qualities of the cognitive system's architecture. Those principles that have not yet been explicitly stated in the literature are as follows: cognitive miserliness, cognitive processing dependence on the environment, knowledge structures, probabilism, and the challenge of individual differences. The paper presents the mentioned principles and their historical antecedents and a proposal for future research questions based on such a juxtaposition.",

          "abstract": "Background: Current screening tools for autism are ineffective and biased, leading to unnecessary referrals and delays in diagnoses, especially for women and people of colour. This has led autism community members and healthcare providers to call for more accurate, unbiased, and scalable screening tools. In recent years, researchers have increasingly recognised the potential of screening tools focused on facial movement differences between autistic and non-autistic people. To make progress, it is necessary to (1) determine which facial movement differences are most prevalent in autistic people, (2) train machine-learning classifiers on these features, and (3) optimise the classifier for subgroups underserved by screening and diagnosis. \nMethod: This proof-of-concept study utilized data from 25 autistic and 26 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched non-autistic people who posed emotional facial expressions across two conditions, resulting in 4,896 recordings.\nResults: First, our Bayesian analyses showed that the estimated prevalence of facial movement differences ranged from 41.05% to 83.16%. Second, we constructed several machine-learning classifiers – trained on the eight most prevalent movement differences (70%+) to distinguish autistic and non-autistic participants. Third, we optimized our best-performing classifier through forward and backward feature selection techniques. Our final K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm achieved 91.87% accuracy, with 88.51% (autistic) and 95.89% (non-autistic) precision, and 96.25% (autistic) and 87.50% (non-autistic) recall. The classifier maintained consistently high performance, with at least 90.99% accuracy, 89.13% precision, and 87.42% recall, across sexes and racial groups. \nConclusions: Here, we demonstrated proof-of-concept that facial movement differences can be used to effectively distinguish autistic and non-autistic people across sexes and racial groups. These results suggest movement-based classifiers could improve the accuracy and equity of autism screening. Future research should extend this approach to children to enable earlier identification and support.",

However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory.

          "abstract": "Feedback loops are central to the dynamics of mental disorder symptoms, serving as mechanisms that sustain and amplify symptoms over time. Despite their importance, the influence of feedback loop structures on symptom progression and persistence remains underexplored. This study bridges this gap by analyzing a family of simulation models of symptom dynamics describing 98,304 directed networks compatible with empirically observed correlation symptom networks and their feedback loops. Systematic simulations of diverse network configurations revealed that while increasing the number of feedback loops elevates symptom levels, this effect plateaus due to the diminishing impact of overlapping loops. Additionally, networks with evenly distributed connectivity sustain higher symptom levels, necessitating the disruption of multiple feedback loops simultaneously to weaken the network's cohesive structure and reduce symptom persistence. Empirical validation using real-world clinical data supports these findings, demonstrating that frequently observed edges in network structures align with simulated configurations that drive high symptom levels. These results demonstrate that symptom severity and persistence are determined not merely by the presence of feedback loops but by their specific connections. Intervention strategies should focus on disrupting influential feedback structures and key connections rather than broadly reducing connectivity. By integrating computational modeling and empirical analysis, this study advances our understanding of symptom persistence and offers insights for designing targeted interventions to mitigate symptom severity and relapse risk.",

          "abstract": "Within the past decade, digital coaching programs (DCPs) have emerged as an evidence-based modality to improve mental well-being and emotional intelligence, although there is limited evidence in real-world context. This pragmatic retrospective cohort study sought to determine the preliminary effectiveness of a DCP in improving mental well-being and emotional intelligence within a real-world context. We hypothesized that there would be a significant increase in mental well-being and emotional intelligence. This study included 588 people that voluntarily enrolled in an eight-week, blended care DCP offered through their employers from October 2021 to August 2024. Participants completed the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) at baseline and then weekly until the end of the program as well as the Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale-10 (BEIS-10) at baseline and the end of the program. In multivariate linear mixed models adjusting for age, gender, program engagement, and program completion, we observed a significant increase in WHO-5 scores (Cohen’s d = 1.98, p&lt;0.001). Over half of the sample (55.4%) experienced a clinically meaningful improvement on the WHO-5 (i.e., at least a 10-point improvement). BEIS-10 scores also significantly increased from baseline to the end of the program after adjusting for relevant correlates (Cohen’s d = 1.32, p&lt;0.001). \nThese results demonstrate that DCPs can be a viable option for individuals looking to improve their mental well-being. Studies employing hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial designs are now needed to further evaluate the real-world effectiveness of this program.",

          "abstract": "Recovery from work is important for promoting employees’ well-being but little is known about which environments are most conducive for recovery. This article examines the relationship between recovery and experiencing nature and, thus, provides a link between recovery research and environmental psychology. In two studies, we drew on the Effort-Recovery Model and proposed that contact with nature is associated with employees’ recovery experiences and affective well-being. In Study 1, we theorized that appraising nature as aesthetic is an underlying mechanism in the relationship between being in nature and recovery. Using an experience sampling approach with multisource data from self-reports and smartphone photos (N = 50, measurements = 411), we found that being in nature was indirectly related to recovery experiences (i.e., relaxation, detachment) and affective well-being (i.e., positive activation, serenity, low fatigue) via perceived attractiveness. In Study 2, we theorized that appreciative contact with nature (i.e., nature savoring) is linked to enhanced recovery and well-being. Using a randomized controlled trial (N = 66), we found that a nature-savoring intervention, compared to a waiting-list control group, had beneficial effects on recovery experiences and positive affective states. Overall, our results suggest that contact with nature is a prototypical setting for employees’ recovery, and we discuss theoretical and practical implications of this finding for occupational health psychology",

No significant contrast in activation was observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), consistent with the original results.\n\nRe-analysis is crucial for validation, as differences in preprocessing methods, including alignment, motion correction, normalization, and statistical mapping, can influence outcomes.

          "abstract": "Women who care for multiple highly dependent children require significant support from non-maternal caregivers (allomothers). Theoretically, grandmothers are seen as key allomothers due to low costs and high inclusive fitness returns. Empirically, however, the evidence is inconsistent and the reasons for this variation are not well-understood. Understanding the factors which promote, or hinder, grandmaternal childcare, such as demographic schedules, is an important next step. Here, we explore the demographic predictors of the low levels of grandmothering for 78 Agta children. Due to generational fertility trends (ages of first and last birth) grandmothers still had dependent children until an average age of 52, creating reproductive overlap. Little to no grandmaternal investment after the age of 60 is explained by declining health in older women due to high mortality rates. This means the ‘helping window’ for grandmothering only spans seven years on average, yet the impact of this period is still be limited by multiple dependent grandchildren given high total fertility rates. We suggest then that grandmothering is constrained by 1) generational reproductive overlap and 2) grandchildren competition. Accordingly, we tested how: 1) the number of dependent children and 2) grandchildren associated with grandmothering using Bayesian mixed-effect models. We found moderate to strong evidence that the more children/grandchildren a women had, the lower her investment in each grandchild. Consequently, whether grandmothers help, or not, appears to be a function of demographic schedules, which vary widely. Future formal demographic modelling then will help shed light on the evolution of grandmothering in humans.",

          "abstract": "The PERMA-Profiler is a self-report instrument designed to assess personal psychological well-being, including PERMA (Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment). Despite consistent validation of its descriptive utility and latent five-factor measurement structure, debates persist regarding the distinctiveness and incremental validity of these dimensions. This study applied multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to evaluate the instrument’s between-item multidimensionality and the functioning of its 11-point rating scale using Category Boundary Discriminations (CBDs). Data represented a culturally diverse sample (N = 2,337), including several previously published datasets. Results indicated that a Rasch-compliant MIRT model did not fit, raising questions about the scientific validity of observed mean or sum scores. Attempts to model the intended five-factor PERMA structure were unsuccessful. This appears to stem from unmodeled latent factor associations, which in turn led to inflated residuals, likely reflecting convergence issues caused by generally high correlations among items and factors. Local stochastic dependencies within Meaning also emerged, which may have systematically inflated previously reported reliability and validity indices.These dependencies suggested that the globally framed item M1 might need revision. Analyses of the 11-point rating scale revealed that participants predominantly used the upper end of the scale, with categories 5 through 10 accounting for 84% of responses, suggesting redundancy of response categories. Categories from 0 to 3 therefore showed minimal incremental discrimination. Reducing the number of response categories, and experimenting with alternative labeling and scale formats, could enhance measurement precision and discrimination.",

This study examined the clinical utility of a clinician-rated global evaluation of personality functioning based on the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS). A total of 346 German mental health professionals provided LPFS ratings for 1,403 patients, stratified by thirty-eight diagnostic categories, including, but not limited to, personality disorders. Clinicians reported on each patient’s treatment outcome, recommended optimal treatment components for each patient, and provided their perspective on the clinical utility of the LPFS and its potential risk of stigmatizing patients. On average, clinicians rated the LPFS as \"very useful\", its applicability as \"rather easy\", and the risk of patient stigmatization as \"rather low\". Logistic and ordinal Bayesian multilevel models indicated meaningful associations between LPFS ratings and clinical judgments, highlighting its effectiveness in conveying clinical impressions. Greater impairments in personality functioning were associated with poorer clinician-rated treatment outcome and poorer prognosis. In addition, associations with optimal treatment components yielded a nuanced pattern, with clinicians typically recommending short-term outpatient psychotherapy for patients with mild impairments, long-term psychotherapy for patients with moderate to severe impairments, and intensive care interventions (e.g., outreach care, assisted living) for those with extreme impairments. The results indicate that German mental health professionals consider the LPFS to be a clinically useful concept and that it may be valuable in organizing and communicating information about patients.",

          "abstract": "Individuals in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] and mild dementia) primarily exhibit episodic memory deficits, while the presence of semantic control impairments remains understudied. To explore semantic control and white matter connectivity in individuals with aMCI and mild dementia, we assessed semantic control deficits, through a word-picture verification task, and integrity of language-relevant ventral pathways, utilizing fixel-based analysis, adhering to a preregistered protocol. We found that individuals with aMCI and mild dementia exhibited greater semantic interference compared to matched controls. No significant group differences were observed in fixel metrics of the white matter pathways. The extent to which reduced white matter integrity might lead to weakened semantic control remains unclear.",

          "abstract": "Over one million annual deaths have been attributed to bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Although antibiotics have saved countless other lives, overuse and misuse of antibiotics increases this global threat. Developing new antibiotics and retraining clinicians can be undermined by patients who pressure clinicians to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics. So we validated two low-cost, scalable interventions for improving antibiotic decisions in an online randomized control trial and a pre-registered replication (N = 985). Both first-person vignette experiments found that an infographic and text message caused intermediate to large improvements in antibiotic decisions compared to active controls — even when controlling for a dozen confounds. Notably, these educational interventions also reduced trust in a clinician who offered antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. These data show how low-cost adjustments to existing communication systems can teach people to reduce the existential risks of antibiotic resistance and how inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can erode trust in health systems.",

          "abstract": "The formation of career aspirations is an essential developmental task in adolescence. During this stage, young people often face educational and vocational decisions that involve choosing areas of specialization, such as mathematics or language arts. While motivational beliefs (self-concept, interest, or related constructs such as intrinsic motivation) and achievement have been identified as important predictors of math- and reading-related career aspirations, less is known about (1) how career aspirations in these domains evolve, (2) whether associations to motivational beliefs change and (3) whether domain-specific career aspirations themselves predict future motivational beliefs and achievement (i.e., recursive effects). Based on expectancy-value theory and dimensional comparison theory, this study used longitudinal data from adolescents in Germany (N = 8,289) to evaluate the stability, trajectories, and predictors of math- and reading-related career aspirations. Second, we investigated whether within- and cross-domain associations with motivational beliefs change over time and if career aspirations predict future motivational beliefs and achievement. We observed increasing stability of domain-specific career aspirations and slight increases in reading- and math-related career aspirations from adolescence (age 13) to young adulthood (age 21). Associations between intrinsic motivation and reading-related career aspirations were stronger at 16 compared to age 13. Further, cross-lagged panel models revealed partial support for effects from career aspirations to motivational beliefs measured two years later. The results underline adolescence as a critical period for career development and have implications for career counseling and domain-specific specializations during adolescence.",

          "abstract": "The perceptual content (e.g., seen a happy vs. seen a sad face) and also subjective visibility (e.g., whether the stimulus is visible or not) of a given (liminal) stimulus is influenced by the history of previously consciously experienced stimuli. This effect on subjective visibility, termed awareness priming, suggests that findings from a large body of literature on unconscious processing might be confounded by conscious awareness. However, those literatures on unconscious processing used implicit behavioral measures of unconscious processing. The challenge is only valid if previous visible stimuli (not just physically salient) also affect implicit behavior, e.g., response priming. Here, we used Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS) to probe the limits and temporal dynamics of awareness priming effect. We showed that prior conscious exposure to two Chinese words increases both visibility and discrimination accuracy, and also improves the response priming of words presented just at the visibility threshold. A correlation analysis revealed that this effect is only driven by the high visibility of the previous stimuli but not high physical saliency. Our results strongly validated the challenge from awareness priming to the literature on unconscious processing. Moreover, we found a different temporal dynamic for how previous visible exposure to a word affects current perception: previous short-term exposure (1-10 back trials) to a visible word only enhances discrimination accuracy of the same word in the current trial, whereas long-term exposure (10-30 back trials) exclusively elevates visibility. This novel finding suggests that areas higher in the processing hierarchy, with larger temporal receptive field, contribute to consciousness, while areas lower in the cortical hierarchy contribute to objective discrimination.",

With this framework we aim to enable stakeholders to analyse differences between ways in which scientists currently collaborate and to reflect on whether, given a certain level of interdependency between sub-goals in a research project, appropriate levels of management and shared goals are present to successfully and efficiently answer scientific questions.",

We used triangulation and fitted complementary models to the simulated data and found contradicting increasing, decreasing, and null effects of initial sense of coherence on subsequent change in subjective burden and mental health. These divergent findings indicated that it is premature to assume causal effects of sense of coherence on subjective burden and mental health and the suggestions by Gonçalves-Pereira et al. in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Gonçalves-Pereira et al.

Conversely, social support may impact SGM individuals’ psychological resilience. To quantify the impact of their interpersonal environments, the current preregistered meta-analysis included 181 studies (N = 75,376) that reported associations between social support (i.e., family, peer, partner, school, work) and internalizing psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidality) among SGM samples. Overall, a small, negative association was observed, r = -.26, with depression’s associations being significantly larger than the other psychopathology categories, r = -.30. Smaller effects were observed for samples with a larger share of bisexual individuals and when a SGM-specific measure was used. Otherwise, the negative association between social support and psychopathology was robust to demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, % white), SGM identity (e.g., % gender minority), source of support, and levels of structural stigma. No evidence of publication bias was observed. This robust finding suggests that all forms of SGM social support are similarly and complimentarily associated with lower internalizing psychopathology.",

Furthermore, this paper proposes a comprehensive concept of secondary psychosis spectrum disorder, demonstrating that stress reactions and depression serve as a common foundation for these disorders. Their basis transitions from minimal introversion through normal state to maximal introversion along fluctuations in introversion, i.e., introversion spectrum, and these disorders arise secondarily from this spectrum.

          "abstract": "Background: Recent models of the development of adolescent psychopathology emphasize the dynamic interplay between substance use and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Importantly, this interplay may be moderated by known risk factors of substance use and internalizing/externalizing symptoms, particularly impaired working memory capacity and high-risk taking behavior. However, thus far studies into the temporal symptom/substance use dynamics were not designed to test moderation of this dynamic interplay. To fill this critical gap, the present study introduces a novel adaptation of the cross-lagged panel network approach (CLPN) for identifying interaction effects between outside factors and cross-lagged estimates. We use this moderated CLPN approach (mCLPN) to examine how working memory and risk-taking moderate the temporal associations between substance use and internalizing and externalizing symptoms.\nMethods: Using data from the IMAGEN study (N = 1,364), we tested how working memory and risk-taking at age 14 moderated temporal associations between internalizing/externalizing symptoms and substance use over two years (ages 14 → 16). Results: Alcohol use showed reciprocal associations with externalizing symptoms and predicted heavier tobacco and cannabis use at age 16. Externalizing symptoms at age 14 predicted more externalizing symptoms and substance use at age 16. Poor working memory and high risk-taking moderated the temporal associations between both symptom domains and substance use. When risk-taking was high, the link between internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 14 and cannabis use at age 16 was stronger.\nConclusions: These findings highlight cognitive risk factors in the substance use/ symptom dynamics and illustrate the value of the moderated CLPN approach in clinical-developmental science.\nKeywords: executive functioning; cross-lagged panel network; substance use; internalizing symptoms; externalizing symptoms",

          "abstract": "Attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) theory proposes that “the people make the place” (Schneider, 1987) and has served as a foundation for many areas of organizational research. In this review, we take stock of the ASA literature to identify what we know and what we need to know about ASA processes and their effects on organizations. Based on a review of over 6,000 articles that cited ASA, we identified 321 studies that used the theory as a basis for their hypotheses. However, only 77 (24%) of those studies actually tested an aspect of the theory. For example, although ASA is an organizational-level theory, most studies used the theory to test phenomena at other levels, such as individuals, teams, or occupations. Among studies that did test the theory, very few directly assessed its core hypotheses. For instance, only one published study directly tested the central hypothesis that ASA processes lead to homogeneity. Moreover, some parts of the theory were not supported. As an example, although the theory suggests that ASA processes will reduce organizational effectiveness, several studies found that homogeneity was associated with better performance. Although the amount of empirical support for ASA theory was uneven, we believe it still has the potential to help understand organizations and the people that make them. To that end, we provide an agenda for future research that prioritizes how to best test ASA’s core hypotheses. We also highlight connections between ASA and other theories and literatures that examine similar phenomena to inspire future research opportunities.",

This study examined the clinical utility of a clinician-rated global evaluation of personality functioning based on the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS). A total of 346 German mental health professionals provided LPFS ratings for 1,403 patients, stratified by thirty-eight diagnostic categories, including, but not limited to, personality disorders. Clinicians reported on each patient’s treatment outcome, recommended optimal treatment components for each patient, and provided their perspective on the clinical utility of the LPFS and its potential risk of stigmatizing patients. On average, clinicians rated the LPFS as \"very useful\", its applicability as \"rather easy\", and the risk of patient stigmatization as \"rather low\". Logistic and ordinal Bayesian multilevel models indicated meaningful associations between LPFS ratings and clinical judgments, highlighting its effectiveness in conveying clinical impressions. Greater impairments in personality functioning were associated with poorer clinician-rated treatment outcome and poorer prognosis. In addition, associations with optimal treatment components yielded a nuanced pattern, with clinicians typically recommending short-term outpatient psychotherapy for patients with mild impairments, long-term psychotherapy for patients with moderate to severe impairments, and intensive care interventions (e.g., outreach care, assisted living) for those with extreme impairments. The results indicate that German mental health professionals consider the LPFS to be a clinically useful concept and that it may be valuable in organizing and communicating information about patients.",

Using 32 virtual interior spaces with curved boundary types and varying architectural variables (size, light, texture, and color), 15 participants assessed aesthetic qualities while their brain activity was recorded via electroencephalography (EEG). Results reveal that alpha and beta oscillations play distinct roles in processing aesthetic judgments and architectural variables, while theta oscillations show no such differentiation.

However, this question has only been examined among US children, and little is known about how much the findings can be generalized across cultures. In this paper, we examine the consideration of different types of costs (psychological, physical) in moral evaluation by children in China, and compare to the US data. We choose to study children in China not only because it is a non-WEIRD culture, but also because recent work has suggested that there are cultural differences between the US and China in terms of how children conceptualize desire inhibition and self-control. This research will have implications for research on children’s moral cognition across cultures.",

To contribute to the understanding of avoidance learning, we here report on a novel approach-avoidance conflict task that requires participants to learn associations between complex visual stimuli and combined appetitive and aversive stimuli while actively engaging with the experimental environment. Using an agent-based behavioral modeling approach, we implemented and validated an extensive set of control, heuristic, Rescorla-Wagner learning-based, and hybrid agents. We show that a Rescorla-Wagner learning-based agent with a prior expectation bias parameter best explains the learning behavior of 50 participants. As such, our work complements current research on the computational underpinnings of approach-avoidance behavior by showing paradigm and task instruction dependencies in approach-avoidance-relevant associative learning and contributes to the overall aim of achieving a more fine-grained understanding of the etiology of anxiety disorders.",

          "authors": "Yijun Qian; Anna Schwartz; Yichi Zhang; Arthur F. Kramer; Leanne Chukoskie",
          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive decline in older adults is a growing global concern. Exergames, which combine physical exercise with cognitive training in an interactive digital environment, have shown promise in mitigating this decline.\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of exergames in improving cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults through a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM, and IEEE databases for studies published between January 2014 and June 2024. Studies were included if they: (1) involved participants with mean age ≥60 years, (2) implemented exergame interventions in community settings, (3) included pre- and post-cognitive assessments, and (4) provided sufficient data for effect size calculation. The analysis examined effects across different populations (healthy, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia), exergame types, and various cognitive domains.\nResults: Ten studies comprising 690 participants (EXG=350, Control=340) met inclusion criteria. The pooled effect size was 0.1327 (95% CI 0.066-0.199, P&lt; .001), indicating significant positive effects of exergames on cognition. Subgroup analyses revealed that individuals with MCI showed the largest benefits (g=0.256, 95% CI 0.11-0.40, P=.003), followed by cognitively healthy older adults (g=0.132, 95% CI 0.03-0.23, P=.013). Aerobic exergames (g=0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.22, P=.002) and combined aerobic and non-aerobic exergames (g=0.291, 95% CI 0.12-0.46, P=.002) demonstrated significant effects, but not in non-aerobic exergame. Among cognitive domains, memory (g=0.179, 95% CI 0.03-0.33, P=.021) and processing speed (g=0.337, 95% CI 0.31-0.37, P&lt; .001) showed significant improvements.\nConclusions: Exergames provide significant cognitive benefits for community-dwelling older adults, with particularly strong effects for individuals with MCI. Combined aerobic and non-aerobic exergames appear most effective. These findings support the use of exergames as a practical tool for cognitive enhancement in community and residential environments.",

          "authors": "Povilas Karvelis; Andreea Oliviana Diaconescu",
          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. This brief report aims to clarify this misunderstanding through simple data simulations. To make the argument more intuitive, we consider two illustrative cases: comparing patients versus controls and comparing two groups formed by a median split. We demonstrate that reliability attenuates observed group differences just as much as it attenuates individual differences. Given that dichotomizing/grouping continuous data - which is implicit in many group differences analyses - leads to a loss of statistical power, low reliability proves to be even more problematic for studying group differences. While here we focused on cognitive sciences and psychiatry, our findings are quite general and could inform many other areas of research, including education, sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, etc., where test-retest reliability is rarely taken into account.",

          "abstract": "Infants with congenital heart disease are now frequently surviving into adulthood but experience poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including reduced cognitive and executive functioning. There is a critical need to link brain development to modifiable disease characteristics so we can offer intervention when the brain is most plastic. Brain dysmaturation in CHD is frequently experienced and likely impacted by the iron deficiency CHD infants experience from their disordered blood flow. Iron deficiency is significant for cognitive and executive function because striatal iron stores are needed for dopamine synthesis. Here we assess, with MRI, how striatal iron in CHD is different than in controls and how iron is impacted or related to various clinical characteristics. We find CHD participants had less iron than controls, indicating iron deficiency impacts deposition. Single ventricle infants had even less than other CHD participants post operatively. Within the CHD group, increased iron, through iron recycling, can also be indicative of cell death from hypoxia or ischemia.  We find additional evidence for this relationship, where increased iron was related to poor APGAR scores pre-surgery. Iron supplantation is a promising intervention to optimize cognitive and executive function in CHD.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) collection methods like experience sampling methodology can place significant burdens on participants, potentially resulting in careless responding, such as random responding. Such behavior can undermine the validity of any inferences drawn from the data if not properly identified and addressed. Recently, a confirmatory mixture model (here referred to as fully constrained latent Markov factor analysis, LMFA) has been introduced as a promising solution to detect careless responding in ILD. However, this method relies on the key assumption of measurement invariance of the attentive responses, which is easily violated due to shifts in how participants interpret items. If the assumption is violated, the ability of the fully constrained LMFA to accurately identify careless responding is compromised. In this study, we evaluated two more flexible variants of LMFA—fully exploratory LMFA and partially constrained LMFA—to distinguish between careless and attentive responding, in the presence of non-invariant attentive responses. Simulation results indicated that the fully exploratory LMFA model is an effective tool for reliably detecting and interpreting different types of careless responding while accounting for violations of measurement invariance. Conversely, the partially constrained model struggled to accurately detect careless responses. We end by discussing potential reasons for this.",

          "abstract": "Prior research documents strong associations between higher educational attainment and improved health and well-being outcomes. Studies on educational differences, such as those conducted by OECD and UNESCO, have focused on national trends in educational attainment. The current study builds on existing international surveys of educational attainment by providing supporting evidence for educational attainment in several countries and novel evidence for various other countries and territories. For example, results demonstrate that country-level aggregate estimates of the proportion of the population attaining a tertiary education from the Global Flourishing Study (GFS) aligns fairly well with existing estimates from the OECD, with a correlation of r=0.83 with 95% CI (0.57, 0.94), and the estimates for new countries may be a lower bound for the estimated proportion of the population attaining a tertiary education. A major additional contribution of this article is providing insights into the contexts of educational attainment across countries by reporting which sociodemographic groups tend to have attained higher levels of education and how these trends differ across countries. We examined these differences by evaluating the sociodemographic contexts (e.g., age, marital status, employment status) in which achieving more education is found using data from 202,898 participants across 22 countries that were post-stratified to be nationally representative within each country.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has shown that the compositional meaning of a compound is routinely constructed by combining meanings of constituents. However, this body of research has focused primarily on Germanic languages. It remains unclear whether this same computational process is also observed in Chinese, a writing system characterised by less systematicity of the meanings and functions of constituents across compounds. We quantified the ease of integrating the meanings of Chinese constituent characters into a compositional compound meaning using a computational model based on distributional semantics. We then showed that this metric predicted sensibility judgements on novel compounds (Study 1), lexical decision latencies for rejecting novel compounds (Study 2), and lexical decision latencies for recognising existing compounds (Study 3). These results suggest that a compositional process is routinely involved in Chinese compound processing, even in tasks that do not explicitly require meaning combination. Our results also suggest that a generic statistical learning framework is able to capture the meaningful functions of Chinese compound constituents. We conclude by discussing the advantages of routine meaning construction during compound processing in Chinese reading.",

So a pre-registered experiment assessed how reflective thinking relates to decisions about 10 thought experiments from epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind. Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, no reflection test priming effects were detected. Rather, an unexpected philosophical reflection effect emerged: making the philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.",

Regression therapy aims to identify and address the root cause of an individual's current emotional, psychological, or physical issues by accessing forgotten or suppressed memories that are present  in the subconscious domain \nMethods \nA total of 169 subjects filled out a BSI-53 questionnaire before initiation of treatment as well as after 2 and 4 months of therapy. Fifteen established  RT therapists conducted therapy according to a standardized protocol. Questionnaires were submitted anonymously to a commercial company that analysed the results and reported to an independent assessor.  \nResults\nRT proved to be highly effective. The BSI-53 total score decreased from a value of 0.91 to 0.48 after 4 months of treatment. A score of 0.48 is close to the value of 0.42 measured in a representative sample of the Dutch population. For most study participants a single session was already satisfactory. Hedges g for this study was 0.95 indicating a large clinical effect. All 9 domains of the BSI-53 questionnaire showed a similar decrease in score, the mean decrease was 47%. Application of unbiased machine learning to all study parameters revealed that a positive effect of the therapy could be predicted from a few BSI-53 questions with high accuracy (AUC: 0,87). \nLimitations \nThis blinded outcome trial was not compared to an active control.\nConclusion\nThis study shows that RT is a highly efficacious treatment modality. It is fast, a few sessions already strongly alleviate psychological and physical symptoms.",

          "abstract": "We find evidence of belief in belief – intuitive preferences for religious belief over atheism, even among atheist participants – across 8 comparatively secular countries. Religion is a cross-cultural human universal, yet explicit markers of religiosity have rapidly waned in large parts of the world in recent decades. We explored whether intuitive religious influence lingers, even among nonbelievers in largely secular societies. We adapted a classic experimental philosophy task to test for this intuitive belief in belief among people in eight comparatively nonreligious countries: Canada, China, Czechia, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and Viet Nam (total N = 3804). Our analyses revealed strong evidence that (1) people intuitively favor religious belief over atheism and that (2) this pattern was not moderated by participants’ own self-reported atheism. Indeed, (3) even atheists in relatively secular societies intuitively prefer belief to atheism. These inferences were robust across different analytic strategies, and across other measures of individual differences in religiosity and religious instruction. Although explicit religious belief has rapidly declined in these countries, it’s possible that belief in belief may still persist. These results speak to the complex psychological and cultural dynamics of secularization.",

          "authors": "Lydia Hickman; Jennifer Cook",
          "abstract": "Older autistic adult literature is sparse, and little is known about the aging autistic population. However, recent evidence suggests an increased prevalence of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) diagnosis in the autistic population. It may initially be assumed that autistic individuals are genetically more likely to develop PD, but genetic studies do not provide evidence for a strong link between the two conditions. Alternatively, an underappreciated body of evidence may shed light upon why autistic individuals score highly on PD diagnostic criteria: movement differences in autism have been likened to those of PD. Given that PD diagnosis is primarily movement-based, if it is indeed the case that autistic movement appears parkinsonian, this may facilitate autistic individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for PD. If validated, this theory could have serious implications for the specificity of the PD diagnostic process. The current review article sets out the evidence for high rates of PD diagnosis and parkinsonism in the autistic population and subsequently questions why this might be the case, making reference to genetic and behavioural similarities between autism and PD. Overall, this article highlights a potential diagnosis issue that should be further researched and considered by clinicians when conducting diagnostic assessments of movement disorders.",

          "authors": "Michael Levin",
          "abstract": "How best to explain the properties and capabilities of embodied minds? The conventional paradigm holds that living beings are to be understood as the sculpted products of genetics and environment, which determine form and function of the brain as the unique seat of intelligence. Some provision is made for emergence and complexity, as additional “facts that hold” about networks, circuits, and other components of life. Here, I present a sketch of a framework and research roadmap that differs from this view in key aspects. First, the evolutionary conservation of mechanisms and functionality indicate fundamental symmetries between the self-construction of bodies and of minds, revealing a much broader view of diverse intelligence across the agential material of life beyond neural substrates. Second, surprising competencies (not just complexity or unpredictability) in systems that have not had a history of selection for those abilities suggest an additional input into patterns of body and mind that motivates a research program on a latent space of patterns ingressing into the physical world. Emphasizing the principles of continuity and pragmatism, and using morphogenesis as a tractable model system in which to develop these ideas, I explore the implications of the following ideas: (A) Evolution favors living forms that exploit powerful truths of mathematics and computation as affordances, which contribute as causes of morphological and behavioral features.  (B) Cognitive patterns are an evolutionary pivot of the collective intelligence of cells; given this symmetry between neuroscience and developmental biology, I propose that the relationship between mind and brain is the same as the relationship between mathematical patterns and the morphogenetic outcomes they guide. (C) Many mathematicians, and a non-mysterian approach to science in general, suggest that these patterns are not random facts to be merely cataloged as “emergence” when found, but rather can be systematically discovered within a structured, ordered (non-physical) space. Therefore, I hypothesize that: (1) instances of embodied cognition likewise ingress from a Platonic space, which contains not only low-agency patterns like facts about triangles and prime numbers, but also higher agency ones such as kinds of minds; (2) we take seriously for developmental, synthetic, and behavioral biology the kinds of non-physicalist ideas that are already a staple of Platonist mathematics; (3) what evolution (and bioengineering, and possibly AI) produces are pointers into that Platonic space – physical interfaces that enable the ingression of specific patterns of body and mind.  This provides a new perspective on the organicist/mechanist debate by explaining why traditional computationalist views of life and mind are insufficient, while at the same time erasing artificial distinctions between life and machine, since both are in-formed by diverse patterns from the latent space. I sketch a research program, already begun, of using the tools of the fields of synthetic morphology and diverse intelligence to map out key regions of the Platonic space. Understanding the mapping between the architecture of physical embodiments and the patterns to which they point has massive implications for evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, AI, and the ethics of synthbiosis with the forthcoming immense diversity of morally important beings.",

Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning is an important mechanism of moral learning and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "Psychopathy is a longstanding construct of great clinical interest, marked by traits such as callousness, manipulativeness, and impulsivity. The Elemental Psychopathy Assessment (EPA; Lynam et al., 2011) was developed to anchor the measurement of psychopathy within the Five Factor Model of personality. This preregistered study presents a meta-analytic review of the EPA’s construct validity, examining its relations at the domain and total levels with other psychopathy measures, personality traits, and psychopathological outcomes. Drawing from 50 studies across 38 manuscripts, over 3,500 effect sizes were analyzed. EPA Antagonism showed strong convergent validity with constructs like TriPM Meanness and SRP-III Callous Affect, while EPA Disinhibition was closely linked to impulsivity-related traits such as TriPM Disinhibition and SRP-III Erratic Lifestyle. EPA Narcissism was associated with interpersonal dominance and manipulation, whereas EPA Emotional Stability generally showed positive relations with adaptive traits and outcomes. Antagonism and Disinhibition emerged as the core psychopathy traits, while the role of Emotional Stability remained uncertain due to its varied associations with maladaptive outcomes. Moderator analyses revealed differences across sample types and EPA versions. These findings offer meta-analytic support for the EPA’s validity, highlighting the centrality of Antagonism and Disinhibition, and the complexity of Emotional Stability in the psychopathy construct.",

          "abstract": "Understanding variability is a key focus in many areas of psychological research, with growing interest in modeling individual and group variability. While multilevel models such as heterogeneous variance models and Mixed-Effect Location Scale (MELS) models have been used to capture these dynamics, they typically rely on linear assumptions and temporal change of the variability is restricted to one level. Recent calls for nonlinear approaches in psychology highlight the need for more flexible models that can better account for complex, dynamic processes. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) within the framework of heterogeneous variance models to address these limitations. By incorporating GPs, we allow for the modeling of nonlinear variability across multiple levels, including temporal dynamics at both the individual and group levels. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in two empirical applications. Our findings show that using GPs provide an improved model fit compared to traditional linear methods and highlight the utility of GPs in variance modeling, offering new possibilities for studying dynamic and emergent processes in psychological and social science research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Peritraumatic dissociation is thought to contribute to posttraumatic symptoms like intrusions and memory disturbances. However, trauma-analogue studies that examined effects of experimental dissociation-induction on intrusions and memory were inconclusive. To better understand this, a necessary first step is to more systematically compare various induction methods.\nObjective: We evaluate different dissociation-induction-methods regarding their effectiveness, the intensity and quality of induced dissociation, and their effects on intrusions and memory in a pre-registered randomized-controlled online experiment.\nMethod: Healthy participants (N=213) were randomized to one of six dissociation-induction-methods: audio-photic stimulation, hypnotic-suggestion, or spiral-staring, each for one-minute or three-minute duration. Participants also completed two control conditions: a picture task as our primary non-dissociation-inducing control condition (control condition 1) and dot-staring as a second dissociation-inducing control condition closely resembling baseline or resting-state conditions in many experimental designs (control condition 2). Each condition was followed by an aversive (“trauma”) film. Peri-film dissociation intensity and quality, as well as film-specific intrusion-load and memory performance, were assessed. Dissociation-induction-methods were deemed successful if they elicited dissociation levels &gt; control condition 1 and ≥ control condition 2. Only successful dissociation-induction-methods were examined further. \nResults: Three-minute of hypnotic-suggestion and one-minute of spiral-staring successfully induced dissociation, while other methods did not meet the effectiveness threshold. Hypnotic-suggestion led to a greater increase in dissociation intensity than spiral-staring. However, dissociation induced by spiral-staring was perceived as more uncontrollable and unpleasant. Results did not support an adverse effect of dissociation induction or dissociation intensity on intrusion-load but on self-reported and objectively assessed memory performance.\nConclusions: Results indicate that hypnotic-suggestion and spiral-staring constitute effective, easy-to-implement, neuroimaging-compatible dissociation-induction-methods that allow to study dissociation in the laboratory. The present data did not support the notion that dissociation fosters intrusion formation but provides causal support for effects of dissociation on trauma memory.",

A non-probabilistic, snowball sample of 335 Peruvian adults was taken. For content validity, the clarity of the items were evaluated using Aiken's V. For internal structure validity, the fit indices of a series of confirmatory factor analyzes were evaluated for the one, two, and three-factor models. For validity with respect to other constructs, the SD-R constructs were correlated with the purity/sanctity subconstruct of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. For reliability, the ordinal alpha and the omega coefficient were used. Acceptable fit indices were obtained for the two and three oblique factor models, acceptable reliability indices for the core disgust and animal reminder scales was obtained, and small and significant positive correlations were obtained between the contamination and animal reminder factors with the purity/sanctity scale of the MFQ. The DS-R is an instrument with acceptable psychometric properties, although some adjustments must be made related to the reliability of the contamination scale, added to the exploration of other variables that correlate to each of its constructs to obtain greater validity in relation to other variables.",

          "title": "Ingressing Minds: Causal Patterns Beyond Genetics and Environment in Natural, Synthetic, and Hybrid Embodiments",
          "authors": "Michael Levin",
          "abstract": "How best to explain the properties and capabilities of embodied minds? The conventional paradigm holds that living beings are to be understood as the sculpted products of genetics and environment, which determine form and function of the brain as the unique seat of intelligence. Some provision is made for emergence and complexity, as additional “facts that hold” about networks, circuits, and other components of life. Here, I present a sketch of a framework and research roadmap that differs from this view in key aspects. First, the evolutionary conservation of mechanisms and functionality indicate fundamental symmetries between the self-construction of bodies and of minds, revealing a much broader view of diverse intelligence across the agential material of life beyond neural substrates. Second, surprising competencies (not just complexity or unpredictability) in systems that have not had a history of selection for those abilities suggest an additional input into patterns of body and mind that motivates a research program on a latent space of patterns ingressing into the physical world. Emphasizing the principles of continuity and pragmatism, and using morphogenesis as a tractable model system in which to develop these ideas, I explore the implications of the following ideas: (A) Evolution favors living forms that exploit powerful truths of mathematics and computation as affordances, which contribute as causes of morphological and behavioral features.  (B) Cognitive patterns are an evolutionary pivot of the collective intelligence of cells; given this symmetry between neuroscience and developmental biology, I propose that the relationship between mind and brain is the same as the relationship between mathematical patterns and the morphogenetic outcomes they guide. (C) Many mathematicians, and a non-mysterian approach to science in general, suggest that these patterns are not random facts to be merely cataloged as “emergence” when found, but rather can be systematically discovered within a structured, ordered (non-physical) space. Therefore, I hypothesize that: (1) instances of embodied cognition likewise ingress from a Platonic space, which contains not only low-agency patterns like facts about triangles and prime numbers, but also higher agency ones such as kinds of minds; (2) we take seriously for developmental, synthetic, and behavioral biology the kinds of non-physicalist ideas that are already a staple of Platonist mathematics; (3) what evolution (and bioengineering, and possibly AI) produces are pointers into that Platonic space – physical interfaces that enable the ingression of specific patterns of body and mind.  This provides a new perspective on the organicist/mechanist debate by explaining why traditional computationalist views of life and mind are insufficient, while at the same time erasing artificial distinctions between life and machine, since both are in-formed by diverse patterns from the latent space. I sketch a research program, already begun, of using the tools of the fields of synthetic morphology and diverse intelligence to map out key regions of the Platonic space. Understanding the mapping between the architecture of physical embodiments and the patterns to which they point has massive implications for evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, AI, and the ethics of synthbiosis with the forthcoming immense diversity of morally important beings.",

Furthermore, this paper proposes a comprehensive concept of secondary psychosis spectrum disorder, demonstrating that stress reactions and depression serve as a common foundation for these disorders. Their basis transitions from minimal introversion through normal state to maximal introversion along fluctuations in introversion, i.e., introversion spectrum, and these disorders arise secondarily from this spectrum.

          "authors": "Juha Silvanto; Yoko Nagai",
          "abstract": "A major question in cognitive neuroscience is understanding the neural basis of mental imagery, particularly in cases of its absence, known as aphantasia.  While research in this field has focused on the role of sensory domains, we propose that the key to understanding imagery lies in the intertwining of sensory processing and autonomic responses. Interoception plays a crucial role in mental imagery by anchoring experiences in first-person physiological signals, providing a self-referential perspective, and grounding the imagery in the body while also enabling its emotional aspects. Moreover, interoception contributes to the sense of agency and volitional control, as well as body schema—key hallmarks of voluntary mental imagery. Therefore, imagery should be approached as an integrated phenomenon that combines sensory-specific information with interoceptive signals. At the neural level, this process engages the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), regions vital for synthesizing information across cognitive, emotional, and physical domains, as well as for supporting self-awareness. From this perspective, aphantasia may reflect a suboptimal functioning of the insula/ACC, which can account for its associations with deficits in autobiographical memory, emotion perception, and conditions such as autism and dyspraxia.",

          "authors": "Margaret Ann McMullin; Nathan C. Higgins; Rohit Kumar; Mounya Elhilali; Joel S. Snyder",
          "abstract": "We encounter situations each day that require our auditory system to quickly interpret our surroundings. Auditory scene perception involves complex processes that allow us to identify both the setting and the objects within a scene, which are essential for decision-making, and situational awareness. While there is substantial evidence for distinct cortical regions and pathways supporting visual scene and object recognition, far less is known about how the brain processes complex auditory scenes and objects. This study aimed to determine whether distinct mechanisms underlie auditory setting and object identification and whether these mechanisms interact to aid perception. Participants listened to 200 natural auditory scenes of varying durations (1, 2, and 4 sec) and identified the setting (e.g., café) as well as the objects (e.g., talking, espresso machine, music) within each scene. Overall, performance was highest on the object identification task, and there was a significant interaction between task and scene duration, with a greater benefit of longer durations for the object identification task. Different low- and mid-level acoustic features of the scenes predicted performance on the two tasks. These results suggest that the auditory system employs distinct (and potentially interactive) computations for setting and object identification, allowing for quick interpretation of complex, real-world auditory scenes. The interaction between task performance and scene duration further suggests object and setting identification may operate on different temporal scales; objects might require more time for accurate individuation, while settings may be recognized more efficiently through global properties of scenes, such as openness or naturalness.",

          "abstract": "The use of survey-experimental research with online access panels provided by marketing research companies has grown significantly in the social sciences. These panels offer rapid access to quota-representative samples, enabling generalizable findings alongside causal inferences. However, researchers face a wide range of pricing options, with higher-priced companies often claiming superior quality in terms of respondent attentiveness, honesty, and representativity beyond quota characteristics. This creates a potential trade-off between sample quality and the statistical power achievable within a given research budget. Our study examines this trade-off within the context of Germany, the largest economy in Europe. We solicited bids from all marketing research companies operating in the German market to conduct survey-experimental research. From these, we selected three companies representing low, medium, and high price points, each corresponding to self-reported panel quality. Using identical vignette, priming, and conjoint experiments, along with standard socio-demographic and attitudinal measures relevant to political behavior research, we compared the outcomes across these quota-representative samples. Our findings suggest that for experimental designs, the trade-off between price and quality is less pronounced than commonly assumed. Based on this evidence, we recommend prioritizing statistical power by minimizing costs per respondent.",

          "abstract": "The role of bibliometric indicators in research assessment has been widely debated. This article explores how citation-based metrics are interpreted and applied in negative habilitation reviews, combining theoretical insights on citation practices with empirical analysis of review discourse. The theoretical section examines different conceptual frameworks for understanding bibliometric indicators, including essentialist, constructivist, and normative perspectives on citations. It highlights how citation metrics are often assumed to reflect recognition, influence, or research quality, despite growing evidence of their contextual limitations. The empirical section analyzes 174 negative habilitation reviews from four disciplines, identifying distinct patterns in how reviewers incorporate bibliometric data into their assessments. While some reviewers treat citation counts and journal rankings as direct indicators of scholarly impact, others regard them as secondary or complementary tools that require careful contextualization. The findings reveal a lack of standardized bibliometric reasoning, leading to inconsistencies in how candidates’ research contributions are evaluated. The study underscores the need for greater transparency and theoretical awareness in the use of citation-based metrics in peer review, contributing to broader discussions on the reliability and standardization of research evaluation practices.",

          "authors": "Matthias Revers; Stephen Coleman",
          "abstract": "This article theorizes how political divisions permeate social interaction, transforming the political into the personal in everyday life. Drawing on affective polarization research, we highlight the central role of identification and emotions in shaping political in-groups and out-groups. Moving beyond conventional measures of cross-group resentment, we conceptualize polarization as the lived experience of political antagonism. We argue that polarization materializes through struggles for recognition, shaped by the perception and processing of political conflict as it circulates through public communication channels. Adopting a performance-theoretical lens, we connect the symbolic language, emotions, and misrecognition in micropolarization to the broader public drama of political conflict. Using interview data on family and friendship disputes related to COVID-19 vaccination denial in the UK and Germany, we examine how public conflicts manifest in interpersonal relationships. This study suggests a research agenda that explores interactional dynamics across online and offline spaces, diverse social groups, and varying levels of relational involvement, offering a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of political polarization.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines gender differences in paid work over time and illustrates the pitfalls encountered by any comparative research that only considers either labor force participation rates or average working hours. To do so, we analyze harmonized survey data from Europe and the United States from 1992 to 2022 (N=43,283,172) and show that more progress was made in closing gender gaps in labor force participation rates than in working hours. In most countries, women’s labor force participation rates increased considerably, but their average working hours decreased, whereas both men’s labor force participation rates and average working hours decreased or stagnated (but nonetheless still remained much higher than women’s). We show and argue that these countervailing trends in working hours and labor force participation rates make it difficult to paint a coherent picture of cross-national differences in women’s and men’s paid work and of changes over time. In response, we propose “work volume” as a supplementary or alternative measure for any type of comparative research. Work volume records zero working hours for nonemployed individuals and thus allows straightforward comparisons between women’s and men’s (or any other groups’) involvement in paid work. Using the proposed work volume measure, we show that gender gaps in paid work decreased over time, but that even in 2022, men’s involvement in paid work remained considerably higher than women’s—with gender gaps being lowest in the Scandinavian and the former Communist countries.",

In consequence, the Finnish government has abandoned the assimilationist model for the adoption of multiculturalism which is still under experimentation. To better figure out how multiculturalism has been understood and carried out in Finnish early childhood education and care, we utilize thematic analysis in joint with critical discourse analysis methods to study Finnish core curricula for the early childhood education and care, published respectively in 2003 and 2016. Results suggest that since 2016, cultural diversity in Finland has been considered as an enriching resource to the society. The right of using and developing mother tongues has been included in Finnish multicultural early childhood education and care. Second, schools have replaced families and parents to become the primary responsible for supporting and developing cultural diversity. Third, different groups, namely Sami, Roma, and immigrants, enjoy differentiated supports for developing their culture in newly reformed multicultural ECEC education.",

          "authors": "Heng-Chien Liou",
          "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the current of queer theory has flown through various departments and disciplines. Following its intellectual roots in post-structuralism, queer theory has proven its worth for investigation on the subjects of sexuality, especially in art and humanities. However, queer theory’s influences in other academic fields, such as social sciences and biomedical science, are given less attention. In particular, the relationship between queer theory and sociology past and now need to be revisited: (1) How has sociology, well-known for its epistemological pluralism, responded to the queer theoretical interventions? (2) How has the poststructural critique inspired, contributed to, or challenged sociological scholarship? (3) How do such interactions differ between the center and the periphery of global academic? To answer these questions, I dived into the academic archives looking for clues by close-reading the seminal queer sociological works from the 1990s to the present, and tracing the genealogy of interaction between the two disciplines. Given the radical roots of sociology, such as Marxism and critical theory, we may assume that queer theory and sociology enjoy a considerable affinity. However, the relationship between the two is indeed indeterminate and often comes into tension or confrontation. I divided the developments into three periods and identified the major conceptual themes in each period. Finally, I conclude this article with the remarks and future directions illuminated by this genealogical investigation of queer sociology. My aim for this article is to serve as a map for prospective students and scholars of queer theory and sociology to navigate the intellectual landscape of queer sociology.",

Through several case studies from the observatory, we examine specific instances of methodological flaws, data integrity issues, and the challenges of maintaining scientific rigour and effective peer review under emergency conditions. While the prototype demonstrates the potential for creating a crowd-sourced comprehensive repository of post-publication reviews, it also reveals limitations such as resource constraints and the complexities involved in selecting and presenting articles and responses.

Thus, religious responses on open-ended questions, like ancestry, are encoded as \"other.\" Utilizing American Community Survey (ACS) 2018-2022 data (n = 15,721,123), I find that the 1.49 million Americans with an \"other\" ancestry display remarkable parallels with American Jews, the country's largest religious minority, according to non-governmental survey data. They are disproportionately concentrated in regions with large Jewish populations, exhibit a linguistic profile (e.g., prevalence of Yiddish and Hebrew) consistent with American Jews, and display demographic characteristics (age structure, educational attainment, and racial/ethnic composition) much more in line with Jews than the general U.S. population. These findings suggest that Jews likely comprise a significant portion of those with \"other\" ancestry on the ACS, yet a majority of the 7.63 million Jews in the U.S. do not report this information. This poses important questions on defining Jewish identity in the U.S. today, especially since the ACS ancestry question may be eliminated and subsumed into the new combined race/ethnicity question under statistical policy directive 15. This is the first study on ACS data analyzing the \"other\" ancestry category and assessing its congruence with the American Jewish population.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the interplay between gender, communication styles, and professional outcomes. Drawing from extant literature on gender stereotypes and their impact on workplace communication, as well as literature on hierarchies and the organization of knowledge in production, I posit that linguistic elaboration, a communication trait more commonly associated with women, obtains different associations in certain workplace contexts. In particular, due to the greater use of elaboration in down-rank communication, this linguistic quality becomes associated with higher status within knowledge-intensive organizations. Consequently, within such contexts, women’s use of elaboration in communication becomes paradoxically gender-incongruent, and penalized accordingly (e.g., accusations of “talking bossy”). Leveraging natural language processing techniques on two distinct datasets – email exchanges within a technology firm and job application essays – I uncover compelling evidence of gender disparities. While both men and women engage in elaborate communication, women non-managers disproportionately face negative consequences, particularly when communicating upward to managers. These penalties persist even controlling for message content and communication patterns, suggesting a status violation mechanism rather than efficiency standards. These findings contribute to organizational theory by illuminating the context-dependent nature of gender-congruent communication and its divergent effects on career advancement.",

          "authors": "Maybritt Jill Alpes",
          "abstract": "The article examines how academics can mobilize their epistemic resources to engage with justice claims able to challenge border violence. Many migration scholars would like to find ways to mobilize their knowledge to resist migrants’ human rights violations. Despite increased focus on research impact, border violence is only increasing. On the one hand, policy makers do not act on scholarly recommendations that are highly critical, but not necessarily actionable. On the other hand, when scholarly recommendations are actionable, legal and policy changes do not necessarily result in meaningful improvements for refugees’ and other migrants’ dignity. As a result, there is a dichotomy between applied research that is not critical and critical research that is not actionable. Against this backdrop, this article explores how migration researchers can reclaim the meaning of impact and smuggle critique into the term. The article is based on auto-biographical explorations of what it means for an anthropologist to produce knowledge on migration from within law faculties and as policy officer and research consultant for human and refugee rights organizations. Based on this material, the article argues that migration scholars who seek justice should not produce more evidence, but rather take law seriously as a knowledge practice. The article develops three design principles for migration scholars who seek to resist in the short- and medium-term migration laws and policies that violate human right principles. First, build knowledge alliances with justice actors. Second, theorize knowledge needs in justice claims. Third, broker the validity of truth claims.",

Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach—pre-nudges—to make consumers more receptive to calorie information. Unlike nudges, which are used to directly influence a choice, pre-nudges are used to directly influence how consumers react to the nudge itself (the calorie label). In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance. Overall, our paper suggests a possible role for pre-nudges in addressing the obesity epidemic—one of the largest public health issues globally—and illustrates the potential usefulness of pre-nudges more generally",

          "abstract": "This article explores the patterns of political representation by movement parties and their influence on policy-making in a comparative manner by investigating policy successes of four movement parties – two in Germany (AfD, die Grünen) and two in Italy (M5S, Federazione dei Verdi), - against the policy expectations of the social movements they represent. It shows that movement parties can achieve policy influence and help transmit policy demands of their associated social movements into institutions in other ways than through a powerful position in the government or in parliament. This demonstrates that a party does not have to be in a governing coalition to achieve policy success, nor does being in a government coalition at the time of policy adoption ensure policy survival in the long-term. On the contrary, parties in opposition or with low representation in parliament are able to achieve important policy impact, despite their relatively low popularity in the elections prior or following the adoption of a particular policy. Policy success can be attributed to a number of diverse factors: close alignment with the movement, impact on the agenda-setting stage through implicit or explicit influence of the party, cooptation of policy issues by established political parties, and direct participation in policy-making. The latter, however, does not by itself ensure long-term sustainability of the policy success. We elaborate on the implications of this research on theories of democratic representation, coalition governance, and public policy.",

Despite important research on economic and political reasons to grant independence to central banks, we know little about what the public thinks about CBI. This is important given citizens' potential role in constraining politicians' ability to alter CBI. We hypothesize that support for CBI is influenced by citizens' limited understanding of central bank governance and their beliefs about who will gain control over monetary policy if independence is reduced. Our expectations are confirmed by a preregistered survey experiment and a pre-post-election test in the U.S. Support for CBI increases when respondents learn that the President would gain more influence if independence was reduced. This support decreases when respondents expect a co-partisan to lead the executive branch. These findings shed light on the legitimacy basis of monetary institutions in politically polarized contexts and, from a policy perspective, indicate the limits of central bank communication.",

          "abstract": "Norris and Inglehart's (2019) cultural backlash theory has become popular for understanding right-wing backlash. The theory views backlash as a reaction from segments of the population who feel alienated by advancing societal liberalization. We test this core claim of the theory by investigating whether highly educated individuals increasingly adopted more liberal attitudes toward immigrants, LGTBIQ+ rights, and gender roles over recent decades across European countries, and whether this has led to an increasing liberalization gap to lower educated segments of the population. Using data from the European Values Study (1980–2020) and the European Social Survey (2001–2021) we find that liberalization dynamics vary significantly across countries and attitudinal indicators. Growing liberalization gaps are most common in Central and Eastern European countries, particularly in a distinct and pronounced way concerning LGTBIQ+ attitudes. Western Europe shows fewer gaps, mostly in isolated attitudes on immigration and gender roles. We conclude that cultural backlash theory is most applicable to Central and Eastern Europe (and to some extent in Southern Europe). In most countries, explaining backlash through this lens requires acknowledging that growing liberalization gaps occur on singular attitudes rather than being a widespread phenomenon.",

We find a robust same-type bias in preferences for teachers. The same-type biases are significant on the full sample but stronger among low-skilled and female students. Our results point to an intersectional mechanism; students are significantly less likely to select classes led by a teacher of the opposite gender and ethnicity, implying that the students’ same-sex bias primarily affects ethnic minority teachers. While the ethnicity bias is robust to default nudging, elevating the opposite gender as the default option reduces or even eliminates the selection bias. We also show that, due to these student preferences, underrepresented teachers may receive significantly weaker students under standard admission systems.",

          "abstract": "Political efficacy is a powerful predictor of political participation. Many traditional measures of efficacy in political science prompt survey respondent to think of “people like me”, thus evoking a group reference. However, without specifying which of multiple possible group memberships respondents ought to think of, answers may refer to completely different groups across respondents, resulting in imprecise measures. In this paper, we argue that political efficacy encompasses not only an internal and an external dimension, but that there also is a third dimension, group-related political efficacy, which reflects variation in degrees of political responsiveness to different groups. To empirically assess our argument, we developed new measures of political efficacy and conducted two large, register-based surveys among different age groups (adolescents and adults) in Germany. The results show that individuals have very different perceptions of group-related political efficacy depending on their educational, economic, and migration backgrounds. With around 30 percent, a significant share of respondents has opposing group-related and external efficacy, suggesting that theoretically and empirically differentiating between these dimensions is important. Based on our evidence, we conclude that a vague stimulus as “people like me” blur the differences between general external and group-related dimensions of political efficacy. Instead, to adequately assess political efficacy, we suggest to use our newly developed (short) scales, specifying the concrete group of reference that the researcher is interested in.",

Then, we evaluated how title changes have affected the evolution of the journals’ language of publication, authorship, readership and impact. The acceleration of the trend towards the de-nationalization and anglicization of journal titles coincided with the rise of discourses on internationalization in the 1980s and the growing use, a decade later, of quantitative indicators in research evaluation, above all the Impact Factor. In general, this rebranding strategy of scholarly journals resulted in a higher visibility on the global market of scientific publications, leading to a more internationalized authorship and readership, but to the detriment of the use of national languages.",

          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

We are looking at five examples through a common lens.

A special focus is put on the description of the generative mechanisms using simple models that can be used online and the distinction of mechanisms of type I (which govern the behavior of individuals and institutions) and type II (which govern the emergence of new systemic properties). Finally, five extensions of the simple models are discussed, which demonstrate different research directions that can be taken in exploring and developing social theory.",

          "abstract": "Environmental challenges, social pressures, and international agreements underscore the need for a transition to renewable energy sources. This shift is driven by the economic feasibility of technologies such as solar and wind power. However, the transition to renewable energy faces significant obstacles: its lower energy density compared to fossil fuels requires larger structures to produce equivalent amounts of energy. Additionally, these sources have a shorter lifespan than conventional ones, leading to increased demand for minerals, which are often extracted in Global South countries. This dynamic may exacerbate the socio-environmental conflicts and impacts associated with mining. Based on data collection and analysis from various global reports, complemented by academic studies from different regions, this study explores the intrinsic connection between renewable energy sources and the expansion of mining activities, highlighting the implications of this process.",

          "abstract": "We examined the extent to which the socioeconomic status (SES) of grandchildren’s families (measured by parental education and household income) is associated with the frequent child care help and financial support grandparents channel towards their descendants. Several studies have shown that (i) grandparental investment varies according to gender and lineage, and (ii) differences in family relationships tend to exist between lower and higher SES families. However, there is a lack of studies examining whether grandparents invest more in grandchildren from lower or higher SES families in contemporary affluent societies, and whether this differs between maternal and paternal grandmothers and grandfathers. We used population-based data on younger and middle-aged adults from Germany. To study the associations between family SES and grandparental investment, we applied generalized ordered logit odds models. Grandparents provided frequent childcare help more often to grandchildren whose parents had higher levels of education and income. Specifically, frequent childcare help from maternal grandmothers increased as parental education levels rose. Additionally, paternal grandparents provided more financial support to families in the medium, high, and highest income classes compared to those in the lowest income class. There was evidence that grandparents invest more in grandchildren from higher SES families than in those from lower SES families. The findings suggest that grandparental support may widen the inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged children.",

          "authors": "Ilari Ilmakunnas; Susanna Sten-Gahmberg; Timopekka Hakola",
          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage points higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed their pension in early 2023. In this study, we assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension take-up using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. We also analyse differences in responses by socioeconomic status and gender. The extraordinary pension index adjustment increased the probability of claiming the partial old-age pension in the first month after becoming eligible for it by around 8 percentage points, or around 80 per cent. The effect is explained by individuals claiming a pension sooner than they would have in the absence of the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

          "abstract": "Elites worldwide have used a variety of indirect tools to exclude specific racial groups from the electorate when laws or constitutions prevented them from doing so directly. Yet because voter registers rarely capture race, how these tools affect the composition of the electorate remains unclear. We contribute foundational micro-evidence from newly digitized archival data for all 135,457 voters registered in the Cape Colony (South Africa) in 1903, including their racial classification. We examine franchise restrictions introduced by Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes a decade earlier, and find they reduced registered voters of color by at least one third relative to white voters, likely shifting crucial election outcomes. Tracing how race, class, and geography intersect at the individual level, we find increased property requirements had the largest impact. This reveals a trade-off between the breadth and precision of different tools of racial disenfranchisement, with consequences for the socioeconomic composition of the electorate.",

Our results illustrate the recent explosion in biodiversity finance grey literature since 2020, and increased prevalence of financial over conservation terminology. Text analysis shows the frequency with which mechanisms for generating private investment in nature are mentioned is greatly disproportionate to estimates of their current and projected role in overall biodiversity financing. Our findings highlight the growth in number and diversity of biodiversity finance actors over time, while also pointing to the centrality of a powerful few in driving financialised discourses.",

          "authors": "Niall Reddy",
          "abstract": "A large literature in heterodox political economy addresses an apparent puzzle in which investment has declined while profits have held up during the financialization era. The dominant answer to this puzzle centers on the rise of shareholder value orientation and the “downsizing and distributing” (DD) imperative it imposes on firms. Yet the detailed empirical literature on the topic - focussed on partial effects - pays precious little attention to actual observed patterns of growth, investment and distribution at a firm level. Digging deep into firm level data and correcting several conceptual and measurement errors, this paper challenges several key stylized facts of the financialization account, revealing a different set of patterns which are very difficult to square with stronger versions of DD theory. It shows that the profit-investment puzzle is not a paradox of the financialization era, but only of the post-2000 period. Similarly, the ramping up of payout rates only happens in a broad way after the turn of the millennium. While financialization theories cannot account for the 2000s watershed I argued that a trifecta of other structural shifts can. Ultimately this paper questions the widespread practice of giving analytical priority to financialization in heterodox political economy.",

Using long-term data on cyclones\nand flooding in Bangladesh, I find that the increase in propensity of both cyclones\nand floods affect crop choice, but only cyclones affect sectoral employment, shifting\nemployment out of agriculture. The paper develops a structural model to study the\nwelfare implications of adaptation and calculate the Value of adaptation i.e. how much\nworse welfare would be if both adaptation channels were shut off. I find that the\nValue of adaptation is informed by the nature of the shocks: both the intensity of\nfuture shocks and their correlatedness across crops and regions influence the Value of adaptation. The Value of adaptation is 20% in the case in which intensity of both flooding and cyclones doubles relative to the 2000s average, and such increases are correlated within regions.",

Initially established in midwifery, the discourse of professional advocacy has gradually shifted from a patient focus to advocating for the professionals in their professional roles. This move is driven by the need to influence the health, well-being, and efficacy of the health professions, thereby positively impacting patient care.  The concept of advocacy is thus expanding from advocacy focussing on patients/social groups, to incorporating advocating for health professionals by health professionals. However, it is unclear if literature and evidence is keeping pace with this potential conceptual shift taking place in the practice setting, and it is unclear if past patient-centred conceptualisations of advocacy are relevant to the context of professional-orientated advocacy. This paper aims to initiate this discussion specific to the nursing profession.",

SA allows for effectively describing and visualizing these temporal processes, helping identify regularities or anomalies in the number, duration, or timing of events and states. These patterns can be linked to units' characteristics (e.g., gender) or contextual factors (e.g., policy changes). The chapter outlines the main steps in conducting SA: coding and visualizing sequences, calculating dissimilarities, clustering similar sequences, and using cluster membership in regression models.

Using spatial analysis to examine spillover effects from adjacent locations, increases in the Catholic adherent rate and the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with increases in homicide, while increases in the mainline Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with decreases in homicide. The total effect (both direct and indirect) for changes in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate is the largest in the model.

We conducted a survey of 505 California farmers and ranchers affected by wildfires between 2017 and 2023. Main findings show that wildfires’ impacts on producers are extensive and range from mild to catastrophic, with both short and long-term repercussions, regardless of their exposure level. Producers play a central role in community emergency wildfire risk response and management by reducing fuel loads, creating defensible space, and leveraging their fire management expertise for themselves and their neighbors. Many producers lack a robust financial safety net, particularly among vulnerable populations, pointing to the need to increase access to recovery resources including insurance and disaster assistance programs. We find an urgent need for policy reforms, improved support, targeted extension programs, and integrated coordination mechanisms. Producers are our overlooked allies in building widespread wildfire resilience. Enhanced collaborative efforts among producers, fire professionals, and agricultural support organizations are thus imperative to co-create and implement strategies that ensure the long-term sustainability and economic viability of California’s agricultural communities.",
