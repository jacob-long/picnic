          "abstract": "Adolescent suicide rates have risen over the past two decades, underscoring the need for improved risk detection strategies. This study leverages passively-collected smartphone data to identify suicide-related language in adolescents’ keyboard usage using natural language processing (NLP). We developed a suicide lexicon for adolescent language and validated it with labeled data (N=121,515 text entries), demonstrating higher performance than lexicons not designed for youth. Across two independent cohorts at elevated suicide risk (Ns=208/211; &gt;6 million text entries), lifetime suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) and current suicidal ideation were associated with increased frequency of smartphone suicide-related language. Human coding indicated varied language, including authentic first-person current suicidal ideation (14.5%) and jokes or hyperbole (20.2%). Compared with the lexicon alone, human coding of suicide-related entries, especially first-person language, showed stronger associations with STB history, highlighting the need for approaches to distinguish intent. Findings highlight both potential and limitations of NLP for suicide prevention.",

          "authors": "Jerome R Busemeyer; Meijuan Lu",
          "abstract": "Quantum consciousness concerns both the possible role that quantum mechanics\nhas for understanding consciousness as well as the role that consciousness\nhas for interpreting quantum physics. Quantum brain theories\nhypothesize that quantum physical processes occur within and between the\nneurons of the brain and have important effects on cognition as well as consciousness.\nQuantum cognition is a growing new field in cognitive science\nconcerned with the application of the mathematical principles of quantum\ntheory to human judgment and decision-making behavior. What do all these\ntheories have to do with each other? Quantum theories of consciousness have\nmore to say about quantum physics than cognitive psychology and conscious\nexperiences. Quantum brain theories have not been sufficiently “scaled up”\nto provide clear implications for how quantum physical processes generate\nmore complex cognition. Quantum cognition theories have avoided addressing\nfundamental issues about consciousness and have remained agnostic with\nrespect to the quantum brain hypothesis. This article will address the problem\nof connecting these ideas together by connecting quantum cognition to\nthe other two topics.",

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that morality may be surprisingly absent from everyday life (Atari\net al., 2023; Hofmann et al., 2014). Across four daily life studies (Total N = 1,663 people from\nNorth America, Germany, and China; 90,002 observations), we revisit the everyday relevance of\nmorality by examining how often people perceive opportunities to express 12 moral virtues (e.g.,\nhonesty, kindness), 12 corresponding vices (e.g., dishonesty, unkindness), and (im)morality.\nParticipants perceived opportunities to express at least one of the 12 virtues &gt; 49% of the time.\nHowever, they rarely perceived these opportunities to express virtues as opportunities to be\n“(im)moral” (&lt; 8% in North America and Germany; 26% in China). Patience, responsibility, and\nrespectfulness were most often relevant, whereas forgiveness, courage, and loyalty were least\noften relevant. We conclude that conceptualizing morality in more concrete terms reveals a\nplethora of morally relevant situations that have gone unnoticed in previous studies.",

          "authors": "Manon Jones; Gwennant Evans; Tesni Huws; Catherine Alice Clark; Charles Hulme; Cameron Downing",
          "abstract": "Approximately 40% of children worldwide learn to read in a language other than their home language or in two languages simultaneously. Evidence suggests that instruction in one language can enhance literacy outcomes in the other; however, the existence and longevity of these cross-language effects in poorer readers is unclear.  This study used a cross-over randomised controlled trial design. Initially, 129 children (mean age = 111.44 months, SD = 12.23) participated in a 15-week Welsh literacy intervention, while 128 children (mean age = 110.62 months, SD = 12.34) served as a wait-list control group and did not receive the intervention during this period. After the first intervention phase, the wait-list control group then participated in the same 15-week Welsh literacy intervention. Welsh and English reading efficiency were assessed at three time points: baseline (t1; prior to intervention), posttest (t2; immediately after the initial intervention phase for the first group), and follow-up (t3; approximately 3-months after t2). We found that training poorer bilingual readers using a language-rich literacy intervention in Welsh improved word decoding skills in both Welsh and English. These effects were sustained in the longer term for the trained language, Welsh, but were short-lived for the untrained language, English. Our findings suggest that targeted intervention in one language enhances cognitive processes underlying literacy in both languages, and that bilingual students struggling with reading skills can make short-term literacy gains from a monolingual intervention that transfer to a language where there has not been explicit training.",

          "authors": "KATIE SPINK; Samantha C. Seaver; Katherine T. Foster",
          "abstract": "Coping effectively with affective distress is a critical developmental task expected to support affective health over the lifespan, with parents likely shaping coping skill development. Yet, naturalistic variation in coping skill development is poorly understood and it remains unclear whether: (1) gender-specific and parental support enrich coping skill development and (2) differences in naturalistic coping skill trajectories differentiate psychopathology outcomes thereafter. Using longitudinal data from a large, nationally-representative U.S. adolescent study (n = 831), the current study applied a longitudinal multilevel modeling approach to track growth in acceptance and cognitive restructuring coping skill use over 7 years spanning adolescence through young adulthood. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVAs and Dunn’s post-hoc tests were applied to estimate trajectory differences based on within-gender variation, between adolescent parental support, and psychosocial consequences in adulthood. Greater parental support acted as an enrichment factor for coping skill development over time, with trajectories further differentiated as by gender. Adolescent coping patterns differentiated psychosocial impairment in early adulthood, with evidence of gender-specific linkages between coping and impairment, particularly for women. Characterizing specific coping repertoires and the context in which they develop is likely support understanding of whether coping skill development contributes to psychopathology onset.",

          "authors": "Hongyang Liu",
          "abstract": "Objective: To test a conditional process in which perceived stress (PSS) mediates the link between academic involution (INV) and sleep health (SQ), with psychological resilience (RE) buffering the INV→PSS, PSS→SQ, and INV→SQ paths among Chinese vocational students.\nMethods: A cross-sectional online survey at a public vocational college yielded N=663 complete responses (forced-response). Measures included an 18-item INV scale, PSS-4, a multidimensional sleep-health index (SQ), and BRS-6. Analyses comprised descriptives, group tests, correlations, and PROCESS Model 59 with 5,000 bias-corrected bootstraps; sex, grade, and place of origin were covariates.\nResults: INV correlated positively with PSS and negatively with SQ; PSS correlated negatively with SQ; RE correlated positively with SQ and negatively with PSS. In PROCESS, INV→SQ (B=−1.028, p&lt;.001) and PSS→SQ (B=−2.555, p&lt;.001) were negative, and INV→PSS positive (B=.522, p&lt;.001). All three interactions supported buffering by RE: INV×RE→PSS (B=−.072, p=.021), PSS×RE→SQ (B=.452, p&lt;.001), INV×RE→SQ (B=.190, p=.033). The direct INV→SQ effect weakened from Low/Mean/High RE (B=−.584/−.394/−.204), becoming nonsignificant around +1 SD (Johnson–Neyman). The indirect effect INV→PSS→SQ also decreased with higher RE.\nConclusion: Academic involution relates to poorer sleep partly through elevated perceived stress. Resilience systematically attenuates these associations, indicating a modifiable protective target for campus health initiatives aimed at safeguarding students’ sleep.",

          "abstract": "Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information\nprocessing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward\ncriticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of\nmeditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the\n“jhānas”, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and\nphysiological data during these practices and quantified the signal’s dynamical properties using\nLempel–Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In\naddition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch\nnegativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhāna was associated with\npronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across\nmultiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites.\nSpectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic 1/f component and a frequency-specific reorganization\nof long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and\nheightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during\njhāna. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhāna with minimal phenomenal\nexperiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness.\nAccordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the\nabsorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "authors": "Pietro Amerio; Axel Cleeremans",
          "abstract": "Perceiving a brief visual stimulus depends on both its intensity and its exposure duration.\nThese two parameters are in a reciprocal relationship, such that doubling the duration and\nhalving the intensity of a stimulus leads to equivalent perceptual performance. This\nrelationship is known as Bloch’s law. Despite numerous demonstrations of the validity of\nBloch’s law, recent evidence shows violations for exposures ranging from few microseconds\nto tens of milliseconds. The main goal of this work was to reassess the law’s validity on the\nperception of simple geometric shapes. The latter were presented for durations between\n0.15 and 100 ms thanks to a modern LCD-based tachistoscope. We successfully replicated\nthe reciprocal relationship between intensity and duration across five different tasks\ninvolving detection, shape discrimination and subjective visibility judgements. In accordance\nwith past literature, we report reciprocity only for stimuli shorter than a maximum critical\nduration (between 15 and 36 ms, depending on the task). We discuss these results in\ncomparison with the aforementioned violations of Bloch’s law, and identify potential causes\nof the latter. This work also served as a proof-of-principle that our apparatus is suitable for\nthe study of the intensity-duration reciprocity with a diverse range of stimuli.",

          "abstract": "In light of the growing circulation of health-related content on social media platforms, a critical gap persists in media uses and effects research: While much of the existing work has focused on self-serving motivations for media selection, an expanding body of evidence suggests that individuals—including those with psychological vulnerabilities—may seek out online content in a self-defeating fashion. In other words, users might actively search for content that aggravates, rather than alleviates, distress. Drawing on self-verification theory and other scholarship on self-defeating tendencies, we argue that when negative self-concepts are salient, users may gravitate toward media messages that validate these self-views, even at the expense of their well-being. We propose a research agenda to systematically examine maladaptive media exposure patterns and their psychological effects. To guide this line of inquiry, we propose an extension of the established Selective Exposure Self- and Affect-Management model to better conceptualize the complex motivations driving contemporary media use.",

          "authors": "Jeffrey M. Greeson; Johanna K. P. Greeson",
          "abstract": "Social connection and grit are critical socio-emotional skills associated with resilience and success among college students. Honors programs, which offer specialized academic and community-oriented experiences, may foster enhanced social connection and consequently greater grit as part of a high-achieving community. This study examined whether participation in a university honors program moderates the relationship between social connection and grit. College students (n = 421, 66% White, 64% female, 17% Honors) participated in a cross-sectional online survey conducted between March 2023 and May 2025. Moderation effects were tested using multiple regression with honors program participation as a moderator. Social connection was positively correlated with grit among the full sample (r = .315, p &lt; .001). Honors students exhibited a trend toward higher grit scores than non-honors students (p = .092, d = .27), while social connection scores did not significantly differ between groups (p = .753). Contrary to predictions, honors participation did not moderate the significant positive relationship between social connection and grit (interaction term β = .161, p = .468). These findings indicate that stronger social connection is a consistent predictor of higher grittiness among college students, irrespective of honors program participation. The absence of a moderating effect suggests that a university’s comprehensive support services may equally foster social connectedness and resilience across student groups, potentially matching the social, emotional, and motivational structures characteristic of an honors program. This study underscores the broader institutional value of cultivating supportive social environments to enhance students’ socio-emotional skills.",

          "abstract": "Background: There is surging interest in workplace mindfulness programs to address employee stress, resilience, and performance, however, significant gaps in knowledge remain around feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and predictors of therapeutic change. Objective: This study evaluated whether a brief, 4-session Mindfulness Skills Course (MSC) for university employees, covered by the institution’s wellness benefits, was effective in reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, improving feelings toward oneself and others, and increasing work performance. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study design. Participants completed self-report surveys before and after the MSC. Class attendance and home mindfulness practice were recorded to assess feasibility and adherence. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate program effectiveness and predictors of change. Results: 190 employees enrolled during the first year of roll-out. Of those, 164 (86%) completed pre-course surveys, 134 (82%) attended at least three class sessions, and 123 (75%) completed the post-course surveys and program evaluation. Paired samples t-tests showed improvements for perceived stress, mindfulness, and relational wellbeing with moderate to large effect sizes (d=.44 - .78; p’s&lt; .001). Self-perceived work performance increased with a small effect (d=.33; p&lt; .001). More frequent home meditation practice was positively correlated with a larger increase in mindfulness (r=.20; p&lt; .05). Increased mindfulness correlated with reduced stress (r=-.55), greater positive emotions towards self (r=.38) and reduced negative emotions towards self (r=-.40) and others (r=-.42) (all p’s&lt; .001). Reduced stress was correlated with increased perceived work performance (r=-.22; p&lt; .05). Higher baseline stress levels predicted greater increases in mindfulness (β= .37, R2= .14, p&lt;.001), while lower baseline mindfulness predicted greater reduction in stress (β= .27, R2= .07, p&lt;.01). Conclusion: Taken together, these results support the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief, 4-wk, employer-sponsored mindfulness skills course, which may be most helpful for individuals with higher stress and lower trait mindfulness.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Trait mindfulness influences perceived stress and sleep; however, it is unclear if this relationship is consistent across gender and race. Methods: College students at a public research university (n = 534, 65% female, 33% nonwhite) completed a cross-sectional online survey measuring three core qualities of mindfulness (trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering), sleep-related impairment, and perceived stress. Multiple group structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test whether the impact of trait mindfulness on perceived stress and sleep-related impairment was moderated by gender or race. Results: Across gender (cisgender male, cisgender female) and race (white, people of color), there were significant indirect effects of higher trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering on less sleep-related impairment via lower perceived stress (all p’s&lt;.001). However, there was no evidence of moderation. The multiple group models explained 26%-39% of the variance in perceived stress (R2 = .26 to .39) and 25%-40% of the variance in sleep-related impairment (R2 = .25 to .40); large magnitude effects.  Conclusions: The mediating effect of three core mindfulness qualities on sleep impairment and daytime functioning through lower levels of stress was consistent across gender and race. Future studies are needed to replicate and extend these exploratory findings using both broad and more refined (e.g., intersectional) demographic groups to further improve attention to diversity in the mindfulness field.",

Correlations were consistent between Honors and Non-Honors students. Only social connection (indirect effect: ꞵ = -.13, p &lt; .001) mediated the relationship between perfectionism and well-being, whereas both social connection and self-control partly mediated the relationship between perfectionism and psychological distress (indirect effects: ꞵ = .09 and ꞵ = .06; p’s &lt; .01). The multivariable path model explained 24% of the variance in well-being and 42% in distress. Conclusion: Social connection may be more important than mindfulness or self-compassion in buffering perfectionism's negative impact on mental health. Interventions aiming to enhance well-being and reduce distress among perfectionistic individuals may benefit from prioritizing social connectedness and belonging, rather than mindfulness or compassion in isolation.",

          "abstract": "Analytical flexibility describes the multiple defensible data analytic options researchers can pursue in a given study. Analytical flexibility can include practices like applying different methods for data cleaning, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests. Analytical flexibility is increasingly important for students to learn about because it impacts low replicability and credibility. Registered reports reduce analytical flexibility by submitting a manuscript to a journal in two stages, where journals provide an in-principle acceptance after Stage 1, committing to publishing the results. We describe and demonstrate an activity for psychology undergraduate courses to explore analytical flexibility within a registered report. Students read a first-stage registered report, received the data, and implemented the analysis plan as described. Analysts generate a product summarizing their results, and compare with the final Stage 2 and other analysts. This activity helps students to achieve multiple important learning outcomes focused on the impact of analytical flexibility on research conclusions, advantages and limitations of open science practice, and implementation of statistical methods in a real data context. This type of project could be an excellent option for a final project in an advanced undergraduate research methods or statistics course.",

Motivated by the mixed empirical findings concerning the effect and long-standing criticisms on estimating and interpreting interaction effects, I used a computational modeling approach to evaluate whether the habit-intention interaction effect estimated from statistical analysis is adequate for inferring the underlying cognitive mechanism assumed by contemporary habit theories. By manipulating the presence or absence of a habit-moderating mechanism in the data-generating model, statistical analyses were performed on the simulated data to examine the correspondence of the estimated interaction effect to the manipulation. Results suggest that while the conventional statistical approach can be indicative of the underlying mechanism, the direction and size of the estimated effect are often misleading in relation to the substantive theory. I identified the cause of the problem from a causal perspective (i.e., intention as a common cause of habit strength and behavior) and discussed potential remedies.",

It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week. However, nuances such as lower average scores when referencing the past week should be kept in mind when comparing results between studies using different reference time frames.",

Although children are theorized to rely heavily on their auditory feedback, previous experimental studies are inconsistent, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. This study examines the role of individual differences in attention and sensory processing abilities on auditory feedback control of speech in children. To this end, 53 children ages 4-11 completed a frequency altered feedback (FAF) task where the pitch of their auditory feedback was manipulated and responses to the manipulation were measured to provide an index of the child’s reliance on their auditory feedback. To measure attention and sensory processing abilities, children completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), and their parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) parent-report, respectively. Overall SSP scores, and scores in auditory, tactile, and sensory seeking domains were found to be associated with larger compensatory responses to FAF, while poorer SART performance was associated with slower vocal responses to down shifts. These results suggest that for children, greater sensory processing differences may promote increased reliance on auditory feedback for speech motor control, while attentional differences may be more important in the temporal processing of FAF.",

But if our colleagues are, accidentally or otherwise, promoting such ideas in exchange for salary, grants, or citations, how are we as academic psychologists meant to react? Formal models, from statistics and computational methods broadly, have a potential obfuscatory power that is weaponisable, laying serious traps for the uncritical adopters, with even the term 'AI' having murky referents. Herein, we concretise the term AI and counter the five related proposals above — from the clearly insidious to those whose ethical neutrality is skin-deep and whose functionality is a mirage.

However, little is known about whether young children also engage in such tendencies, or whether political groups are even socially meaningful for young children. To trace the beginnings of these tendencies, the current study investigated whether 6- to 12-year-old U.S. children use political markers, such as political party affiliation and support for presidential candidates, to guide their social preferences. We also examined children’s ability to report their political affiliation, whether their political affiliation matched their parents’, how accurate they are at reporting their parents’ political affiliations, and whether having parent-child conversations about politics predicted children’s political affiliation and social preferences. We found that children as young as 6 years of age showed ingroup preferences for individuals who shared their own or their parents' political affiliations – especially based on support for presidential candidates. Notably, even if children could not report their own presidential candidate choice or were inaccurate at predicting their parents' presidential candidate choice, children still preferred people who supported the same presidential candidate as their parents. Further, children who had conversations with their parents about politics were more likely to prefer people who matched their parents’ political affiliations. This study provides the first empirical evidence that 6- to 12-year-old children are using political markers to form ingroup preferences and show rudimentary forms of political partisanship.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive psychologists have long been interested in the intersection of emotion and memory given that the emotions associated with a stimulus affect its memorability. Theoretical perspectives within cognitive science have guided research on how affective dimensions such as valence and arousal impact aspects of memory such as accuracy, subjective vividness, consolidation, and retrieval. Here we argue that well-established theories of emotion from affective science represent a fruitful source of ideas whose implications for episodic memory have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we propose a model of emotional memory inspired by psychological constructionist theories of emotion that builds upon existing perspectives in this area while generating several novel hypotheses and avenues of investigation. Following psychological constructionism, we conceive of emotions as emergent phenomena constructed when perceivers use conceptual knowledge to make sense of affective sensations in context. The Constructionist Model of Emotional Memory (CMEM) highlights new directions for future emotional memory research, such as investigating the mnemonic consequences of conceptual emotion knowledge, and considering the effects of variability in emotion construction at the situational, individual, and cultural levels.",

In principle, the RCI provides common criteria for evaluating individual change. However, current practices use sample-specific estimates to create these criteria. Because sample estimates are subject to sampling error, these criteria are also subject to sampling error and therefore differ across studies. We illustrate how current practices can lead to differing criteria for reliable change and use simulations to identify the impact of sampling error on the RCI. Excessive error in the RCI began for the average sample when N &lt; 30, and samples only comfortably avoided the risk of excessive error when N &gt; 100. Finally, small errors in estimating a measure’s reliability sometimes had profound effects on the RCI. Recommendations on use of the RCI are provided.",

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with schizophrenia have prominent impairments in social cognition that contribute to poor functional outcomes. Gaze processing – the social-cognitive ability to accurately perceive human eye gaze direction – is similarly abnormal in schizophrenia and associated with social functioning. Though gaze processing has known neural underpinnings in cerebral social-processing brain regions, emerging data suggest that the posterior cerebellum plays a key but often neglected role in social-cognitive function. Elucidating the bi-directional cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics underlying social cognition is critical to identifying a novel treatment target.  \n\nMethods: 39 individuals with schizophrenia and 33 non-clinical control (NCC) participants completed an eye-contact detection task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dynamic causal modeling was used to delineate the dynamics between posterior cerebellum (Crus II) and three cerebral social processing nodes (inferior parietal lobule, anterior insula, and fusiform gyrus) regions and to quantify abnormal effective connectivity in SZ. A confirmatory replication analysis using an independent sample (SZ=27, NCC=22) was conducted to confirm the results. \n\nResults: Model structure comparison revealed overwhelming evidence that cerebellar connections to cerebral social processing nodes are vital to explaining gaze processing in NCC (ln(BF)=98.84) and SZ (ln(BF)=46.85). Relative to NCC, SZ showed less upregulation of cerebellar outputs during gaze processing (t(68)=2.853, p=.006) and this decreased upregulation was associated with social dysfunction (ρ=-.251, p=.034). These results were replicated in the independent sample.\n\nConclusions: Replicated across two independent samples, people with schizophrenia have altered cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics during gaze processing that is linked to social functioning. Given the accessibility of the cerebellum from the scalp for non-invasive brain stimulation relative to many cerebral social-cognitive regions, our findings have critical implications for translational interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conditions associated with perinatal inflammation have been identified as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, data linking early inflammatory biomarkers with later ADHD symptoms remain scarce. The acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) is a key marker of systemic inflammation. To date, no studies have examined the association between CRP levels in cord blood (reflecting neonatal inflammation) and subsequent childhood ADHD symptoms. Here, we aimed to investigate whether elevated cord blood CRP concentrations are associated with child’s ADHD symptoms at age 5. \nMethods: We analyzed data from 1019 and 831 mother–child pairs enrolled in the ELFE and EDEN prospective birth cohorts, respectively. CRP levels in cord blood were measured using an immunoassay. ADHD symptoms were assessed at age 5 using the hyperactivity–inattention subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Outcomes included both continuous scores and categorical thresholds: borderline (≥6) and abnormal (≥7) hyperactivity–inattention symptoms. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were conducted within each cohort to assess associations between elevated CRP levels (≥75th percentile) and ADHD symptoms. Results were then pooled using meta-analytic methods.\nResults: Borderline hyperactivity–inattention scores were observed in 21% of children in the ELFE cohort and 14% in EDEN. After adjusting for maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and pregnancy-related factors, as well as child characteristics at birth, elevated cord blood CRP was significantly associated with higher odds of ADHD symptoms: borderline scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08–1.86), abnormal scores (aOR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.06–2.08), and increased continuous symptom scores (β = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.04–0.54). \nConclusions: Higher CRP concentrations in cord blood are associated with greater ADHD symptom severity at age 5. These findings support the hypothesis that early-life inflammation may contribute to the developmental origins of ADHD and suggest that CRP could serve as a potential early biomarker of neurodevelopmental vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "Visual stimuli are known to vary in their perceived duration, with a variety of features, including both high and low level, shaping temporal responses. For example, the size, memorability, or numerosity of stimuli lead to longer perceived intervals, thus highlighting the malleability of time perception. However, little is known about how stimulus shape may influence temporal perception.  This feature is critical, as shape morphometry forms a general basis by which these other features may exert their influence on perceived duration.  To investigate this, we conducted a series of three experiments looking at how specific characteristics of shapes are significant factors in the manipulation of time perception.  We initially observed that greater shape angularity led to more precise time estimates, independent of shape identity.  Next, we found that shapes and symbols with greater edginess, vertical asymmetry, and thickness led to longer perceived durations.  Finally, we discovered that shapes built with higher numbers of geometrical primitives were perceived as longer, more precisely, and responded to more quickly, and were influenced by how subjectively meaningful they were to individual participants.  Our findings suggest that certain aspects of shapes are able to manipulate time perception due to innate geometric qualities within the visual cortex itself.",

          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted.

Social gaze is important in social interactions as it facilitates detecting information from and signaling information to the social partner. However, while previous work has identified differences between autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze patterns while viewing social videos, no work to-date has directly measured differences in autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze during face-to-face peer interactions.\nMethods: Autistic and non-autistic youth ages 11-15 years completed a face-to-face social interaction with a novel peer while wearing mobile eye-tracking glasses to measure gaze. The interaction consisted of three tasks: a getting-to-know-you conversation, a vacation-planning task, and a video-watching task. Fixations to the face were compared between autistic and non-autistic youth across the three contexts.\nResults: Autistic youth fixated less on their partner’s face than non-autistic youth, and these gaze differences varied across interaction contexts. Gaze differences between autistic and non-autistic youth were most pronounced during the unstructured initial getting-to-know-you conversation and absent during the structured video-watching task.\nConclusions: Context impacts gaze for autistic and non-autistic youth, such that the social attention patterns of autistic youth differ the most from their non-autistic peers during unstructured initial conversations. These gaze differences provide autistic youth with reduced opportunities to sense and signal information about their social environments, emphasizing that supports for peer interactions may be especially crucial when navigating these initial, unstructured meetings. In turn, reduced gaze signaling may also impact peers’ understanding of autistic youth, with implications for the development of autism acceptance programming that incorporates acknowledging and accepting potential gaze differences.",

          "authors": "Lourdes Guardiola; Sofia Abrevaya",
          "abstract": "Exposure to fitspiration content on social media has been linked to increased body dissatisfaction and negative mood. Although often portrayed as a healthier alternative to thinspiration, fitspiration frequently features slim, toned bodies and may reinforce appearance-related concerns. A recent trend, curvy fitspiration—featuring curvier women promoting physical activity and a healthy lifestyle—has shown promise in reducing body dissatisfaction. The present study aimed to investigate differences in the effect of Fitspiration content on weight concern, feeling fat, body dissatisfaction and negative mood depending on the body shape being observed (thin or curvy). Participants included 71 women who completed, before and after the exposure to images, 4 visuoanalogical scales. The variable feeling of fatness increased after exposure to fitspiration content featuring thin bodies and decreased after exposure to curvyfitspiration. Body dissatisfaction showed a significant time effect, increasing after exposure regardless of the experimental condition. Weight concern didn´t have a significant effect after exposure. Mood was significantly higher in the fitspiration condition with a slim body, regardless of the time of measurement. These results suggest that fitspiration's influence is shaped not only by body type but by its emphasis on appearance and the dynamics of social comparison and digital validation.",

          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts. This work goes beyond purely legalistic or formalist accounts of rules, showing that people’s intuitions about rule violations are shaped not only by codification but also by descriptive normativity, moral wrongness, and perceived legitimacy of enforcement.",

Traditional cognitive assessments often lack reliability and require lengthy in-person visits, limiting scalability for younger, trial-ready populations.\nObjectives: To evaluate the feasibility, reliability, and validity of high-frequency remote digital cognitive assessments in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD).\nParticipants: 162 mutation carriers and non-carriers from DIAN-TU from 20 international sites (Ages 19-69 years).\nMeasurements: Participants completed remote assessments via personal smartphones, prompted four times daily for seven days (approximately 3 minutes per session), and conventional in-clinic cognitive testing at baseline. Adherence, test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and sensitivity to clinical impairment were evaluated.\nResults: Average adherence was 41%. Despite this, remote measures demonstrated excellent reliability (ICCs &gt; 0.90 after 10 sessions) and strong construct validity, with tasks loading onto memory, attention, and executive function domains. Model fit was poorer in symptomatic individuals (CDR &gt; 0), consistent with cognitive dedifferentiation during disease progression. Both remote and traditional composites were sensitive to clinical impairment, with similar effect sizes and increasing group differences near expected symptom onset.\nConclusions: High-frequency remote cognitive assessment is feasible, reliable, and valid in a relatively young international ADAD cohort. This approach offers substantial advantages for clinical trials, including reduced participant burden, improved accessibility, and enhanced reliability, supporting its integration into early-intervention studies.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen as allowing a person not only to live by good and just principles but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,909) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "abstract": "Background\nGambling-related harm is increasingly recognised as a complex, multi-dimensional public health problem which variably impacts health, relationships, resources, and broader social functioning. Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem. They are grounded in diverse lived experience and aligned with public health principles.",

          "abstract": "In adverse listening conditions, speech recognition scores are generally higher when listeners can also see the talker’s mouth. Because bilinguals tend to be more detrimentally affected than monolinguals in audio-only noisy conditions, they may stand to benefit more than monolinguals from a second modality. At the same time, the ability to leverage visual cues may be limited by the amount of exposure a listener has to the target language, which varies among bilinguals. In this study, we aimed to understand whether the benefit of audiovisual speech cues is modulated by listeners’ language experiences. To that end, we measured speech recognition accuracy in noise in both audiovisual and audio-only modalities among monolingual and bilingual listeners. We also collected subjective effort and subjective mental fatigue ratings from participants throughout the experiment to evaluate the relationship between audiovisual speech perception and listening effort for different listeners. Our results show that more active use of another language results in less accurate speech recognition in noise for English, but does not modulate the benefit of the audiovisual speech signal.",

This preregistered, seven-day experience-sampling study examined how perceived appropriateness varies across situations. One hundred forty-two adults completed three surveys per day (2,670 surveys total; 3,821 vocalisations), rating appropriateness alongside situational cues and psychological situation characteristics. The results showed that laughter and sighs were most often judged appropriate, whereas screams and retches were least. Appropriateness was higher at home and in social places (e.g., parties) than in work/school or public settings (e.g., library), and higher with close ties than with weak ties or strangers. Psychological characteristics showed that formality and power were associated with lower appropriateness, whereas sociality and positivity were associated with higher appropriateness. Effects were vocalisation-specific: for example, laughter was considered more appropriate in positive, social, and brisk contexts, but less appropriate in formal and high-power contexts. By charting when and where vocalisations are judged acceptable, these findings outline situational principles of vocal display rules in everyday life.",

While extant literature shows that evaluations of someone's moral character can affect subsequent moral judgments, there is contradictory evidence on whether character information affects judgments in a way that is domain-general or domain-specific. Does receiving information about any morally bad character trait increase blame, or only information about traits that are similar to the subsequent act?  In two experiments (preregistered; N = 1320), we investigated how incidental information about an agent's moral character can influence moral and causal judgments. We consistently found that participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more of a cause, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect of character was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Overall, our findings support an account of moral judgment in which character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments of a subsequent act, challenging the domain-specific view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act should influence blame.",

The resulting 12-item Decision Process Scale (DPS) can be used to measure how much people rely on rules versus cost-benefit reasoning and how much they rely on intuition versus deliberation in the specific moral dilemmas they face in a laboratory experiment or in the real world.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) often includes heterogenous items, as when one uses it while assembling a desk from sets of boards, knobs, bolts, and washers. Here we investigate how WM capacity is limited when recalling multiple sets of items, for which performance surpasses the usual limits observed in single-set procedures. We presented participants (N = 181) with up to four sets of items for serial recall, usually of different stimulus types in the same trial (colors, characters, locations, and/or shapes). Conditions differed in the total number of items, the number of sets, and/or item types across sets in a trial. For uniformity in analyses, Set 1 was kept constant at three items of a type and was usually recalled first, free of output interference. In Experiment 1, recall of Set 1 was not only limited by the total number of items, but also by the number of sets in a trial. Experiment 2 ruled out interference as an alternative explanation. Experiments 3-4 showed the dependency of the results on clearly grouped presentation of the sets. The results suggest that groups of items are associated as newly-formed, often incomplete chunks offloaded from the focus of attention (FoA) to an activated portion of long-term memory (aLTM) for later retrieval. This offloading process would spare capacity but not without cost; a fraction of an item was lost from Set 1 for each subsequent item recalled. We present a dual-stage theory in which pointers held in the capacity-limited FoA allow retrieval of chunks from aLTM.",

For this purpose, a total of five studies were conducted in the present work to generate items and to test content, construct, and criterion validity. On the basis of this procedure an efficient scale was developed, which matches with the psychometric quality criteria and measures employee pro-environmental attitudes and employee pro-environmental behavior with six items each.

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "authors": "Ahmad Lotfi; Reza Ebrahimpour; Sajjad Zabbah",
          "abstract": "Perceptual decisions often rely on integrating multiple discrete pieces of sensory evidence over time. Previous studies have shown that these integration strategies are dynamic and can give rise to temporal biases such as the recency effect, where more recent information receives greater weight in the decision process. While some have attributed the recency effect to memory leak, recent findings suggest it may instead reflect a strategic modulation of attention. In this study, we investigated whether attention increases uniformly over time or selectively in response to the amount of accumulated evidence. Using a direction discrimination task with single-, double-, and triple-pulse random dot motion stimuli, we tested competing models of evidence integration and attentional allocation. Consistent with prior work, we observed marginally better performance in weak-strong double-pulse trials compared to strong-weak ones. Notably, in triple-pulse trials, improved performance was evident only when considering the first and third pulses, but not the first two or last two, arguing against a uniform time-based increase in attention. Crucially, when the first two pulses were treated as a unit, a weak-strong pattern relative to the third pulse produced significantly higher accuracy. These findings support a model in which attention increases not over time, but over evidence: reduced early evidence leads to increased attentional allocation to later samples. Our results provide further insight into the adaptive nature of perceptual decision-making and the role of online attentional strategies in optimizing performance in environments with discrete, time-separated sensory events.",

In two studies, we investigated the potentially protective effects of fasting on the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers following experimentally induced sensitization of nociceptive fibers through painful cutaneous electrical stimulation. In the first experiment (N = 33), participants underwent the painful electrical stimulation protocol twice: once after a 12-hour fast and once after consuming a standard breakfast. In a follow-up experiment (N = 52), participants were randomized to receive either the painful electrical stimulation protocol after a 16-hour fast or after their usual morning meal. In both experiments, we assessed the intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial extent of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, as well as emotional state and hunger levels. Fasting increased hunger and negative affect in both studies. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, participants in the fasted condition reported significantly less mechanical hypersensitivity compared to the breakfast condition. In both experiments, fasting did not reduce the pain intensity reported during the painful electrical stimulation. These findings provide behavioral evidence that a 16-hour fast may reduce the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. These results in humans align with preclinical evidence showing that fasting affects mechanical hypersensitivity, without necessarily affecting the perceived intensity of acute painful stimuli. Our findings suggest that metabolic state may modulate mechanical hypersensitivity in humans.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has made it easier than ever to produce hyperrealistic but entirely false imagery. One especially harmful use is the creation of non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes depicting real people. While such content clearly violates privacy, its broader political implications remain underexplored. This paper investigates how sexually explicit AI-generated imagery affects\npublic perceptions of politicians and broader democratic outcomes. Drawing on a pre-registered survey experiment in the U.S. (N = 1904), we exposed participants to either explicit, private, or control images of a fictitious male or female politician embedded in a mock social media feed. The results indicate that explicit deepfakes significantly diminish candidate evaluations, particularly with respect to affect, trustworthiness, perceived competence, and leadership qualities. Exposure to AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) further leads to lower voting intentions for the targeted politician, illustrating how reputational harm can translate into electoral consequences. Contrary to expectations, male politicians were more strongly affected by these negative shifts in perception. However, we find no evidence that exposure to such content reduces participants’ own political ambition. These findings highlight the reputational risks posed by synthetic intimate media and highlight the urgent need to mitigate its potential threats to democratic processes.",

          "authors": "Anthony Montgomery",
          "abstract": "Organizational psychology has traditionally focused on internal dynamics, neglecting the broader social structures in which organizations are embedded. This limitation is particularly evident in research on job burnout. While burnout is often framed as a symptom of organizational dysfunction, it also reflects wider systemic forces—economic instability, political regulation, cultural expectations, and ecological stressors—that influence how individuals navigate the competing demands of performance and wellbeing. Current models underestimate these contextual and historical influences due to their peripheral position in organizational analysis. This paper introduces a new open systems theory of burnout that delineates how sublethal forces interact with organizational processes to deplete employee energy and increase burnout. It proposes nine core propositions through which external environmental factors shape burnout experiences and argues for a paradigm shift toward systemic, context-aware models. The paper concludes by presenting a theoretical framework and challenges for future research.",

          "abstract": "Homophone errors (e.g., there/their) are not uncommon in typing, but it is debated whether they simply reveal poor spelling knowledge or signal competition in the production system. We tested the idea that competition underlies the greater difficulty associated with producing homophone, compared to non-homophone, targets. Using computational simulations, we showed that competition alone is sufficient to produce interference during homophone production, and that such interference is exacerbated by increasing lexical competition. These predictions were confirmed in two experiments, a typing-to-dictation task (Experiment 1) and a question-answering task (Experiment 2). We further showed the homophone effect was insensitive to the syntactic category: we found a robust homophone interference effect of a comparable magnitude for same-category (e.g., flower-flour) and different-category (e.g., idol-idle) homophones. Collectively, these results show that lexical selection in typing is similar to speaking in terms of the processes arising from representational overlap, but distinct from it in terms of the influence of syntax.",

          "abstract": "Learning to recognize and produce foreign speech sounds can be challenging, particularly when only subtle differences distinguish these new sounds from phonemes in the native language. Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows us to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Trust in science plays a crucial role in addressing major societal challenges, from climate change to global health. In a wide range of countries, most people tend to trust science. However this trust might seem irrational, since people tend to know little about science. Here, we argue that people need not possess much knowledge or understanding of science to rationally trust it. We propose a cognitive model of trust in science—the rational impression account—according to which people come to trust science by relying on a suite of basic cognitive mechanisms: First, people infer competence from possessing rare knowledge; Second, people infer accuracy from consensus; Third, people’s impressions can persist after they forget what generated them. The rational impression account stresses the importance of science education and communication in fostering public trust in science.",

However, how the magnitude of this Cognate Facilitation Effect (CFE) changes with age and its task-dependent manifestations remain unclear. Clarifying these patterns may benefit educators with evidence-based strategies to support learners across different stages and tasks. This systematic review synthesizes studies on CFE in school-aged second and foreign language learners between 1987 and 2024 (n = 36). The results showed that, firstly, the CFE follows an inverted U-shaped trajectory. It increases during early literacy (ages 6–9), peaking in middle childhood (ages 9–10), and declining thereafter. Secondly, facilitation is robust in comprehension tasks but more variable in production, where overlap can induce interference. Furthermore, we evaluate psycholinguistic models and propose integrating speech-production models to account for the interference effect of cognate production. These findings suggest educational implications: cognates can help support vocabulary development in early literacy, but more refined strategies are needed as learners advance.\n\nKeywords: cognates; cross-linguistic transfer; literacy development; psycholinguistics",

          "abstract": "Background: Practitioner ratings of their adherence to evidence-based psychotherapy or counseling practices in working with autistic youth could be an efficient method for tracking the success of efforts to implement effective practices in community behavioral health service settings. Tools of this sort that generalize across multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) have not been developed to date. In this study, a practitioner self-report measure of adherence to EBPs for autistic youth was developed and evaluated. Method: A multiple baseline study of seven behavioral health practitioners was conducted to determine if internet-based self-directed training on Modular EBPs for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA; meya.ucla.edu), a free internet-based practitioner training app, would facilitate an increase in clinician adherence to EBP techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral intervention practices. Practitioners made self-ratings on the MEYA Integrity Scale-Practitioner Version (MEYA-IS-PV). Expert coders unaware of phase or study hypotheses also rated the therapists’ adherence to EBPs for each session. Caregivers rated youth outcomes at each session on the Youth Top Problems scale. Results: Linear mixed models showed that MEYA-IS-PV scores corresponded to expert ratings of adherence, increased following the onset of training in EBPs, and predicted improvements in youth behavioral health. Visual analysis of the multiple baseline data confirmed that 5 of 7 practitioners increased their self-reported adherence in EBPs once training began. Conclusion: Self-ratings of adherence are promising for examining adherence to EBPs in psychotherapy or counseling for autistic youth.",

          "abstract": "Autistic youth experience high rates of co-occurring mental health concerns, yet empirically supported practices (ESPs) are rarely implemented with fidelity in community care due to barriers in training, scalability, and workflow integration. The Modular Evidence-Based Practices for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA) platform was developed as a free, open-access digital tool that provides just-in-time therapist training, modular cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies, and caregiver-supported goal monitoring. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, seven community clinicians implemented MEYA following a baseline phase of usual care. Platform use was tracked through analytics, and six clinicians participated in qualitative exit interviews. Results: Directed content analysis revealed five overarching themes: MEYA was perceived as useful, flexible, and clinically relevant; therapists valued the CBT content and caregiver goal charts; feasibility was supported by its accessibility but limited by workflow demands; underutilization of measurement-based care (MBC) features and a resulting impact on the personalization of care were noted barriers. Engagement data showed moderate-to-high uptake across modules. Conclusion: Overall, MEYA was feasible and acceptable across diverse providers, with strengths in usability and fidelity support. Findings identify priorities for refinement, particularly in automating measurement-based care features and creating push-out guidance via email to clinicians who need to conserve time and effort. These results provide preliminary evidence for MEYA as a scalable platform to increase access to ESPs for autistic youth.",

          "authors": "Olivia Fischer; Renato Frey",
          "abstract": "Polarization has become a major concern in behavioral science and popular media, as it may affect many important areas of life. For instance, how polarized are people's perceptions of risks, such as regarding (not) imposing mitigation measures during a pandemic? Answering this question is surprisingly challenging: Whereas multiple theoretical views of polarization and their respective mathematical operationalizations coexist, the latter are often used interchangebly as measures of \"polarization\". This may be indicative of a jingle fallacy, because it is unknown whether the diverse ways of quantifying polarization in people's perceptions of important societal matters empirically converge. In study 1 we thus ran a reanalysis of a large dataset from the World Values Survey covering diverse topics of societal relevance (N = 93,214), finding only moderate empirical convergence between six operationalizations of polarization. In study 2 we applied the same approach focusing specifically on people's risk perceptions of COVID-19 mitigation measures (N = 768), and found a similar pattern of low convergence between different operationalizations of polarization. Yet, according to one operationalization with a clear threshold for polarization, risk perceptions were polarized in 11 out of 12 experimental conditions. Our findings emphasize the need to carefully consider how polarization is operationalized to avoid broad generalizations, keeping in mind that some operationalizations may speak to specific theoretical conceptualizations. To raise awareness for this concern and support behavioral science researchers in conducting similar analyses with their own datasets, we provide a novel online tool available at https://shiny.cbdr-lab.net/polarization.",

          "abstract": "This study was undertaken in 2023 in follow-up to earlier work (Bolton et al., 2022) which preliminarily quantified a new construct operationalized around the ideas of psychologist Carl Rogers. While we were interested in re-formulating from a humanistic psychological perspective, after Rogers’ original conditions of worth concept (1957, 1959), the behavioral formulation of conditional regard, we also tested and provided evidence for the hypothesis that autistic people experience heightened conditions of worth relative to non-autistic people. We validated through a brief online survey (n = 162, including 109 autistic and 53 non-autistic individuals) two distinct sets of items, one retrospective for the adolescent period between ages 12 and 17 and the other for adulthood, to assess the extent to which individuals perceive conditions of worth. The items were then correlated with an array of individual difference variables. Perceived emotional safety recalled as an adolescent and felt as an adult, perceived psychological control of one’s parental figure when an adolescent, adult fear of criticism and rejection, adult masking or camouflaging of parts of oneself, adult incongruence or inauthenticity, adult acceptance of external influence, and adult self-alienation were all positively correlated in support of the measures’ convergent and predictive validity. Adult self-esteem, unconditional positive self-regard, adolescence-perceived parental autonomy support, authentic adult living, and congruence or authenticity were all, with some exceptions, negatively correlated in theoretically expected directions. Perfectionism was also variously correlated. Implications and applications are offered for academics as well as mental health practitioners.",

Based on overlapping feelings, thinking, and behaviour, seven archetypes of response were identified: the Hopeless Helper, Nervous Navigator, Furious Fighter, Guilty Guardian, Wounded Witness, Detached Drifter, and Determined Doer.\nFindings highlight the complex and interconnected ways young people respond to climate change across emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. Archetypes provide a framework for understanding both risks and resilience, emphasising that distress often stems from systemic inaction.

Participants completed the same unfamiliar face matching task three times: in one session (Experiment 1), or over three weeks (Experiment 2). We found a wisdom of the crowd within effect in both experiments, which was significant after two responses, and larger with three. Surprisingly, the delay did not offer additional benefit.

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

It challenges rational choice theories by showing that preference can change by having an irrelevant option in the choice set. The attraction effect is typically studied in situations where individuals have full access to option information during choice. However, in many real-life situations, people must make choices based on their memory of the options. In three experiments (N = 379), we investigated the attraction effect when people had to rely on their memory when making choices. We show initially that relying on memory eliminated the attraction effect, but also that the attraction effect was recovered with improvements in memory. The results suggest that memory accuracy may be a boundary condition of the attraction effect. We also observed improvements in decoy avoidance and choice accuracy with improvements in memory. Our results are consistent with the representational noise hypothesis (Spektor et al., 2021) where noise (e.g., due to forgetting) disrupts how people represent the relationships among options.",

However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

          "abstract": "This study investigated effects of content format and instructional framing on knowledge attainment, situational interest, and academic emotions in digital history learning. In a 2 (format: game versus text) × 2 (instruction: learning versus fun) between-subjects design, 143 university students engaged with either a historically accurate video game on the Roman Empire or a structurally aligned interactive text application, each paired with instructions to focus on learning or fun. Both formats presented the same historical content through main narratives, optional missions, and supplemental historical information in the form of codex entries. The findings revealed that participants in the game condition reported higher enjoyment and greater triggered situational interest, indicating that the game enhances the positive affective experience of engaging with historical content and sparks learners’ interest. However, our hypothesis that knowledge test performance would be higher in the game condition was not supported. Instead, knowledge test scores were higher in the text condition. No statistically significant effects emerged for instructional framing or for the interaction between format and framing on the outcomes. Additional analyses of behavioural data showed that text participants engaged more extensively with codex entries, and that codex engagement strongly predicted knowledge outcomes across both formats. This suggests that knowledge outcomes depend on the visibility and integration of supplemental materials, and learners’ engagement with them. Overall, this study contributes to research on digital history learning by offering a controlled comparison of identical content delivered through game and text and shedding light on the role of instructional framing.",

          "authors": "Katharina Marie Bach; Sarah Bichler; Marcia Linn",
          "abstract": "Revising explanations allows learners to develop a coherent understanding of scientific phenomena by integrating different ideas, a key learning outcome according to the Knowledge Integration (KI) Framework. We explored the design of critique activities and analyzed how peer critique helps 1305 middle school students to revise science explanations. Students wrote a science explanation about thermodynamics in an online learning environment, critiqued the explanation of a fictitious peer and then, revised their own explanation. For the critique activity, they were randomly assigned to three conditions that differed in the characteristics of the fictitious peer’s explanation. Specifically, students either critiqued a peer’s explanation that describes intuitive ideas (intuitive), combines intuitive and scientifically normative ideas (partial), or connects several scientifically normative ideas (linked). We found that critique was valuable in each condition as students showed more integrated understanding in their revised responses to the explanation question compared to their initial response. Students in the linked condition received the highest KI scores. Students who started with a higher KI score had an advantage over those with a lower KI score in all conditions. This difference was strongest in the intuitive condition, indicating that the intuitive condition was the least beneficial for students with lower prior knowledge. Qualitative analysis of the types of revisions students made revealed that, in all conditions, students often adopted ideas from the answer they critiqued. When they adopted the intuitive idea, they were less likely to improve their explanation than when they adopted the link. These results illustrate the importance of critique for promoting integrated understanding. They reveal the need for more frequent and more powerful instruction to build skepticism when confronted with potentially unreliable information, e.g. by comparing two explanations with contrasting ideas.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their sensation of task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested if pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

Study 1 (N=500) shows that greater use of problem decomposition in group discussions predicts lower error. Study 2 (N=240) provides causal evidence: instructing groups to apply problem decomposition leads to higher accuracy than combining initial estimates. Study 3 (N=160) shows the advantage arises when applied collectively rather than by individuals working alone. We also introduce a scalable natural language method to detect problem decomposition in deliberation text and predict collective accuracy.

Recent work using \nthe Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task underscores the critical role of categorization consistency \n(trial-by-trial response variability around the mean response function) as a critical predictor of \nreal-world outcomes such as language and reading abilities. Yet, the mechanisms that \ncontribute to categorization consistency remain unknown. One hypothesis is that higher-level \nlinguistic factors, such as lexical knowledge, may stabilize the percept by cleaning up lower-\nlevel perceptual noise. The first aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by examining \nwhether categorization consistency is modulated by lexicality (word vs. nonword). Forty-eight \nadult American English listeners completed a VAS task involving both word (e.g., batch-patch) \nand matched nonword (e.g., bazg-pazg) continua. Listeners’ categorization consistency for the \nword continua was significantly higher than for the nonword continua. This suggests that \ncategorization consistency is, indeed, affected by higher-level linguistic factors. The second aim \nwas to investigate whether individuals’ broader language abilities influence their reliance on \nlexical information during speech categorization. Although individuals with greater language \nability showed more consistent categorization, language scores did not modulate the lexical \neffect on categorization consistency. Together, these findings demonstrate the roles of top-down \nknowledge and language knowledge in stabilizing speech categorization.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between heritable and acquired traits. In a large-scale study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between sleep deprivation and political polarization through two experimental protocols. We conducted an 8-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) experiment (n=20) and a 4-hour partial sleep deprivation (PSD) experiment (n=44) to examine their effects on ideological extremism and affective polarization. Results revealed a significant increase in ideological extremism following TSD in between-subjects analysis (Cohen's f² = 0.48), while no significant effects were observed with the PSD protocol compared to the regular sleep (RS) condition. Importantly, moderation analyses revealed that political orientation significantly influenced susceptibility to sleep deprivation effects, with different patterns emerging in between-subjects versus within-subjects analyses. Left-wing participants showed greater vulnerability to increased ideological extremism under sleep deprivation in between-subjects comparisons, while this effect was found for right-leaning individuals in within-subjects analyses. No significant effects were observed on affective polarization in either protocol. These findings provide initial evidence that sleep deprivation can contribute to political polarization by increasing ideological extremism, particularly when considering political orientation as a moderating factor. The study provides novel insights into the complex relationship between sleep and political cognition in distinct sociopolitical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Supporting wellbeing within education settings is vital. Whole school approaches present a holistic and integrated mechanism that recognise school staff, the school community and pupils. The Well Schools whole school approach to supporting teacher and pupil wellbeing provides a framework that guides planning, policy and practice while allowing for bespoke and socially valid approaches suitable for each school community. \nMethod. A case study approach explored how schools adopted the Well Schools framework, and what practices and provision schools were offering as part of Well Schools. Second, it aimed to identify the perceived impact of embedding the Well Schools approach for schools, teachers and pupils. 10 case study schools were recruited that were implementing Well Schools and that represented diversity in setting type, varying locations across the UK and school demographics. Data was collected via interviews (n = 16) with school leaders and class teachers that focused on their experiences and engagement with the whole school approach with particular attention to the process of implementation. \nFindings. Six themes were identified covering how Well Schools was being implemented, what drove this and the impact it was having: 1) staff enrichment, 2) pupil enrichment, 3) motivation, 4) capability, 5) awareness and engagement, and 6) sustainability. Findings suggest the value of supporting staff and pupil wellbeing were central to an effective learning environment that supported wellbeing. Well Schools offered the opportunity for schools to build relationships, collaborate and learn from a network of schools. This network and the engagement with like-minded schools was identified as a reason why some schools were attracted to the whole school approach.\nConclusion. Promoting Well Schools can help other schools adopt better practices for health, wellbeing and identify ways of developing holistic wellbeing at the school, teacher and pupil levels. Such continued engagement further exemplifies the feasibility, acceptability and positive impact the case study schools reported regarding Well Schools.",

          "authors": "Samuel Poelker-Wells; Danielle Fearon-Drake; Francesca Filbey",
          "abstract": "Background: The primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis interacts with the endocannabinoid system (eCB), which declines with age, potentially reducing its ability to regulate homeostasis and altering responses to cannabis. Indeed, animal studies suggest age-related differences in response to cannabis that result in mixed effects in older individuals. Importantly, biological sex modifies the eCB system, which complicates interpreting these effects. Objective: The goal of this study was to understand how individual variation in human endocannabinoid system function due to age and sex influences cannabis’s effects in middle-aged and older adults. Methods:  Self-reported measures of cannabis use behaviors, memory, mental and physical health, cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptom severity, and sleep quality were collected from 107 adults (age range= 35-78, 54 females) who use cannabis. Partial correlations examined associations between age and outcomes controlling for years of use. Biological sex was assessed as a moderator. Results: Regression analyses revealed a significant age × sex interaction for CUD symptoms and mental health scores. Specifically, CUD symptom severity decreased, and mental health scores improved with age in females but not in males. Sensitivity analysis suggested that participants who reported medical-only use exhibited a steeper decline in CUD symptom severity with age than recreational-only or hybrid-use participants. Conclusions: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on cannabis use in aging populations and underscores the need to consider age, sex, and reason for use when evaluating cannabis-related outcomes such as CUD risk in the emerging demographic of middle-aged and older adults who use cannabis.",

          "abstract": "Speeding can be conceptualised as a social dilemma that requires attention to engineering factors such as traffic and roadway conditions as well as psychological traits and individual attributes. These traits and attributes shape whether regulatory and physical signals are internalised as binding constraints, yet most existing studies overlook them. In particular, drivers’ Social Value Orientation (SVO) can substantially influence speeding and moderate the effects of other factors. To address this gap, we examined stated preferences to exceed speed limits, and their determinants including SVO, across urban scenarios in the West Midlands (WM), Athens, and Valencia. We used an ordered discrete choice model with random parameters and heterogeneity in means to capture unobserved and latent psychological heterogeneity. Results indicated that road design, traffic density, and speed enforcement were associated with self-reported speeding, with effects varying by context and driver traits. Higher SVO was linked to greater compliance in the WM, mixed effects in Valencia, and norm-congruent behaviour in Athens that could legitimise moderate speeding. Older drivers in Athens reported greater responsiveness to cameras. Age moderated self-reports: in WM and Athens, the stated likelihood of speeding linked to drivers’ violation history declined with age; the gender gap widened with age in WM but narrowed in Athens. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the effects of engineering and enforcement are not uniform across all drivers. Their impact is mediated by local norms, perceived credibility, and socially embedded understandings of considerate driving, underscoring the need to integrate social and psychological dimensions into traffic safety interventions.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia, the strong diminution or complete absence of mental imagery, challenges long-standing views of imagery as central to cognition. Competing accounts variously explain the phenomenon as a failure of sensory reactivation or as unconscious mental imagery. Here, we propose a new framework, the integration model of aphantasia, which argues that reactivated sensory information must undergo multi-stage integration to yield imagery experience. Against unconscious imagery accounts, we argue that the neural activations observed in aphantasics are not imagery but sensory precursors: rudimentary sensory codes that lack perceptual status. Only when sensory precursors are locally integrated do they become perceptual representations, and only when these are further integrated with interoceptive signals do they give rise to conscious imagery experience. We present the integration model as a dual-stream framework that unifies recent attention- and interoception-based accounts, situate the model within existing theories of mental imagery and aphantasia, and highlight its clinical relevance. In doing so, we reframe the debate on unconscious imagery and draw attention to the role of multi-stage integration as a key mechanism underlying mental imagery and its absence across different subtypes of aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Despite the theoretical arguments and recent empirical evidence indicating retest correlations to be particularly suitable reliability estimates, usual retest intervals (e.g., two weeks; one month) will underestimate the reliability of measures over the within-session interval in which inter-test relationships are regularly estimated.  Consequently, we argue that within-session retest correlations may be particularly useful for estimating the reliability of measures over this interval. Specifically, we show evidence that within-session retest correlations: (1) provide the common upper-limit of internal consistency and retest reliability estimates, and consequently (2) are considerably less susceptible to producing disattenuated correlations greater than 1 in magnitude; (3) better track variation in scale validity correlations than common reliability estimators such as coefficient alpha; and (4) can be estimated for single-item measures. We illustrate this using data collected from several samples on two personality inventories, the Inventory of Individual Differences in the Lexicon (IIDL; Wood, Nye, &amp; Saucier, 2010) and Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2; Soto &amp; John, 2017).  Results suggest that reliability is typically underestimated and thus overadjusted for in meta-analytic and structural equation modeling contexts, and that greater use of these estimates is thus likely to slow the momentum toward broader constructs and provide sturdier psychometric ground for the measurement of narrower constructs or nuances. More generally, we detail how within-session retest correlations draw better attention to the crucial role of the time interval separating measurements toward determining the appropriate estimates to use when adjusting for the measurement unreliability affecting zero-order correlations.",

          "abstract": "Most people believe that social media discourse is negative and divisive. Here we show how this negativity can evolve even when users are not motivated to be negative. We propose that social media users seek to differentiate themselves from other users, and it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity than positivity because negative information is more heterogeneous and counter-normative than positive information. This makes users increasingly likely to post negative comments as a conversation unfolds and it becomes more challenging to make unique contributions. Analyzing 2.05 billion comments from 2,150 Reddit communities shows that comments become more negative over time, both within threads and community histories. This trend towards negativity is mediated by the semantic uniqueness of comments, suggesting that it arises from users differentiating themselves. This trend is strongest when initial dialogue is positive, making negative comments highly counter-normative. We replicate these patterns in a multigenerational experiment simulating social media dialogue (n = 4,000). Participants become more negative over time, but only when incentivized to be unique, and especially when dialogue begins positively. These findings suggest that the structure of social media platforms interacts with human motivation to foster a drift towards negativity over time in online discourse.",

          "title": "How Often is “Often”? Improving Assessment of the Externalizing Spectrum Using Absolute Frequency",
          "authors": "Isaac T. Petersen; Zachary Demko; Philipp Doebler; Loreen Sabel; Jacob Oleson; Robert Krueger",
          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have allowed for the creation of polygenic scores (PGSs) reflecting genetic liability for depression, yet recent work suggests that these PGSs may also reflect greater genetic propensity towards higher levels of stress exposure. The current study sought to extend prior findings to examine whether an established depression PGS (DEP-PGS) is associated with greater stress exposure at the neighborhood level in a sample of preadolescent children. This study included 278 children of European ancestry between the ages of 7 and 11 (45.3% female) and their parent. Parents and children completed clinical interviews and questionnaires and children provided genetic samples. Children’s neighborhoods were defined based on their current home address and geocoded indices of neighborhood adversity (i.e., area socioeconomic disadvantage, crime, opportunity) were matched to zip codes. As hypothesized, children with greater genetic liability for depression as reflected by DEP-PGSs were more likely to live in neighborhoods characterized by greater adversity. Findings were maintained when statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and parent’s and children’s histories of depression and anxiety. The current findings build upon prior research highlighting depression-relevant gene-environment correlations and extend this work to provide evidence that DEP-PGSs may capture genetic liability for exposure to stressful contexts at the neighborhood level. Future research is needed to replicate findings in diverse samples and to examine whether neighborhood-level adversity mediates the relation between DEP-PGSs and future depression risk in youth.",

Ancorado nessa visão dinâmico-complexa, em diálogo com o Modelo de Aprendizagem da Fala (Flege, 1995; Flege; Bohn, 2021), este estudo objetiva investigar o desenvolvimento, entre aprendizes brasileiros de inglês, do padrão de pre-fortis clipping de vogais diante de plosivas finais. Três participantes foram acompanhados longitudinalmente em 12 coletas ao longo de 13 semanas. Entre a primeira e a segunda coleta, receberam insumos distintos: nenhum tipo de intervenção pedagógica referente à pronúncia (Participante 1), treinamento perceptual (Participante 2), e treinamento perceptual associado à instrução explícita de pronúncia (Participante 3). As produções da forma-alvo foram analisadas acusticamente e submetidas a Análises de Picos com simulações de Monte Carlo e a Análises de Pontos de Mudança. Os resultados apontam padrões individuais de variabilidade e mudança possivelmente ligados aos tratamentos pedagógicos. Os achados reforçam a pertinência de estudos de processo para o desenvolvimento fonético-fonológico em LNN e a compatibilidade entre a TSDC e o Modelo de Aprendizagem da Fala, além de evidenciar ganhos do uso complementar dos dois métodos de análise",

          "abstract": "Successful learning often emerges through social interaction: what are the neural and behavioural systems that support this process? This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning with detailed behavioural and physiological measures in 27 unconstrained social learning interactions. Learning was supported by teacher-learner inter-brain synchrony (INS), over regions important for mutual understanding (temporo-parietal junction, TPJ) and communicative coordination (ventral premotor, PMv). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the INS-learning association in oppositive ways, motivating a dual-process model: during knowledge-building phases, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low INS in regions for mutual understanding (TPJ) and coordination (right PMv), and high INS in language-related areas (left PMv). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high INS over TPJ. Cross-brain general linear modelling (xGLM) revealed asymmetric neural dependencies linked to speaking and teaching roles in the left-hemisphere language network. These effects remained after controlling for nodding, gaze, and breathing, indicating that INS reflects true social-cognitive alignment beyond sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated and nonlinear brain–body dynamics and positions INS as a marker of mutual prediction during communicative social interaction.",

However, the neural basis of stable, trait-level differences in attention control remains unclear. Prior research has emphasized momentary fluctuations in attentional engagement, often overlooking enduring individual differences. Here, we applied the quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis of infraslow fMRI dynamics in a large sample (N = 191) to test whether trait attention control is reflected in network-level brain activity as well as the locus coeruleus. Using latent-variable measures of attention control, working memory capacity, and fluid intelligence, we isolated the unique contribution of attention control across rest, 1-back, and 3-back conditions. Under heightened cognitive demand, individuals with higher attention control exhibited more flexible coordination of the frontoparietal control network (FPCN): they showed stronger decoupling from the default mode network (DMN), enhanced coupling with the dorsal attention network (DAN), and greater engagement with the locus coeruleus (LC). Even at rest, high attention individuals demonstrated stronger FPCN-DAN coupling, and little to no correlation between FPCN-DMN, indicating that attentional capacity is reflected in both task-evoked reconfiguration and baseline network architecture. These findings reveal how attention control, as a trait, is instantiated in the brain’s dynamic architecture.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety and math achievement are reciprocally related, which likely impacts individuals’ agency; their educational and career trajectories in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; and countries’ economic growth in these areas. Previous meta-analyses on this relationship have faced limitations from studies using small convenience samples and have encountered methodological issues, such as variance restriction, low statistical power, and ecological bias. To address these challenges, the present research synthesis is the first to use a comprehensive collection of representative individual participant data (IPD) from International Large-Scale Assessments (ILSAs). This analysis incorporated cumulative evidence from 1980 to 2022, including 452 probability samples from 90 countries, and covered student and adult populations. The meta-analytic average correlation between math anxiety and math achievement was r = –.26. Moderator analyses revealed novel evidence that this relationship is sensitive to construct characteristics as well as individual and contextual factors. Specifically, the negative relationship was weaker for the worry facet of math anxiety compared with its affective facet and its cognitive interference facet, and it was weaker following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, the negative relationship was stronger for individuals with average and high levels of math achievement and in countries with higher Gross Domestic Product per capita. Gender differences in the relationship were largely negligible after 2010, although female individuals exhibited a stronger negative relationship in the 1980s and 1990s than male individuals. In summary, synthesizing IPD from ILSAs provided novel, nuanced, and robust evidence for research, practice, and policy.",

          "authors": "Tatsuya Daikoku",
          "abstract": "Creativity in human societies is sustained not by isolated minds but by embodied, collective intelligence. Using music as a model system, we show that creativity rests on the dynamic tuning of uncertainty: moderate, time-varying surprise—often felt as internal bodily sensations—sparks exploration, while group synchrony stabilizes what is new. Because creativity itself is value-neutral, its fate depends on the co-occurrence of ethics, morality, and empathy. Ethical norms bound admissible deviation, and empathic perspective-taking—amplified by bodily and physiological coupling—acts as a social “precision weight” that admits, reshapes, or rejects novelty. From these ingredients emerges field-level intelligence: a process in which groups preserve diversity, selectively integrate deviations, and maintain “just-right” uncertainty under partially connected social structures. This framing explains the resilience of creativity across generations and sets an agenda for empirical work: quantify uncertainty dynamics in embodied interaction, test how ethical and empathic cues regulate admissibility, and identify network conditions that best sustain socially shared creativity. This framing clarifies why creativity endures and suggests a concrete empirical agenda.",

In particular, we show that group judgments are more accurate than the average of a comparable number of individual judgments, and that group judgments can be as accurate as the judgments of the best individual member of the nominal groups (i.e., the person with the lowest judgment error). Additionally, our meta-analytic results substantiate two different mechanisms that lead to synergy in quantitative group judgment. On the one hand, group members can learn from each other and, thereby, increase their individual accuracy (G-I transfer). On the other hand, when controlling for G-I transfer, group members are also able to identify the more accurate judgments and assign more weight to them (differential weighting).",

          "abstract": "Importance: Versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire such as PHQ-2, PHQ-8, and PHQ-9 are among the leading assessment tools for depression in research and clinical practice. However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

The current consensus, rooted in computational functionalism, proposes that consciousness should be ascribed based on a principle of computational equivalence. The objective of this opinion piece is to criticize this current approach and argue in favor of an alternative “behavioral inference principle”, whereby consciousness is attributed if it is useful to explain (and predict) a given set of behavioral observations.  We believe that a behavioral inference principle will provide an epistemologically valid and operationalizable criteria to assess machine consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Social norms influence a wide spectrum of behaviors, yet their role in motivating political action remains underexplored. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes three norm types: (1) social approval of activists’ goals, (2) social approval of their actions, and (3) social engagement in those actions. We test how these norms and their consistent or inconsistent combinations shape willingness to participate in political action and perceptions of the cause’s importance and feasibility. Six preregistered experiments examined these effects in both hypothetical and real-world contexts, in Poland and the U.S., using between-person and within-person designs. Study 1 showed that information about one norm type spilled over to inferences about the others, underscoring the need to examine norms in combination. Across Studies 2–6, consistently high levels across all three norm types in most cases produced the strongest action intentions, while consistently low levels produced the weakest. Inconsistent combinations yielded more nuanced effects, with reduced approval of goals especially likely to undermine action intentions, and withdrawal of action approval playing a comparatively weaker role. Manipulations of social norms also influenced perceived importance and expectancy of the cause, which mediated their effects on collective action intentions. Taken together, these findings integrate normative and motivational theories and offer practical suggestions for implementing norm-based interventions in social campaigns.",

This study tested a model of how perfectionism, via its effect on self-compassion, stress and coping, can affect health outcomes such as health-related quality of life and intuitive eating for people with long-term conditions, which had not been previously tested in a sample of people with CKD. To address this gap, structural equation modelling was used to model the association between these constructs in a sample of kidney transplant recipients (n=354) and a non-CKD comparison group (n=400). Results showed that ‘maladaptive’ perfectionism significantly predicted lower levels of self-compassion, coping, intuitive eating and health-related quality of life, and higher levels of stress. However, self-compassion was found to buffer this effect, demonstrating that higher levels of this positive self-attitude could help to ameliorate the negative associations between maladaptive perfectionism and health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases play a critical role in the maintenance of specific phobias, yet reliable assessment tools remain scarce. This study examined the psychometric properties of three novel measures designed to evaluate interpretational processing biases in acrophobia: the Scrambled Sentences Task (SST), the Encoding Recognition Test (ERT), and the German version of the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). Using an online cross-sectional design, the convergent and divergent validity as well as the reliability of these tasks were assessed. The sample included N = 286 participants with mild to severe acrophobia. Overall, all measures demonstrated good convergent validity, and their weak associations with non-acrophobia-related questionnaires support divergent validity. The measures also showed high internal consistency and moderate to high parallel forms of reliability, indicating strong reliability overall. Consistent intercorrelations among the tasks further support their coherence in assessing interpretation bias. Finally, regression analyses revealed that the SST and HIQ were the strongest predictors of acrophobic symptoms, suggesting that each task may tap into distinct facets of interpretation bias despite their overlap. These findings offer empirically grounded insights that can inform future research, especially within intervention contexts. For example, embedding these bias measures in randomized controlled trials could illuminate their role in identifying and precisely tracking cognitive markers during therapy, enabling more targeted interventions in acrophobia treatment.",

Across countries, positive beliefs (e.g., competence, autonomy, trust) were associated with higher SES, whereas negative beliefs (e.g., insecurity, unworthiness, pessimism) were linked to lower SES. These associations replicated across SES indicators (education, income, wealth) and explained up to 20% of variance in SES outcomes.

          "abstract": "Human behaviour is largely driven by the desire to maximize pleasure. Music, in both perception and production, is a uniquely powerful source of pleasure, engaging cognitive, bodily, psychological, and social processes. This paper focuses on groove, an everyday, effortless form of sensorimotor musical experience. While previous studies have solely  examined groove as pleasurable urge to move, this paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding groove as a multidimensional source of musical pleasure. Extending beyond prior two-dimensional accounts, the framework incorporates immersive and social aspects of the experience. Gathering research findings across disciplines, four sources of pleasure are identified, operating at the cognitive, psychological, behavioural, and social levels: (1) pleasure arising from processing of the music, especially linked to the balance of prediction and surprise in musical structure; (2) immersive pleasure associated with a flow-like, altered attentional experience; (3) movement pleasure generated through (desire for) bodily synchronization and sensorimotor reward; and (4) pleasure rooted in social connection, synchrony, bonding, and collective participation. These interconnected levels are supported by neurochemical mechanisms that modulate attention, arousal, timing, and reward, anchoring the pleasures of groove in embodied brain–body dynamics and reflecting its biopsychosocial nature. This framework offers a more nuanced account of why groove is such a powerful, rewarding and everyday human experience. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the current work informs applied domains by highlighting various sources of pleasure that provide internal motivation, offering insights for designing music-based interventions in therapy, education, and well-being, and suggesting directions for future empirical testing.",

Study 1, a pre-registered study on intergroup relations in the turbulent Bangsamoro region of the Philippines (N = 816), found that identity fusion was positively associated with outgroup trust when the outgroup was perceived positively. Study 2 (N = 1,576) replicated these results across Gambia (n = 236), Pakistan (n = 505), Tanzania (n = 337), and Uganda (n = 498) , while also finding that perceptions of the relationship itself (e.g., whether cooperation was judged beneficial to the ingroup) similarly moderated the effect of identity fusion on willingness to cooperate. These results suggest that identity fusion can have positive consequences for intergroup relations, depending on contextual perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Procrastination is a widespread phenomenon that occurs across multiple domains. Current theoretical accounts invoke specific structures of preference or cost to elucidate the occurrence of procrastination. We propose a theoretical model of procrastination that does not invoke a specific structure of preference, and instead relies on an unavoidable aspect of any projection into the future, namely, that the time it takes to complete a task is variable. This model captures the basic phenomenology of procrastination and predicts a phenomenon that we demonstrate empirically, the \"deadline-time-arrival effect\": decision makers (DMs) who live closer to their destinations (e.g., schools or offices) tend to arrive later than those who live farther. The same theory explains other instantiations of procrastination, such as repeatedly postponing the initiation of a task as the deadline for completion approaches—e.g., delaying the planned drafting of a grant application. Our framework thus puts forth a unified view of procrastination in which its various manifestations reflect an optimal adaptation to environmental statistics.",

          "authors": "Benjamin PUTOIS; Florian Lecuelle",
          "abstract": "Behavioral insomnia of the limit-setting type is very common. It is characterized by delayed sleep onset due to oppositional behavior at bedtime and the child's dependence on parental presence to fall asleep. This condition reduces the child's total sleep time, increases daytime irritability, and lowers frustration tolerance. It also leads to parental exhaustion, as parents are deprived of their evening time and are frequently required to wake during the night. This article presents a standardized clinical protocol for children over 3 years of age, incorporating a token economy system, reinforcement strategies, and the use of a symbolic mediator.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, increasing skepticism regarding oxytocin’s (OT) influence on social behavior arose. Low power, HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known), and replication failures have clouded the field. Here, we directly address these concerns with a high-powered, preregistered study that offers robust evidence for a causal effect of OT on trust among individuals with a low disposition to trust. We recruited 359 low-trusting individuals who participated in a trust game under strict anonymity conditions. Results show that OT administration significantly increased trusting behavior by roughly 15%, with consistent effects across regression models with and without controls for personality traits. A pooled data analysis incorporating a previous sample (n=219) of low-trusting individuals further strengthens this conclusion, yielding a statistically significant 16.9% increase in trust. Crucially, no interaction effect was found between OT and the degree of dispositional trust, suggesting OT’s effect is uniform across the low-trusting spectrum. These findings present a strong case for OT’s selective trust-enhancing role. By isolating OT’s impact within a well-defined subpopulation and experimental context, this study provides a critical pivot in the debate over neurobiological mechanisms of trust.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how individuals form beliefs about their own creativity – referred to as the creative self-concept (CSC) – requires examining the informational sources that shape these self-assessments. In this paper, we introduce and validate the Sources of Creative Self-Concept Scale (SoCSC), a questionnaire adapted from self-efficacy research, designed to assess four theorized sources of CSC: mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and emotional states. A sample of 558 adults completed measures of CSC (both global and trait-like) and the SoCSC. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor model aligned with the proposed sources. All sources were significantly associated with CSC, with social persuasion emerging as the strongest individual predictor. However, structural equation modeling revealed that a general factor – reflecting shared variance across all sources – accounted for the majority of the variance in CSC. This finding suggests a dynamic interplay between personal experiences, observed models, social feedback, and affective responses in shaping creative self-perceptions. The results are discussed in the context of Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy.",

Sign-trackers (ST) attribute both incentive and predictive values to these cues, while goal-trackers (GT) assign solely predictive value, orienting their attention rapidly toward the forthcoming reward. Although animal studies report sign-tracking and goal-tracking as stable, trait-like learning styles often related to maladaptive behaviors, human research has produced inconsistent results, raising questions about the reliability and the stability of this behavior. To address these issues, we investigated the test-retest reliability and stability of the classification over a four-month period of the eye-gaze index most commonly used in human sign- and goal-tracking literature. Our findings revealed good capacity for detecting sign-tracking behavior, but limited consistency in identifying goal-tracking behavior, resulting in suboptimal overall reliability. These results raise the possibility that goal-tracking may be either genuinely rare in the population or poorly captured by the current index. Overall, while the gaze index holds promise for identifying ST behavior, methodological refinements or alternative approaches may be needed to reliably detect GT behavior and improve the utility of this measure in future research.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "Background: Workplace gaslighting is an underexplored psychosocial stressor that may exacerbate burnout and turnover among employees. Aim: This study examined associations between gaslighting, job burnout, and turnover intention in Greek workers using a cross-sectional design. Methods: The study was conducted in January 2025 with a sample (N = 291) of workers based on convenience sampling. Data from networking via professional social media Information was obtained using an online survey shared among professional social media groups. Workplace gaslighting was assessed using the Gaslighting at Work Scale (GWS), job burnout using the Single-Item Burnout Measure, and turnover intention on a reliable six-point Likert scale. Demographic information consisted of gender, age, education level, and years of work experience (potential confounders). Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between workplace gaslighting and the two outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Results: Participants were mainly female (77%), and the mean age was 42.2 years (SD = 10.3), with a mean duration of work experience of 16.7 years (SD = 9.5). High job burnout (mean = 6.8) and turnover intentions (mean = 3.1) were reported. There were significant positive correlations between workplace gaslighting and burnout (r = 0.230, p &lt; 0.01) and workplace gaslighting and turnover intention (r = 0.385, p &lt; 0.01). In multivariable regression analyses, workplace gaslighting was positively associated with job burnout (b = 0.616, 95% CI = 0.466–0.765, p &lt; 0.001) and turnover intention (b = 0.581, 95% CI = 0.414–0.748, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Workplace gaslighting was strongly associated with both burnout and turnover intention in workers. These results highlight the negative effects of gaslighting at work, and direct to the relevance of organizational interventions geared to prevent gaslighting in order to achieve employee well-being while diminishing staff turnover.",

          "abstract": "Pupil dilation responses are reliable physiological markers of arousal in reaction to unexpected events across sensory modalities. However, a direct comparison across modalities has not yet been conducted. In this study, we address this gap by examining pupil responses to regular and random sequences of visual dots and auditory tones, as well as transitions between these sequences. In Experiment 1, we showed dilation responses when a regular sequence of visual dots changed to a random sequence, but not to the reverse transition. A transition between two different regular sequences led to less dilation on average. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings, confirming the reliability of the observed dilation patterns. In Experiment 3, we compared the pupil responses when sequences and transitions were presented in visual versus auditory modalities. We observed strong cross-modal similarity in pupil sizes, particularly for transitions between regular and random sequences. Notably, these similarities persisted even during baseline trials, when no explicit transition occurred. We also decomposed the time-series pupil size to approximate phasic pupil dilation events. The patterns of dilation events aligned with the overall dilation, with modality-specific dilation event size differences primarily in the context of transitions between different regular sequences. Overall, our findings suggest that pupil-linked arousal reflects imperfect inference of statistical structure and its violations, exhibiting substantial similarity across modalities.",

          "abstract": "Millions of people now use AI-powered chatbots to support their mental health, yet little is known about whether such interactions can effectively enhance psychological well-being. We conducted a preregistered experiment on a large, diverse sample (N = 2,922) to test four AI chatbots, each prompted to employ a multi-step strategy drawn from prior psychological research on sources of happiness and meaning in life. Chatbots encouraged participants to either (a) savor positive life experiences, (b) express gratitude toward a friend or family member, (c) reflect on sources of meaning in their life, or, (d) reframe their life story as a “hero’s journey.” All four chatbots led to improvements on a broad range of psychological well-being outcomes – including affective well-being, meaning in life, life satisfaction, anxiety, and depressed mood – relative to a control chatbot condition. These results generalized to key subpopulations, including those with high baseline levels of anxiety or depression. Chatbot interactions increased interest in seeing a human therapist, including among those who were previously unwilling or had never attended therapy. A separate, nationally representative survey (N = 3,056) found that half of U.S. adults expressed interest in using empirically validated AI chatbots for mental health support. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven well-being chatbots grounded in psychological research offer a scalable and effective way to produce short-term increases in several aspects of psychological well-being. Importantly, these results do not generalize to all AI-based emotional support.",

          "abstract": "Skill acquisition in social contexts depends on learners’ ability to attune to the behaviors of their partners, whose actions help structure environments that guide attention and shape the learning of adaptive behaviors. While greater coupling is often associated with learning and collaborative problem-solving, recent perspectives suggest that the dynamics of interpersonal coupling are more complex, arising from the interplay of two opposing forces – integration and individualization – which define social interaction as a metastable system. This study examined how these dynamics influence performance and solution insight in a two-person problem-solving game with a latent solution that, when discovered, enables superior performance. Using multidimensional cross-recurrence quantification analysis (MdCRQA), participants who discovered and exploited the latent solution exhibited greater perceptual-motor coupling during the pre-discovery period than non-discoverers. Coupling declined after discovery, with further reductions linked to successful task performance, consistent with the metastable view of social interaction. Finally, we demonstrate that AI agents embodying the decision policies of pre-discoverers can, when working with novice human participants, scaffold environments that increases the likelihood of participants discovering the latent solution. These findings are discussed in the context of designing human-compatible AI agents that facilitate the self-organization of adaptive behaviors in humans.",

          "abstract": "Ambiguity avoidance in decision-making may reflect either stable preferences for certainty or uncertainty in beliefs formed through limited experience. Prior studies have commonly used the max–min expected utility (MMEU) model to interpret ambiguity-related decisions, but MMEU confounds preferences with beliefs by focusing on the range of possible probabilities rather than how individuals form them. We conducted two experiments (N = 53; N = 298) using a Linked Colored Lottery Task to evaluate whether ambiguity avoidance reflects stable preferences or beliefs about outcome distributions. Participants first learned to associate colors with distinct outcome distributions by sampling from them and then made incentivized choices between options that varied in ambiguity. This design allowed us to observe how beliefs about distributional variance influenced decisions and to distinguish whether choices reflected belief construction processes versus uncertainty evaluation. We compared models based on MMEU and on subjective recursive expected utility (SREU), which explicitly separates beliefs from preferences. In both experiments, model comparison favored SREU, and participants with more dispersed inferred beliefs were more likely to avoid ambiguous options. Sampling patterns and memory for outcomes showed similar effects. Apparent age-related differences in ambiguity avoidance were also better explained by belief variance than by preferences. These results suggest that ambiguity avoidance often reflects perceived imprecision in learned beliefs rather than an inherent aversion to uncertainty–a cognitive rather than affective phenomenon. This distinction clarifies whether individual differences in choice behavior stem from how people form beliefs or from how they evaluate outcomes, with implications for understanding decision-making across learning, memory, and uncertainty processing domains.",

Previous studies have obtained mixed findings, in part because the typical free response time paradigm lacks the specificity required to disentangle component processes underlying inhibitory control. Here, we apply a novel forced-response paradigm and a computational model to disentangle these processes to test if aging results in overall speed differences or a selective deficit in inhibitory control. 50 older adults and 57 younger adults completed a “forced-response” arrow flanker task. We find strong evidence that older adults demonstrate a global slowing of processing, without any selective deficit in inhibitory control. Furthermore, we demonstrate global slowing is sufficient to explain the mixed findings in previous free RT studies. Overall, these results highlight the utility of using a theory-informed, fine-grained approach to study inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "Current attempts to test whether AI systems are conscious fall into two families: (i) theory-driven criteria imported from cognitive or neuroscientific models (e.g., global broadcasting, higher-order representation, integrated information), and (ii) behavioral or verbal-report tests in the spirit of the Turing paradigm. The former are theory-dependent namely, their verdicts presuppose the correctness of contested explanatory accounts and thus cannot independently ground attributions of phenomenal consciousness. The latter are counterfeit-vulnerable. For example,  advanced language models can mimic first-person discourse, inviting anthropomorphic bias without evidencing phenomenality. We propose a substrate-independent sufficiency criterion that avoids both pitfalls by operating under informational control. If a system trained without any explicit or implicit consciousness-related data can, nonetheless, when prompted, articulate the defining properties of phenomenal consciousness including ineffability, physical irreducibility, intentionality, and unity, then we should attribute consciousness to it with the same degree of confidence we attribute to other humans. We operationalize this criterion for large language models via a test framework comprising: (1) training-data filtering to remove consciousness leakage; (2) a staged evaluation with prerequisite semantic checks and two options for probing (structured property-specific tasks or an open-ended prompt for high-ability models); and (3) a baseline comparison between restricted and unrestricted models under expert judgment, preceded by an intelligence pre-check to avoid confounds. Our proposal does not claim necessary conditions or solve the hard problem. It offers a logically rigorous, counterfeit-resistant path to empirically adjudicate attributions of phenomenal consciousness in artificial systems.",

Psychedelic treatment is thought to impact personality traits, psychological flexibility, and expectations, however these non-pharmacological variables may also influence the initial decision to participate. This study aimed to identify factors associated with the willingness to participate in a psychedelic trial. \nMethods: A cohort of chronic pain patients (N = 988) completed a survey assessing their interest in participating in a psychedelic clinical trial and the Big Five personality traits. A subset (N = 235) were re-surveyed for additional data on psychological flexibility and outcome expectations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to measure the associations between these factors and participants’ willingness to participate.\nResults: Trait openness to experience, and positive outcome expectations, were associated with a greater likelihood of willingness to participate, while negative outcome expectations predicted lower willingness. When controlling for all variables, negative expectancy emerged as the strongest and only significant predictor.\nConclusions: The results show that negative outcome expectations play a role in who chooses to participate in psychedelic clinical trials, suggesting that current trials are biased toward including participants who are more risk tolerant. As psychedelic therapies enter mainstream medical practice, broader populations undergoing psychedelic treatment may not see the same therapeutic outcomes observed in current trials. These findings highlight the need to account for expectancy effects in study enrollment to prevent overestimation of efficacy and improve generalizability.\nKeywords: psychedelics, willingness to participate, expectations, personality, openness",

Yet, previous studies linking personality dynamics to outcomes only examined these associations cross-sectionally, making it unclear whether person-specific dynamics also predict more distal outcomes. In this exploratory study, we investigated prospective associations between individual differences in person-specific dynamics, conceptualized as personality network parameters, with 13 life outcomes over two years. Our findings indicated that node and edge properties in the network were the most robust predictors of distal outcomes, hinting that the accumulation of specific node dynamics over time may link personality traits to outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for personality theory and for policy and intervention.",

          "authors": "William Costello; Alberto Acerbi",
          "abstract": "Incels (involuntary celibates) are a misogynistic online subculture whose members define themselves by a perceived inability to form sexual or romantic relationships. Despite rare but high-profile instances of ideological violence, most empirical research shows that they struggle primarily with poor mental health rather than engage in organized extremism. Yet the group commands disproportionate public attention, illustrated most recently by Netflix’s Adolescence, which quickly became the platform’s most-watched mini-series of all time and sparked intense political discussion despite being fictional. Beyond this, the incel motif recurs in artistic depictions across film and musical lyrics and has entered common parlance as a popular insult directed at men. Why are incels so captivating? Drawing on cultural attraction theory and evolutionary psychology, we argue that incel narratives resonate with evolved cognitive biases that make them particularly “sticky.” These include biases towards sex-related content, moral violations, negativity, coalitional threat, protectiveness of women, and morbid curiosity toward dangerous young men. Incels also qualify as minimally counterintuitive, violating gendered expectations by centering their identity on male sexual exclusion. These features render incel discourse especially memorable and transmissible. We conclude by considering the implications of this cultural virality for media, policy-makers, and public discourse, highlighting the risks of letting cultural attraction rather than empirical accuracy shape responses to incels.",

Results revealed seven latent profiles that varied in the number and type of explanations endorsed, as well as the degree of certainty associated with each.

          "abstract": "In today’s media landscape, there are an ever-expanding number of communication channels that people can use to communicate within their interpersonal relationships. This study, grounded in Media Multiplexity Theory, investigates how communication channels are used during everyday meaningful social interactions and their impact on close friendships. Using data from an intensive longitudinal field study (N = 1,423 young adults; 27,644 experience sampling observations), we found that young adults used more communication channels during meaningful interactions within their strong tie relationships (e.g., close friends, friends, romantic partners), and tended to have such interactions with strong ties via phone calls or direct messages. In contrast, meaningful interactions with weak ties tended to occur in-person or via video calls. Findings from a social network survey indicated that the odds of the friendship being maintained several months later were higher for those who used more communication channels when having meaningful interactions with their close friends. Overall, the findings support and extend Media Multiplexity Theory by examining communication channels use within dyadic relationships for high quality social interactions and its impact on the maintenance of close friendships, which has implications for how people navigate social connections in an increasingly digital environment.",

Largely unexamined is the therapeutic potential of humor to support recovery from addiction, despite the increasing prevalence of narratives in culture and media (stand-up comedy, TV shows) involving recovery and comedy. The therapeutic potential of humor and key therapeutic targets of recovery (i.e., cognitive, reward, and social) may possess a powerful synergy that could garner enjoyment, cognitive flexibility, and meaning during recovery. The goal of this Think Piece is to describe key processes involved in recovery, link these processes to key processes involved in humor, and then describe existing humor interventions that could be adapted for recovery. Key processes include cognitive deficits and bias in addiction and cognitive reframing and cognitive flexibility through humor; the importance of nondrug reward in recovery and the uniquely rewarding properties of humor (like an “aha!” moment); the importance of social connectedness in recovery and the unique social function of humor in camaraderie and belonging. Humor interventions could be adapted for recovery, including humor-coping training to reframe difficult situations, humor induction (e.g., stand-up comedy clips) to uplift mood, the use of humor to boost effects of other treatments (i.e. Contingency Management, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), and to enhance engagement with interventions. We conclude with areas of investigation such as understanding heterogeneity in the types of comedy people prefer, disentangling therapeutic and non-therapeutic humor styles, technology-delivered humor interventions, dynamic and context-dependent aspects of humor, and the timing of therapeutic humor during recovery.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

          "abstract": "Creativity is fundamentally a collaborative process. Yet as generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into creative work, understanding how AI reshapes collaboration has become critical. This pre-registered study directly compares human-human and human-AI collaboration dynamics across two creative tasks: the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) and creative short story writing. Participants were randomly assigned to pairs in either human-human (N = 68 pairs) or human-AI (GPT-4o; N = 72 pairs) conditions, with partners alternating turns as first responders to examine how initiation order shapes the creative process over time. Our findings reveal that the apparent \"AI advantage\" in creative collaboration is illusory, driven primarily by increased AI verbosity rather than enhanced creativity. Critically, collaboration with AI partners negatively impacted humans' own creative responses compared to human-human partnerships, with human-AI collaboration failing to enhance idea originality or diversity relative to human-human collaboration. Human partners demonstrated superior collaborative effectiveness that strengthened over time, indicating that current generative AI systems, while producing more verbose outputs, do not replicate the collective creativity characteristic of human-human collaboration. These results challenge assumptions about AI’s creative potential, with direct implications for AI system design and collaborative creative practice.",

          "abstract": "The term \"immersion\" is frequently used to describe and evaluate technologies within the field of extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Over the past few decades, extensive research has been conducted on immersion. However, there remains a lack of consistency in how the term is defined and applied in the literature. Additionally, there is no clear and consistent conceptual hierarchy of related terms across different measurement models. To address these issues, this paper explores the multidimensionality of immersion, as well as associated concepts such as presence and involvement. From this, a unified conceptual model of immersive experience is proposed for future studies in XR. The model defines physical presence, social presence, self presence and involvement as the core dimensions of an immersive experience, which arise from sensorimotor, task/motor and narrative engagement. Plausibility, interactivity, and interestingness are identified as key properties of immersive systems and content that fascilitate engagement, each of which is influenced by subjective factors: internal reference, skills/knowledge and personal preference, respectively. This model provides a comprensive framework for researchers to measure immersive experiences more consistently and build a coherent body of research in XR.",

Our model is compatible with a very broad range of material composition and provenance for agents (encompassing evolved, engineered, and hybrid beings), and comprises perspectives upon both features of the physical world and the contents of a putative space of patterns containing both low- and high-agency forms (a.k.a., minds). This framework opens pathways for AGI development that, at crucial junctures, do not depend on the self-construction and self-transcendence cycles that otherwise characterize biological evolution. Context dependent, shareable, and ultimately unbounded in space and time, the emerging agents are in principle capable of responding to stress challenges with universal care, thus transforming our understanding of intelligence itself.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Focused Attention (FA) and Open Monitoring (OM) meditation are theorized to confer distinct neurobehavioral influences, yet the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study leveraged computational modeling to formally test and distinguish how these two distinctive mindfulness states modulate theoretical processes of attention control. Methods: Specifically, we analyzed flanker task data from a prior study in which twenty-nine novice non-meditating participants completed a fully within-subject crossover protocol, involving brief state inductions of FA, OM, and active control. We then fit a Shrinking Spotlight (SSP) computational model to quantify parameters of attentional scope, decision thresholds, and non-decision related processing. Results: As hypothesized, FA decreased the maximum “width” of the attentional spotlight compared to both OM and control conditions, while slowing the rate of narrowing. In contrast, open monitoring accelerated the rate of attention narrowing and increased nondecision time. Conclusions: These results indicate that FA narrows attentional scope, possibly reducing initial distraction but with limitations to rapidly recalibrate attention beyond the initial scope of focus. In contrast, OM appears to improve the speed of selecting relevant targets, while slowing the speed of perceptual-motor encoding and motor execution. Together, these findings provide model-based evidence for the distinct attentional mechanisms of FA and OM and illustrate the utility of computational cognitive modeling for testing key theories within mindfulness science.",

Additionally, the extent to which mood symptoms that frequently co-occur with apathy also contribute to biases in decision making is unclear. To address these gaps, we developed a novel online task completed by 158 older adults who rated everyday activities (e.g., watching TV, going to the park) across 19 value attributes (e.g., enjoyment, social obligation), and made a series of choices between different activities. A factor analysis of attribute ratings identified three latent factors representing reward, effort, and obligation, which strongly predicted choices and choice response times. Apathy was selectively associated with an overweighting of effort-related attributes while controlling for impulsivity and depression, with no effect on the weighting of reward or obligation. Interestingly, impulsivity, which correlated positively with apathy, was associated with an underweighting of effort. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling supported these findings: apathy and impulsivity modulated the influence of effort on drift rate in opposite directions, altering evidence accumulation toward or away from high-effort options.

If the decline continues, we risk the return of endemic measles, along with other vaccine- preventable diseases. Evidence-based, scalable approaches to support hesitant parents are needed.\n\n*Methods*: We ran a preregistered two-arm online randomized controlled trial (Prolific, August- September 2025) among MMR-hesitant U.S. parents. Participants with baseline intention ≤ 6 (1–7 scale) were randomized 1:1 to: (i) Experimental, a timer-gated four-panel MMR carousel followed by an LLM-guided motivational interview, or (ii) Active Control, a format-matched car seat safety carousel and chat. The primary outcome was post-intervention MMR intention adjusted for baseline using ANCOVA (HC3 robust SEs). Sensitivity included a rank-inverse-normal (RIN) transform and exclusion of two borderline low-quality cases. An exploratory analysis of the durability of the effect used delayed post-intent from a follow-up survey on a separate sample of participants.\n\n*Results*: Among N = 180 randomized participants, the adjusted arm effect (Treatment vs Control) was β ≈ 1.03 points (95% CI 0.72–1.34) on the 1–7 scale. In the follow-up sample (N = 66), the adjusted effect was positive and of similar magnitude (β ≈ 1.09; 95% CI 0.52–1.66). Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent inferences.\n\n*Conclusions*: A brief appointment-framed MMR content review plus LLM conversation produced a clear increase in vaccination intention relative to a structure-matched active control, with encouraging signs of short-term durability.

As such, one might theorize that humans are designed to seek out and maintain as many friendships as possible. However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustain - do they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity – an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy – and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (NTotal = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale’s factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls.

          "abstract": "Counterfactual thinking -- thinking about how things could have gone differently -- is a fundamental cognitive capacity that underlies many aspects of our everyday lives; it allows us to learn from past mistakes, evaluate our own and others' actions, and imagine a world beyond the here and now. Yet, prior work has yielded a strikingly wide developmental window for the onset of counterfactual thinking: as early as 2, and as late as 12. There are at least two reasons for this: reliance on counterfactual language (which can underestimate children's competence), and a failure to distinguish counterfactual thinking from hypothetical thinking (which can overestimate children's competence). The current work presents a novel paradigm for probing genuine counterfactual thinking that does not require counterfactual language. After watching a scenario where Granny drops two items that are caught by two different characters, participants are asked which of the two characters Granny should thank. Across three experiments that implement different versions of the task to rule out alternative accounts, we find that the capacity for genuine counterfactual thinking may be present by around age 5, while younger children may succeed on tasks that can be solved via hypothetical thinking. By offering an intuitive and practical method for assessing counterfactual thinking without counterfactual language, the current work opens up a range of empirical questions about the interplay between the development of counterfactual thinking and other cognitive capacities.",

In this paper, randomly selected pairs of variables that showed cross-sectional correlations between .20 and .70 in a large longitudinal study were analyzed using the cross-lagged-panel-model. Results showed that in 98% of these randomly selected pairs, evidence for significant causal effects emerged. The median effect size of these randomly selected effects was larger than the median effect from the literature. Alternative models that account for stable-trait or state variance led to fewer significant effects.

          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "The use of noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation methods—such as transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)—has grown significantly over the past two decades. Evidence indicates that the dose-response relationship in brain stimulation is neither straightforward nor monotonic, with outcomes influenced by factors such as the brain state, anatomical variability, and neurophysiological mechanisms. Despite advancements in the field, there is still no consensus on standards for estimating and reporting delivered and received stimulation doses or defining dose-response relationships. This paper addresses these gaps by discussing four key areas: (1) factors influencing the delivered dose (stimulation parameters applied at the scalp), (2) quantification of the received dose (electric or acoustic fields delivered to brain tissue), (3) characterization of physiological, behavioral, and molecular responses to specific delivered/received doses, and (4) the dose-response relationship, which describes how variations in dose modulate brain function and behavior. Drawing on evidence from human and animal studies conducted in silico, in vitro, and in vivo, we outline challenges, propose solutions, and summarize current consensus standards. By promoting rigorous methodologies and transparent reporting, this paper aims to advance the reproducibility, safety, and efficacy of research on dose-response assessment in transcranial brain stimulation and its clinical applications.",

This study aimed to validate its French version and use it to identify emotional profiles among young French people (18-30 years old, N=1650). Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature.

          "abstract": "The Reversed Congruency Effect (RCE) typically observed with gaze targets has been rarely demonstrated with non-social stimuli like arrows targets. In a novel approach, we conducted two pre-registered experiments to investigate whether the RCE can be elicited using non-social stimuli (arrows) when directional information is visually masked. Participants performed a spatial Stroop task with arrows varying in perceptual complexity due to overlapping visual masks. Direction and spatial location were either congruent or incongruent. Remarkably, highly masked arrows elicited an RCE, with faster responses on incongruent trials. Distributional analyses showed reduced interference among the fastest responses and larger RCE in middle quantiles. Additionally, increased errors for both congruent and incongruent conditions were observed in the fastest responses, with congruent trials showing higher error rates, as previously observed with gaze targets. These findings suggest that the RCE reflects a dynamic interplay between early response capture and inhibitory control, shaped by the visual features of masked stimuli. Critically, they raise the possibility that similar perceptual constraints contribute to the RCE observed with gaze targets, offering a potential non-social mechanism underlying this effect. Our results highlight how visual complexity can modulate automatic activation and control processes, underscoring the value of distributional methods for revealing the temporal dynamics of interference.\n\nDraft version 1, 01/10/25.

          "abstract": "Does Automatic Morphological Processing Uniquely Contribute to the Reading Abilities of Middle School Students?\n\nPurpose: Morphological processing is theorized to contribute to skilled reading via the processing of high-level regularities (e.g., semantics). However, morphemes also may contribute to skilled reading via relatively low-level regularities: orthography and phonology. Evidence suggests that middle school marks the shift from effortful use of knowledge of morphological structure during word reading to its automatic activation, thus supporting the development of reading fluency and comprehension. Consequently, this study asked whether automatic morphological processing contributes unique variance to these reading outcomes in middle school students. \n\nMethod: Participants were 80 seventh- and eighth-grade students (n female = 42, n male = 38; mean age = 12.76 years). Four assessments measured decoding, oral reading fluency, and comprehension. Four computer-administered experimental tasks (each with a masked and unmasked version) indexed automaticity and knowledge in reading morphologically complex and simple words. Three analysis approaches were used in a conceptual replication of previous studies (Roembke et al., 2019; 2021): mixed ANOVAs, commonality analyses, and hierarchical regressions.\n\nResults: Only automaticity with morphologically complex words contributed unique variance to comprehension, and it also contributed unique variance to fluency. This was shown on a task that required the mapping of morpho-orthographic to morpho-phonological regularities. Automaticity with morphologically simple words most consistently contributed unique variance to decoding and fluency. \n\nConclusions: Results suggest that middle school students automatically apply morpho-orthographic to morpho-phonological regularities to support fluency and comprehension. However, there was no evidence that they automatically map morpho-orthographic to morpho-semantic regularities to uniquely influence these outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The reversed congruency effect (RCE), typically observed with gaze stimuli, reflects slower and less accurate responses to congruent than incongruent trials, in contrast to the standard congruency effect (SCE; faster for congruent than incongruent trials) observed with arrows. This phenomenon has been interpreted as evidence that gaze engages unique social and perceptual mechanisms. The present study examined whether the RCE could also be elicited with non-social stimuli designed to mimic the asymmetric contrast between pupil and sclera. Across two preregistered experiments, we manipulated the contrast polarity of arrow targets: in gaze-similar arrows, a darker arrowhead and lighter tail paralleled the pupil-sclera configuration, whereas in gaze-opposite arrows this relation was reversed. We also varied perceptual context by embedding stimuli in complex backgrounds. Both manipulations influenced response speed and accuracy, eliciting the SCE, with complex backgrounds producing slower, less accurate performance and reduced SCEs. Distributional analyses further revealed modulations of early response dynamics but no evidence of an RCE. Target-specific effects also emerged, with gaze-similar arrows harder to process yet eliciting smaller SCEs than gaze-opposite arrows. These findings suggest that contrast polarity and perceptual complexity alone are insufficient to reproduce gaze-induced RCEs, underscoring the unique role of gaze in spatial conflict resolution.\n\nAuthor note: Draft version 1, 01/10/25.

Empathy is not a static trait, instead capable of growth and development, and this chapter explores whether AI can and, more importantly, should be used to increase one’s empathy. Nothing in principle stands in the way of AI improving our empathy, but the possibility raises unanswered questions about whether such an approach would be effective or would backfire in unexpected ways, such as encouraging the commodification of empathy as a technological tool that can make companies money, rather than a fundamental part of the human experience.",

It is important for researchers using the NCA to be aware of its susceptibility to spurious findings in order not to overinterpret findings. We recommend researchers using the NCA to scrutinize their findings by estimating ranges of spuriousness, i.e., effects that could be expected due to the correlation between variables. If the estimated necessity effect does not fall above the range of spuriousness, conclusions of necessity should probably be suspended.",

Participants also rated themselves on social-traits and completed a personality questionnaire. We computed dissimilarities between pairs of participants for face-judgements, self-rated-social-traits, and personality-traits, resulting in three separate dissimilarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we showed that both the self-rated-social-traits and personality-traits matrices were significantly correlated with the face-judgements matrix. Importantly, these associations were stable when controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and location. These findings show that people who are more similar to each other also perceive others in a similar manner, and could form the basis for how we gravitate towards others and build friendships.",

We conducted two U.S. studies (N ≈ 7,000) using local income inequality to test these two assumptions and downstream consequences. Confirming the first assumption, residents of more unequal areas reported stronger and more frequent upward and downward economic comparisons. These associations were mediated by perceived competitiveness. Challenging the second assumption, income inequality was associated with a mix of emotional responses to comparison: Inequality consistently predicted resentment when comparing with better-off others and compassion when comparing with worse-off others. Inequality also predicted shame, hope, relief, contempt, and anxiety in one study but not the other. Finally, inequality predicted support for redistribution, an association mediated by resentment and compassion. Together, the findings confirm that income inequality fuels social comparison but reveal that its emotional and attitudinal consequences are more nuanced than commonly assumed.",

This shows that there are fundamental flaws in the way we (used to) go about doing empirical work. The current chapter discusses three methodological hallmarks that have emerged from the critical discourse surrounding the replication crisis: reproducibility, replication, and preregistration. It has become clear that they deserve to be regarded as integral elements of the scientific process, and the aim of this chapter is to help authors improve their work in the light of these insights. Following some initial terminological clarifications, we first turn to various aspects related to reproducibility, ranging from the FAIR principles for data sharing and data publication to computational tools and workflows ensuring the recoverability of statistical results. The focus then shifts to replication and replicability, with an outline of the continuum from direct to conceptual replication as well as advice on how to facilitate attempts by others to replicate our work. We also consider design, analysis and interpretation strategies that may be used to increase the replicability of our statistical conclusions and the linguistic claims they inspire. Finally, we discuss the essential role played by preregistration, where the researcher specifies their linguistic hypotheses and data analysis protocol prior to data acquisition; this form of academic self-discipline has culminated in the emergence of Registered Reports, a new publication format that is beginning to gain ground across the linguistic and cognitive sciences.",

In this study, we used a morphed shape dimension to separately measure generalization of fear (learning when an aversive stimulus is present) and generalization of safety (learning when an aversive stimulus is absent) in participants classified as high or low in trait anxiety. In two experiments, we found that high trait anxious participants undergeneralized safety learning relative to low trait anxious participants, but there were no differences in overgeneralization of fear. A control group who learned about a neutral outcome did not show this pattern of results, and the aversiveness of the outcome predicted undergeneralization of safety learning, but did not predict overgeneralization of fear learning. Our findings suggest that overgeneralization of fear in clinically or high trait-anxious participants may be partly driven by undergeneralization of safety learning. Therefore, promoting generalization of safety learning may be a useful strategy to reduce the spread of fear.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "abstract": "Empathy plays a central role in human emotional relationships. Empathic accuracy, the ability to accurately infer another person’s emotional state, varies by informational modality and, in humans, is often intertwined with emotional and motivational processes. This study examines whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini - demonstrate empathic accuracy, and how their accuracy compares to that of humans when presented with only the semantic content (transcripts of recorded videos) of ecological, complex autobiographical emotional narratives. We compared the empathic accuracy of LLMs’ to that of human participants (N = 127, randomly sampled students, both in-lab and online) who either read the same transcripts or watched the original videos, which enabled them to use facial and bodily expressions, as well as paralinguistic cues, in addition to semantics. LLMs were able to infer emotional states from semantic content alone with a precision that is equal to or surpasses human performance. This was true both generally and when analyzing positive and negative emotions separately. Theoretically, these findings suggest that semantic information alone can support high empathic accuracy, though humans may not fully leverage this potential. Practical implications are discussed regarding the use of LLMs in introspective and emotional contexts, while raising critical concerns about privacy, ethical risks, and the potential reshaping of emotional understanding, intimacy, and human connection in an increasingly AI-mediated world.",

          "abstract": "Motivated by the Scarr–Rowe hypothesis—which suggests that the expression of genetic potential depends on early-life conditions—this paper investigates how a genetic predisposition toward success in education interacts with the childhood environment to shape economic preferences. Using incentivized experimental data from a representative sample of English adults over the age of 50, we find that a higher genetic propensity for educational success is associated with lower risk aversion and greater patience—but only among those who experienced more advantaged childhood environments. Among participants who experienced an adverse early-life environment, risk aversion increases with genetic resources, whereas the positive relationship between genetic resources and patience is significantly attenuated. These findings suggest that early-life conditions can channel genetic resources in ways that are contextually adaptive. Concurrently, the results indicate that environmental inequality shapes the realization of genetic potential in ways that reinforce patterns of social immobility, thereby intensifying concerns regarding the systematic underutilization of potential arising from constraints on household resources.",

          "abstract": "Background\nSome people experience mood changes when hungry. However, the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical conditions, such as depression and eating disorders, is understudied. Therefore, we devised a questionnaire to measure hunger-related mood dysregulation.\nMethods\nWe developed and validated the Mood, Emotions and Appetite List (MEAL) using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in adults and adolescents in the community, and adults with a history of mental health disorder (N = 1,119). We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.\nResults\nThe MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related ‘irritability’, ‘low mood’ and ‘somatic feelings’ (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and other activities. MEAL scores were associated with irritability, depression, anxiety and menstrual symptoms. In the mood drift task, the irritability subscale (MEAL-i) demonstrated a significant interaction with time, such that individuals with higher MEAL-i scores reported steeper decreases in happiness (B = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.16–-0.06) and steeper increases in boredom (B = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00–0.12) and frustration (B = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.05–0.19).\nConclusions\nThe MEAL measures individual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, is associated with mental health, self-reported functioning, and predicts faster worsening of mood during experimentally induced frustration.",

          "authors": "Ingmar Brilmayer; Philip Georgis; Petra B. Schumacher",
          "abstract": "Understanding language in real-world interaction requires methods that integrate auditory, visual, and neural signals. We present a proof-of-concept study combining mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking to investigate referential selection during dyadic communication. Using a simplified version of the director task, pairs of participants engaged in naturalistic object-movement instructions while EEG and gaze data were recorded and synchronized via LabStreamingLayer. This approach allowed us to calculate overlap-corrected, regression-based event-related potentials (rERPs) time-locked to spoken nouns and to participants’ fixations, focusing on the N400/P300 (300–500 ms) and later (500–800 ms) time windows. Our results show that gaze behavior and fixation-related potentials provide crucial information for interpreting language-related ERPs: targets competing with occluded referents elicited stronger P300 effects, suggesting higher attentional demands, while fixation timing systematically modulated neural responses. Contrary to predictions, competitors received little visual attention, indicating that participants prioritized direct task-relevant information. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data integration for understanding attentional and predictive mechanisms in real-world communication. Importantly, we demonstrate that established analytic techniques, such as artifact subspace reconstruction, independent component analysis, and linear deconvolution for ERP calculation, are applicable to noisy, naturalistic data sets. This study thus provides a methodological framework for linking gaze and neural activity during interactive language processing beyond laboratory constraints.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the behavioral and neural correlates of implicit and automatic gender stereotyping at the intersection of language and face processing, focusing on the bidirectional flow of gender-stereotypical information and previously observed asymmetries in stereotype processing. We recorded response times (RTs) and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to a target face (male, female) preceded by stereotypically associated words (e.g., conducente “driver”, badante “caregiver”), or to stereotypically associated target words preceded by a face (male, female). Participants performed a gender categorization task on target faces and a lexical decision task on target words/non-words. RTs showed typical priming effects for target faces, but an asymmetrical priming effect for target words: faster responses to stereotypically female words preceded by a gender-congruent face, whereas faster responses to stereotypically male words preceded by a gender-incongruent face. ERPs showed a gender stereotype asymmetry for target faces and only partially for target words. Female faces elicited a larger P300 and LPP when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words; male faces elicited a larger N400 when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words. Similarly, stereotypically male words elicited a larger P300 when preceded by a gender-incongruent than congruent face. Our findings reveal robust neural asymmetries in gender stereotype processing, extending beyond language, underscoring the need to treat female- and male-related biases as distinct cognitive phenomena in both future research and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research faces a fundamental challenge - the Precision-Breadth-Simplicity (PBS) impossible trinity. While experimental findings are often precise and simple, they tend to be narrow in scope. Conversely, broad and simple concepts frequently lack precision. Developing theories that are both precise and broad is scientifically valuable but inevitably introduces complexity, which conflicts with humans’ cognitive limitations in processing complexity. To address this impossible trinity, I propose a comprehensive exploration (CE) approach—a data-guided theory-building framework that involves: (1) designing experimental conditions in a stimulus-driven way, with minimal upfront theoretical specification; (2) conducting experiments with tens of millions of observations (e.g., 40 million responses in Huang, 2025a); (3) modeling the results through iterative improvements; and (4) producing the outcome: a moderately complex quantitative information-processing model to integrate diverse empirical findings. Inspired by similar strategies that drove breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (e.g., ImageNet’s role in advancing object recognition), the CE approach offers a promising path toward more integrative psychological theories. Initial implementations in visual working memory research demonstrate both its practicality and potential to transform how we study mental processes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a characteristic but understudied feature of many pro-environmental behaviors, and traditionally, it is mostly discussed as a barrier that keeps people from behaving pro-environmentally. In contrast, contemporary frameworks of cognitive effort show that effort can also be beneficial, for example by increasing the subjective value of the outcome of an effortful action. From this new perspective, we conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of existing data from an online study (N = 1160) featuring the Work for Environmental Protection Task (WEPT), which allows participants to exert real cognitive effort in exchange for donations to a pre-selected pro-environmental organization. We found that after performing the WEPT, participants were more likely to donate additional bonus money to their assigned organization compared to an alternative organization, suggesting a higher subjective value of the former. To assess the robustness of this finding, we conducted a high-powered, preregistered confirmatory study (N = 801). We found that the differential pattern in the donation decisions replicated with a larger effect size and was also consistent with self-reported subjective value of the organizations. These findings indicate that spending effort for the benefit of a pro-environmental organization can increase the value assigned to that organization. This resonates with the idea that effort is more than just a barrier and can have a positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.",

          "abstract": "Background There is growing interest in the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) as a means for quantifying how individuals’ affective experiences fluctuate over time, and how such dynamics relate to mental health outcomes. A plethora of methods exist for precisely quantifying these affect dynamics, but recent work pooling data from multiple studies has suggested that most of the variance in outcome measures of depression, borderline symptoms, and life satisfaction is captured by simple measures, such as the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) of affect ratings over time. Ever-more sophisticated approaches for measuring affect dynamics may offer little value for understanding mental health. Here, we examined a broad array of mental health outcomes and affect dynamic measures within a single cohort to comprehensively evaluate whether EMA-derived measures of affect dynamics are associated with specific psychopathological experiences.\n\nMethods  314 adults (97 males; 18–45 years of age) completed 28 days of EMA, which included once-daily ratings on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)-10 and daily measures of stress, sleep, and alcohol use. We calculated 16 established affect dynamics measures (M, SD, relative SD, mean-squared successive differences, autoregression, intraclass correlation, and Gini coefficient for positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), as well as emotion network density and PA–NA correlation) in addition to six additional measures derived using dynamic network analyses of participant responses (promiscuity and flexibility for the entire network, PA, and NA). Predictive power was assessed using cross-validated linear regression models predicting 117 outcomes spanning five cross-sectional psychometric questionnaires and EMA-based longitudinal behavioral measures. We compared models that included each complex measure against baseline models using only M or M + SD scores quantifying PA and NA.\n\nResults Across all 117 outcomes, no complex affect dynamics measures improved cross?validated R² by more than 5.3 % beyond the M and SD of PA and NA. \n\nConclusion Elaborate measures of affect dynamics, as indexed by the PANAS-10, offer minimal incremental explanatory power in predicting psychopathology beyond basic summary statistics of daily affect. These findings question the added value of increasingly complex measures of affect dynamics for predicting standard psychological and behavioral outcomes.",

However, these associations have predominantly been examined for children who struggle with decoding aspects of reading. This study asked whether children with reading comprehension weaknesses relative to their decoding skills also show higher prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems. \n\nMethod: Preregistered analyses compared the externalising and internalising scores of 931 children with comprehension weaknesses and 4422 typical readers previously identified from Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (James et al., 2023), with additional exploratory analyses to further compare to 1353 children with decoding weaknesses. Multilevel growth models were used to compare parent-report scores at ages 9, 11, and 13, alongside self-reported internalising scores at ages 10, 12 and 13. \n\nResults: Children with comprehension weaknesses showed no differences in the prevalence or trajectory of internalising and externalising symptoms to their peers without reading difficulties. Exploratory analyses confirmed that children with comprehension weaknesses had fewer externalising problems than those with decoding weaknesses, and that females in this group had fewer self-reported depressive symptoms at the first test point.  \n\nConclusion: Associations between reading difficulties and behavioural or emotional problems are largely constrained to decoding weaknesses. Children with relative reading comprehension weaknesses do not appear to share this broader risk profile.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research suggests some of the most profound meditation-induced psychological transformations require mastery of mental skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Such development, however, often demands years of sustained practice and expert guidance. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers a novel means of potentially supporting meditative development by modulating brain structures with high spatial precision. Suppression of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—a hub of self-referential processing—may reduce stickiness in internal cognitions and self-interference, thereby fostering equanimity, a crucial meditative faculty. This pilot feasibility study investigated the effects of tFUS-based PCC inhibition during a ten-day silent retreat. Twenty-eight meditators received two stimulation sessions during the retreat and completed standardized questionnaires and daily phenomenological reports. Quantitative analyses revealed significant increases in trait mindfulness, both state–trait nondual awareness, and interoceptive body listening. Qualitative analyses identified consistent differences between stimulation and non-stimulation days: tFUS was associated with enhanced meditative phenomenology, including equanimity, concentration, and sensory clarity, as well as shifts in self-perception and cathartic emotional release. These experiential effects often unfolded in interaction with participants’ ongoing psychological challenges, suggesting that tFUS may increase baseline equanimity and scaffold meditative capacities. Implementation was feasible but required logistical planning. Limitations include the quasi-experimental design, reliance on self-reports, and lack of long-term follow-up. Future studies should use randomized sham-controlled designs, neurophenomenological methods, and examine systematic dose–response parameters with MRI-guided targeting. Together, these findings highlight tFUS as a promising tool for augmenting meditation training and advancing the study of meditative development.",

Guided by theories of femmephobia and dirty femininity, we explored cis-men’s perceptions of menstruation in the workplace in three European countries: Croatia, Germany, and Italy. Semi-structured interviews with 21 cis-men office workers were thematically analysed, uncovering pervasive beliefs and attitudes that sustain and reproduce menstrual stigma. Participants characterised menstruation as irrelevant to the workplace – and even taboo. They felt uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed that it should remain hidden, especially at work. They regularly represented their menstruating colleagues as emotionally unstable, weak, and less competent, reinforcing femmephobic stereotypes. Our findings extend applications of femmephobia to the devaluation and regulation of menstruating bodies in the workplace, and broaden the concept of dirty femininity to include menstruation. To promote inclusive workspaces, interventions should foster dialogue and build empathy between menstruators and non-menstruators, alongside educational initiatives that dismantle patriarchal systems, refute menstruation as taboo, and reduce menstrual stigma at work.",

          "abstract": "Continuous flash suppression (CFS) is a popular method for suppressing visual stimuli from awareness for extended periods. It involves a dynamic, high-contrast masking stimulus presented one eye which suppresses a target stimulus presented to the other. The strength of suppression is usually inferred from how long it takes for the target to breakthrough from suppression into awareness (the bCFS threshold). A new variant known as ‘tracking CFS’ (tCFS) directly measures the strength of suppression by measuring both breakthrough and suppression thresholds. Here, we employ the tCFS paradigm while varying the temporal frequency of the masking stimulus. Our data reveal two clear results: (i) CFS exhibits a clear temporal frequency tuning, with bCFS thresholds peaking for masks modulating at ~1 Hz; (ii) suppression depth (the difference between breakthrough and suppression thresholds) remains constant despite changes in bCFS. The first result confirms an earlier finding that peak bCFS occurs for very low temporal frequencies. The second result provides a valuable insight in showing that bCFS changes occur completely independently of suppression strength, which remains constant. In this study, suppression averaged 13 dB, around 2–3 times stronger than suppression reported in binocular rivalry studies.",

          "abstract": "Substance use among individuals with chronic pain represents an escalating public health crisis. Although opioid use and misuse dominate clinical attention amid the ongoing epidemic, cannabis legalization across the United States has introduced new complexities regarding cannabis use and opioid co-use patterns, potentially amplifying addiction risk in vulnerable populations. Despite growing concern, longitudinal research examining how psychosocial risk factors predict distinct patterns of opioid use, cannabis use, and co-use remains limited. This study employed latent growth modeling (LGM) to investigate trajectories of cognitive-affective risk factors and their differential prediction of substance use patterns among community-dwelling adults with chronic pain. Participants (n = 133; ages 19-67, M = 41.74, SD = 12.92; 55.88% women; 61.76% White) completed a 30-day ecological momentary assessment protocol to monitor stress, pain intensity, psychological distress, pain catastrophizing (helplessness, magnification, and rumination), substance cravings, and use behaviors. LGMs demonstrated an acceptable fit and explained a substantial variance in the observed variables. Substance use patterns remained relatively stable across the 30-day observation period. Critically, cognitive-affective pathways (both intercepts and slopes) consistently predicted opioid use across all risk factors. Cannabis use showed weaker associations, indicated only by helplessness trajectories and pain intensity intercepts. Most notably, elevated cognitive-affective pathways were inversely associated with co-use patterns across all risk factors. These findings challenge assumptions about polysubstance use primacy in chronic pain populations, suggesting that opioid use represents the predominant, persistent pattern driven by cognitive-affective mechanisms, while cannabis use and co-use appear more transient and less systematically predicted by these risk factors.",

In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human–machine\ninteraction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we\nrigorously measure these biases?\nWe address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test &amp; Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling,\npre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks.

          "abstract": "Persistent negative feelings such as stress, loneliness, fatigue, pain, irritability, anxiety, and\ndepressed mood are more than temporary discomforts. When they endure, even at subclinical\nlevels, they predict disease, disability, and premature mortality as strongly as many traditional\nmedical and social risks. Yet decades of evidence have not yet been organized into a framework\nthat recognizes these states as determinants of health in their own right. This article advances the\nconcept of Affective Determinants of Health (ADoHs), a category parallel to Social\nDeterminants of Health (SDOH). We define affectivity as the systemic capacity to feel, affects as\nits phenomenal instances, and affective determinants as the subset of affects that meet criteria for\ndeterminant status.\n\nA novel contribution of this framework is the recognition that persistent affects function not only\nas indicators of strain, suffering, and distress, but as stressors themselves, producing cumulative\nbiological and psychosocial strain. To explain their operation, we introduce a Three-Channel\nModel of biological, behavioral, and coping pathways and describe the construct of cumulative\naffective load, which parallels allostatic load. By consolidating diverse evidence, we argue that\nsystematic recognition of ADoHs as transdiagnostic determinants can improve early detection,\nprevention, and intervention across clinical care, population health, workplaces, education, and\npolicy. Recognizing ADoHs highlights both the costs of neglect and the opportunity to address\nthe affective foundations of health, equity, and human functioning.\n\nKeywords: affective determinants of health, affectivity, social determinants of health (SDOH),\nemotion, health disparities",

Critically, past research testing the social effects of emotional expressions has primarily relied on simulated expressions that may not capture the complexity of real-world emotional displays. Across two studies (N=1,534), we examined how naturally diverse vocalizations influence prosocial behavior. In Study 1, authentic videos of crying individuals were synched with typical crying, atypical crying, typical laughter, or no vocalization. When participants were asked to make affective inferences (Study 1A), vocalization type influenced their perceived valence judgments. However, when participants made donation decisions without explicit inference instructions (Study 1B), vocalization type did not impact donations, except when audiovisual signals were affectively conflicting. In Study 2, we examined the role of explicit inferences of affect in facilitating the link between naturalistic expressions and prosocial behaviors. We found that when participants first made explicit inferences about others’ affective states, they donated more money overall and their helping behaviors were more sensitive to vocalization types. However, when participants donated without providing explicit inferences first, their helping behaviors were less influenced by vocal cues and donation amounts were lower overall. Collectively, these findings highlight the role of explicit inferential processing in establishing the link between naturalistic emotional expressions and social behavior.",

          "abstract": "The paired lexical decision task is a common task used for studying online speech processing. Several key priming effects underlying the composition of the mental lexicon have been found using this priming paradigm, non-exhaustively including orthographic priming effects, semantic priming effects, and phonological priming. This study revisits the effects of orthographic priming in an auditory lexical decision task with English heteronymic pairs, word pairs that share the same orthographic form but have distinct phonological codes. Although heteronymic pairs present an ideal condition for orthographic priming effects to surface, heteronyms are often related to each other semantically, making it difficult to isolate possible orthographic effects from semantic priming effects. To this end, we present a novel methodology for using language models to generate semantically matched prime target controls to compare reaction times against. Using these semantically matched controls, we gather reaction time results from a sample of 29 English speaking university student and conduct Bayesian Regression analysis on 153 heteronymic prime target pairs and 343 control pairs. We find no significant difference in reaction times between heteronymic pairs and semantically matched pairs.",

          "abstract": "Incorporating gamelike elements into courses can increase student engagement and motivation, especially when the game involves freedom, choice, and storytelling. In this paper, I describe the \"meaningful gamification\" of an upper-level decision science course using the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. The course was organized into a seminar and a game component such that students spent the first class of each week in a traditional lecture and the second class of each week applying evidence-based solutions to problems within their Dungeons and Dragons games. Reception of the class was universally positive, and students reported high levels of engagement. Importantly, students reported that the opportunity to practice course concepts in-game made it more likely that they would be able to apply them in real life. In this paper, I share the structure, goals, and logistics of the course so that other instructors can use the framework to adapt their own courses.",

          "authors": "Peggy L. St. Jacques",
          "abstract": "Subjective features of memory are often treated as secondary to the objective content of remembered events. However, growing evidence suggests that these features actively shape how memories are constructed, experienced, and used. Rather than treating visual perspective as a peripheral correlate of subjectivity, this review positions it as a key mechanism that shapes the memory. Because perspective can be flexibly controlled and reliably measured, it offers a unique window into how retrieval goals interact with mental simulation to produce vivid and emotionally resonant recollections. Drawing on behavioral and neuroimaging research, this review shows that visual perspective determines the spatial framing of memory, and the emotional and sensory qualities of recollection. Focusing on the posterior parietal cortex, it outlines distinct roles for the angular gyrus (AG) and the precuneus in supporting perspective-dependent retrieval. The AG contributes to the selection and maintenance of a retrieval perspective, integrating perceptual and conceptual features into a coherent scene. In contrast, the precuneus supports spatial transformation and modulates the vividness, emotional tone, and embodied character of recollection, particularly when individuals recall events from a non-dominant or shifted perspective. Together, these findings position visual perspective as a central mechanism in the construction of subjectivity. Understanding how perspective shapes the process of remembering provides insight into how memory supports emotion regulation, mental simulation, and the continuity of the self across time.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experiences (MPEs) present a paradox for theories of consciousness.\nDefined by phenomenological simplicity, they are nonetheless accompanied by unexpectedly high\nneural signal diversity. Traditionally, entropy has been interpreted as a marker of\nphenomenological richness, exemplified by psychedelic states. Yet MPEs such as advanced\nabsorptive meditation (jhāna) or 5-MeO-DMT exhibit high entropy despite radically reduced\nexperiential content. This tension—the entropy–content paradox—challenges the entropic brain\nhypothesis and calls for a refined framework. We propose that entropy does not directly index the\nrichness of conscious content, but rather the grain of inference by which the brain resolves\nvariability. Psychedelics exemplify a fine-grained regime, in which loosened constraints amplify\nfluctuations into proliferating content, whereas MPEs exemplify a coarse-grained regime, in which\nrigid stabilization smooths over variability into contentless awareness. Both regimes elevate\nentropy, but they diverge in phenomenology and perturbational signatures.

          "abstract": "Friendships help people achieve many fundamental adaptive functions. As such, one might theorize that humans are designed to seek out and maintain as many friendships as possible. However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustain - do they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity – an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy – and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (NTotal = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale’s factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls.

In two state-based experiments, harmonic locking emerged as a system-wide property of brain-body coordination, associated with cognitive demand, task-related physiological arousal, and negative affect valence. Cardiorespiratory rhythms coupled to low-frequency, network-level brain rhythms, which in turn coupled to higher-frequency brain activity, enabled by a coordinated, oppositional modulation of low- and high-frequency rhythms. The converging effects of cognitive demand, physiological arousal, and negatively-valenced affect suggest a conceptual and functional overlap, potentially unified as constituent elements of state stress. A third, meta-analytical experiment found individual differences in perceived stress and interoceptive sensitivity to physiological arousal predicted latent expression of brain-body coupling. Finally, distinct elements of the stress response engaged distinct modes of synchrony, contingent on arousal activation: a purely cognitive stress promoted theta-anchored intra-brain coupling; stress accompanied by cardiorespiratory activation promoted delta-anchored brain-body coupling. Together, this study identified harmonic locking as a stress-responsive, hierarchically-organized substrate of brain-body coordination.",

In Parkinson’s disease (PD), where dopaminergic dysfunction is a core feature, alterations in corticobulbar excitability may provide insights into both motor and motivational deficits. Objective. This study investigated whether motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the submental muscle (SbM) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) differentiate PD patients from matched healthy controls, and whether SbM excitability is modulated by acute dopaminergic stimulation. Methods. Twenty-two participants (10 PD patients, 12 healthy controls) were tested using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients underwent stimulation in both OFF (≥12 h levodopa withdrawal) and ON (1 h after levodopa) conditions. MEP amplitude, onset latency, and elicitation rate were extracted. Linear and generalized linear mixed models tested between- and within-group effects. Results. At baseline, patients showed a higher proportion of elicited MEPs in ECR compared to controls (p = 0.045), but no differences for SbM. Within patients, levodopa intake was associated with longer SbM onset latency (p = 0.012), reduced SbM elicitation rate (p = 0.034), and a robust increase in ECR amplitude (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions. These findings suggest a dissociation between control (ECR) and target (SbM) excitability, SbM results differently sensitive to dopaminergic state, supporting its potential linkage to broader dopaminergic network, comprising corticobulbar and motivational function that are disfunctional in PD.\nKeywords: corticobulbar tract; submental EMG; Parkinson’s disease; transcranial magnetic stimulation; motor evoked potentials; motivational arousal.",

Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward\ncriticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of\nmeditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the\n“jhānas”, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and\nphysiological data during these practices and quantified the signal’s dynamical properties using\nLempel–Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations.

Relative to mindfulness, jhāna was associated with\npronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across\nmultiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites.\nSpectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic 1/f component and a frequency-specific reorganization\nof long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and\nheightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during\njhāna. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhāna with minimal phenomenal\nexperiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness.\nAccordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the\nabsorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence continues to advance, people increasingly expect humanoid robots to demonstrate sophisticated social behaviours. To meet these expectations, it is crucial to design robots that align with human models of social cognition. This study explores the extent to which humans co-represent actions performed by social robots and how prior attitudes influence this process. We use the social inhibition of return (SIOR) paradigm, where individuals are slower to respond to targets in locations previously acted upon by themselves or by a partner. In a within-subjects design, participants engaged first with a robot co-actor and then with another human co-actor. Overall, our findings suggest that interacting with a robot fosters positive perceptions of the robot and evokes co-representation of their actions. Additionally, we found a trade-off between self- and social-inhibitory processes when interacting with a robot, in contrast to interactions with humans. Furthermore, prior attitudes, particularly the tendency to attribute human-like qualities to robots, were paradoxically found to reduce the SIOR effect.  We discuss these results in relation to the uncanny valley effect, as well as broader implications for how human and robot factors that drive people’s co-representation of robot behavior may support more natural and effective human—robot cooperation.",

A new United States Video Speed Test (USVST) was developed. The new test used ten video clips, each 8 seconds in duration, which participants viewed before indicating how much slower or faster they would drive in the same scenario. In a pre-registered online study, the USVST showed high internal and test-retest reliability. Like the UQVST, the USVST correlated positively with scores on the speed subscale of the Driving Style Questionnaire and negatively with age. Further, the USVST showed a negative correlation with the cautious driving subscale of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory and a positive correlation with the sum of self-reported accidents, violations, and police pullovers. Males also scored significantly higher on the USVST than females. Collectively, this evidence suggested that the USVST may be a useful tool for measuring speeding propensity.",

Corticobulbar (CB) projections linking tongue/submental effectors to motor cortex are implicated in reward processing and motivational arousal (Alipour et al., 2002; Kringelbach et al., 2003; Kringelbach, 2005; O’Doherty, 2004; Volkow et al., 2011; 2017). Submental muscle (SbM) surface EMG may thus provide a convenient physiological window on motivational states during foods selection (Sato et al., 2021; Ferraioli and Vicario 2024). Objective. To test, in healthy participants, whether SbM activity recorded during an immersive virtual‑reality (VR) supermarket varies as a function of food motivational category (Daily, Hedonic, Dislike) and whether SbM contributes to the prediction of self‑reported preference, along with personality traits, like impulsivity in monetary choice, measured by Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ; Kaplan et al., 2016). Methods. Fourteen adults completed a VR shopping task selecting 10 products per three different conditions. SbM was recorded continuously and summarized within pre‑selection (−550/−200 ms) and post‑selection (T0/+550 ms) windows, as specified in our published protocol (Ferraioli et al., 2025). Linear mixed‑effects models (LME) examined effects of Condition and Phase on SbM. A separate LME predicted Preference from SbM, Condition, and impulsivity (MCQ). Results. SbM was higher in Hedonic vs Daily (β=0.342, p=.022), with no main effect of Phase (p=.774) and no Condition×Phase interactions. Preference was positively associated with SbM (β=0.441, p=.043) and strongly reduced in Dislike (β=−5.760, p&lt;.001); MCQ had no effect. Conclusions. Our preliminary analyses on an ecologically valid VR environment, showed SbM differentiates motivational categories and independently predicts reported preference, supporting SbM as a candidate biomarker of motivational arousal and complementing the broader CB‑excitability program (Ferraioli et al., 2025).\nKeywords: corticobulbar tract; submental EMG (SbM); virtual reality; food preference; motivational arousal; linear mixed‑effects models.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of human experience is that of being a bounded and embodied agent. This basic sense of self typically operates implicitly, yet traditional contemplative accounts alongside recent work in philosophy, phenomenology and neuroscience suggests that it can be attenuated or even fully dissolved while retaining awareness. Here we present an extended analysis of data from a large-scale neurophenomenological study investigating such minimal modes of awareness, in which 46 long-term meditators alternated between resting-state and meditative conditions of self-boundary (SB) dissolution and maintenance during magnetoencephalography. Results show global increases in broadband entropy rate and directed information transfer in both meditation conditions compared to rest. Spectral decomposition of both measures reveals that broadband effects are driven mostly by high-frequency activity, and that information transfer and entropy rates exhibit qualitatively different spectral patterns. Although these global changes don’t clearly differentiate meditative self-boundary dissolution, localized reductions in information transfer from the anterior cingulate to mid and post cingulate and in high-beta entropy rate in sensorimotor and posterior-medial cortices did differentiate the meditation conditions. Furthermore, a relative reduction of broadband orbitofrontal cortex entropy rate, and broadband information transfer from occipital, cingulate, limbic and subcortical areas, both correlated strongly with SB-dissolution phenomenology. Together with a previously reported neural correlate from the same dataset of reduced high-beta power in the posterior-medial cortex, these two neural correlates synergistically explained over half the variance in phenomenological dissolution scores (R² = 0.52), exhibiting a neurophenomenological association of unprecedented strength. By integrating nuanced phenomenology with multiscale neural metrics, our findings provide novel insight into self-attenuation and advance the empirical investigation of minimal phenomenal experience.",

These arise from multiple experimental procedures and animal species. To assess any proposed theory of associative learning, decisions must be made about which behavioral phenomena to account for. However, there is currently no systematic approach to prioritize observations within this body of evidence. Here, we propose a set of benchmarks that theories should explain: phenomena that are robust across experiments, generalize across procedural variations, and occur under broad but clearly specified circumstances. We queried the expert community for phenomena to be included, reviewed the relevant literature, graded the phenomena into four categories of robustness and generality, and compared our gradings with a second survey of the expert community. We identified 94 benchmark phenomena, of which 16 are domain- and species-general and hence should be explained by any theory claiming generality, and 30 are species- and/or domain-specific but highly robust across procedures. Strikingly, some textbook phenomena that have motivated influential and general associative learning theories are not among these. The remaining 48 phenomena were either tied to particular experimental procedures or of inconclusive generality. Some of their boundary conditions appear to be informally known across laboratories but rarely investigated in a systematic manner. Thus, our review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current evidence, which will direct theorizing towards high-priority phenomena while also re-focusing research into areas in which evidence is lacking.",

          "abstract": "The sensitive period for phonetic learning, normally considered to be between 6 to 12 months of age, has been demonstrated as one of the earliest milestones for language development. Infant speech processing towards the end of the sensitive period has been shown to predict individual language development trajectories up to school entry and most recently, risk of speech and language disorders, suggesting its potential clinical relevance. Yet, this literature is largely limited to typically developing infants with regard to their family histories of speech and language delays or disorders. The current study begins to fill the gap by investigating associations between neural markers of the sensitive period, family history risk factors, and language outcomes by gathering extensive information from a large group of infants. Specifically, family information includes an extensive parental survey of family background and clinical history, a comprehensive assessment of language skills for one older sibling by a research speech-language pathologist (SLP), and a daylong audio recording in infants’ homes for assessing their language environment. The study design focuses on comparing neural predictors of language development in infants with or without first-degree family history of speech and language delays and disorders (i.e., High vs. Low-risk infants). Infants’ neural speech processing is measured three times using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) at 6 months, 12 months, and 14 months of age. Infants’ language development is tracked until school entry by both parental surveys (MB-CDI) and the same comprehensive assessment protocol with a research SLP. This protocol documents the study design and methodological details for data collection and preprocessing. This study will allow our research team to start tackling important questions regarding early predictors of speech and language delays and disorders (e.g., late-talking, Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)) and contribute significant value to the broader field.",

Research indicates that the quality rather than the quantity of these elements predict therapeutic outcomes in CBT. However, it remains unclear which factors facilitate the post-treatment implementation and continuation of individually helpful elements. This study investigated whether the quality of \"bridging elements\" predicts their implementation in the post-treatment phase. Bridging elements were defined as any element of previous therapy that a patient has experienced as helpful and that helps maintain treatment effects from the patient's perspective after treatment termination. Criteria were derived from the literature to rate the quality of patients' open-ended descriptions of their bridging-elements. A prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted with 120 inpatients who had been previously treated with CBT. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that a quality score composed of four quality criteria significantly predicted implementation of bridging elements even after controlling for motivational factors, while none of the single quality criteria alone was predictive at four-month follow-up. Prior to treatment termination individually helpful bridging elements should be identified to foster enduring change. Specific attention should be paid to defining high-quality bridging skills, which should be specific, time-limited, independent from others, action-oriented, measurable, and frequently applicable.",

          "abstract": "Youth who are simultaneously engaged in both the juvenile justice and child welfare systems—commonly referred to as dually involved youth—face disproportionately high rates of trauma exposure, psychiatric comorbidity, and adverse developmental outcomes. Traditional accounts of juvenile impulsivity often emphasize sensation seeking or underdeveloped executive function, portraying defiance as a product of poor judgment or deliberate noncompliance. Emerging evidence, however, highlights the role of negative urgency, defined as rash action in response to distress, as a more precise explanatory construct. This paper develops and applies the concept of the Urgency Loop, a cyclical process in which trauma-induced emotional dysregulation drives impulsive actions aimed at short-term relief, producing long-term negative consequences that reinforce distress and perpetuate maladaptive patterns.\n\nDrawing from neuroscience, developmental psychology, and criminology, the Urgency Loop framework situates behaviors such as runaway episodes, aggression, and substance use not as thrill-seeking but as relief-seeking adaptations to overwhelming affective states. This reorientation challenges prevailing juvenile justice interpretations of 'willful defiance,' which often justify punitive sanctions and surveillance. Instead, the framework underscores how trauma reshapes limbic–prefrontal circuitry, heightens vulnerability to negative urgency, and interacts with systemic responses to exacerbate cycles of involvement.\n\nThis manuscript reviews theoretical models of impulsivity, empirical findings on trauma and neurodevelopment, and critiques of trauma-informed practice. It further explores implications for juvenile justice reform, including the potential utility of ecological momentary assessment, ethical considerations of pharmacological interventions, and the need for more nuanced adjudicative approaches. By reframing impulsive behavior as a neurobiological adaptation to distress rather than intentional rebellion, this work seeks to inform interventions that are more effective, equitable, and developmentally appropriate.",

          "abstract": "People with pronounced narcissistic traits exhibit marked problems in their intersubjective experiences, yet a more detailed view on how different aspects of interpersonal functioning relate to grandiose and vulnerable narcissism is lacking. We conducted a preregistered questionnaire study of 956 participants to examine how vulnerable and grandiose narcissistic traits differ in relation to mentalizing capacity, tendency to trust in socially transmitted information (epistemic trust), belongingness needs, and experiences of internal and external shame. Our findings confirmed hypotheses, differentiating distinct inter- and intrapersonal patterns between narcissistic subtypes: Individuals high in vulnerable narcissism displayed compromised mentalizing and were associated with increased epistemic mistrust and credulity, higher need for belonging, and heightened experiences of internal and external shame. Conversely, grandiose narcissistic traits predicted lower belongingness needs, reduced shame experiences, and higher epistemic mistrust without credulity or clear deficits in mentalizing abilities. These results clarify clinically meaningful distinctions within narcissistic presentations, highlighting vulnerable narcissisms pronounced interpersonal instability and grandiose narcissisms defensive self-regulation. The findings emphasize the importance of differentiating narcissistic subtypes to inform targeted therapeutic strategies addressing specific emotional and relational impairments.",

          "abstract": "The ubiquity of over-optimism, overconfidence, wishful thinking and desirability biases suggest that a universal motivational mechanism distorts all decisions and judgments uniformly. Here, we investigate this intuition, by assessing the relative effects of incentives on two types of probabilistic judgments: beliefs about externally generated hypotheses, versus confidence in one’s own decisions. Across four perceptual decision-making experiments, we manipulate the agency of decisions over ambiguous states-of-the-world and the monetary incentives for accurate probabilistic judgments about decision accuracy. Results show that incentives consistently bias participants’ reports, but, contrary to the uniform motivational bias intuition, substantially more for confidence than belief judgments. Modelling probabilistic judgments as an incentive-dependent weighting of evidence that is congruent with a (covert) decision rationalizes this apparent discrepancy. We conclude that gain versus loss prospects modulate how we integrate evidence confirming our endorsed hypothesis, shedding light on the formation of beliefs and confidence, and their interaction with motivational processes.",

          "authors": "Norbert Meskó",
          "abstract": "Exploitation is a pervasive yet under-theorized phenomenon shaping interactions from intimate relationships to global institutions. Existing approaches typically examine narrow domains—manipulation in interpersonal contexts, cheating in economic games, or corruption in political systems—without an integrative account. The General Exploitation Theory (GET) addresses this gap by conceptualizing exploitation as a continuum, ranging from benign utilization of opportunities to abusive appropriation that imposes disproportionate costs on others or the environment. This continuum-based approach aligns with dimensional models in psychology and the behavioral sciences. GET advances a bio-psycho-social model in which exploitation emerges through the interplay of evolved biological mechanisms, intrapsychic processes, interpersonal strategies, and societal structures. Reward circuits, hormonal modulation, and cognitive biases may bias individuals toward short-term opportunism; emotions and motivational drives such as envy, greed, and status striving provide proximate energy for exploitative behavior; interpersonal dynamics translate these tendencies into deception, coercion, and betrayal; and societal and institutional arrangements embed exploitation at scale through hierarchies, inequalities, and legitimizing ideologies. Evolutionary theory clarifies its resilience, framing exploitation as a conditional strategy that can yield reproductive or material benefits despite long-term costs. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, GET offers a comprehensive framework for understanding exploitation as an adaptive, multi-level process. This perspective not only explains its persistence but also provides a roadmap for systematic research on mechanisms, variability, and consequences. In doing so, GET positions exploitation as a central construct for the behavioral sciences and a consequential dimension of human nature across levels and contexts and over time worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Trust is a critical factor in the acceptance and safe deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). In recent years, it has remained a prominent topic of discussion, with market data indicating that public trust in these technologies remains suboptimal. As a result, researchers have explored various strategies to enhance trust in AVs. One such strategy involves anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices. Initially, it was assumed that incorporating anthropomorphic features would enhance trust in AVs. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes from 5903 participants from seven databases were included in this meta-analysis.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

We conducted two behavioural experiments to validate a carefully controlled categorization task intended to dissociate these explicit and implicit systems. Then we applied fNIRS neuroimaging within-subjects to localize a neuroanatomical dissociation. We localized two effects to R DLPFC (1) a simple single-dissociation of higher activity in RB categorization, and (2) a negative relationship between overall task performance and the magnitude of neural activation. We conclude that explicit and implicit cortical activity are dissociable by neuroimaging, and that fNIRS is a feasible modality to study human categorization.",

Across four experiments, listeners heard various speakers describe two characters while their eye-movements were measured to these referents. Afterwards, listeners provided judgments about the speaker’s intent. Eye-movements revealed frequency effects for literal but not ironic meanings, systematic reference restriction for ironic but not “opposite” speakers, and late-emerging conflicts between literal and ironic meanings. Judgments revealed intuitions about the pragmatic function of irony and relations to truth conditions. These findings demonstrate that ironic interpretations are not directly retrieved from conventionalized representations in the lexicon. Instead, they involve real-time reasoning about utterance semantics and speaker intentions, and that these dual processes yield distinct signatures during comprehension.",

          "abstract": "Creativity depends on the rapid generation of novel associations and the equally rapid evaluation of their usefulness; yet, prevailing dual-process theories treat these operations as sequential and largely independent. We propose System 3, an integrative cognitive architecture in which intuition-dominated search and analysis-dominated checking are locked into a fast, self-regulating micro-cycle that we call transformative metathought. The model is specified by three behavioral indices—associative-distance density, analytic-verification ratio, and convergence latency—and mapped onto a neural motif in which Default Mode Network (DMN) activity alternates with Central Executive Network (CEN) activity on a sub-second timescale. A review of recent fMRI, EEG, and causal stimulation studies shows that (i) DMN–CEN coupling increases with idea originality, (ii) rapid network switching predicts insight accuracy, and (iii) dual site neuromodulation that balances the two networks boosts creative output without loss of practicality. System 3 also reframes cognitive biases as scalable heuristics that expand the search space when monitored by metacognitive confidence signals, and positions dopamine and serotonin as chemical gain controls on the generate–evaluate loop. Practical applications range from AI assisted ideation and precision neurofeedback to cautious exploration of pharmacological and genetic levers. An ethical framework is proposed to safeguard psychological integrity, authenticity, and equity as such interventions mature. Finally, developmental data suggest that the generative component matures early in adolescence, whereas evaluative gating and full-loop metacognition continue to develop into adulthood, inviting longitudinal tests of the model. System 3 thus offers a falsifiable, multi-level account of creative cognition and a scaffold for responsible enhancement technologies.",

This has sometimes been attributed to age-related change in communication goals, yet little is known about how different age groups modify their discourse style when they have different goals. Here, young and older adults produced discourse on a range of topics, first without specific instructions and then when instructed to be as entertaining or as focused as possible. When aiming to entertain, both age groups spoke more quickly and were less globally coherent, particularly in the later stages of responses. This later decline in coherence was more pronounced in the older group.  These results indicate that deviations from the topic of discussion can stem from a desire to entertain one’s audience. Thus, a shift in communication goals is a viable possible explanation for age-related declines in coherence.",

          "abstract": "Unreliable measurement can lead to lower statistical power, attenuated effect sizes and residual confounding. However, estimating reliability can be challenging for complex cognitive and behavioural assessments without test-retest data. Most statistical methods for assessing reliability with a single test administration are designed for fixed-item questionnaires. We introduce a novel Bayesian procedure called relative measurement uncertainty (RMU) for estimating reliability that can be broadly applied, including to many widely used computational models. Our approach draws pairs of samples from each subject's posterior and calculates the correlation between draws. We demonstrate analytically and via simulation that this method provides accurate reliability estimates and well-calibrated credible intervals across linear factor, signal detection and reinforcement learning models. Simulations found that RMU was more accurate (lower root mean square error) than existing measures (coefficient alpha, coefficient H, split-half), but more importantly, it can be applied across a wide range of computational models. RMU offers a general method for estimating reliability, leveraging the modelling flexibility of Bayesian statistical methods.",

Central tendencies extracted from the clusters at different levels of abstraction revealed featural prototypes and an overall family resemblance structure. To probe the effects of regional context on conceptual structure, we used a subset of participants who were long-term residents of Canada or the United States. We found that prototypical features varied regionally, suggesting an effect of participants’ geographical region on conceptual structure. This work is the first to investigate how people represent settlements as concepts and helps centralize the utility of semantic feature norms in understanding how people collectively think about where they live, and the importance of context effects on representations of settlements.",

          "abstract": "The prenatal period is a critical window for the emergence of sensorimotor coordination and early relational processes. Within this framework, yawning—a stereotyped behavior linked to arousal regulation and social contagion—offers a unique opportunity to explore maternal-fetal relationships before birth. While contagious yawning has been extensively studied in postnatal contexts, its presence and developmental role in utero remain unexplored. This study investigated whether fetal yawning behavior is modulated by maternal yawning, suggesting a primitive form of behavioral contagion within the dyad. Thirty-six pregnant participants were exposed to video stimuli designed to elicit yawns, while fetal facial movements were recorded using 2D ultrasound. Maternal and fetal yawning frequencies were analyzed across four conditions: baseline, maternal still-face, maternal mouth opening/closing movements, and maternal yawning. Fetal and maternal time series were further examined using Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), and an LSTM-based neural network was employed for automated behavioral classification. Results showed a significant increase in fetal yawns following maternal yawning, but not during control conditions, indicating selective behavioral responsiveness. CRQA revealed enhanced temporal structure in true mother-fetus dyads compared to shuffled pairs, suggesting non-random coordination. The LSTM model accurately distinguished yawning from other facial actions, supporting the reliability of the behavioral data. These findings provide the first evidence of prenatal yawning contagion and support the notion that behavioral alignment may reflect embodied mechanisms of attunement that precede postnatal social engagement, offering new insights into the developmental origins of intersubjectivity.",

          "abstract": "Semantic-categorically related distractor words slow down picture naming more than unrelated distractor words do (e.g., “dog” vs. “car” for the picture of a horse). This semantic interference effect in the picture-word interference task has been replicated numerous times and is an empirical cornerstone of speech production research. However, picture-picture interference studies in which the distractor words were replaced with distractor pictures have yielded highly inconsistent results, reporting semantic interference, semantic facilitation, and null effects. We present a meta-analytic summary of the published studies. We found the estimated semantic effect to be close to zero (2 ms, 95% CI [-5, 9]). This contrasts with the results of 14 previously unpublished picture-picture interference experiments from our laboratory. Across these experiments, the estimated semantic interference effect was 15 ms (95% CI [9, 21]). When all data were included in a meta-analysis, the pooled estimate was 9 ms (95% CI [4, 14]). This suggests that the magnitude of semantic interference from distractor pictures has been underestimated and that it is not as elusive as previously thought. We conclude that there is no qualitative difference in the semantic effects caused by distractor words and pictures, and we discuss the implications for modelling word production.",
