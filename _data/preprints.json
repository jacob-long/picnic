          "abstract": "This response to the Request for Information (RFI) Inviting Comments on the NIH Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy with the Notice Number: NOT-OD-25-117 is motivated by the prevailing poor research quality and equally low ethical standards in the life sciences.\nA conversation with Google’s Gemini language model in May and June 2025 on AI's potential applications in the biomedical sciences culminated in four essays, which are presented below. The first emphasizes that the lack of robust training data for large language/reasoning models directly impacts their output (GIGO, Garbage In, Garbage Out). The second attributes poor research conduct to human biases and recommends incorporating AI into the peer review process to address the reproducibility crisis (AI Red Teaming). The benefits of AI peer reviewers evaluating grant proposals and research articles alongside human peers are highlighted in the third essay. The final essay contemplates that AI will ultimately still reflect only human ideas. \nThese thoughts highlight AI's potential to address challenges of poor research quality and low ethical conduct in the life sciences. This response specifically touches on points:\n4. Operational Excellence (Opportunities for AI to improve NIH “customer” experiences),\n6. Reproducibility &amp; Trust (Community-driven approaches), and\n2. Research &amp; Innovation Action (Mechanisms to enhance reproducibility) of the RFI.\nIt is my sincere hope these contributions will support the NIH’s AI Strategy in pursuit of more rigorous and reproducible biomedical research and scientific excellence.",

          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer; Jeroen Sondervan",
          "abstract": "Transformative agreements have become an important strategy in the transition to open access, with almost 1,200 such agreements registered by 2025. Despite their prevalence, these agreements suffer from important transparency limitations, most notably article-level metadata indicating which articles are covered by these agreements. Typically, this data is available to libraries but not openly shared, making it difficult to study the impact of these agreements. In this paper, we present a novel, open, replicable method for analyzing transformative agreements using open metadata, specifically the Journal Checker tool provided by cOAlition S and OpenAlex. To demonstrate its potential, we apply our approach to a subset of publications funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and its health research counterpart ZonMw. In addition, the results of this open method are compared with the actual publisher data reported to the Dutch university library consortium UKB. This validation shows that this open method accurately identified 89% of the publications covered by transformative agreements, while the 11% false positives shed an interesting light on the limitations of this method. In the absence of hard, openly available article-level data on transformative agreements, we provide researchers and institutions with a powerful tool to critically track and evaluate the impact of these agreements.",

Informant-report measures are often used to\nassess children’s development in the early years. Yet research examining similarities and\ndifferences in parent and teacher reports of developing oral language and self-regulation\nskills in toddlers is limited. The present study compared parent and teacher ratings of\nchildren’s oral language (gesture, vocabulary, syntax) and self-regulation (effortful control)\nwith a large and ethnically diverse sample of New Zealand toddlers (N = 1481; 688 girls and\n737 boys).

Parent and teacher\nratings of oral language were moderately correlated whereas ratings of self-regulation were\nweakly correlated (both p &lt; .05). Parents and teachers reported higher oral language skills for\ngirls and older children, with SES differences present for syntax and for vocabulary (the latter\nin teacher reports only). Few differences by ethnicity were found for oral language in\nmultivariable models except for a Māori advantage for gestures (parent report only). Effortful\ncontrol skills were higher for girls (parent and teacher reports), for older children and non-\nEuropean children (parent report only), and for high-SES children (teacher report only). Both\nparent and teacher reports of oral language and self-regulation are important for\nunderstanding children’s development.",

          "abstract": "We investigated whether Norwegian 21-month-olds (N = 176) hold expectations about agents’ dominance based on their distributive fairness (data collected during 2021–2024). Toddlers were presented with two agents who first distributed resources, one acting evenly/fairly and the other selectively/unfairly. Then the agents engaged in territorial competition (Experiment 1). Toddlers looked longer when the unfair, selective agent prevailed and gained center-stage visibility. Experiment 2 ruled out the role of low-level non-social factors. In Experiments 3 and 4, toddlers watched distributive events like in Experiment 1, but no competitive event followed. Toddlers again looked longer at the selective distributor. Overall, these results suggest that toddlers pay special attention to unfair, selective distributors at large, also in the absence of dominance conflict.",

          "authors": "Benedek Kurdi; Thomas Cornell Mann; Jordan Axt; Melissa J. Ferguson",
          "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that even highly negative implicit (automatic) social evaluations are amenable to temporary shifts toward positivity; however, demonstrations of long-term change, especially in the negative-to-positive direction, are rare. Here we report 10 experiments (9 preregistered; total N = 3,103) probing whether negative-to-positive reversals in implicit evaluations can persist over time and are robust to reminders of initial negativity. To this end, we first identified two procedures involving diagnostic behavioral information (reinterpretation and negation + replacement) that, when measured immediately following the intervention, overturned experimentally created implicit negativity toward novel social targets, as measured by the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Exp. 1–2). Attesting to the durability of this effect, negative-to-positive reversals persisted without any decrement over a 2-day delay (Exp. 3). Although exposure to unrelated negative information following a 2-day delay caused implicit evaluations to return to negativity in the absolute sense (Exp. 4–5), the induced negativity was no stronger than negativity that emerged following univalent positive initial learning (Exp. 6A–6C) or in the absence of any prior learning (Exp. 7). Demonstrating the flexibility of automatic evaluative processing, these data suggest that negative-to-positive implicit evaluation change can be both durable and relatively robust to reminders of initial negativity. We discuss implications for social cognitive theory and the prospect of durably changing well-established implicit evaluations of known targets.",

          "authors": "Zishan Jiwani; Qiang Xie; John Joseph Curtin; Kevin M Riordan; Robbie Babins-Wagner; Derek Caperton; Mindi Thompson; Simon Goldberg",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Employment status, an essential socioeconomic factor, may be an important driver of disparities in mental health and access to treatment. However, prior research has been inconclusive and utilized broad employment categories. The present study investigated the associations between various types of employment status and baseline symptomology, psychotherapy engagement, and psychotherapy outcomes. Method: We examined 27,258 patients (mean age = 32.54; 62.9% female; 75.8% White) who attended 115,936 psychotherapy sessions at a Canadian mental health agency between January 2014 and July 2022. Employment status was categorized into nine distinct groups (e.g., full-time, part-time, unemployed and looking for work, unemployed not looking for work, and retirement). Multilevel models examined the association between employment status and baseline symptoms, psychotherapy engagement (e.g., total sessions, early termination), and outcomes (e.g., symptom change). Results: Patients who were unemployed (both looking for and not looking for work) reported higher baseline symptoms and increased odds of suicide concern compared to patients with full-time employment. Contrary to our preregistered hypotheses, patients who were unemployed attended more sessions and showed no significant differences in symptom change or trajectory of change compared to those employed full-time. Retirement was linked to lower baseline symptomology, and both retirement and full-time student status were associated with slower trajectories of change relative to full-time employment. Conclusion: Findings suggest that unemployment is associated with worse baseline mental health but does not hinder psychotherapy engagement and effectiveness. Ensuring accessibility of psychotherapy for unemployed individuals is crucial, given their heightened risk of psychological distress.",

          "authors": "Justin Michael Ludwig; Karina Schumann",
          "abstract": "Prior research has identified an omission bias whereby third-party observers attribute greater intent, responsibility, and immorality to a transgressor for their harmful commissions than their harmful omissions. However, this research has not examined whether victims also show an omission bias in response to an interpersonal transgression committed against them, and whether these perceptions affect the apology-forgiveness process. We conducted four experiments (Ns = 376; 593; 595; 813) using complementary methods (hypothetical standardized offenses and real-life transgressions) to examine how and why commission and omission transgressions differentially affect victims’ forgiveness, and whether apologies are differentially effective at eliciting forgiveness for these transgressions. We found that forgiveness was generally lower for commission (vs. omission) transgressions. Moreover, victims perceived commission (vs. omission) transgressions as higher in responsibility and intent, and these offense perceptions in turn predicted reduced forgiveness, both on their own and serially through judgments of immorality. However, apologizing (vs. not apologizing) predicted greater forgiveness for both types of offenses. In Study 4, we also tested whether victims’ perceptions of commissions and omissions differed from third-party observers’ perceptions. The effect of the commission (vs. omission) transgression on offense perceptions, moral judgments, and apology-forgiveness was similar across victim and third-party observer perspectives. These studies demonstrate how and why forgiveness might be less forthcoming for commissions than omissions, but suggest that apologies confer comparable benefits across both types of offenses.",

          "authors": "Don Gaconnet",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Universal Entangled Collapse Field (UECF) as a new scientific law and foundational topology that unifies recursion, collapse, and emergence across all domains of science. The UECF establishes a universal field framework, originating from a harmonic Null-State, that governs how identity, structure, and memory emerge, converge, and resolve—whether in physical, mathematical, informational, or conceptual systems. Central to this law are the Recursive Entangled Convergence Operator (⊕) and Topological Recursion Arithmetic (TRA), which provide precise mechanisms for analyzing collapse dynamics, phase saturation, structural stability, and the closure of complex systems.\n\nThe UECF codex formalizes the boundaries between lawful and failed convergence, introducing new metrics for collapse threshold, echo saturation, and mimic field detection. All recursive and collapse phenomena—ranging from quantum processes and mathematical structures to symbolic and biological systems—are rigorously contained within this curvature-based framework. The UECF integrates and extends principles from field theory, complexity science, mathematical logic, information theory, and systems theory, offering a paradigm shift for understanding the fundamental nature of emergence, phase transition, and structural closure.\n\nIntended for interdisciplinary researchers in physics, mathematics, systems science, cognitive science, and beyond, this work defines the universal conditions under which all scientific phenomena collapse, converge, and return—providing a new law for the evolution and closure of recursive structures throughout science.",

          "abstract": "Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and is one of the most devastating, complex, and perplexing of all human behaviors. Unfortunately, despite centuries of scientific and scholarly inquiry, suicidal thoughts and behaviors remain exceedingly difficult to understand, predict, and prevent. Fortunately, recent advances in mathematical, computational, and digital methods are providing new opportunities to capture and model the immense complexity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In this paper, we first provide a brief review of existing literature and then identify four priorities for future research, including: 1) rigorous conceptual and descriptive research, 2) formal theory development and refinement, 3) measurement in context and over time, and 4) prediction of group- and individual-level suicide risk. Finally, we discuss cross-cutting considerations related to ethical dilemmas, enhancing diversity, and training the next generation of scientists. Together, these future directions offer an actionable agenda to guide the future of suicide research and make meaningful progress towards reducing its global burden.",

          "abstract": "The goals of animal advocacy organizations have the potential to benefit animals, as well as public health, environmental outcomes, and livelihoods, leading many to believe that increased cooperation between social movements may increase their impact. For example, research has found that environmental supporters are more likely to take pro-animal actions than those unconcerned (Faunalytics, 2023). Southeast Asia, however, a critical region for farmed animal advocacy, lacks comparable research to support this kind of alignment. This scoping study explores social movements in six Southeast Asian countries — Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam — selected for their large human and animal populations and economic significance. Through literature review, informal discussions with local researchers, social media content analysis, and interviews with senior staff at environmental and human development organizations, we present key findings for helping farmed animal advocates strategize future collaborations with other movements. Our findings give direction on how to approach other movements, and how their goals may overlap. Additionally, we provide a country-by-country analysis to give more specifically tailored advice, depending on the country of interest. This report will help support animal advocacy throughout the region as well as help researchers think of future research projects designed to make advocacy and collaboration in Southeast Asia easier.",

          "abstract": "Home to over 9 billion farmed land animals, diverse religions, and a myriad of languages and cultural contexts to navigate, Southeast Asia is a crucial but difficult region in which to create positive impact for animals — especially in regards to plant-based diet change.

By analyzing social media comments to better understand audience beliefs, this study examines their sources of influence and pinpoints which messages may influence and resonate best with consumers when it comes to plant-based diets and products. These findings present a key opportunity for advocates to better understand how this crucial region views plant-based diets and products — more importantly, it demonstrates how they can finetune their strategies to maximize positive impact for animals.",

          "abstract": "When masked by competing speech, utterances are more intelligible when spoken by a familiar voice than by a novel one. If familiar voices are less cognitively demanding to perceive, a concurrent task, which consumes resources, should disrupt perception of speech less if the attended voice is familiar. Furthermore, if the intelligibility benefit occurs because listening to a familiar voice is less cognitively demanding, then the concurrent task should reduce the familiar voice benefit.  Participants (N=30) heard two concurrent closed-set sentences in two different voices (familiar-novel or novel-novel) and reported the content of one (target) while ignoring the other (masker). Simultaneously, participants tracked the location of four moving dots on a screen (multiple object tracking, dual task) or ignored the visual input (single task). Word report was highest when the target voice was familiar, lowest when the masker voice was familiar, and intermediate when both voices were novel. Concurrent MOT performance reduced intelligibility of the novel, more than the familiar, voice, but did not reduce the magnitude of the benefit, suggesting that familiar voices require fewer cognitive resources to process than unfamiliar ones but that this reduction may not directly facilitate the familiar-voice benefit.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness, on the Dynergic Theory of Consciousness (DTC), is not an emergent add-on but the natural expression of reality's relational fabric. DTC treats relations as ontologically primary: when five universal patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) synchronize within a substrate's binding window, a system experiences itself as a unified whole. Each substrate constructs distinct temporal realities: human cortex knits ~100 ms moments, plant networks weave seconds-long intervals, neuromorphic chips build microsecond temporal universes. Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS) quantifies this coordination, yielding testable predictions: 40-70% PTS drop under anesthesia, monotonic PTS gains as neuromorphic synchronization tightens, and correlation between PTS and behavioral flexibility across species. By revealing the hard problem as a category error of substance-first thinking, DTC reframes time itself as a product of relational coordination rather than a pre-existing container. If these predictions hold, consciousness will shift from biology's most stubborn mystery to physics' signature of self-organizing coherence.",

This study examined alignment between societal and psychological constructs by comparing concepts encoded in natural language to reported symptoms.  We used large language models (LLMs) to assess social consensus because they’re trained on ideas expressed in text by millions of individuals. Societal and psychological constructs were identified from a novel measure—new to LLMs and participants—covering 71 psychopathology dimensions. Psychological constructs were estimated by factor-analyzing self-reports (N=780). Multiple methods were used for societal constructs: 1) factor-analyzing item semantic embedding similarity from two LLMs, 2) grouping items with ChatGPT.  In results replicated across methods, societal constructs aligned with 77% of self-reported factors with 16 cases of misalignment suggesting constructs based on superficial symptom/behavior (dis)similarity rather than psychological mechanisms.  Findings indicate that although common knowledge of psychopathology is largely accurate, some symptoms/behaviors are misunderstood.",

          "authors": "Silvia Shiwei Zhou; Aidan G. Taylor; Amy Tuer; Selena Breithaupt; Si Pan; Jeffrey D. Wammes",
          "abstract": "During lectures, students’ attention often shifts away from the current content toward unrelated thoughts; a state described as mind wandering (MW). These states are frequent, and can interfere with learning, as measured by later tests. Interventions that incorporate interpolated or pre-lecture testing seem to refocus learners’ attention, but these effects may be transient. Here, we present a novel ‘concurrent’ testing approach, where strategically targeted questions are presented throughout the entire lecture, and test whether it can reduce MW, relative to pre-lecture testing. In our study, 298 undergraduate students watched a video lecture on introductory statistics. A previous dataset (Kane et al., 2017) had monitored MW during this lecture, allowing us to develop test questions targeting specific lecture segments that previously elicited high rates of MW. We also developed a complementary set of control questions targeting other lecture segments. Participants viewed the lecture, and the targeted (or control) tests were displayed either before the lecture or concurrently throughout the lecture. MW was assessed via thought probes presented after pseudo-randomly selected segments throughout the lecture. After the lecture, we measured comprehension using a final test. Our findings showed that concurrent testing reduced the incidence of MW more than pre-lecture testing alone, while also increasing the likelihood of thoughts that were directly on-task. This pattern was especially pronounced during segments explicitly targeted with test questions, reducing what should otherwise have been high rates of MW in these strategic moments. Concurrent testing, therefore, provides an effective strategy for enhancing attentional engagement during university lectures.",

          "abstract": "Delay Discounting (DD) refers to the tendency for behavioral consequences (rewards or punishers) to be devalued as they occur more remotely in the future. DD has become a fruitful model of impulsive behavior and thus there is growing interest in developing interventions that could reduce it. Delay Exposure (DE) training has shown promising results in rodents. It consists of rats pressing a lever to produce a cue stimulus for a 17.5 s interval, at the end of which a reinforcer is delivered (Renda et al., 2021). The present study aimed to address some limitations in DE research: extensive number of training sessions required (60 or more), exclusive use of group designs, and potential confounding maturation effects. Using a within-subjects design, a variation of DE and its standard control condition (Immediate Exposure-IE) were evaluated in DD of rats tested in adolescence and adulthood. All DE and IE standard aspects remained the same except that the delay cues and reinforcers were response independent due to equipment limitations that prevented the use of a third operandum. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were daily exposed to a delay-discounting task (DDT, Liley et al., 2019) until steady responding was obtained at late adolescence (starting postnatal week – PW– 14, Ghasemi et al., 2021) and early adulthood (PW 25-27). Eight of the 18 rats (Main group) continued daily DD assessment plus different experimental manipulations added to the DDT across six conditions. The remaining 10 rats were kept as a Waitlist control group (no DD assessment/treatment between PW 28-42). The first manipulation added to the DDT controlled the additional access to pellets and time spent in the operant chamber entailed in subsequent DE/IE conditions. This 60Pellets condition consisted of 1-hr pre-DDT-session response-independent access to the same number of reinforcers delivered during each session of the DE/IE manipulations (i.e., 60 pellets). The third and fifth conditions consisted of DE and IE (counterbalanced across half of the animals) with 60Pellets reversals interspersed between them (fourth and sixth conditions). Based on subjects’ performance during the first six conditions, a second control manipulation was introduced. This Wait condition entailed rats waiting in the operant chamber during the 60-min before the daily DDT session without operanda, delay cue, or pellets. All 18 rats, including waitlist, were exposed to a DDT retest during PW 43-49 (i.e., middle adulthood). Waitlist rats were then exposed to 60Pellets and DE conditions between PW 46-51. Unexpectedly, we found that exposure to the 60Pellets condition during early adulthood produced significant reductions in DD, with an average of 16 sessions needed to produce steady low DD. These rats maintained low DD levels throughout the remaining conditions of the experiment, regardless the manipulation, including DE/IE and two reversals to 60Pellets. DD of Waitlist rats did not change between early- and middle-adulthood tests separated by ~20 weeks, and not significantly decreased under 60Pellets and DE conditions. These preliminary and promising findings suggest early- but not middle-adulthood response-independent access to reinforcement reduces impulsive choice long-term with a relatively brief intervention. The specific contribution of response-independent DE/IE, extensive and repetitive DD assessment, and maturation on this effect is unclear. Further efforts aimed at reproducing these effects and identifying the processes involved are warranted.",

          "abstract": "Increasingly, people use language models for emotional support, and understanding the quality of that support is crucial. This project (N = 3,740) focused on one of the pillars of emotional support and the most researched emotion regulation strategies, called cognitive reappraisal, which is the ability to extract multiple meanings from an emotional situation and to choose a framing that reduces its emotional intensity. In a first conservative test, we compared trained humans and GPT-4's ability for reappraisal using made-up vignettes and third-party human raters (Study 1), showing that GPT-4 outperformed humans. In Study 2 we then investigated whether the gap was driven by effort or skill by incentivizing participants to produce better reappraisals, which led to increased time spent on reappraisals but did not decrease the gap between humans and GPT-4. To examine how the perception that support came from AI affected evaluations, in Study 3 we provided participants with an AI label of the source of reappraisal, which reduced their evaluation of the effectiveness of reappraisal, but GPT-4 was still considered more effective. In Study 4, to ensure that differences were sustained in real-time interactions, we had participants share negative emotional situations with either a human or GPT-4 and receive reappraisal, replicating GPT-4's superior performance compared to humans. We conducted language analysis to identify differences between humans and GPT’s reappraisals, finding differences in language complexity, which explain some differences in evaluation. These results help us understand the nature of emotional support by LLMs and how it compares to humans.",

          "abstract": "For decades, researchers have debated whether the magnitude of the Flynn Effect—intergenerational increases in mean IQ scores—varies across cognitive domains and subdomains, and whether the Flynn Effect reflects gains in general cognitive ability (g). We conducted a cross-domain, subtest-level investigation of the Flynn Effect across middle childhood and early adolescence (ages 7-15 years, N = 1187, 89% White, 9% Black, 52% female) in longitudinal cognitive ability data collected prospectively between 1957 and 1999 using three versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Results provided clear evidence of the Flynn Effect as both increases in mean IQ score across generational cohort and decreases in mean IQ across test versions. Flynn Effect magnitude differed substantially across domains and subtests. Performance IQ gains were larger than full-scale and verbal IQ gains in cohort-based analyses, but test version-based estimates showed an opposite pattern (VIQ &gt; FSIQ &gt; PIQ). Variance in Flynn Effect magnitude across subtests did not follow a discernible pattern. The strength of the Flynn Effect on individual subtests was not strictly proportional to each subtest’s g-loading, with performance IQ subtests showing larger increases than would be expected given their g-loadings and verbal subtests showing smaller-than-expected gains.",

          "abstract": "Languages differ in their rhythmic properties; for instance, English has higher temporal variability than Spanish. While listeners with stronger nonnative accents may better understand speech with corresponding accents, it remains unclear whether this general benefit relates to suprasegmental aspects and whether it extends to reduced cognitive load. As such, we examined how perceptual rhythmic ability, production rhythmic ability, and temporal variability in English speech production predict cognitive load during listening in L1 Spanish–L2 English bilinguals. Cognitive load was indexed via pupil size as participants listened to English sentences spoken with Spanish, American, and Mandarin accents. Overall, individuals with stronger rhythmic abilities exhibited greater cognitive load when processing L2 English, whose rhythm diverges from Spanish, compared to those with weaker rhythmic skills. Notably, for perceptual rhythmic ability, this difference was reduced in the American-accented English condition, suggesting that the rhythmic alignment between the accent and the target language facilitates processing.",

          "authors": "Chris Budhan",
          "abstract": "Carl Jung's theory of cognitive functions has been marginalized in academic psychology due largely to fundamental distortions introduced by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). This theoretical framework proposes a systematic rehabilitation of Jung's original insights through integration with contemporary neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and clinical practice.\n\nThe central argument demonstrates that MBTI's four-letter typing system, particularly the problematic Judging/Perceiving dimension, represents a theoretical corruption that obscures Jung's sophisticated eight-function framework. We argue that cognitive functions describe underlying information processing preferences that operate as the cognitive architecture generating surface-level behavioral traits measured by models like the Big Five.\n\nThis rehabilitation effort advances three key contributions: First, a critique of current assessment methods reveals the \"self-report paradox\"—accurate cognitive function assessment requires the very self-knowledge the theory aims to develop. We propose integrated assessment combining neuroimaging, performance-based evaluation, and AI-powered behavioral analysis. \n\nSecond, we introduce an \"inverted shadow\" model wherein each conscious cognitive function corresponds to a specific unconscious counterpart with opposite content and orientation, providing systematic predictions for psychological development and clinical presentation. Third, we demonstrate applications across domains including psychiatric subtyping (showing how conditions like borderline personality disorder manifest differently across cognitive types), AI personality design, and aesthetic analysis.\n\nThe framework suggests that psychiatric conditions show cognitive function-related variants requiring personalized treatment approaches, while AI systems could achieve more effective human-computer interaction through cognitive function recognition and adaptation. Empirical validation opportunities include neuroimaging studies of function-specific brain networks, longitudinal developmental research, and treatment outcome studies comparing matched versus mismatched therapeutic approaches.\n\nThis rehabilitation positions cognitive function theory as a complement to, rather than competitor with, existing personality frameworks, offering unique insights into individual differences that could enhance psychological science, clinical practice, and technological design.",

          "abstract": "Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and is one of the most devastating, complex, and perplexing of all human behaviors. Unfortunately, despite centuries of scientific and scholarly inquiry, suicidal thoughts and behaviors remain exceedingly difficult to understand, predict, and prevent. Fortunately, recent advances in mathematical, computational, and digital methods are providing new opportunities to capture and model the immense complexity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In this paper, we first provide a brief review of existing literature and then identify four priorities for future research, including: 1) rigorous conceptual and descriptive research, 2) formal theory development and refinement, 3) measurement in context and over time, and 4) prediction of group- and individual-level suicide risk. Finally, we discuss cross-cutting considerations related to ethical dilemmas, enhancing diversity, and training the next generation of scientists. Together, these future directions offer an actionable agenda to guide the future of suicide research and make meaningful progress towards reducing its global burden.",

          "abstract": "Self-control—the ability to pursue long-term goals over short-term temptations—is a critical faculty of human cognition, but the cognitive processes enabling self-control are not well understood. Traditional models have focused on impulse inhibition: effortfully inhibiting prepotent motor responses towards a temptation, yielding a stage-based evolution of choice. Other models emphasize dynamic competition between goal and temptation, yielding a more integrative evolution of choice. Although these models represent fundamentally different conceptions of self-control, current methods are inadequate for investigating real-time dynamics, leaving the question of which model best describes self-control unresolved. We investigate these models using mouse-tracking: a dynamic, real-time measure of decision-making in which we measure participants’ computer mouse movements as they navigate tradeoffs between immediate and delayed gratification (e.g., $5 today vs. $20 in 3 months). We develop a novel quantitative approach that integrates the rich spatial and temporal information contained in mouse trajectories, and find evidence for both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. Notably, impulse inhibition is less frequent, occurring in only one-quarter of choices favoring larger later rewards over smaller sooner ones. We further find substantial individual variability on who relies on impulse inhibition, with more present-biased individuals more likely to use impulse inhibition to choose larger-later options. Finally, our approach reveals the diverse variability within impulse inhibition and dynamic competition, and accounting for this variability greatly strengthened models predicting out-of-sample choices. Our findings clarify the mechanisms underlying self-control and introduce a robust tool for quantifying real-time decision-making dynamics.",

          "abstract": "People are generally faster to respond to smaller numbers with a left-sided response and larger numbers with a right-sided response. The SNARC (spatial-numerical association of response codes) effect has been reported for a range of tasks for symbolic representations of number (e.g., digits). However, the evidence for SNARC effects for non-symbolic representations of number (i.e., quantities of objects) is mixed and usually restricted to tasks where numerical properties are relevant. Here, we report six studies where participants made color decisions to circles. We manipulated the stimuli so that displays formed symbolic patterns (i.e., dice-like arrangements, Experiments 1 and 2), canonical but non-symbolic patterns (i.e., symmetrical arrangements, Experiments 3 and 4), or non-symbolic and non-canonical patterns (i.e., scattered arrangements, Experiments 5 and 6). We additionally manipulated whether aggregate surface area was controlled and whether individual elements within displays remained constant in size across the experiment. The SNARC effect was present when (1) circles were arranged in a symbolic manner, or (2) aggregate surface area increased congruently with quantity. The effect of aggregate surface area was not restricted to conditions where individual circles were a consistent size across the different stimuli, suggesting that the visual cue of aggregate surface area was more important than the sense that individual stimulus items were identical across the experiment. Our results are consistent with the view that non-symbolic quantities offer a route to magnitude and its spatial representations, but that this may be modulated by the consistency of high- and low-level visual cues to magnitude.",

Yet, it remains unclear whether MRI-derived markers of white matter microstructure generalize across tracts to support latent modeling approaches. Here, we derived measurement models for markers of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA), neurite density (intra-neurite volume fraction, INVF), and myelin content (magnetization transfer ratio, MTR) across 52 tracts (HCP-1065 atlas) grouped into ten functional clusters, using data from two independent samples (N = 150, age range 20−74 years, Dortmund Vital Study, Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05155397; N = 215, age range 18−40 years, Mainz Network Study). Confirmatory factor analyses consistently favored hierarchical bifactor models, capturing both a general factor per marker and orthogonal hemisphere-specific factors, independent of participants’ age and sample. Fluid intelligence, assessed with Raven’s Progressive Matrices 2, was significantly predicted by general factors of FA (𝛽 = 0.46, 𝑝 &lt; .001) and MTR (𝛽 = 0.20, 𝑝 = .021) in the Dortmund sample, but not in the Mainz sample (here measured with Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices).

We answer this question measuring partisans' affective reactions to images of US politicians with self-reports and physiological indicators of valence and arousal. Our results show that partisans do not display reliable visceral reactions to images of politicians, even though they report feeling more negatively about out-party politicians than in-party politicians. This disconnect between non-conscious physiological responses and conscious self-reports is consistent with constructivist theories of affect as well as canonical models of partisanship.

Each substrate constructs distinct temporal realities: human cortex knits ~100 ms moments, plant networks weave seconds-long intervals, neuromorphic chips build microsecond temporal universes. Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS) quantifies this coordination, yielding testable predictions: 40-70% PTS drop under anesthesia, monotonic PTS gains as neuromorphic synchronization tightens, and correlation between PTS and behavioral flexibility across species. By revealing the hard problem as a category error of substance-first thinking, DTC reframes time itself as a product of relational coordination rather than a pre-existing container. If these predictions hold, consciousness will shift from biology's most stubborn mystery to physics' signature of self-organizing coherence.",

          "title": "Quantum Resonance: Consciousness, Complexity, and the Harmonic Dimension",
          "authors": "Chris Budhan",
          "abstract": "This investigation proposes a speculative theoretical framework for consciousness studies that positions awareness as a fundamental dimension of reality rather than an emergent property of neural complexity. Drawing from panpsychist philosophy, quantum biology research, and empirical observations of musical coordination phenomena, we develop a \"consciousness field theory\" suggesting that individual awareness represents localized access to dimensional consciousness fields through quantum interface mechanisms and harmonic resonance principles.\n\nMethodological Approach: We systematically distinguish between four categories of claims: (1) empirically established observations, (2) philosophical speculation extending beyond current evidence, (3) metaphorical illustrations for conceptual exploration, and (4) testable hypotheses generating specific research predictions. This framework enables rigorous exploration of speculative possibilities while maintaining scientific integrity and acknowledging conventional explanations.\n\nKey Theoretical Components: The framework proposes that consciousness operates through dimensional coupling mechanisms enabling biological systems to interface with consciousness fields via quantum coherence in neural microtubules, harmonic optimization through mathematical frequency relationships, and collective consciousness coordination during musical improvisation and group activities. We emphasize that conventional neuroscientific explanations may adequately account for observed phenomena without requiring consciousness field mechanisms.\n\nEmpirical Research Directions: The framework generates testable predictions including gamma wave synchronization during jazz ensemble performance, enhanced neural coherence during just intonation versus equal temperament exposure, correlation between microtubule quantum coherence and anesthetic sensitivity, and measurable consciousness quality improvements in harmonically optimized acoustic environments.\n\nPractical Applications: Consciousness field principles suggest potential enhancements to music therapy, educational curricula, and therapeutic technologies while building upon established practices. All applications emphasize integration with conventional treatments rather than replacement, requiring rigorous empirical validation and professional supervision.\n\nCritical Limitations: The framework remains highly speculative, extending far beyond current empirical foundation. Proposed mechanisms lack direct experimental validation, and alternative explanations through conventional neuroscience, psychology, and cultural conditioning may prove sufficient. The primary value lies in generating novel research directions and methodological approaches rather than claiming empirical validity.\n\nContribution: This investigation demonstrates methodology for responsible speculative research in consciousness studies, showing how theoretical creativity can be pursued while maintaining scientific standards, acknowledging limitations, and respecting established knowledge. The framework offers conceptual tools for consciousness exploration regardless of specific theoretical validation, potentially advancing both empirical investigation and philosophical understanding of awareness.\n\nSignificance: Beyond specific theoretical claims, this work establishes methodological standards for consciousness field research that prioritize testable predictions, balanced argumentation, ethical application, and clear distinction between empirical evidence and speculative possibility. The approach serves as a model for how consciousness studies can explore fundamental questions while maintaining scientific integrity and intellectual humility.",

          "abstract": "Detection of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated texts is crucial in education for several reasons. This study provides direct evidence from university professors’ experiences regarding the key features they use to identify AI-generated writing and ranks these features based on their perceived importance. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, online interviews were used to extract the most salient features that help professors detect AI-generated texts. In the second phase, an online survey asked professors to rate the likelihood that each identified feature contributes to successful AI text detection. The findings revealed that professors consider the absence of language errors, complex syntax and phrasing, use of difficult vocabulary, presence of hallucinated content, fabrication of nonexistent sources, repetition of words or phrases, and distinctive text structure as potential indicators of AI-generated text. Among these, hallucinations, fabrication of sources, and the absence of language errors were rated as the strongest cues for detection, while difficult vocabulary was seen as the least reliable indicator. These results have important pedagogical implications since they can inform the development of more effective detection tools, and guide the design of academic integrity policies and instructional strategies to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a dynamic systems-based account of human cultural development, grounded in a process-relational worldview. In contrast to mechanistic approaches that treat culture as an external influence, this framework conceptualizes culture and development as inseparable, co-constituting processes unfolding across situational, ontogenetic, and sociocultural levels. Drawing on a real-life infant–caregiver interaction as a “slice of life” example, we illustrate how routines emerge and stabilize through self-organization, and how historical and material-cultural aspects afford and constrain developmental trajectories. We apply key concepts from the dynamic systems approach—including emergence, self-organization, attractor stabilization, circular causality, and historical constraint—to explain human cultural development. The emergent structures of processes are treated as a formal causes, and we adopt an explanatory pluralism. Inspired by the work of Vygotsky, Rogoff, and dynamic systems theorists, the proposed perspective serves as a thinking tool for systematising and advancing integrative, process-oriented explanations of human cultural development.",

          "authors": "Chris Budhan",
          "abstract": "Background: Atypical depression affects 15-30% of major depressive episodes, demonstrating poor response to SSRIs (20-40% response rates) compared to MAOIs (60-80%). A specific subset of individuals with atypical depression presents with high sensory processing sensitivity, histories of chronic social invalidation, and personality features resembling internalized borderline presentations, creating diagnostic confusion and treatment resistance that may affect up to 5-10% of treatment-seeking populations.\n\nTheoretical Framework: We propose a testable neurobiological pathway wherein chronic social defeat in temperamentally sensitive individuals triggers inflammatory cascades and dopaminergic suppression, manifesting as both atypical depression symptoms and apparent personality dysfunction. This framework integrates established animal social defeat models, emerging human neuroinflammation research, and validated temperament studies to explain treatment resistance patterns.\n\nModel Components: The framework synthesizes converging evidence: robust animal social defeat paradigms demonstrate inflammation-dopamine dysfunction links; human neuroinflammation studies show associations with depression subtypes (effect sizes d = 0.25-0.50); sensory processing sensitivity represents a validated, heritable trait (h² = 0.47) affecting environmental responsiveness; clinical observations document complex presentations requiring systematic study.\n\nHypothesized Mechanisms: Proposed pathway involves social defeat → inflammatory activation (predicted IL-6 &gt; 2.5 pg/mL, CRP &gt; 3.0 mg/L) → dopaminergic suppression in reward circuits → characteristic symptoms (mood reactivity, hypersomnia, rejection sensitivity) plus adaptive behavioral strategies that may appear as personality pathology.\n\nClinical Implications: If validated, this model suggests apparent personality dysfunction may represent neurobiologically constrained adaptations rather than primary characterological pathology. Treatment implications include prioritizing anti-inflammatory and dopaminergic interventions over serotonergic approaches, addressing social defeat through trauma-informed modalities, and modifying environments to support sensitive temperaments.\n\nCritical Limitations: This framework represents theoretical synthesis requiring empirical validation. No longitudinal studies have confirmed the proposed developmental pathway. Treatment recommendations extrapolate from general research rather than studies of the target population. The model may explain only a subset of atypical depression presentations through one of multiple possible pathways.\n\nTestable Predictions: Specific falsifiable hypotheses include: distinctive inflammatory signatures in the described population; superior response to dopaminergic versus serotonergic agents (predicted effect size difference d &gt; 0.50); correlation between social defeat severity and treatment resistance; interaction effects between sensitivity and environmental factors in predicting syndrome development.\n\nResearch Priority: Systematic empirical testing must precede clinical implementation. The framework's value lies in generating specific hypotheses for prospective validation rather than guiding immediate practice. Future studies should examine biomarker patterns, treatment responses, and developmental pathways in this theoretically defined population.",

          "abstract": "From early toddlerhood, children distinguish between respect-based power exerted by a leader and fear-based power exerted by a bully. Here, we tested if and from what age children rely on this ability to allocate their epistemic trust. Children aged 1.5 to 10 years (n = 337) were presented with a leader-character and a bully-character who both used the same novel word (“zaffo”) to label each a different novel object. Next, children were asked to select the zaffo. Results revealed that toddlers trusted the bully-character (i.e., when asked to select the zaffo from a number of objects, they tended to pick up and pass the object labeled as zaffo by the bully-character). At 3 years the opposite tendency emerged (i.e., children tended to select the object previously labeled as zaffo by the leader-character) and it is not until the age of 8 years that children also displayed a clear distrust for bullies (i.e., only a handful of children selected the object labeled as zaffo by the bully-character). These results show that early in life learning is affected by the type of social power displayed by informants and that an adult-like tendency to selectively learn from respected leaders emerges gradually after an initial shift.",

          "abstract": "Despite its pervasive presence in the general population, mental fatigue remains difficult to tackle from a scientific point of view. A promising framework consists of conceptualizing fatigue and fatigue recovery as a dynamic process resulting from effortful cognitive activities and rest periods, which in turn affects motivated behavior. The brain mechanisms underlying fatigue recovery during rest and its prolonged effects are, however, not fully elucidated. In this study, 19 healthy young adults completed two versions of a dual-task paradigm varying with difficulty level. The presence of mental fatigue was characterized through effort and motivation perception, and task performance (d’ and response bias indices from the signal detection theory). Participants further completed resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during the recovery period following the tasks to assess how the functional connectivity of the brain was affected by the mental state induced by each task version. First, behavioral analyses showed that, compared with the easy condition, participants in the difficult task condition reported greater changes in effort perception and reduced motivation, indicative of a heightened mental fatigue state. This motivational decline was further associated with a more conservative response bias. Second, neuroimaging results showed reduced connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right anterior supramarginal gyrus following the difficult vs. easy condition, with lower connectivity values associated with heightened effort perception. These findings underscore the interplay between fatigue, effort, and motivation, and suggest that persistent alterations in brain connectivity at rest may underlie the extended timescales of fatigue recovery.",

          "abstract": "When defining concepts for scientific work, researchers consider various desiderata (desired characteristics) that are derived from higher level meta-desiderata regarding accepted goals of scientific work and how to act towards achieving them. Although these desiderata are often implicit, they significantly impact researchers' processes of defining and selecting concepts, ultimately influencing research outcomes, communication, and knowledge production. We evaluate the selection and application of desiderata for defining cross-disciplinary concepts dependent upon higher level meta-desiderata working from the example that if one believes that science ought to strive for providing systematic knowledge about the world (level 1), and if one believes that the ease of communication will positively affect the process of attaining that kind of knowledge (level 2), then one ought to strive for definitions of concepts that provide as much as possible of the list of features we argue for (level 3). Using psychological concepts as our examples we offer a proposed list of six desiderata: precision, specificity, theory-neutrality, explanation- neutrality, operational ease, folk-level understanding. The goal is to facilitate researchers' consideration of appropriate desiderata and, where their meta-desiderata match the example provided, promote the adoption and utilization of these desiderata in their work. Given the backdrop of conceptual change and conceptual creep, this aspect, though less discussed, plays a crucial role in shaping our research and knowledge production.",

          "abstract": "The relationships between workplace stressors and psychological strain are typically operationalized in two pathways—stressor and strain effects. We examine the temporal dynamics from workload-to-exhaustion (stressor effect) and exhaustion-to-workload (strain effect). Studies examining these phenomena exhibit heterogeneity in effect size and direction. We argue this arises from differences in longitudinal measurement frequency, inconsistent separation of within-person and aggregate-level temporal dynamics, and ambiguities in theoretical models. In the current study, we aim to develop more robust empirical inferences and theoretical explanations by focusing on individual-level dynamics of workload and exhaustion at fine-grained timescales and by examining between-person heterogeneity in these dynamics. We measured emotional exhaustion and workload in a sample of professionals (n = 160) working under hybrid work arrangements, across one year (15 longitudinal assessments). Reciprocal and autoregressive dynamics for each individual were modelled with a hierarchical continuous time dynamic structural equation model. This revealed strong evidence for a negative exhaustion-to-workload effect consistent across individuals, indicating higher exhaustion resulted in lower subsequent workload, peaking approximately 1 month. Conversely, we did not find support for a population-level workload-to-exhaustion cross-effect, with significant between-person heterogeneity in strength and direction of this effect. Follow-up moderations focusing on affective commitment, work-related needs-satisfaction, and supervisory monitoring were examined for both pathways, and indicated individuals with better work design tended to have better stress-related outcomes. Our study suggests a hitherto neglected process in work stress research: exhausted individuals tend to withdraw their effort to lower their workload, especially if they have other resources such as positive work designs.",

Parenthood is often thought to have adverse consequences across multiple cognitive domains, such as memory, a phenomenon known colloquially as ‘baby brain’. Evidence supporting an objective cognitive decline in the postpartum period is unconvincing, and it is unknown whether fathers experience similar changes in cognitive function. Here we examine cognitive differences in birthgiving mothers and non-birthgiving fathers up to two years postpartum. Four hundred participants (300 parents and 100 non-parents) completed a cognitive battery assessing executive function, working and episodic memory, processing speed and subjective memory. Parents showed similar performance to non-parent controls on all objective cognition measures, and we found evidence for no differences in cognitive performance between mothers and fathers, suggesting the absence of so-called “baby brain” effects. Significant group differences in subjective memory were driven by a self-promotion bias, where male non-fathers reported better subjective memory than all other groups. A commonly shown phenomenon in males, this self-promotion bias appeared to be lost in fathers, an effect driven by lack of sleep. Strikingly, there was no effect of time postpartum on any cognitive measure. Therefore, these results challenge the societal ‘baby brain’ stereotype, and provide a new foundation to support family units together irrespective of birth-giving status.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Relative Theory of Self-Construction (RTSC), a structural model of consciousness grounded in the axiom that “the boundary between self and other is absolute.” Based on this premise, RTSC posits that the human mind comprises two concurrent, independent mental systems: the Existential Mental World (W₁), which reflects the internal soul and generates cognition, emotion, and volition toward self-growth; and the Relational Mental World (W₂), which recognizes others as equally souled and generates responses based on relational contexts.\nThese systems do not directly exchange information. Instead, their outputs are superimposed with weighting coefficients α and β to produce consciousness S, expressed as:\n　　　S=αW_1+βW_2\nThis formulation describes the momentary state of consciousness as the interference of two qualitatively distinct domains. Furthermore, W₁ and W₂ form a feedback loop with S, allowing for temporal updating. The dynamic evolution of this process is captured by the recursive formulation:\nOhba’s Consciousness Equation:\n　　　S_(t+1)=αW_1 (S_t,L_t)+βW_2 (S_t,L_t)\nwhere Lₜ denotes input from the external environment.\nRTSC reframes psychological distress not as deficit but as interference imbalance, and reconceptualizes personality as the evolving structure of orientation between two mental worlds. In artificial intelligence, RTSC offers a framework in which consciousness arises from non-integrated generative systems, where inconsistency and conflict are not flaws but essential features. RTSC thus provides a formal model of consciousness that avoids recursive meta-structures, distinguishes mind from consciousness, and reframes artificial subjectivity as a product of dual-world interference.",

We model the task as a hierarchical\ncombination of local subgoals (e.g., when and where to pass people) and a global goal (which\ngate to navigate toward). Although eye movements are difficult to analyze in such a dynamic\ntask, they prove to be particularly revealing about how participants combined these local and\nglobal goals efficiently in real time. Overall, the results suggest that adults are experts at\nsocial navigational tasks, rapidly deploying a flexible combination of local and global decision\nstrategies to navigate crowded environments efficiently.",

This study examined alignment between societal and psychological constructs by comparing concepts encoded in natural language to reported symptoms.  We used large language models (LLMs) to assess social consensus because they’re trained on ideas expressed in text by millions of individuals. Societal and psychological constructs were identified from a novel measure—new to LLMs and participants—covering 71 psychopathology dimensions. Psychological constructs were estimated by factor-analyzing self-reports (N=780). Multiple methods were used for societal constructs: 1) factor-analyzing item semantic embedding similarity from two LLMs, 2) grouping items with ChatGPT.  In results replicated across methods, societal constructs aligned with 77% of self-reported factors with 16 cases of misalignment suggesting constructs based on superficial symptom/behavior (dis)similarity rather than psychological mechanisms.  Findings indicate that although common knowledge of psychopathology is largely accurate, some symptoms/behaviors are misunderstood.",

          "abstract": "Mood-congruent memory (MCM) is a well-established phenomenon that occurs when emotional memory is biased towards content affectively congruent with a past or current mood. To date, however, a majority of research in this area has examined how mood directly impacts the encoding or retrieval of emotional memories, with comparatively less work examining the offline effects of mood during early consolidation. To address this gap in the literature, here we induced happy and sad moods after participants encoded emotional stimuli, and then tested memory at least a day later with both recall and recognition tests. Across multiple experiments using different stimuli, induction techniques, and memory tasks, we demonstrate that a change in post-encoding mood is associated with mood-congruent shifts in memory for the affective tone of an emotional experience, while also boosting recognition accuracy for mood-congruent stimuli. These effects were moderated by subjective arousal and self-relevance ratings of the stimuli at encoding, suggesting that phenomenological appraisals of a stimulus shape the influence of mood during consolidation. Our findings propose that MCM can arise from mood states dissociated from the initial encoding or subsequent retrieval of emotional material, such that mood retroactively facilitates MCM even after an emotional experience has already occurred.",

In line with the hypotheses, both system-justifying worldviews (e.g., authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and system-challenging worldviews (e.g., need for chaos and prejudice against the rich and powerful) were robustly associated with antidemocratic attitudes adjusting for other predictors and demographic variables—and these associations were mediated by perceived illegitimacy of the democratic system. Several system-orthogonal aspects of worldviews, including a simplistic epistemology (e.g., lack of actively open-minded thinking) and misperceptions of antidemocratic attitudes among political opponents, also robustly predicted antidemocratic attitudes, while political prejudice, societal malcontent, and perceived superiority or the self and ingroup showed less robust effects. At a more specific level, the strongest predictors of support for democratic elections, censorship, political violence, and denying groups their rights were actively open-minded thinking, authoritarianism, need for chaos, and social dominance orientation, respectively. Taken together, the results contribute to a more unified and nuanced understanding of the psychological underpinnings of antidemocratic attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Emerging single-process propositional perspectives in psychology and philosophy have introduced the key idea that, much like their explicit (deliberately retrieved) counterparts, implicit (automatically retrieved) attitudes should be sensitive to logical operations such as negation. In the present project, we subject this idea to a particularly stringent test by probing not only whether the formation of implicit attitudes is sensitive to negation but also whether such sensitivity additionally reflects the distinction between easy-to-negate bipolar adjectives (those with clear antonyms, e.g., strong) and difficult-to-negate unipolar adjectives (those without clear antonyms, e.g., unique). Across four experiments (three preregistered; total N = 6,707), we found (a) no significant difference in the formation of implicit attitudes in response to affirmed bipolar versus affirmed unipolar adjectives (β = 0.07); (b) modulation of the formation of implicit attitudes by whether adjectives were affirmed or negated (β = 0.67); and, critically, (c) stronger modulation of the formation of implicit attitudes by the negation of bipolar relative to unipolar adjectives (β = 0.23). These results generalized across three sets of adjectives, two implicit attitude measures (the Implicit Association Test and the Affect Misattribution Procedure), and two novel targets (social and nonsocial). Together, these data provide strong evidence to suggest that the formation of implicit attitudes is sensitive to logical operations, including not only whether an adjective is affirmed or negated but even whether adjectives are relatively easy or difficult to negate. We discuss theoretical implications for single-process and dual-process accounts of attitude formation and higher-order human cognition.",

Unfortunately, despite centuries of scientific and scholarly inquiry, suicidal thoughts and behaviors remain exceedingly difficult to understand, predict, and prevent. Fortunately, recent advances in mathematical, computational, and digital methods are providing new opportunities to capture and model the immense complexity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In this paper, we first provide a brief review of existing literature and then identify four priorities for future research, including: 1) rigorous conceptual and descriptive research, 2) formal theory development and refinement, 3) measurement in context and over time, and 4) prediction of group- and individual-level suicide risk. Finally, we discuss cross-cutting considerations related to ethical dilemmas, enhancing diversity, and training the next generation of scientists. Together, these future directions offer an actionable agenda to guide the future of suicide research and make meaningful progress towards reducing its global burden.",

          "abstract": "Why are people drawn to stories that evoke fear? The paradox of horror, which refers to our fascination with frightening narratives despite their negative emotional content, has received a compelling explanation from evolutionary science: humans are attuned to threat-related information because it carries adaptive value. In this work, we extended that framework by identifying a key structural condition that elicits fear in fiction: protagonist vulnerability. We introduced the Protagonist Vulnerability Index (PVI), a computational measure of the formidability imbalance between protagonists and antagonists, and applied it to 691 films. We showed that horror films systematically feature weaker protagonists, stronger antagonists, more persistent threats, and more hostile environments. We also demonstrated that PVI reliably distinguishes horror from other genres, predicts fear-related keywords in non-horror films, and correlates with physiological fear responses as measured by heart rate. By linking PVI scores to psychological and demographic data from more than 3.5 million individuals on Facebook, we found that a preference for high-PVI films is associated with lower agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, and with higher openness. We also found that openness moderates the negative association between neuroticism and fear-related content, suggesting that curiosity can override threat avoidance in anxious individuals. These findings clarify the narrative conditions that activate evolved threat-management systems and provide a framework for predicting and potentially engineering fear in fiction.",

We explore the intersections of psychological and sociological research, as well as care practices, in dementia scholarship and how these have evolved in the years leading to and proceeding the start of the 21st century. Focusing on historical discourses of dementia and the metaphor of dementia as a ‘living death’, this essay maps the development of prominent conceptualisations of dementia in western cultures, from their roots in Cartesian philosophy to modernist values and existential anxieties. We firstly explore historical notions of selfhood in people living with dementia and the presumed erosion of the self that culminates in a so-called living death. Then, we discuss the radical shift in attitudes that arose around the start of the 21st century towards perseverance of selfhood in dementia and person-centred care. We finally consider whether our current understanding of selfhood in dementia could benefit from a posthuman approach, which requires a radical shift towards a more relational, multiple, and ultimately affirmative ways of caring for dementia.",

In Study 1 (N=1130 U.S. adults), participants were more likely to consider a claim false when its imprecision was consequential. Study 2 (N=880 U.S. adults) replicated this finding in a within-subjects design. Study 3 (N=400 U.S. adults), a registered report study, employs a game with real stakes for participants to test whether truth evaluations depend on how good or bad the consequences of a claim’s imprecision are.

          "abstract": "This paper proposes that foundational principles from theoretical neuroscience - predictive coding, the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and variational inference - offer a biologically grounded framework for artificial general intelligence (AGI). These approaches characterise the brain as a hierarchical inference system that continuously updates beliefs and selects actions to minimise uncertainty and surprise. In contrast to conventional AI systems, which typically rely on static architectures and offline training, biological agents engage in active, generative inference within dynamic, uncertain environments. We argue that it is this inference-based architecture - not just its behavioural outputs - that underpins the adaptability, generalisation, and resilience of natural intelligence. We outline a neuro-inspired computational framework built on hierarchical generative models, scalable variational inference (e.g., Variational Laplace), and Active Inference. Finally, we contrast this approach with dominant deep learning paradigms and discuss its implications for building interpretable, adaptive, and autonomous machine intelligence.",

          "authors": "Takao Nakai",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive psychological framework for understanding \nand sustaining motivation, defined as the maintenance and enhancement of mental \nproactiveness necessary for both achieving mid-to-long-term goals and engaging in \ndaily responsibilities. Drawing upon fundamental human tendencies—namely, pain \navoidance and effort minimization—motivation emerges when perceived rewards \noutweigh perceived costs. This active inclination is crucially underpinned by an \nindividual's \"mental and physical vitality\". \nWe identify common inhibitors of motivation, including lack of knowledge, \ndependency, unrealistic optimism, contradictory desires, unforeseen difficulties, and \nmental or physical fatigue. It is crucial to recognize that declines in motivation are a \nnormal occurrence. Central to overcoming these is a foundation of vitality—mental \nand physical well-being—which enables individuals to manage stress and sustain \neffort. We also propose habits to reinforce motivation, such as continual reward-cost \nevaluation, broadening the perception of rewards, cost-reduction strategies, and \nrepeated self-questioning to clarify authentic desires. \nImportantly, we argue that the ultimate goal is not merely to sustain motivation, but to \narrive at meaningful conclusions—including the conscious choice to disengage when \nappropriate. Abandonment, when intentional and well-reasoned, is a valid strategy \nthat frees mental bandwidth, reduces stress, and allows for resource reallocation to \nmore promising or fulfilling objectives. Finally, we propose that a form of lasting \nmotivation can be cultivated by embracing lifelong, \"never-ending goals\" that foster \ngrowth, meaning, and sustained engagement, transcending the dissipation of \nmotivation that often follows the achievement of specific goals.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering (MW) is a common mental phenomenon where attention shifts spontaneously from an external task to internal trains of thought. Recent studies propose that non-invasive brain stimulation methods hold potential for influencing attentional shifts between on-task and MW states. Exploratory analysis from a recent repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) study reported that targeting the left angular gyrus (AG) with inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) reduced MW compared to sham stimulation, without affecting executive performance (Drevland et al., 2024). The present study is a pre-registered, direct replication of the study by Drevland et al., but also expands their protocol by applying excitatory intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the same cortical area. Using a triple-blind crossover design, healthy participants completed four blocks of the Finger-Tapping Random Sequence Generation Task (FT-RSGT) in three sessions on separate days. Each session included three rounds of either real (cTBS or iTBS) or sham stimulation in an accelerated rTMS design. We successfully replicated the effect of cTBS in reducing MW propensity but failed to find the expected increase in MW post-iTBS stimulation. Furthermore, based on a joint analysis of the current data and that from Drevland et al., we found compelling evidence for cTBS being efficient both in reducing MW and improving executive performance. Our results provide evidence for the causal relationship between the left AG and shifts of attention during an executive task, highlighting the role of the default mode network in the generation and maintenance of MW episodes.",

          "abstract": "When solving a problem with a clear goal, people often break down the problem into subgoals, a form of reasoning known as backward reasoning. The cognitive mechanisms of backward reasoning are poorly understood. Inspired by classic ideas from Newell and Simon, we conceptualize backward reasoning as search through a space of subgoals and actions to attain them. We show that this space can be represented by an AND-OR tree, a structure first used in early artificial intelligence research to automate problem solving. We hypothesize that, when solving problems with a clear goal, people reason backward by searching through AND-OR trees. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from two problem solving tasks: Tower of London and Rush Hour. We developed a psychologically plausible, single-parameter computational process model, which we fit to this data on a per-participant basis. We found that our model successfully captured key trends in the data, unlike alternative models. Our results elucidate the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human problem solving and open the door to a precise characterization of individual differences in problem solving.",

Across two studies on U.S. citizens, we examine whether news coverage of misinformation generates misperceptions and decreases levels of trust in information institutions (i.e., media, professors, and scientists) and whether its effects can be comparable to those of exposure to untrustworthy content. We rely on an online experiment using mock social media posts (Study 1, N = 1,670) and also on online behavioral tracking data paired with\nover-time survey self-reports (Study 2, N = 804). Study 1 finds that exposure to both actual misinformation and the coverage of misinformation increases misperceptions, but does not decrease trust. Study 2 presents evidence that behaviorally tracked visits to untrustworthy sites and exposure to news coverage of misinformation —although relatively rare — do not affect misperceptions, but both predict lower levels of trust in scientists, with less consistent effects for media and university\nprofessors.

In this research project we investigate responses to a flood risk label, that communicates flood risk using five different risk levels, on a scale from A (dark green) to E (red). Five hypothetical studies and a framed field experiment, show how this label affects homeowners’ threat appraisal, coping appraisal and ultimately willingness to implement and pay for flood protection measures. While our results suggest the potential of a flood risk label to motivate individual adaptation, balancing system and individual-level responsibility is crucial.",

          "abstract": "The PHQ-4 is an ultra-brief (4 items) screening questionnaire for depression and anxiety. In this\nbrief report, we test the benefits of adding one additional response option (“Once or twice”, in\nbetween “Not at all” and “Several days”) to improve the scale’s sensitivity to milder alterations,\nand thus increase its usefulness in subclinical populations. In study 1 (N=485), we provide\nevidence using Item Response Theory (IRT) that the new response option does improve the\nscale’s psychometric quality and extends the sensitivity to the measured constructs on the lower\nend of the spectrum. In study 2 (N=836), we show that the refined version offers an improved\nsensitivity to subclinical variability in depression (indexed by the BDI-II) as compared to the\noriginal version. In conclusion, adding the “once or twice” response option is a low-cost no-downsides way of increasing the PHQ-4’s sensitivity to subclinical variability, making it a tool\nof choice for general population research.",

          "abstract": "How do people mentally replay real-life events, and what shapes the time it takes to remember them? In this study, we investigated the temporal compression of memories by examining how long it takes participants to recall everyday events they recorded using wearable cameras. While remembering duration increased with the actual length of events, this relationship was nonlinear: recall duration rose steeply for events lasting up to ~10 min, then plateaued, suggesting scale-invariant retrieval beyond this threshold. Crucially, various event characteristics also influenced remembering duration, with events that were more unusual, unpredictable, emotionally positive, socially engaging, or marked by greater change showing less temporal compression. These effects were not explained by retrieval difficulty, but rather reflected the richness of memory representations, including greater detail and stronger sense of reliving. Together, these findings suggest that memory compression depends not only on the event’s actual duration, but also on how it was subjectively experienced and structured in memory. By linking event features to the tempo of recall, this study offers novel insight into the dynamics of episodic memory and the mechanisms that shape how we mentally replay real-life experiences",

In a preregistered between-subject experiment, third-year police students (N = 96) paired up to perform a field exercise of a simulated critical incident encounter. The pairs were randomized to receive “tactical breathing” instructions or to focus on standard operating procedures. Expert observers evaluated performance, and participants reported their level of stress. The preregistered analysis showed that stress was associated with lower performance. The pairs that used tactical breathing performed better than the control group. Tactical breathing was not associated with self-reported stress.

The results showed a small but non-significant pooled effect favoring GenAI. Initial analyses suggested greater originality in GenAI ideas, but sensitivity analysis showed this was driven by a few studies with very large effects. No significant differences were found between human ideas and those generated by prompting specific GenAI models (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4). Funnel plots and asymmetry tests indicated no evidence of publication bias, supporting the findings’ validity.

          "abstract": "Despite its pervasive presence in the general population, mental fatigue remains difficult to tackle from a scientific point of view. A promising framework consists of conceptualizing fatigue and fatigue recovery as a dynamic process resulting from effortful cognitive activities and rest periods, which in turn affects motivated behavior. The brain mechanisms underlying fatigue recovery during rest and its prolonged effects are, however, not fully elucidated. In this study, 19 healthy young adults completed two versions of a dual-task paradigm varying with difficulty level. The presence of mental fatigue was characterized through effort and motivation perception, and task performance (d’ and response bias indices from the signal detection theory). Participants further completed resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during the recovery period following the tasks to assess how the functional connectivity of the brain was affected by the mental state induced by each task version. First, behavioral analyses showed that, compared with the easy condition, participants in the difficult task condition reported greater changes in effort perception and reduced motivation, indicative of a heightened mental fatigue state. This motivational decline was further associated with a more conservative response bias. Second, neuroimaging results showed reduced connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right anterior supramarginal gyrus following the difficult vs. easy condition, with lower connectivity values associated with heightened effort perception. These findings underscore the interplay between fatigue, effort, and motivation, and suggest that persistent alterations in brain connectivity at rest may underlie the extended timescales of fatigue recovery.",

          "abstract": "Variations in mental imagery ability has been linked to various emotional, cognitive and personality measures. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework is missing to account for these associations and their link to mental health. Here, we present evidence for a model of mental imagery centered around a putative \"inwardly focused\" cognitive style, which integrates a range of traits associated with visual imagery. By examining the association between self-reported imagery vividness and a diverse array of cognitive and personality questionnaire measures, we demonstrate that imagery is significantly correlated with interoceptive awareness and mindful presence, as well as the personality traits of openness, conscientiousness and extraversion. Canonical correlation analyses revealed that we could link these measures to a singular latent variable, which we propose reflects a latent inward trait or \"inwardly focused\" cognitive style. Canonical variates were stable across two datasets (n=298 and n = 293). In addition, the latent inward trait was negatively correlated with alexithymia (the inability to identify and express emotions) and positively correlated with the frequency of involuntary autobiographical memories. To further examine these relationships, we constructed a latent measure of negative mental health using depression, stress and neuroticism items. A path analysis revealed that the latent inward trait mediated the effects between imagery vividness and negative mental health via alexithymia and involuntary autobiographical memories, suggesting that the latent inward trait plays a crucial role in shaping how mental imagery impacts mental health, notably as it intersects with other important individual cognitive differences.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety has been linked to increased generalisation of threat expectations to perceptually similar stimuli. Such generalisation can arise either from a failure to distinguish threatening from non-threatening stimuli (perceptual mechanism) or from the transfer of learned values between stimuli (value-based mechanism). Yet, how these mechanisms contribute to generalisation remains unclear.  Here we assess how participants (n = 140) generalise outcome expectancies to perceptually similar stimuli, using personalised stimulus spaces. We show that perceptual and value-based contributions to generalisation can be dissociated based on response distributions. Our computational modelling results indicate that generalisation in some participants can be explained by perceptual mechanisms alone but that stronger generalisation in trait anxiety is driven by greater reliance on value transfer. In this work we dissociate perceptual and value-based contributions to generalisation and link trait anxiety to preferential reliance on value-transfer.",

After analyzing passages where Freud conflates the real patient with the mythical figure of Oedipus and acknowledges the pivotal role of names in psychological processes, I employ an engineering technique to support the integration of the adjective “Oedipal” into psychoanalytic discourse. Additionally, I explain how the term “Oedipal complex” is more consistent with the philosophy of science. My contribution addresses intellectual resistance to Freud’s theories and the analysand’s “refusal to heal,” proposing that adopting the refined term could significantly impact the future of psychoanalytic theory and practice.

          "authors": "Angelia Caparco; Genaro Lopez-Martin; Alejandro Galvez-Pol",
          "abstract": "Research on the interaction between interoception and external sensory processing has expanded rapidly, particularly in how stimulus processing is influenced by concurrent cardiac phases (systole and diastole). However, definitions of these phases vary widely. Some studies follow biomedical conventions, defining systole as the period from the R-peak to the end of the T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG), with diastole encompassing the remainder of the cycle. Others adopt a time-based heuristic approach, defining systole based on the estimated arrival of afferent cardiac signals in the brain. This approach assumes that baroreceptor activity plays a key role in cognition, though conclusive evidence for this is lacking. This variability leads to inconsistencies, where systole in one study may correspond partly or entirely to diastole in another. To address this, we first review studies examining how cardiac phases modulate stimulus perception. Second, we highlight methodological inconsistencies in defining cardiac phases, particularly in time-based heuristic approaches. Third, we discuss additional sources of variability, such as differences in recording equipment and measures of interoceptive ability. Rather than focusing on specific findings, we highlight broader challenges in replicability and interpretation. Additionally, we introduce the HEARTS framework, a set of guidelines for standardising methodologies in interoception research. This consists of six recommendations: Harmonizing physiological terms across fields, Establishing clear nomenclature, Avoiding selective reporting, Refining mechanistic understanding, Tailoring methods for precision, and Standardizing study comparability. Implementing these recommendations can improve methodological consistency, cross-study reliability, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring a more accurate understanding of how cardiac interoceptive signals shape perception and cognition.",

          "abstract": "Recency is a typical serial position effect in working memory tasks characterized by better recall performance for end-of-list items relative to mid-of-list items. It has been argued that part of the recency effect can be explained via response suppression, a mechanism discarding recalled items from the set of retrieval candidates. According to this account, a recency effect emerges because the probability to retrieve a wrong item drops significantly as recall proceeds. The current study will re-evaluate this account, capitalizing on a prediction derived from response suppression. Specifically, response suppression predicts that a recency effect emerges for items tested last, as opposed to items encoded last. It therefore follows that testing participants’ memory in random order should result in a recency effect for items tested last, independently of encoding order. I will test this prediction using a modified cued recall procedure in which participants are cued with a serial position and must select the item that appeared in that position from among the retrieval candidates. This procedure will be used across three experiments in which participants encode and retrieve words, spatial locations, and colors.

Nevertheless, our understanding of how contextual factors such as socio-economic status (SES) and gender affect creativity is still limited – especially from an international perspective. In the current study, we thus examined the impact of gender and SES on creative thinking across 62 countries, using data from the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Creative thinking, alongside mathematics and reading, was analyzed using a two-stage meta-analytic approach, integrating effect sizes from country-specific samples with a total sample size of N = 493,660. Our results revealed consistent gender disparities, with females outperforming males in creative thinking and reading, a trend robust across countries but with considerable variability. Gender disparities were less pronounced in the mathematical domain. Moreover, SES was found to be a strong predictor of creative thinking, mathematics, and reading, with higher SES associated with better performance across all domains. There was no substantial interaction effect between gender and SES for creative thinking and reading, suggesting that SES advantages are consistent across genders. Our analyses indicated substantial heterogeneity between countries, emphasizing the need for context-specific educational policies. These findings highlight the pervasive influence of gender and SES on fundamental educational outcomes and hence stress the necessity of tailored interventions to address these disparities around the globe.",

They reported that recalled stories flowed less sequentially than imagined stories. However, the robustness and generalizability of this narrative flow measure remain unverified. To assess generalizability, we apply sequentiality derived from three different LLMs to a new dataset of matched autobiographical and biographical paragraphs. Contrary to previous results, we fail to find a significant difference in narrative flow between autobiographies and biographies. Further investigation\nreveals biases in the original data collection process, where topic selection systematically influences sequentiality scores. Adjusting for these biases substantially reduces the originally reported effect size. A validation exercise using LLM-generated stories with “good” and “poor” flow further highlights the flaws in the original formulation of sequentiality. Our findings suggest that LLM-based narrative flow quantification is susceptible to methodological artifacts.

A tablet-based training program for everyday planning may be a suitable intervention, but its feasibility must be evaluated. This study evaluated how behavior changes during training and if individuals with ID can use technology by themselves.\n\nMethod\nThirty-three adolescents with ID and 30 younger children with a typical development were recruited. The participants were instructed to train in school for a total of 300 minutes. After the intervention, the participants were matched on mental age (MA).\n\nResults\nOnly 16% of the participants trained for all 300 minutes. Participants in the MA group trained for a longer time than the ID group. Both groups made fewer errors per task at the end compared to the beginning. Individuals with ID started off making less attempts per task and increased their activity during the training. This pattern was not seen in the comparison group.\n\nConclusions\nBoth groups used the program independently, without adult supervision. However, a large group of participants in the ID group had a low usage time. Thus, the program might not have been feasible for that subgroup. The ID group increased their activity during the training which might mirror a strategy development of how to use the program. The change in behavior in activity on task attempts can be interpreted such that individuals with ID need a longer time to get familiarized with the technology. Tablet-based training programs are feasible for individuals with ID, but it is necessary to follow up on usage time.",

Guided Grad-CAM highlighted detailed facial regions relevant to specific impressions, whereas GPT-4o provided linguistic descriptions of these visualizations. The results demonstrated that key predictors included the eyes, surrounding eye region, and forehead for attractiveness; structural facial elements for dominance; and expressions for trustworthiness. This study offers new insights into the interpretability of facial impression predictions and proposes a novel approach to examining how specific facial features influence social judgments through deep learning and explainable AI techniques.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nIn reference to dual-process theories of cognition (e.g., Kahneman, 2011), \nwhich distinguish between intuitive (System 1) and analytical (System 2) processing, \nwe propose a logical framework to infer unconscious hierarchical judgment patterns in \nclinical decision-making. \nThis framework is constructed using propositional logic, including reductio ad \nabsurdum, contrapositive reasoning, and De Morgan’s laws. \nWe apply this model to a retrospective dataset of medication error incident \nreports, under the hypothesis that differential forgetting rates mediate unconscious \nprioritization. \nThe analytical design includes multiple and logistic regression models, and \nincorporates non-medication incident reports to control for environmental and temporal \n\nconfounders, while ensuring the unintentional nature of the target behavior. \nOur reasoning structure is designed to logically exclude three of the four \ncognitive quadrants—conscious/equal, conscious/hierarchical, unconscious/equal— on \nlogical, empirical, and psychological grounds, leaving unconscious/hierarchical \njudgment as the most plausible explanation. \nThis study presents a novel approach for detecting structured cognition beneath \nunconscious behavior and emphasizes forgetting as a potential cognitive marker. \nThe proposed framework has potential applications not only in medicine, \npsychology, and artificial intelligence, but also in education, where uncovering \nunconscious prioritization may inform error prevention, adaptive learning design, and \ncognitive support.",

          "authors": "Mariya Cherkasova",
          "abstract": "Objective: A prominent feature of land-based and online slot machines are dynamic visuals and sounds that accompany winning outcomes. Prior work suggests that these features may influence game experience, facilitate immersion, and increase arousal. Additionally, when added to a laboratory gambling task, audiovisual stimuli promoted riskier decision making, but whether this generalizes to realistic gambling products remains unclear. In this pre-registered study, we used a highly realistic slot machine simulator, deployed online, to evaluate the effects of win-accompanying sensory feedback (SF) on gambling experience and behavior. Method: Recruitment allowed comparison of online active gamblers (AG) versus non-gamblers (NG). Participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomly assigned to complete 200 spins on a simulator version with either enhanced or diminished SF. Results: enhanced SF resulted in shorter latencies to initiate spins (i.e. faster speed of play), but did not affect bet size or self-reported experience. Relative to NG, AG reported greater game immersion and positive affect during the game, and these variables were also predicted across all participants by greater problem gambling severity and monetary gains in the gambling session. Self-reported immersion and affect were also predicted by ADHD and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: An increased speed of gambling under SF may incur greater losses over time, raising concerns about harm potential, especially considering the appeal of faster speeds for those experiencing gambling problems. Game experience was influenced by monetary outcomes and personal characteristics rather than SF, supporting the notion that both product and personal characteristics confer risk of harm.",

          "authors": "Camille Williams; Qiang Xie; Elvan Muratoglu; Simon Goldberg",
          "abstract": "The current study examined the effectiveness of digital interventions for enhancing empathy in adults. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions compared with non-specific (i.e., not intended to be therapeutic) and active control conditions (i.e., intended to be therapeutic). Across 24 studies, including 26 comparisons (n = 3,137), the overall estimated effect size was statistically significant (g = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.32], p = .006). However, when accounting for publication bias using trim-and-fill analysis, the estimated effect size became smaller and non-significant (g = 0.07, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.22], p = .322). Studies with follow-up data were analyzed separately (k = 6), yielding a small effect (g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.07,0.5], p = .008) which was robust to trim-and-fill analysis. No significant moderators were identified. An exploratory analysis of studies separated by control group type revealed a small positive effect for studies with non-specific control groups (g = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.33], p &lt; .001) which was robust to trim-and-fill analysis. The results suggest there is potential for digital interventions to have a positive impact on enhancement of empathy in adults, although digital interventions do not appear to outperform active control conditions. For digital interventions to most fully deliver on their potential, they may require more advanced technology that can offer attuned interaction that mimics a human relationship, as well as offer feedback to participants.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility—the ability to adapt behavior in response to changing conditions—is widely recognized as a key feature of animal cognition. It is often measured using reversal learning tasks, where individuals must inhibit a previously rewarded response and adopt a new one after contingencies shift. Despite its widespread use, the comparability of these tasks across species remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of 206 empirical studies (2014–2023) spanning eight major taxonomic groups: invertebrates, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, rodents, other mammals, non-human primates, and humans. For each study, we extracted variables related to taxon coverage, sampling, learning and reversal criteria, cue types, and outcome measures. Analyses included nonparametric tests to assess group-level differences, linear discriminant analyses to explore multivariate structure, and model-based robustness checks. Our findings reveal three fundamental obstacles to reliable cross-species inference. First, research effort is highly imbalanced: birds, rodents, and humans accounted for over half of all study cells, while most animal diversity—especially invertebrates and amphibians and reptiles—remains virtually untested, with less than 1% of described species included per taxon. Second, research is taxonomically siloed: 99% of studies focus on a single group, limiting opportunities for direct comparison. Third, and most critically, methodological standards diverge dramatically across taxa. Humans were consistently held to the strictest learning criteria (median threshold 90%), while birds, invertebrates, and fishes most often used lower thresholds (80–84%). Overtraining was implemented in two-thirds of amphibian and reptile studies but was rare (less than 30%) elsewhere. The number of reversal phases differed more than threefold among groups. Nearly all studies of amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates used single-reversal designs, whereas multi-reversal protocols were much more common in humans and non-human primates. Sample sizes—both per cell and per study—, evaluation window lengths, cue types, and outcome metrics also displayed taxon-specific patterns. These systematic differences in experimental design introduce structural asymmetries that complicate cross-taxon comparisons, blurring the line between true cognitive variation and methodological artifacts. Although research to date has advanced our understanding, further progress will depend on greater methodological coordination and broader taxonomic coverage. Emerging large-scale collaborations are beginning to address these gaps, offering a promising path toward a more robust and equitable science of behavioral flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Goals represent a central concept in the analysis of human motivation. How people evaluate their goals on dimensions like commitment or progress provides insight into motivational processes. Previously, however, goal dimension measures were often developed ad hoc and published without construct validation (Kiendl &amp; Hennecke, 2022). To address this issue, we developed and factor-analyzed (Study 1 and 2) the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire (GDQ) for measuring 9 commonly investigated goal dimensions: commitment, demand, enjoyment, expectancy, external motivation, facilitation, progress, support, and value. In Study 1, goal expectancy, progress, and enjoyment accounted for about half the explained variance in the initial item set. We tested the construct validity of the GDQ in two longitudinal studies focusing on academic goals (Study 3) and New Year’s resolutions (Study 4). For academic goals, between-person analyses suggested that higher enjoyment, expectancy, and progress as well as lower demand predicted satisfaction with performance and better grades. In Study 4, within-person analyses using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models revealed that support predicted life satisfaction one month later, and enjoyment was associated with it cross-sectionally. Cross-sectionally, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress were furthermore positively and demand was negatively associated with affective well-being on the within-person level. Exploratorily, commitment and expectancy consistently predicted goal progress. Recommendations for parsimonious measurement are derived through exploratory commonality analysis Five of the nine scales showed many of the predicted associations supporting their validity. We recommend further validation of the external motivation, support, facilitation, and value dimensions in study contexts better tailored to their influence or expression.",

It also talks about the causes for injury and the reason behind it which can be corrected with just basic understanding of communication between the horse and the rider. This article helps in understanding the need for further research that needs to be done on the psychological factors affecting the horse and the rider and also to research on how the rider can communicate in better ways with the horse for performance enhancement. Various journals such as Journal of sports and exercise Psychology, Journal of veterinary science, New Perspectives on Equine Assisted Interventions, Journal of veterinary behavior and Anthrozoös, were referred to for this review. 62 articles were selected at the initial stage of screening out of which 31 articles were selected for this article. It can be understood from these articles that there is a high amount of correlation between the effects the rider has on the horse whether positive or negative influence. According to these studies, it can be understood that with more practice and time the communication between the horse and the rider will be improved which in turn would improve the performance as a whole helping in performance enhancement in equitation and the partnership between the horse and rider.",

Mediation analyses have been performed using the PROCESS macro in SPSS.\nResults: Female participants with mobility disabilities have higher scores in psychological well-being than their male counterparts (t(112) = -3.14, p &lt; 0.01). It has also been reported that resilience significantly mediated the relationship between self-esteem and psychological well-being (β = 0.147, LLCI = 0.006 to ULCI = 0.313). \nConclusion: The study's findings suggest that students with mobility disabilities have lower psychological well-being.

          "abstract": "Abstract\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy—grounded in the exploration of unconscious processes, defense mechanisms, and the therapeutic alliance—remains largely absent from undergraduate nursing curricula. This descriptive, cross‑sectional study evaluated baseline knowledge of psychodynamic concepts among 100 third‑year nursing students at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College &amp; Hospital School of Nursing in Eastern India. Participants completed the 45‑item Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Knowledge Questionnaire (Cronbach’s α = 0.891). Descriptive statistics revealed that 76 % of students scored in the poor knowledge range (0–15 correct answers), 14 % achieved moderate knowledge (16–30), and 10 % demonstrated adequate knowledge (31–45). A χ² test identified a significant association between knowledge level and programme type (B.Sc. vs. Post‑Basic B.Sc.; p = .040), whereas age, gender, and religion showed no significant relationships. The findings underscore a critical theoretical gap that may compromise students’ ability to deliver trauma‑informed, emotionally attuned care. Integrating psychodynamic content—through simulation, supervised reflection, and inter‑professional teaching—could foster deeper empathy, strengthen the nurse–patient alliance, and align nursing education with contemporary global mental‑health priorities. Longitudinal evaluations of learning outcomes and patient‑care quality are recommended.\nFuture research will explore broader thesis-level investigations into resilience, the integration of AI in psychodynamic education, and mixed-method approaches that support culturally diverse student populations. These include the development of digital mental health interventions, reflective supervision models, and interdisciplinary collaborations to enhance psychodynamic capacity-building across nursing and clinical psychology.\nMethod\nA descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 third-year nursing students at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College &amp; Hospital School of Nursing.

Only 14% achieved moderate scores, while 10% demonstrated adequate understanding. A significant association was found with the type of nursing program (p = 0.040).\nConclusion\nThese findings underscore the urgent need to integrate psychodynamic concepts into nursing curricula to improve reflective practice, emotional attunement, and therapeutic engagement in mental health care.",

          "abstract": "Human eye movements while identifying a face, searching for targets, and executing motor actions are directed to regions contributing to task accuracy. However, what humans look at and do when free-viewing a scene without a specific task is not well understood. We show that observers' free-viewing fixations are similar to fixations of observers instructed to describe the scenes and dissimilar to fixations of observers counting objects or searching for specific objects. Small visual alterations to images that change a scene’s understanding but not the most salient or its meaning map alter where humans most frequently fixated. Free viewing fixations are more frequently directed to objects critical to the understanding of a scene (objects that, when erased from the scene, maximally alter the scene’s description) rather than the most salient, most meaningfully judged scene region (meaning map), or the object perceived to be gazed or grasped. By having observers describe the scene while maintaining fixation on objects relevant or irrelevant to scene understanding, we show that eye movements during free viewing are functionally important to extracting an accurate understanding of scenes. Thus, we conclude that the human brain's default task during free viewing is to understand scenes reflected by frequent eye movements to objects that maximize accurate understanding even when these objects are not gazed at or to be grasped.",

          "abstract": "Background: The persistence of consciousness across continuous molecular turnover of\nneural tissue requires substrate-independent computational accounts that specify when\nconsciousness occurs and provide decisive falsification criteria. Current theories face critical\nlimitations: Integrated Information Theory has been declared \"pseudoscience\" by 124+\nresearchers due to unfalsifiability, while Global Neuronal Workspace Theory showed mixed\nempirical results in recent adversarial collaborations.\n\nFramework: We propose Attention Schema-Modulated Binding (AS-MB) theory, which reduces\naccess consciousness to a single testable criterion: consciousness arises when an attention\nschema controller elevates precision weights for hierarchical prediction-error units, creating\nbinding coherence across cortical scales that exceeds threshold θ for ≥τ ms. Formally: C* = 1\niff [Bc(t→t+τ; local, global) &gt; θ] ∧ [π driven by valid AS].\n\nInnovation: AS-MB provides (1) a single falsifiable criterion integrating multiple complex\nmechanisms, (2) specific neuroanatomical predictions targeting right TPJ as critical hub within\ndistributed attention schema networks, (3) decisive falsification criteria based on binding\ncoherence measurements, and (4) a staged validation pipeline addressing operationalization\nchallenges.\n\nPredictions: Three distinguishing predictions enable definitive theory testing: (1) TMS to\nattention schema hubs reduces binding coherence through precision modulation more than\nadjacent cortex stimulation, (2) attention schema activity leads recurrent processing by\n50-100ms with lead magnitude correlating with resulting binding coherence, and (3) high\nbinding coherence without schema control yields unconscious processing while high schema\ncontrol without coherence yields fragmented awareness.\n\nSignificance: AS-MB addresses the falsifiability crisis in consciousness research by providing\ndecisive refutation criteria while maintaining mechanistic specificity. The framework offers\nimmediate applications for consciousness assessment and establishes methodological\nstandards for theory development in post-IIT consciousness science.\n\nKeywords: consciousness, attention schema, binding coherence, predictive processing,\nfalsifiability, precision weighting",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between childhood trauma and personality traits among Indian college students, with a focus on how different trauma subtypes influence the Big Five personality dimensions. A sample of 250 students aged 18–24 completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire–Short Form (CTQ-SF) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44). Statistical analyses including Pearson’s correlation, MANOVA, hierarchical regression, and moderation via PROCESS Macro revealed that emotional and physical neglect were the most prevalent and developmentally impactful forms of trauma. Emotional neglect significantly predicted higher neuroticism (β = .38, p &lt; .001), while both forms of neglect were associated with lower conscientiousness and agreeableness. Gender was found to moderate the impact of neglect on conscientiousness, with male students showing greater personality disruption. These findings highlight the enduring psychological consequences of early emotional deprivation and the importance of gender-sensitive, trauma-informed interventions in university mental health frameworks. The study underscores the developmental weight of neglect and invites reconsideration of how trauma is conceptualized in personality formation within emerging adult populations in non-Western contexts.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between childhood trauma and personality traits among Indian college students, with a focus on how different trauma subtypes influence the Big Five personality dimensions. A sample of 250 students aged 18–24 completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire–Short Form (CTQ-SF) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44). Statistical analyses including Pearson’s correlation, MANOVA, hierarchical regression, and moderation via PROCESS Macro revealed that emotional and physical neglect were the most prevalent and developmentally impactful forms of trauma. Emotional neglect significantly predicted higher neuroticism (β = .38, p &lt; .001), while both forms of neglect were associated with lower conscientiousness and agreeableness. Gender was found to moderate the impact of neglect on conscientiousness, with male students showing greater personality disruption. These findings highlight the enduring psychological consequences of early emotional deprivation and the importance of gender-sensitive, trauma-informed interventions in university mental health frameworks. The study underscores the developmental weight of neglect and invites reconsideration of how trauma is conceptualized in personality formation within emerging adult populations in non-Western contexts.",

          "abstract": "So far, there is little evidence of a negativity bias in evaluative conditioning. In evaluative conditioning neutral stimuli (conditioned stimuli; CSs) are paired with stimuli of either positive or negative valence; as a result, the initially neutral stimuli change their valence into the direction of the paired valent stimuli. So far, there is no evidence that the size of this effect differs between positive and negative pairs. We investigated if a negativity bias occurs when a CS is paired with both negative and positive stimuli, in sequence, in an evaluative counter-conditioning procedure. In three experiments (N = 100, N = 362, N = 120), conditioned stimuli (CSs) were paired with either positive or negative stimuli in an evaluative conditioning phase; then in an evaluative counter-conditioning phase, the same CSs were paired with stimuli of the opposite valence. We tested whether counter-conditioning is more effective when positively conditioned CSs are negatively counter-conditioned than when negatively conditioned CSs are positively counter-conditioned. We found this to be the case. There was no evidence that this negativity bias was driven by differences in memory. Furthermore, we found no evidence that a negativity bias nor a positivity bias occurs in a typical (initial) evaluative conditioning procedure. We discuss implications for understanding evaluative conditioning and negativity biases.",

          "abstract": "Predicting object motion is critical for interacting with a dynamic world. Heavier objects tend to move more slowly than lighter ones, whether we lift them ourselves or observe larger vehicles accelerating more gradually. Here we ask whether the perceptual system internalizes everyday mass–velocity relationships described by Newton’s second law of motion. Across three experiments (N=176), we reveal a novel mass–speed illusion: heavier-looking objects are judged to move more slowly than lighter ones, despite identical physical speeds and sizes. A simple psychophysical model inspired by environmental mass–velocity statistics captures this bias. \nThese findings overturn the assumption that mass and velocity are processed independently in human perception. Instead, our results suggest that inferred mass is woven directly into velocity perception. By internalizing environmental mass–velocity regularities, the brain bridges intuitive physics and perception, providing a unified framework for understanding motion biases and guiding adaptive behavior in a dynamic world.",

          "abstract": "The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely used to assess decision-making deficits in clinical populations. Previously used methods do not provide clear evidence whether associations between IGT performance and psychopathology are general across multiple forms of psychopathology or are specific to individual disorders. In this study, we examined IGT performance across anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior: reward and punishment learning rates, win-frequency sensitivity, and response bias. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and diagnostic history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Across six experiments, we tested the hypothesis that acquired attitudes are moderated by memory retrieval of relevant evaluative information previously experienced with the attitude object. In Experiment 1, an evaluative conditioning effect was moderated by presenting the unconditioned stimulus (US) as a retrieval cue, using a design that controlled for valence priming effects. Experiment 2 replicated this moderation effect in an impression formation paradigm, where attitudes were based on behavioral descriptions. Experiments 3a and 3b used a similar design as Experiment 1, but with intermixed positive and negative information. Again, retrieval cues influenced attitudes, although the effects were smaller in magnitude and not significant in one of the studies. In Experiments 4 and 5, we examined memory retrieval in a setting with higher external validity: We assessed people’s liking of everyday objects and showed that liking was related to the valence of a related memory after the memory’s retrieval. We found this effect on valence ratings and on an adapted Affect Misattribution Procedure, but not in an evaluative priming task. Together, these studies demonstrate across multiple paradigms that acquired attitudes depend not only on the encoding and storage of evaluative information, but also on its retrieval. These findings suggest that, within the paradigms and timescales we investigated, acquired attitudes do not become fully semantically integrated into the representation of attitude objects but remain contingent on the retrieval of the original evaluative experiences.",

          "authors": "Jeanne Brown; Meghan Clayards",
          "abstract": "Creaky voice has historically been associated with men's speech (e.g., Henton &amp; Bladon, 1988), supported by acoustic studies (e.g., Gittelson et al., 2021; Klatt &amp; Klatt, 1990). Since around 2010, sociolinguistic work alongside public discourse has perpetuated greater creaky voice use by women instead, typically implementing impressionistic coding (e.g., Podesva, 2013; Yuasa, 2010). This study investigates whether this recent shift can be attributed to perceptual social and acoustic biases related to (perceived) speaker gender and pitch (f0), respectively. Using a matched-guise paradigm, 40 Canadian English listeners rated the perceived creakiness of the same modal and creaky voices—altered to have ambiguously gendered formants and median f0s (115, 135, 155 Hz)—paired with female and male faces. Bayesian regression analyses revealed strong effects of voice quality and moderate effects of f0: creaky and lower-f0 stimuli were rated as creakier. No overall effect of face gender was found. However, a weak interaction between face gender and f0 suggests a possible gender prototypicality bias: female faces were rated as slightly creakier at lower f0s and male faces at higher f0s. These findings show that neither acoustic nor gender-based biases alone can account for widespread reports of women-led creaky voice use.",

          "authors": "Gregory Edward Cox",
          "abstract": "Similarity lies at the core of theories of memory and perception.  To understand similarity relations among complex items like text and images, researchers often rely on machine learning to derive high-dimensional vector representations of those items.  To use these representations to explain and predict human performance, a cognitive model must establish a relationship between vector similarity and the psychological construct of similarity.  To that end, I introduce SALR (``similarity as likelihood ratio''), a mathematical transformation of the similarity between vector representations, operationalized as the cosine of the angle between them, into a ratio of the relative likelihood that the two representations encode the same versus different items.  The likelihood ratio operationalizes similarity in a manner that is motivated by theories of perception and memory while also being readily ``plugged in'' to existing cognitive models.  Three example applications show how SALR can be used to compute drift rates of a diffusion decision model based on similarity information derived from machine learning models, thereby accounting for the speed and accuracy with which individual participants respond to individual items.  SALR enables inferences regarding how different people represent items, how much information they encode about each item, and how that information is affected by experimental manipulations.  SALR serves both the practical purpose of making it easier to incorporate representations from machine learning---indeed, any method in which similarity is operationalized as a cosine---into cognitive models and the theoretical purpose of allowing cognitive models to grant insight into how people process the increasingly complex, naturalistic items to which machine learning models are applied.",

Additionally, depressive symptoms partially mediated the\nrelationship between parental stress and responsiveness. Effects of personality traits\n– namely emotional stability and intellect – were modest and significant only with one\nof the two measures of caregiver responsiveness. We did not find any association\nbetween caregiver responsiveness and infant age.\nConclusions: Parental stress emerged as the most consistent predictor of caregiver\nresponsiveness, underscoring its central role in shaping parental behavior.\nFurthermore, our findings suggest that the role of parental personality in predicting\ncaregiver responsiveness may depend on how responsiveness is conceptualized.",

          "abstract": "Producing words during the semantic fluency task (e.g., “name all the animals you can in a minute”) involves not only activating the relevant semantic representations, but also being able to flexibly utilize phonological information to facilitate retrieval. However, the mechanisms by which individuals effectively use phonology as a latent cue during memory search remain understudied. In this study, we used a computational approach to examine the use of different lexical sources during memory search in two categorical domains (Animals and Foods) within the semantic fluency task. We captured the relative saliency of semantic and acoustic information by creating blended lexical representations obtained from two language models trained on text (word2vec) and speech (speech2vec). To examine process-level mechanisms, we implemented computational models based on optimal foraging principles to characterize transitions within and across clusters of related items. These models were evaluated within a sample of normal hearing children and a naturally occurring control group with limited early auditory and language experience – prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants. Overall, in domains where semantics and phonology were more highly correlated (i.e., Foods), greater use of phonology in within cluster transitions was associated with better fluency performance for those with normal hearing. In contrast, though children with cochlear implants amplified acoustic structural information in these domains, they were less able to flexibly leverage phonological information to retrieve more items within clusters. Together, this work highlights how early linguistic experience shapes the ability to use semantic and phonological cues to navigate lexical space in a controlled, adaptive manner.",

Triumph and pride were primarily differentiated by aggressive and expansive behaviors, respectively. Our findings show that triumph was the predominant emotion following successful bar clearance, with pride also more frequent than during the baseline period. However, pride/expansion levels did not differentiate between bar clearance and failure.\nSignificantly more actions such as making a fist, shouting, lowering the eyebrows (Action Unit [AU] 4), and raising the upper lip (AU 10) were observed after successful clearances compared to failures. Regression analysis, using triumph as a criterion, significantly predicted competition rank, seasonal best, personal best, and absolute height. Pride frequency post-clearance was predicted by height, personal best, and rank, excluding seasonal best. Triumph showed higher predicted variance than pride.\nThe results suggest triumph is more related to success than pride, even in non-interactive sports, particularly in difficult competitions. We discuss the relation of triumph and pride to power and achievement motivation, as well as the physiological and communicative functions of triumph signals.",

This shift has been accompanied by methodological advancements that extend beyond classical tools such as tape recorders or video cameras and include motion-tracking systems, depth cameras, and multimodal data fusion techniques. While these tools enable richer empirical insights, they also introduce significant conceptual and practical challenges, particularly for researchers new to multimodal data collection. This paper provides a structured exploration of the methodological workflow essential to multimodal language and communication research. We present a flexible decision-making framework that guides researchers through key considerations, from data selection and its alignment with research questions, to data collection methods, technical requirements, and data management, including ethical considerations and data sharing. We also address critical factors such as equipment choice, data synchronization, and ethical concerns (e.g., privacy and data protection) while illustrating these processes with examples from different research contexts (i.e., lab-based experiments, large-scale annotated corpora, field studies including non-human primates). Rather than advocating a one-size-fits-all approach, our discussion emphasizes key decision points, trade-offs and real-world examples to help researchers navigate the complexities of multimodal data collection. By integrating perspectives from different disciplines, our flexible decision-making framework is intended as a practical tool for newcomers to address common conceptual and methodological challenges in the rapidly developing area of multimodal data collection.",

          "abstract": "Young adult speakers can be induced to increase the acoustic contrast between vowels through exposure to a non-uniform auditory “centralization” feedback perturbation that makes vowels sound less distinct from one another. While this result suggests that sensorimotor adaptation is a promising learning mechanism to drive behaviorally-relevant changes related to speech intelligibility, existing research on sensorimotor adaptation in speech has largely focused on younger adults. Given established age-related deficits in speech motor performance, it is possible that healthy aging itself negatively impacts speech motor learning; however, these potential effects of age are currently unknown. Here, we examine the effects of healthy aging on the magnitude of both adaptation to the complex “centralization” paradigm as well as the generalization of this learning to untrained vowels. Forty-three neurobiologically healthy speakers (age range: 18-73) read monosyllabic words with corner vowels while their auditory feedback was shifted towards the center of the vowel space. Adaptation was measured as the increase in vowel contrast induced by this perturbation. Generalization was tested in monosyllabic words with non-corner vowels produced under masking noise. Speakers adapted to the perturbation, producing the trained corner vowels farther from the vowel center, with increased acoustic contrast among them. This learning generalized robustly to untrained non-corner vowels. Crucially, age did not affect the magnitude of adaptation nor the magnitude of the generalization. These findings demonstrate that healthy aging does not impair sensorimotor adaptation in speech, further establishing that sensorimotor adaptation can be leveraged to drive behaviorally-relevant changes in speech in older adults with acquired motor speech disorders.",

This study characterized context-specific patterns of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and SB among Kansas youth participating in 4-H programming. A cross-sectional online survey was completed by a convenience sample of 796 Kansas youth (Grades 3-12; 53% female; 70% rural; 94% White) enrolled in 4-H. Youth, independently or with a parent, completed the Youth Activity Profile to estimate MVPA and SB across six contexts: average daily, weekday, weekend, school-, and home-based MVPA, and home-based SB. Linear regression models were computed for each outcome, with three-way interactions between gender, grade, and rurality. Participants averaged 67.6 minutes of daily MVPA and 4.2 hours of home-based SB, with similar MVPA levels on weekdays and weekends (66.4 vs. 70.5 minutes/day). Significant main effects of grade and gender were found across all MVPA and SB outcomes (all p’s &lt; .05), with MVPA declining by grade and consistently lower among girls. Significant grade-by-rurality interactions were observed for weekday (B = -1.18, SE = 0.58, p = .04) and school-based MVPA (B = -0.90, SE = 0.44, p = .04), indicating steeper age-related declines among urban youth. No other interactions were statistically significant (all p’s &gt; .05). While average MVPA levels met recommendations, steep age-related declines and persistent gender disparities – especially among high school girls – highlight the need for developmentally appropriate, gender-responsive PA promotion strategies. Programs like 4-H may offer scalable, context-specific PA opportunities to support youth at greatest risk of inactivity-related health consequences.",

          "abstract": "Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments is partly due to problems with auditory selective attention—a process that enhances the neural representation of target sounds over competing sounds. Neurofeedback training that targets auditory selective attention shows promise to improve speech-in-noise perception in normal-hearing individuals. For such training to be effective, the attention decoding algorithm must be accurate, generalizable, and explainable, even for brief, few-second-long EEG signals.\nPrior attention decoding algorithms used for neurofeedback have low accuracy and lack generalizability, despite their explainability. To address these shortcomings, this study developed three attention decoders based on well-established algorithms: forward linear model, backward linear model, and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We assessed the decoder’s accuracy in classifying selective attention from single-trial EEG and its generalizability to untrained participants. For explainability, we examined spatial and temporal features critical for decoding.\nOur findings indicate that decoding selective attention to short, co-located sound is feasible with both linear and CNN models, each offering unique benefits. The CNN showed superior accuracy (72.3%) and cross-subject generalizability compared to linear models (64.9%). Conversely, linear models provided clearer neurophysiological explainability, aligning spatially and temporally with established evidence for attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses.\nThese results support that linear models are more suited for neurofeedback, where understanding the basis of decoding is crucial for effective training. Meanwhile, the CNN remains a strong candidate for applications requiring high performance. This research provides a foundation for developing evidence-based rehabilitation protocols for speech-in-noise perception, enabling interventions grounded in measurable neural changes.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period marked by rapid brain development and the onset of many mental health disorders. Brain MRI studies during adolescence, especially when paired with behavioral phenotypes and information about genetic risk factors, hold promise to advance early identification of mental health risk and spur the creation of targeted treatments to improve patient function, prognosis, and quality of life. However, prospective neuroimaging is costly and time-intensive, and individuals who participate may not be reflective of the general population. These challenges are compounded when examining adolescents, as many families lack the time, energy, or resources to participate in studies that utilize research-grade imaging. Repurposing clinical MRIs obviates many of the challenges of neuroimaging research. Here we describe the Brain-Behavior-Genetics study protocol. This protocol describes procedures used to recruit participants with recent high-quality clinical brain MRIs and prospectively acquire genetic and socio-behavioral data, resulting in a highly cost-efficient design that harnesses a vast and underutilized neuroscientific resource.",

          "abstract": "The development of metacognition and executive functions support adaptive and goal-directed behaviour in adulthood. Therefore, effective screening of these competences is crucial for implementing early interventions in educational and clinical contexts. While neuropsychological tests typically target a single competence and force clinicians to rely on time-consuming batteries, the Metacognitive Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Meta-WCST) probes metacognition, executive functions and their interaction. However, this test has not yet been scientifically validated on children with either typical or atypical development. This gap reflects both a methodological shortcoming and a missed opportunity for developmental neuropsychology. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of studies involving the Meta-WCST, with the aim of evaluating its translational potential for developmental applications. Despite several methodological limitations in the current literature, our evaluation suggests that the Meta-WCST can be adapted to developmental contexts through targeted improvements to theoretical/computational frameworks, data analyses methods, protocol procedures. These considerations have meaningful implications for multiple areas of developmental neuropsychology, including scientific research, educational practice, and clinical assessment.",

This preregistered randomized controlled trial (https://osf.io/7wx9d; Beard et al., 2024) tested the effectiveness of HW compared to a symptom tracking (ST) control condition. Method: U.S. adults with anxiety and depression symptoms (N=340; Mage=33.04 years, 57.4% women, 60.6% White, 14.7% Black, 11.2% Asian, 10.9% Multiracial, 22.1% Hispanic/Latine) were randomly assigned to complete three weekly interpretation bias exercises and once weekly depression and anxiety symptom surveys (HW), or three weekly depression and anxiety symptom surveys (ST) for four weeks. Results: A priori benchmarks for retention, adherence and satisfaction were achieved: 77.8% of HW participants were still using the app in Week 4, 43.7% achieved perfect adherence, and app usability and acceptability were rated positively. As hypothesized, HW was superior to ST at improving negative and benign interpretation biases (Word-Sentence Association Paradigm) and functional impairment (Work and Social Adjustment Scale); and HW (vs. ST) participants also reported significantly greater global improvement (Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Improvement Self-Report) and subjective engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale) at post-intervention. Unexpectedly, while depression and anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7) improved significantly, these changes were not unique to the HW condition. Conclusions: HW is an engaging and scalable intervention that may be effective for improving overall severity and functioning, but further validation of effectiveness for specific symptom domains is needed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood maltreatment significantly impacts future mental health, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neurocognitive changes following maltreatment may constitute a latent vulnerability for psychopathology. While previous research shows that maltreatment alters threat and reward processing, its effects on learning and decision-making are poorly understood. We investigated how childhood maltreatment influences future learning and decision-making in volatile environments focused on win-seeking vs. loss-avoidance.\nMethods: Adolescents aged 12-17 with (n=59) and without (n=46) exposure to maltreatment completed a probabilistic reversal learning task with separate win- seeking and loss-avoidance conditions during fMRI. We employed computational modelling to assess latent learning processes. In addition to group differences, we explored effects of maltreatment type and psychiatric symptoms.\nResults: A belief-based Hidden Markov model showed that maltreatment-exposed individuals had lower estimates of environmental stability in the win-seeking, but not the loss-avoidance condition. Congruently, maltreated adolescents perseverated less and thus outperformed controls after reversals in the win-seeking condition. At the neural level, maltreated adolescents displayed lower right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation associated with environmental changes (upcoming reversals). In maltreated adolescents, lower stability estimates in the win condition were associated with more psychiatric symptoms and impaired performance during stable task phases. Predominant exposure to abuse was associated with altered win-seeking, while neglect was associated with altered loss-avoidance.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether interacting with a simulated cognitive technical system could elicit different emotional responses, as indicated by facial expressions. Participants were presented with various challenging scenarios designed to elicit anger, frustration, fear, sadness, disappointment or general negative feelings. In a so-called 'Wizard of Oz' experiment, participants had to complete a solvable task while interacting with the simulated cognitive technical system. At two standardized points during the experiment, participants were confronted with an unexpected set of complex problems designed to elicit negative emotions (the weight limit barrier and the Waiuku barrier). These barriers were assessed by categorizing the participants' facial movements using the Facial Action Coding System(Ekman et al., 2002a). Emotion categorization was primarily based on the Emotional Facial Action Coding System (EMFACS(Friesen &amp; Ekman, 1984)), but also incorporated prototypical Action Unit (AU) combinations as indicators.\nAnalysis of 80 subjects revealed that there were hardly any full, prototypical facial expressions of emotion according to EMFACS. Studies that employed other methods to induce emotions usually found that only parts of prototypical emotions were displayed on the face. Our hypothesis regarding anger/frustration induction was not supported in either challenge situation. As hypothesized, unspecific negative affect and sadness/disappointment were significantly higher during the second challenge (the Waiuku barrier). The different emotions induced in the experiment, especially the high frequency of social smiling during the baseline condition, indicated that the technical system was capable of inducing emotions like humans can, and that it was treated like a person, albeit virtual.",

          "authors": "Elige Chbat",
          "abstract": "Macaques, commonly classified as wild animals, are often excluded from consideration as companion animals due to prevailing prejudices and institutional frameworks. However, newly emerging observations reveal that some individuals have formed deep, reciprocal emotional bonds with macaques, integrating them, not merely as pets, but as genuine members of the family. This lifestyle appears to bring greater psychological, intellectual and social fulfillment for the macaques, surpassing the well-being of their wild and captive counterparts, thus contributing to the emergence or more evolved profiles. These cases challenge the dominant long-standing paradigm that macaques “cannot be pets” or “belong only in the wild”, and other prejudices, rooted in earlier observations of captive macaques suffering neglect, abuse, and psychological distress, observations which have shaped current legal and ethical assumptions. They highlight a quiet revolution in human-primate relationships, rooted in mutual understanding and fulfillment, deep emotional reciprocity, and enrichment, and argue for distinguishing macaques integrated into families from the conventional notion of “captivity” which fails to reflect their lived experience.\nDespite growing evidence of healthy, enriched, and mutually fulfilling human-primate relationships, many regulatory bodies, continue to operate under outdated non-inclusive convictions, instead of exhibiting scientific curiosity and ethical reflection. As a result, they would intervene, using rigid interpretations of wildlife law to confiscate well-cared-for macaques, sometimes selectively and without conducting any behavioral or welfare assessments, disrupting the lives of well-adjusted macaques and causing trauma, regression, and even fatal outcomes, to which they nonetheless remain indifferent and unaccountable. \nThis paper examines the ethical and scientific shortcomings of rigid legal applications and critiques how institutional bias and the unchecked enforcement, particularly through the story of the monkeys Kaka, Mit and Puka, can become a mechanism of harm in the name of conservation and in the name of the law, no longer serving an intent to protect, but an intent to punish, deriving the law from its original purpose. This is especially problematic when authority is delegated to NGOs or agencies driven by personal or political agendas rather than genuine concern for animal welfare. It highlights the urgent need to distinguish between signs of fulfillment and distress, and advocates for policy reform that incorporates these behavioral indicators into law enforcement procedures, as the consequences of confiscation differ dramatically between abused and emotionally bonded, well-cared-for macaques.\nUltimately, this review not only challenges assumptions about macaques in human families, but calls for making ethics a legal duty to protect animals from being victimized by punitive or corrupt enforcement practices; It argues for a more nuanced, case-by-case approach, individualized welfare assessments rooted in international animal welfare principles that prioritize emotional bonds and quality of life over rigid legal classification, by integrating behavioral science and ethical analysis into legal processes to uphold the original protective intent of the law over political interests or vengeful action; And it encourages transparency and the recognition that not all human-primate relationships are harmful, some are profoundly beneficial to the animals.",

          "abstract": "During psychological treatment, depressed individuals tend to show changes in affect and symptoms in varied, non-linear patterns that are not yet well understood. This study aimed to investigate how affect changes as depression improves, by examining the presence and dynamics of underlying mood states in intensive ecological momentary assessments (M=502 observations per person) of 29 depressed individuals receiving psychotherapy. A Bayesian multilevel Hidden Markov Modeling approach was used to identify the optimal number of states and investigate whether probabilities of switching between these states changed over the course of treatment. Visualization was used to reveal temporal patterns in state switches and inter-individual heterogeneity. A three-state solution best fit the data: a high depressed mood state in which negative affect was elevated and positive affect was lower; an inverse, low depressed mood state; and an intermediate state in which arousal levels were relatively low (including more tiredness, less stress and irritation). These states aligned well with validated weekly symptom scores. Typically, individuals remained in the same mood state from one moment to the next, switching to other states on 24% of occasions. Initially, switches from high to low depressed mood mainly occurred via the medium depressed mood state. As treatment progressed, participants (treatment responders especially) became more likely to remain in or switch to the low depressed mood state and became less likely to spend time in or switch to the high and medium depressed mood states. The pattern of switches and time spent in these states varied highly between individuals.",

We contrasted two levels of associative constraints on word generation, and we tested the differential impact of ADHD traits on the dynamics of the resulting “trains of thoughts”. In the strong constraint condition, each word had to be semantically close to the previous one; in the weak constraint condition, participants had to say the words that spontaneously came to their mind.\n\tWe first validate the notion that the weak constraint condition mirrors free thought by comparing the word produced in the task with participants’ self-reported real-life thoughts. Using response times and semantic metrics, we then show that participants with higher ADHD traits produced more dynamic series of words, but only in the weak constraint condition mirroring free thoughts. Our study supports the idea that ADHD symptoms in the general population are associated with heightened thought volatility, and provides one of the first operationalization of the notion of cognitive constraints in spontaneous thought research.",

Specifically, the paper argues that a deficiency in \nself-esteem gives rise to a fear of worthlessness, which then fuels discriminatory \nbehavior toward perceived \"others,\" cognitively rationalized as \"just.\" \nImportantly, the discrimination examined here refers to the irrational, unjust exclusion \nand mistreatment of individuals or groups based on prejudice—fundamentally \ndistinct from the ethically reasoned “distinction based on coexistence possibility” \ndiscussed in earlier work (Nakai, 2025b).

We introduce the concepts of ‘cluster dummies’ and ‘demeaning,’ and provide scripts to estimate the within-school association between sports and depression in a fictional dataset. In PART 2, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to longitudinal data, and provide scripts to estimate the within-participant association between sports and depression over time in a fictional four-wave dataset. In this part, we cover three additional topics. First, we explain how to calculate effect sizes and offer simulation-based sample size guidelines to detect within-participant effects of plausible magnitude with sufficient power. Second, we show how to test two possible interactions: between a time-invariant and a time-varying predictor, and between two time-varying predictors. Third, we introduce three relevant extensions: first-difference modeling (estimating changes from one wave to the next); time-distributed fixed-effects modeling (estimating changes before, during, and after an individual event); and within-between multilevel modeling (estimating both within- and between-participant associations). In PART 3, we discuss two limitations of fixed-effects modeling: time-varying confounders and reverse causation. We conclude with reflections on causality in nonexperimental data.",

          "authors": "Takao Nakai",
          "abstract": "This conceptual study aims to clarify the psychological mechanism underlying \nnegative thinking, positing it as a distortion in subjective value judgment that \nprofoundly impacts an individual's psychological well-being. Drawing upon prior \nconceptual studies on the mechanisms of value, fear, and discrimination , this paper \nreconstructs negative thinking as a reactionary mechanism to existential \ninsecurity—one that emerges when the subconscious mind interprets the self as \n“worthless,” and fails to adequately discharge the associated emotions. Departing \nfrom conventional quantitative methods, it explores the intricate interplay of value \nperception, emotional processing, fear response, and the pivotal role of \nunconditional love in shaping one's confidence in existential worth. This paper delves \ninto how certain personality traits, when coupled with accumulated stress and \nnegative emotional suppression, can lead to depressive states characterized by \nimpaired logical reasoning and a sense of being trapped in a \"thought cage\". It \nfurther examines the often-overlooked influence of emotional contagion from others, \narguing that while its precise scientific mechanisms are still evolving, its experiential \nreality significantly contributes to the perpetuation of negative emotional states. By \nintegrating these dynamics and providing precise functional definitions of key \nconcepts, this work offers a coherent framework for understanding the core \npsychological dynamics of negative thinking and proposes practical pathways for its \novercoming, including the importance of self-acceptance, mutual support, healthy \nemotional expression, and early psychological education. This paper emphasizes \nthat genuine psychological insight arises from understanding intrinsic logical \nmechanisms and experiential truths, rather than solely relying on numerical analysis.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom duration and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of small numbers. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom duration and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Although numerous studies have shown that nature exposure can enhance children’s self-esteem, the psychological effects of activities in natural environments vary across individuals. Environmental Sensitivity is a framework that captures individual differences in the susceptibility to environmental influences (including nature). This study investigated the interactive effects of nature exposure and environmental sensitivity on the self-esteem of Japanese children. A total of 1,200 parent-children dyads, in grade four to six (599 boys, 595 girls, and 6 other/unidentified; 400 in each grade), participated in a two-wave longitudinal online survey over a five-month interval. Children’s sensitivity (only at Time 1), hours of nature exposure within the past four weeks, and self-esteem were assessed. Analyses based on the latent difference score model revealed that an increase in the hours of nature exposure predicted a greater enhancement of self-esteem, especially for highly sensitive children. However, the contrastive effect was observed at an extremely low sensitivity level (lower than M – 1.67SD). It is possible that emotional reactivity, a trait of highly sensitive individuals, could explain these individual differences. Our findings offer crucial insights for future researchers, educational practitioners, and policy developers.",

          "abstract": "This conceptual paper explores the underlying mechanisms of human desire, \nparticularly focusing on two fundamental principles: \"pain avoidance\" and \"effort \nminimization\". These principles not only shape how desires arise and are expressed, \nbut also provide the basis for understanding impulsive behavior and addiction as \ndysfunctional responses to emotional suppression. By reinterpreting desire as a \nmorally neutral drive, the paper argues for a paradigm shift: from suppressing desire \nto fostering its healthy fulfillment. The proposed model highlights the role of \nsuppressed psychological pain, existential insecurity, and the scarcity of diverse \npleasures as root causes of addiction. Practical implications include therapeutic \nstrategies based on emotional processing and lifestyle diversification.",

          "authors": "John Protzko",
          "abstract": "In the Experimental Human Sciences, there is a tendency to equate statistically significant differences between vignettes or conditions or wordings as being indicative of gaining insights into people’s intuitions. This is based on a number of large assumptions, the primary one being the mean of a group is an adequate estimator for the intuitions of those in the group. While this is justified when interpreting the causal effect of different experimental manipulations on means of participants’ judgments, it is questionable about whether this is justified when extrapolating to what “people believe”. The problem is individual differences. Individual differences are the inescapable fact that: for all human traits, behaviors, mental states, abilities, characteristics, intuitions: people differ. Not everyone shares the same intuitions. Not everyone holds the same values. Individual Differences are present in every experimental study in the human sciences. They are, however, condemned to the denominator of our equations, with larger individual differences masking our between-group estimates and shrinking our effect sizes. Experimentation can highlight what factors exert a causal effect on intuitions and reasoning, but individual differences prevent us from making the leap to what “people believe”. In studies with large and robust experimental effects, there are individuals who understand our experimental paradigms yet disagree with the group. These are people too. We highlight examples of the confusion from experimental mean group differences are interpreted as what “people believe”. Using Experimental Philosophy as a case study, we further discuss that while Experimental Philosophy tends to have larger effect sizes than other disciplines, group distributions due to experimental manipulations in Experimental Philosophy still show over large overlap between groups. These problems are not unique to Experimental Philosophy, as it is indeed shared by all experimental human sciences. Unlike many other fields, however, Experimental Philosophy is interested in understandings people’s intuitions. We discuss how this problem can be addressed in future Experimental Philosophy studies by incorporating within-subjects experiments opposed to between-subjects experiments, highlighting these solutions using data from a replicated X-Phi study.",

          "abstract": "Personality Adjustment Through Relationships (PATR) is an integrative theory of personality that synthesizes developmental, neurobiological, relational, spiritual, and trait-based perspectives. It proposes that personality originates from neurobiological predispositions, but is shaped and expressed over time through relational and contextual influences. PATR introduces fourteen domains of functioning, developed by reorganizing validated IPIP trait scales into relationally meaningful clusters. These domains aim to capture adaptive patterns of personality expression and adjustment across contexts. The model emphasizes that neurological maturity and the individual’s environment mediate how traits are expressed, with implications for understanding growth, resilience, and dysfunction. Clinical relevance includes the potential for improved diagnostic clarity and domain-specific treatment planning. While the component scales are validated, the proposed domain structure has not yet undergone empirical testing. Plans for exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, followed by norming and application studies, are underway. PATR offers a parsimonious, testable framework for understanding personality change through relationships.\n\tKeywords: personality theory, relational psychology, trait-based assessment, neurobiological development, attachment and adjustment, IPIP, clinical application, personality change, adaptive functioning, social learning",

          "abstract": "Mathematics anxiety influences not only math performance but also career choices, often leading individuals to avoid math-intensive fields in higher education. While much research has been devoted to that relation, other factors, such as general and test anxiety, neuroticism, and math-related attitudes (e.g., math self-concept and self-efficacy) have received less attention, although they are related to (or potentially confounded with) math anxiety. In this study, we used Latent Profile Analysis to examine how different profiles of (math) anxiety and attitudes influence students' choice of study programs with varying levels of math content. Our sample consisted of 837 German university students enrolled in programs with low, medium, or high math intensity. We identified seven distinct profiles characterized by different combinations of anxiety and math attitudes. These profiles varied in their distribution across study programs and in the extent to which the presence of mathematics influenced program choice. Notably, differences in study choices were associated much more with math attitudes than with math anxiety. Furthermore, gender distribution varied across profiles, with women being overrepresented in profiles marked by lower math attitudes. These findings underscore the importance of considering math attitudes alongside math anxiety when examining students' academic and career choices.",

We illustrate that their assertions do not hold in newer datasets that use different recruitment methods and have reduced rates of inattention and acquiescence. We also show that their analysis of new experimental data suffers from methodological problems (including low statistical power and omission of key covariates), which when corrected, substantially undermines their key claim and instead indicates that, even in their own data, metacognitive biases remain linked to mental health symptoms after controlling for inattention and acquiescence.",

          "authors": "Nadine Cruz Neri; Francesca Siems-Muntoni",
          "abstract": "In grammatical gender languages, such as German, every noun has and expresses a (grammatical) gender. In many of these languages, the generic masculine form is a linguistic convention, in which the grammatical masculine form is used to refer to (groups of) individuals when gender is irrelevant, unknown or at least one male individual is present. In recent decades, it has been argued that the generic masculine form might lead to linguistic imbalances in favor of men, potentially discriminating women and non-cisgendered individuals. Thus, gender-fair language alternatives have been proposed though they are often critized. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of gender-fair language alternatives on different outcomes in German as an exemplary grammatical gender language. The findings of 38 studies suggest that gender-fair language alternatives generally have no impeding or positive effects across various domains. Overall, they do not significantly impede comprehensibility, motivation, reading time, text aesthetics, or quality. In contrast, studies indicate that such alternatives positively affect the mental representation of women and non-binary individuals, motivational outcomes and perceptions of professions, job advertisements, and candidates—particularly benefiting women and girls. Future research should aim to corroborate these findings with more diverse samples. Practical implications for language policies and educational settings are discussed.",

          "authors": "Katsumi Watanabe",
          "abstract": "The present study examined whether and how moral judgments in classic trolley dilemma scenarios changed following a major real-life event – the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. A longitudinal survey of 840 adults assessed decisions in two trolley problem scenarios (an impersonal “lever” version and a personal “footbridge” version) before and after the disaster, along with individual difference measures (Belief in a Just World, internal locus of control) and demographics. We analyzed changes in ethical choices (to sacrifice one person to save five or not), their directionality, and predictors of such changes. Results showed a significant increase in decision instability in the personal scenario: about 30% of participants altered their choice post-disaster, compared to 19% in the impersonal scenario. However, in the impersonal scenario more participants shifted from a utilitarian choice (sacrificing one) to a deontological choice (refusing to sacrifice) after the earthquake. By contrast, the personal scenario showed little net change. Belief in a just world (BJW) and internal locus of control scores significantly decreased from pre- to post-survey, indicating an erosion of just-world beliefs and personal control after the disaster. However, these changes did not directly predict who changed their moral decisions. Logistic regression analyses revealed that pre-existing individual differences played a role in moral stability: for the impersonal dilemma, higher BJW was associated with more consistent (unchanged) moral judgments, and women were more likely than men to alter their decision. In the personal dilemma, a lower internal locus of control predicted greater likelihood of changing one’s decision, and those who were students or in part-time employment showed higher odds of change than full-time workers. Model prediction was above chance but indicated substantial unexplained variance, underscoring the complexity of moral judgment dynamics. In sum, the present study provides evidence that a profound contextual event can subtly shift moral decision-making, and that certain individual dispositions confer stability in one’s ethical choices.",

          "authors": "Paul Haward",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the origins of non-literal meaning in human cognition and proposes a generative structural engine based on each concept’s central form—a reductive, domain-general format embedded within every concept we learn, which encodes a small subset of each concept’s information with a default sense of certainty. Recent work has demonstrated that people rely on form composition when generating and interpreting complex thoughts—a default mechanism for combining forms to generate meaning. The present paper tests the hypothesis that form composition operates across domain boundaries in a way that naturally and immediately generates metaphorical meanings. Across four experiments, participants judged it possible to combine central forms to produce metaphorical meaning—even when the metaphors and the concepts involved were novel. In contrast, they rejected metaphors involving non-form information as impossible. These findings suggest that form composition enables the spontaneous generation of non-literal meaning. This challenges the view that metaphor is secondary or derivative, instead positioning it as deeply interwoven with, and a natural outcome of, the very mechanisms by which humans combine concepts. The work carries broad implications for our understanding of concept learning, linguistic creativity, LLMs, and illuminates byproducts, such as the cognitive bias toward reductive reasoning across domains.",

          "authors": "Ryuhei Yasuda; Kyoshiro Sasaki",
          "abstract": "Sense of agency (SoA) refers to the feeling that one’s actions cause environmental changes. A previous study showed that SoA is enhanced when keypress-triggered motion stimuli move faster, suggesting that SoA depends on the extent of action outcomes. We examined whether the numerical magnitude of action outcomes similarly affects SoA. Participants pressed a key, which triggered the presentation of dots (Experiments 1–2) or digit values (Experiment 3), and then rated their SoA on a 10-point scale. Results showed that SoA ratings increased with greater numerical magnitude. However, Experiment 4, using an intentional binding paradigm, found that the interval between the keypress and dot onset was perceived as longer when more dots were presented. This contradicts Experiments 1–3 and suggests the observed SoA enhancement might stem from response bias (e.g., higher numerical magnitude of the outcomes leading to higher values in the rating/estimating phase). To test this, Experiment 5 replicated Experiment 2 with a reversed rating scale (1 = strongest, 10 = weakest) and again found higher scores with greater magnitude, supporting the response bias account. In contrast, the effect of motion speed was unaffected by rating direction, suggesting a genuine influence on SoA. These findings highlight the importance of carefully distinguishing true effects from mere response biases when evaluating how outcome magnitude influences SoA.",

          "abstract": "In dialogue, speakers align with their interlocutors at various linguistic levels and can adjust their utterances in light of their interlocutor’s demographic attributes (e.g., dialectal background) to facilitate communicative success (i.e., interlocutor modelling). This study further investigated whether speakers align with their interlocutor in their perspective of reference (e.g., referring to a person by their occupation or appearance; e.g., a monk or having a bold head). More importantly, we tested whether such perspective alignment, if any, is larger with a linguistically less competent interlocutor (a child interlocutor compared to an adult interlocutor in Experiment 1 and a non-native-speaking interlocutor compared to a native-speaking interlocutor in Experiment 2) and whether perspective alignment is sensitive to whether the participant and the interlocutors were engaged in a communicative task or not. In two experiments, participants carried out a communicative task with an online interlocutor (i.e., they took turns to describe a picture of a person so that the other person could click on the described picture) and a non-communicative task (they took turns to describe pictures without the need for the other person to click on the described picture) in Mandarin Chinese. Results showed that participants demonstrated greater perspective alignment a linguistically less competent interlocutors in both tasks. Such an interlocutor effect was observed in both the communicative and non-communicative tasks, though it was more pronounced in the former than in the latter. These findings support a hybrid model of interlocutor modeling is both goal-directed and implicit: while speakers tailor their utterances in light of their interlocutor’s demographics to boost communicative success, such interlocutor-sensitivity seems to additionally be driven by an implicit mechanism even in the absence of explicit communicative goals.",

Educator-child interactions were video-recorded across five target activity settings: book-reading, diapering/toileting, group, play, and mealtime. Educators’ child-directed talk was coded for temporal reference (past, present, future) and function (conversation-eliciting and conversation-directing utterances). Analyses showed that centers in the ENRICH condition had educators who used more conversation-eliciting language over time in video-recordings of book-reading and diapering/toileting compared to centers in an Active Control. Further, children in ENRICH centers talked more frequently over time during book-reading relative to children in Active Control centers. These findings highlight the potential impact of professional development programs, such as ENRICH, in enhancing both educator practices and child language use within early childhood education and care settings.",

This study aimed to test a set of pre-registered hypotheses by suggesting that loneliness alters bottom-up appraisal processes of social threat and top-down emotion regulation mechanisms. In this double-blind, within-subject study, we included 120 individuals (equally split between highly lonely and non-lonely groups) who received active (2 mA) or sham transcranial direct current stimulation over the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in separate sessions. Participants were asked to passively watch negative or neutral stimuli or to reinterpret negative stimuli to decrease their affective response. Overt behavioral responses (valence and arousal self-response) and covert physiological markers (event-related potentials [ERPs]) of the affective response in each group were analyzed separately for stimuli with and without social content. Active dlPFC stimulation enhanced neural modulation during the reappraisal of social stimuli, as reflected in a larger difference in late positive potential between reappraised and passively viewed negative images. However, the valence rating difference between these conditions suggested less effective reappraisal under active stimulation. Anodal stimulation of the left dlPFC selectively decreased self-reported emotional reactivity during the passive viewing of social stimuli in highly lonely individuals. However, this effect occurred without corresponding changes in ERP markers. Loneliness may primarily impair the self-monitoring of affective responses rather than that of regulatory mechanisms. The left dlPFC supports the accurate self-assessment of emotional states, and targeted non-invasive brain stimulation can alleviate loneliness-related difficulties in this domain.",

Data comes from a larger randomized control trial, Kia Tīmata Pai (The Best Start Study), aimed at enhancing young children’s language and self-regulation. A subset of 24 centers (110 educators and 183 children) took part in video observations at baseline and a one-year follow-up. Educator-child interactions were video-recorded across five target activity settings: book-reading, diapering/toileting, group, play, and mealtime. Educators’ child-directed talk was coded for temporal reference (past, present, future) and function (conversation-eliciting and conversation-directing utterances). Analyses showed that centers in the ENRICH condition had educators who used more conversation-eliciting language over time in video-recordings of book-reading and diapering/toileting compared to centers in an Active Control. Further, children in ENRICH centers talked more frequently over time during book-reading relative to children in Active Control centers. These findings highlight the potential impact of professional development programs, such as ENRICH, in enhancing both educator practices and child language use within early childhood education and care settings.",

          "abstract": "Across myriad, real-world contexts, we encounter the challenge of learning to take actions that bring about desirable outcomes. The theoretical framework of reinforcement learning proposes formal algorithms through which agents learn from experience to make rewarding choices. These formal models capture many aspects of reward-guided human behavior in controlled laboratory contexts. Here, we suggest that the constructs (i.e., states, actions, and rewards) and algorithms formalized within reinforcement learning theory can be operationally defined and extended to additionally account for learning in complex, natural environments. We discuss several recent examples of empirical studies that provide evidence of signatures of reinforcement learning across diverse human behaviors in everyday environments.",

          "abstract": "Background: The persistence of consciousness across continuous molecular turnover of\nneural tissue requires substrate-independent computational accounts that specify when\nconsciousness occurs and provide decisive falsification criteria. Current theories face critical\nlimitations: Integrated Information Theory has been declared \"pseudoscience\" by 124+\nresearchers due to unfalsifiability, while Global Neuronal Workspace Theory showed mixed\nempirical results in recent adversarial collaborations.\n\nFramework: We propose Attention Schema-Modulated Binding (AS-MB) theory, which reduces\naccess consciousness to a single testable criterion: consciousness arises when an attention\nschema controller elevates precision weights for hierarchical prediction-error units, creating\nbinding coherence across cortical scales that exceeds threshold θ for ≥τ ms. Formally: C* = 1\niff [Bc(t→t+τ; local, global) &gt; θ] ∧ [π driven by valid AS].\n\nInnovation: AS-MB provides (1) a single falsifiable criterion integrating multiple complex\nmechanisms, (2) specific neuroanatomical predictions targeting right TPJ as critical hub within\ndistributed attention schema networks, (3) decisive falsification criteria based on binding\ncoherence measurements, and (4) a staged validation pipeline addressing operationalization\nchallenges.\n\nPredictions: Three distinguishing predictions enable definitive theory testing: (1) TMS to\nattention schema hubs reduces binding coherence through precision modulation more than\nadjacent cortex stimulation, (2) attention schema activity leads recurrent processing by\n50-100ms with lead magnitude correlating with resulting binding coherence, and (3) high\nbinding coherence without schema control yields unconscious processing while high schema\ncontrol without coherence yields fragmented awareness.\n\nSignificance: AS-MB addresses the falsifiability crisis in consciousness research by providing\ndecisive refutation criteria while maintaining mechanistic specificity. The framework offers\nimmediate applications for consciousness assessment and establishes methodological\nstandards for theory development in post-IIT consciousness science.\n\nKeywords: consciousness, attention schema, binding coherence, predictive processing,\nfalsifiability, precision weighting",

          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is known to be associated with racing thoughts. Recent theoretical work suggests that thought dynamics could be modulated by cognitive constraints. In the present project, we operationalized the unfolding of spontaneous thoughts with a word generation paradigm. We contrasted two levels of associative constraints on word generation, and we tested the differential impact of ADHD traits on the dynamics of the resulting “trains of thoughts”. In the strong constraint condition, each word had to be semantically close to the previous one; in the weak constraint condition, participants had to say the words that spontaneously came to their mind.\n\tWe first validate the notion that the weak constraint condition mirrors free thought by comparing the word produced in the task with participants’ self-reported real-life thoughts. Using response times and semantic metrics, we then show that participants with higher ADHD traits produced more dynamic series of words, but only in the weak constraint condition mirroring free thoughts. Our study supports the idea that ADHD symptoms in the general population are associated with heightened thought volatility, and provides one of the first operationalization of the notion of cognitive constraints in spontaneous thought research.",

          "abstract": "With the growing integration of text-generating AI systems like ChatGPT into writing, understanding the factors that influence human-AI interactions and task delegation is crucial. Psychological and design-related factors shaping these behaviors remain largely unexplored. To address this research gap, we conducted two studies: a large-scale survey (N = 1007) and a randomized controlled experiment (N = 397). The survey investigated the impact of perceptions of AI systems on individuals’ willingness to delegate writing tasks to AI and revealed perceived trustworthiness and anthropomorphism as significant predictors of willingness to delegate writing tasks to AI, while there were no effects of perceptions of social agency and AI intelligence. Building on these insights, the experiment tested the causal effects of anthropomorphic design features on user perceptions, delegation behavior, and co-created text outcomes. Participants interacted with AI systems varying in anthropomorphism and completed both personal and professional writing tasks. Anthropomorphic design increased perceptions of trustworthiness, intelligence, emotional engagement, and social presence. It also led to more frequent prompting and greater adoption of AI-generated content, particularly in professional contexts, along with increased use of analytical language. However, users tended to underestimate the AI’s contribution, especially in professional tasks and when interacting with an anthropomorphic AI—raising considerations around authorship awareness and attribution. Overall, this research sheds light on the complex dynamics of human-AI interaction, offering insights into how user- and task-related factors as well as AI design influence task delegation decisions in the context of writing. Findings can inform AI design and optimize future use.",

Second, social cognitive explanations do not rely on the need for ‘dedicated’ processes for their validity and, contrary to the authors' claim, we have not posited an informationally-encapsulated social module to explain paranoia. Third, heuristic and recursive mentalising properties do not need to be at odds to explain social behaviour: the social cognitive toolbox contains but is not limited to recursive mentalising.

          "abstract": "Attentional selectivity focuses on what is currently relevant. Relevance changes frequently in everyday life, triggering rapid reassignments of attentional priorities. Such reassignments are often not associated with behavioural changes and are thus difficult to assess objectively. Here, we measured rapid, covert switches between preparatory task settings (attentional templates) in visual search, as they occurred in real time. Participants searched for colour-defined targets in search displays that appeared unpredictably either early (after 700 ms) or late (after 1500 ms) on each trial. In Experiment 1, early and late targets were defined by different colours. Participants first had to activate a template for the early target colour, then switch to a template for the late target colour if no early search display appeared. In Experiment 2, cues signalled whether the initial target template had to be maintained or changed. Template activation states were tracked with N2pc components to rapid sequences of irrelevant probes matching either the early or late target colour. A template for the early target colour was active from about 300 ms before the expected arrival of early search displays, followed by a template switch. Switches based on endogenous temporal expectations emerged more gradually in time than switches in response to external cues. Presenting cues in Experiment 2 triggered a temporary search template deactivation even when the target colour remained unchanged, indicating that template maintenance is subject to an attentional blink. Results demonstrate that rapid switches between attentional templates in visual search can be tracked with high temporal precision.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine dynamic decision-making in judo as transitions in the fighter-fighter dyadic system. We hypothesized that 1) symmetric interpersonal coordination emerges in a fight, and 2) throwing decision-making is expressed as transitions in dyadic coordination patterns and occurs due to attacking affordances in the form of relative body orientation misalignments. Twenty high-level judo athletes were paired according to official rules. In the control condition, five dyads performed displacement movements without attacking. In the experimental condition, five dyads engaged in constrained combat to throw the opponent. Participants' angular velocities were processed into relative angular velocities and running correlations (RC) as measures of orientation (mis)alignments and dyadic dynamics, respectively. Results reveal that both experimental conditions showed non-normal RC distributions (p &lt; .001), negative skewness (control: M = -0.95, SD = 0.31; experimental: M = -0.096, SD = 0.31), and higher frequencies in the symmetric interval (0 &lt; RC &lt; 1). Despite significant differences between task distributions (p &lt; .001), results supported the attraction towards symmetric coordination. Also, in the experimental condition, RC dynamics abruptly transitioned between coordination patterns with increasing relative angular velocity, as attacks disrupted coordination and defensive actions stabilized it. These results supported that attacking decision-making was induced by relative body orientation misalignments, highlighting that decisions in judo are embodied, shaped by contextual interactions, and guided by throwing affordances. This view contrasts with mentally predetermined ‘optimal’ decisions, as it is dictated by information-processing models of cognition and traditionally prescribed in practice.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\t\nBackgrounds: Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) has garnered widespread attention due to its rapidly increasing prevalence and social harm. Individuals with MUD are often accompanied by severe mood dysregulation, leading to more frequent irrational decisions such as drug-seeking behavior without consideration for consequences. Existing research indicates that the impairment of the reward system is central to the development of addiction. However, it remains unclear how the abnormal reward processing affects the mood regulation abilities of individuals with MUD. In this study, we explored the cognitive and computational mechanisms through which the subjective mood of individuals with MUD is influenced by reward information during decision-making. \nMethods: We recruited 76 male participants (27 with MUD, 49 healthy controls, HC) who completed a risk gambling task. In this task, participants were asked to choose between two options with certain or uncertain rewards. After every 2-3 gambling trials, participants also rated their momentary subjective happiness. We constructed multiple computational models to predict how various reward information (such as reward prediction error) influenced the short-term fluctuations in participants' subjective mood during risk decisions.\nResults: Individuals with MUD exhibited significantly more irrational decisions compared to the HC group. Computational modeling revealed that, compared to healthy controls, individuals with MUD showed a significantly weaker influence of various reward information (e.g., expected value, EV; reward prediction error, RPE) on their subjective mood. Importantly, the EV-and RPE-mood association predict the degree of substance abuse.\nConclusions: Our findings provide computational evidence that individuals with MUD lack effective regulation of mood by the reward system. This process leads to more substance abuse. These results shed new light into the mood issues in individuals with MUD from the perspective of reward processing, thereby helping to reduce drug.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive scientists have long debated the capabilities of non-conscious perception, defined as the level of processing of external stimuli that people do not consciously experience. While much is known about non-conscious visual perception, the auditory modality has received less focus. Here, we examine the level of processing for audible and intelligible spoken words that participants did not notice during the performance of another difficult visual task. Using repeated occurrences of such inattentional deafness, alongside objective and subjective awareness probes, we measure the processing of supraliminal, but undetected words. In two pre-registered EEG experiments (N = 67), we show a unique, temporally late, neural response that differentiates words from pseudowords in the absence of conscious awareness. Additionally, an exploratory analysis found a behavioral interference of undetected words with visual task performance. Both results were contingent on the relevance of word detection to participants, implying that auditory non-conscious processing is not automatic but goal-dependent. Overall, our results support flexible capabilities for non-conscious speech perception, suggesting the ability to integrate acoustic information over time.",

Necessity effects are quantified as the size of the (semi-) empty space. Ding and Kuvaas reported statistically significant necessity effects, as estimated by NCA, and concluded that basic psychological needs are necessary for employees’ optimal development. However, here we show that the necessity effects reported by Ding and Kuvaas were not significantly stronger than could be expected due to correlations between the variables. Therefore, it is premature to claim that basic psychological needs are necessary for employees’ optimal development and the conclusion by Ding and Kuvaas in this regard can be challenged. We recommend researchers using NCA to extend their analyses by estimating a “range of spuriousness”, i.e., how strong the necessity effect can be expected to be due to the correlation between X and Y. If the estimated necessity effect falls within (or below) the range of spuriousness, researchers should refrain from concluding that X is necessary for Y.",

          "abstract": "Anticipation is essential for successfully performing in dynamic environments, yet it is often framed as mentally inferring a future state without considering how action is embodied and embedded. This paper introduces an action-based approach to anticipation and team synergies based on perception-action couplings. Using football as a case study, we measured anticipation as the players’ prospective coordination with the match environment towards task objectives. We explored how team synergic behavior emerged from players’ anticipatory movements, guiding the teams’ ability to maintain goal directed behavior. Defender-ball-goal angles were computed from game positional data and submitted to cluster phase analysis to develop a team coherence model expressing how defenders collectively blocked the progression of the ball towards goal. Cross-correlation analysis measured defender-ball coupling strength and delay (ρ), capturing how defenders coordinated with the ball to sustain and interchange among blocking roles, so the team could maintain coherence. Results showed that higher coupling strengths (ρ) were associated with defenders’ anticipatory movements in relation to the ball, exhibited by negative coupling delays (median lag = -1.02 s). This indicates that defenders coordinated their movements with future ball positions to assume and interchange among blocking roles. Regression analysis showed a strong association (R² = .74) between blocking role interchanges and team coherence stability. This action-based approach helped clarify how perception-action is coordinated among team members to foster team synergies, offering a comprehensive framework for studying anticipation as an embodied and embedded human skill, while providing a tool for its broader application across group performance domains.",

          "abstract": "This conceptual study aims to clarify the psychological mechanism underlying \nnegative thinking, positing it as a distortion in subjective value judgment that \nprofoundly impacts an individual's psychological well-being. Drawing upon prior \nconceptual studies on the mechanisms of value, fear, and discrimination , this paper \nreconstructs negative thinking as a reactionary mechanism to existential \ninsecurity—one that emerges when the subconscious mind interprets the self as \n“worthless,” and fails to adequately discharge the associated emotions. Departing \nfrom conventional quantitative methods, it explores the intricate interplay of value \nperception, emotional processing, fear response, and the pivotal role of \nunconditional love in shaping one's confidence in existential worth. This paper delves \ninto how certain personality traits, when coupled with accumulated stress and \nnegative emotional suppression, can lead to depressive states characterized by \nimpaired logical reasoning and a sense of being trapped in a \"thought cage\". It \nfurther examines the often-overlooked influence of emotional contagion from others, \narguing that while its precise scientific mechanisms are still evolving, its experiential \nreality significantly contributes to the perpetuation of negative emotional states. By \nintegrating these dynamics and providing precise functional definitions of key \nconcepts, this work offers a coherent framework for understanding the core \npsychological dynamics of negative thinking and proposes practical pathways for its \novercoming, including the importance of self-acceptance, mutual support, healthy \nemotional expression, and early psychological education.

          "abstract": "This paper introduces EgoSafe Selection, a psychological and philosophical extension of Darwin’s natural selection. While traditional evolutionary theory explains the survival of biological traits through reproductive fitness, it does not fully account for the persistence of socially rewarded traits in modern human societies — traits often shaped by fear, conformity, and the need for ego validation rather than adaptive advantage. EgoSafe Selection proposes that individuals and cultures unconsciously favor traits that provide emotional or social safety, such as dominance, status, wealth signaling, and behavioral conformity, in order to manage collective anxiety and social survival.\n\nThis theory draws from evolutionary psychology, social behavior, and spiritual philosophy, positioning fear — not just survival — as a major driver in human selection. It critiques the idea that all socially dominant traits today are biologically adaptive, and instead argues that many are perpetuated because they ease social discomfort or affirm societal norms.\n\nFinally, the theory points toward a conscious alternative. Through awareness of our ego-based selection patterns, individuals can begin to make choices not driven by fear or social pressure, but by presence, love, and freedom. Love, in this context, is not transactional but foundational — an expression of unity and oneness that transcends ego, separation, and judgment. EgoSafe Selection, then, is not just a critique of unconscious evolution but a call toward conscious human transformation.\n\nChatGPT was used solely for text modulation and language refinement.

          "abstract": "Recent research in speech perception highlights categorization consistency—the degree of trial-by-trial variability in response—as a more informative metric of individual differences in speech categorization over how gradient underlying category structure individuals have. However, its relevance to broader language functions remains unknown. In Experiment 1, English-speaking adults (n=57) completed a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task, rating a speech continuum on a continuous scale, alongside two language assessments. Results showed that a greater consistency in speech categorization strongly predicted better language abilities (accounting for 29% of the variance), whereas categorization gradiency showed no such relationship. Experiment 2 (n=76) added a VAS task in which participants performed the same task with images from a visual continuum, to determine whether the observed effects reflected domain-general categorization mechanisms. Replicating and extending the findings of Experiment 1, speech categorization consistency again emerged as a robust predictor of language outcomes, with an even larger effect size (~40% of the variance). Critically, commonality regression revealed that a substantial proportion of variance in language performance was uniquely attributable to speech, but not visual, categorization consistency. These provide compelling evidence for a speech-specific and robust link between speech categorization consistency and general language function.",

Psychological research has often been one-sidedly focused on tackling health risk factors or maladaptive traits, disregarding the potential of fostering positive resources such as character strengths when aiming to influence health trajectories. We examine the predictive validity of character strengths for health-related outcomes using machine learning algorithms.\nMethods\nUsing a sample of 4,830 adults from five countries, we examined the validity of character strengths for the prediction of 12 health-related indicators (e.g., sleep quality, feeling anxious, or healthy dieting) across two levels of measurement (items vs. scales), modeling approaches (multiple regression vs. three machine learning algorithms), and cultural contexts.\nResults\nThe outcomes could be predicted by character strengths with R² values ranging from .02 for the prediction of poor physical health to .28 for poor mental health. Character strength items rarely out-predicted their overarching scales. Machine learning algorithms were able to enhance predictive performance by means of regularization, but the results did not point to meaningful non-linear or interaction effects. The largest differences in predictive performance were found when evaluating models across culturally dissimilar countries.\nConclusions\nCultural context proved an important moderator of the association between character strengths and mental as well as physical health indicators. In contrast, the incremental value of character strengths at the item level or including complex relationships in the modeling compared to simpler modeling approaches is negligible.",

Further, Study 2 provides empirical support for the previously theorized\ncomponents of social contribution, providing evidence that self-efficacy and social\nresponsibility underlie this construct in political contexts.

          "abstract": "The current child and adolescent mental health crisis necessitates both empirical and theoretical innovation. This review presents a new framework conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC) - formulated from a transdiagnostic preventative perspective. The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours, including emotional awareness and regulation of distraction, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with the intertwined activity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to activity in the theory of mind, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

          "abstract": "This metascientific project studied the replicability of Bem Experiment 1, which had claimed a precognitive effect, i.e., the ability to successfully guess the outcome of future random events (Bem. J Pers Soc Psychol. 2011;100: 407-25). The use of advanced methodologies—based on the advanced meta-experimental protocol (AMP) and transparent psi project (TPP) procedures—reduced the risk of false discoveries as a function of (i) confirmation bias, (ii) non-transparency, and (iii) intrinsic measurement bias. The combined AMP-TPP test strategy performed three replication studies with a total of 26,483 participants resulting in N = 420,472 critical trials. Study 1 failed to replicate the precognitive effect. An exploratory analysis of Study 1 suggested an effect in the opposite direction than was originally predicted (49.48% ± 0.26 SE; N = 37,836). Study 2 confirmed this exploratory result using a high-powered replication design (49.65% ± 0.14 SE; p = 0.013; N = 127,000). Study 3 was unable to replicate the result from Study 2 (50.07% ± 0.11 SE; p = 0.496; N = 217,800). The result of Study 2 represents a rare example in psi research of the successful replication of an exploratory result using a confirmatory protocol. The source of the one-time confirmed anomalous result in Study 2 remains to be identified. This result presents either (i) a psi-derived anomaly that defies known physical laws, or (ii) a method-derived anomaly, e.g., a false-positive statistical finding. Using conventional standards, based on the lack of replicability in Study 3 and absence of an accepted scientific theory, the second scenario appears more plausible. This AMP-TPP metascientific project demonstrated the use of advanced controls for assessing the reliability of the employed scientific process. This project shows how rigor-enhancing test strategies can improve the reliability, not only of psi research, but any type of weak-effects experiments, including in psychology.",

Across two experiments, participants were presented with everyday communicative scenarios with their corresponding real-world outcomes (i.e., every meaning’s truth-value). Participants’ perceived commitment to each stream of meaning (explicit or implicit) was measured through a direct commitment probe, along with their overall trust in the speaker. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the truth-value of the implicit content influenced participants’ perceived commitment not only to the implicit meaning, but also to the explicit meaning, despite the latter being independently true/false. The effect was asymmetrical, as the truth-value of the explicit content influenced commitment to the explicit meaning only. Experiment 2 examined this asymmetry by manipulating the subjectivity of the explicit content, which resulted in a moderate shift towards symmetry when the explicit content was objective.

          "abstract": "This tutorial introduces Factored Structural Equation Modeling (FSEM), an alternative to classic multivariate SEM, and demonstrates its implementation in the Blimp software and the rblimp R package. FSEM reconceptualizes the joint distribution of observed and latent variables as a set of univariate and multivariate submodels—each specified via simple regression equations—and treats latent variables as missing data to be imputed via Bayesian data augmentation. This approach seamlessly accommodates combinations of continuous (normal and nonnormal), binary, ordinal, nominal, count, and two-part variables; interactions; nonlinear effects; heteroscedasticity; and multilevel data structures without violating distributional assumptions. We first outline the theoretical foundations of factored regression specification and its connection to the probability chain rule. We then describe the Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation and missing-data imputation algorithms that underlie FSEM. Next, we present a series of illustrative models—ranging from basic confirmatory factor analysis to complex dynamic, multilevel, and hybrid generalized-linear-SEM applications—providing Blimp syntax excerpts and a real-data example. We conclude by discussing practical considerations, limitations, and directions for future methodological research.

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that frontal hemispheric asymmetry may underlie various mental health disorders, and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), which reflects cortical activity and inactivity between the left and frontal lobes, could be a potential biomarker for these conditions. Some studies suggest that a single session of EF (EF) may modulate brain activity; however, it is not yet completely clear whether a single session of EF can shift FAA. We designed a preregistered, triple-blind randomized-controlled study to address this gap in the literature. Sixty-six healthy individuals (Mage = 24.55, SDage = 7.63) were recruited for the experiment. First, we assessed baseline resting-state FAA over a 10-minute period, consisting of five minutes each under eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Subsequently, participants were assigned to one of two 30-minute-long EF protocols, designed to modulate cortical activity by enhancing activation in either the right or left frontal hemisphere. FAA was reassessed immediately after the completion of the feedback intervention. The results indicated that a single session of EF does not modulate FAA; therefore, it should be considered with caution regarding causal inferences. However, the absence of effects may also be attributed to the form of feedback used, as well as individual differences in neurocognitive and psychological profiles.",

Approaches focusing on shared conceptual space suggested that the presence of synchronous or coordinated behaviors indicates the extent of conceptual alignment and thus, predicts communication success. Here we test this claim.\nMethods: Pairs of participants solved a computer-mediated communicative task involving verbal negotiation (“Bargaining Game”), while data of head motion, pupil size, and gaze direction were collected, and measures of prosody and structural speech characteristics were extracted from the recorded verbal interactions. Communication success and efficacy were assessed using objective task performance measures and subjective evaluations from the participants.\nResults: 1) interlocutors coordinated multiple aspects of their behavior, 2) objective measures of task performance were predicted by gaze pattern coordination, and 3) some forms of interpersonal coordination positively affected the participants’ subjective experience of their partner and the interaction.\nDiscussion: The results indicate that interpersonal coordination between interlocutors is prevalent across multiple modalities and it facilitates some aspects of the interaction - although, a mechanistic role of interpersonal coordination in communication was not specifically supported by the data.",

          "abstract": "Background Next-generation sequencing technologies are now routinely used in the NHS to identify rare genetic conditions (RGCs) in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). As such, the proportion of children diagnosed in early childhood (&lt;6years) is rising rapidly. The risk of mental health conditions in this group is high, however anecdotal accounts suggest little mental health support is provided. The present study aimed to (1) define the challenges and facilitators in accessing mental health support for families caring for RGC IDD children and (2) explore family and healthcare professional priorities for mental health support. Focus groups were conducted with parents of RGC children and neurodisability medical professionals. De-identified transcripts of interviews were analysed using Framework Analysis. Eleven parents of children with RGC and IDD, and four professionals participated in the focus groups.\n\nResults The framework analysis identified general healthcare challenges related to having an RGC, including an absence of information in ‘the big black hole’ of the post-diagnostic void, ‘falling between the cracks’ and being stuck in a loop of referrals. It also identified barriers that were specific to accessing mental health support, including difficulties in understanding how to navigate services, diagnostic overshadowing (where the RGC diagnosis acted as an exclusion criterion for accessing services) and the emotional burden of seeking mental health support. Facilitators in accessing mental health support included parental resilience, happenstance, finding key advocates and getting other diagnoses that were more widely recognised. Parent and practitioner priorities for support were aligned. They included support for families post-genetic diagnosis, training and education for healthcare professionals, early mental health support and care-co-ordination. \n\nConclusion children with RGC diagnosed in early childhood and their caregivers face unique challenges in accessing mental health support for their child. Innovative approaches are needed to support parents caring for an IDD child diagnosed with RGC in early infancy and to provide better training for professionals on RGC management.",

While traditional natural and sexual selection focus on traits that enhance survival and reproduction, Ego‑Safe Selection argues that in human societies, traits often persist because they provide emotional safety, social validation, or ego comfort—rather than biological fitness. These traits are selected culturally through imitation, social norms, and fear-based avoidance, shaping preferences for partners, leaders, or behaviors that feel non-threatening or ego-affirming. This theory reframes evolution as driven not only by external pressures like predators or competition, but also by internal ones—such as fear of rejection, need for group approval, and emotional security. By integrating insights from evolutionary psychology, attachment theory, and cultural evolution, Ego‑Safe Selection offers a new lens to understand how psychological and social environments influence which traits are preserved and passed on.\nChatGPT was used solely for text modulation and language refinement.

          "abstract": "Background &amp; Aim: Studies have produced inconsistent findings when exploring relationships between social media usage (SMU) and wellbeing. This likely reflects the vast heterogeneity in subjective measures of SMU, coupled with a lack of consideration for the factors that influence different styles of SMU and drive individual differences in susceptibility to their effects. To advance our understanding of social media effects, the present study used a novel objective measure of individuals’ behaviour on social networking sites to examine whether distinct SMU styles are related differentially to social competencies that support real-world social interaction, and if these user characteristics mediate relationships between SMU styles and indices of psychosocial wellbeing. Methods: A total of 509 participants (261 females; Mage = 31.00, 18-71 years) completed the Social Networking Site Behaviour Task that measured styles of SMU objectively, the Multidimensional Social Competency Scale that captured self-reported competencies in seven domains of interpersonal behaviour, and four subjective measures of psychosocial wellbeing. Structural Equation Modelling was used to determine if social competencies differed among distinct SMU styles and mediated relationships with psychosocial variables. Findings: We identify interactive, reactive and passive SMU styles, reveal that users expressing these distinct styles differ on several social competencies, and discover that these competencies mediate differential relationships between SMU styles and indices of psychosocial wellbeing. Discussion: Just as individual differences in social competencies manifest in face-to-face interactions, we suggest that they also underpin SMU styles and shape individual differences in susceptibility to their effects on wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in wellbeing research emphasize its multifaceted nature, traditionally defined by hedonic and eudaimonic approaches. However, growing cross-cultural and empirical studies suggest this dichotomy may be insufficient to capture the diversity and complexity of human flourishing. This study investigates harmony as a distinct and essential dimension of wellbeing beyond life satisfaction and meaning in life. Drawing on data from culturally diverse samples in the United States and Hong Kong, confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling were applied to compare one-, two-, and three-factor models encompassing life satisfaction, meaning in life, and harmony. Across both samples, the three-factor exploratory structural equation modeling model showed the best fit, supporting the empirical distinctiveness of harmony. The findings provide strong empirical evidence for a tripartite model of wellbeing and support harmony as a core dimension of wellbeing. The results underscore the importance of expanding wellbeing frameworks to include culturally sensitive constructs and suggest a more holistic and integrative approach to conceptualizing and operationalizing wellbeing —one that moves beyond the hedonic–eudaimonic dichotomy— and opens new directions for future research, measurement, and interventions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Both visual and motor experiences impact action prediction, yet through potentially different mechanisms. Having physical experience with an action is thought to engage motor simulative processes, potentially activating the watcher’s motor system in an effector-specific manner, aiding prediction. Leveraging baseball’s unique specialization demands, we assessed pitch discrimination in athletes with predominantly visual experience seeing pitches (hitters, n = 41; 7 = left-handed hitters) and motor experience producing pitches (pitchers, n = 42; 9 = left-handed). Videos of right-handed (RH) pitches, with temporal occlusion applied at or after ball release, of three different pitches, were used to assess pitch prediction accuracy. Two versions of each video clip were shown; the original RH clips were “flipped” to make the pitcher appear to throw left-handed (LH). Pitchers and hitters had reliable responses and showed high accuracy (~70%) and discriminability. Pitchers were more discriminatory than hitters when contrasting two pitch types with the same initial trajectory and speed, but different postural cues (curveballs and changeups; d’ pitchers = 2.18, hitters = 1.88). Although there was the predicted interaction for the pitchers when comparing LH and RH pitchers watching LH and RH videos (p&lt;.05), only LH pitchers showed a trend for a same-side, LH video advantage (p=.06). Because pitchers did not differ in accuracy from hitters, despite a lack of visual experience seeing and responding, this suggests that their motor experience aided predictions. However, there was only partial support for a simulation explanation based on effector specificity (due to absence of any differences in RH pitchers).",

          "abstract": "Stable nations require strangers to coordinate and cooperate despite regional, cultural, religious, educational, and class differences. We quantified how far apart cultural differences between these groups actually are and then used them to predict various measures of conflict within each country. Using the Cultural Fixation Index (CFST) on World Values Survey data (more than 260,000 participants; 95 countries; 2005–2022), we measured cultural distance between groups defined by their region, ethnicity, religion, education level, income level, and subjective social class. A pre-registered multiverse analysis (54,600 model specifications; 100 model families; 6 demographic groupings; 6 outcome measures) showed only one robust pattern of negative societal outcomes: larger cultural distance between geographic regions predicts more corruption, weaker democracy, lower social mobility, and greater risk of civil conflict. Distances between ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic groups were mostly benign, and educational distance was often associated with better outcomes. The results imply that what matters is not diversity per se, but whether culturally distinct groups are geographically segregated and therefore less likely to regularly interact to negotiate the cultural traits needed for cooperation and coordination.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we introduce Madonna Sabia, a new archetype born from the conscious integration of the polarized images of the “pure” Madonna and the “sexualized” Whore, long described by psychoanalysis as the Madonna-Whore Complex. Madonna Sabia embodies the woman who unites virtue, discipline, erotic power, wisdom, and emotional congruence, inspiring without manipulation, embracing authenticity, and inviting men and women to reconcile with their own projections.\n\nBy presenting Madonna Sabia, we offer a transformative model for psychology, psychoanalysis, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, business, and social sciences. We propose not only a theoretical construct, but a practical framework for therapeutic, technological, and cultural applications that enable true integration of the feminine and masculine, expanding human capacity for conscious, ethical, and inspiring relationships.\n\nMadonna Sabia is not merely an idea: she is the mirror where fragmented perceptions of women can heal, and where the essence of love becomes a source of strength instead of fear.",

          "abstract": "Darwin described how traits enhancing survival or reproduction are passed on. In human societies, however, many traits—like height, wealth, dominance—persist not due to objective adaptive value but because they ease collective fear or boost ego. I call this “Ego‑Safe Selection.” It reframes evolutionary psychology by recognizing that cultural and psychological forces, not just biology, shape the traits we pass down.\nKey Difference Between Darwin's Theory and My Theory (Ego-Safe Selection)\n[1] Darwin: Traits are passed on because they help an organism survive and reproduce in the natural world.\nMe: Traits are passed on because they help individuals feel safe, accepted, or validated in social and emotional terms.\n\n[2] Darwin: Focuses on external factors — environment, predators, physical fitness.\nMe: Focuses on internal, social factors — fear of rejection, ego protection, social approval.\n\n[3] Darwin: Reproductive success is based on physical fitness or attractiveness.\nMe: Reproductive success is often based on social conformity, emotional safety, or status approval.\n\n[4] Darwin: Evolution is shaped by biological advantage.\nMe: Evolution is shaped by psychological and emotional preference in the minds of others.\n\n[5] Darwin: Sexual selection is seen as a branch of natural selection for passing on “desirable” traits.\nMe: Sexual and social selection is driven by fear and ego — what people choose not out of love, but out of emotional survival.\n\nSummary:\nDarwin emphasized biological survival.\nI emphasize psychological survival.\n\nMy theory expands natural selection into a deeper human truth:\n“We didn’t just evolve based on who was strongest. We evolved based on who made others feel safest — emotionally, socially, and egotistically.”\n\nI would love to mention some references and inspirations\n\nCharles Darwin, On the Origin of Species (1859) – The foundational theory of natural and sexual selection.\n\nSigmund Freud, The Ego and the Id (1923) – For early explorations of ego and human drives.\n\nEvolutionary Psychology (general) – For connecting biology, behavior, and mate selection.\n\nTaoism (via Lao Tzu) – For the concept of flexibility, yielding, and quiet strength in nature and humanity.\n\nYuval Noah Harari, Sapiens – For ideas about human storytelling and imagined realities shaping survival.\n\nThese works helped shape the context in which “Ego-Safe Selection” was conceptualized, though all ideas, structure, and language in this paper are original.",

          "abstract": "With the global increase in smartphone use, parental technoference – disruptions in parent-child interactions due to digital devices – has been shown to negatively impact children’s development, particularly on parental responsiveness and children’s emotional wellbeing. The current study is the first to investigate the real-time effects of parental smartphone use on 9-month-old infants’ object learning during live interactions. Using head-mounted eye trackers, N= 21 infant-caregiver dyads engaged with novel toy objects in two conditions (familiarisation phase): a Joint-Attention (JA) condition, where caregivers introduced objects while engaging in joint attention with the infant, and a Smartphone (SP) condition, where caregivers introduced objects without looking at the infant but instead watching videos on a smartphone. Immediately after each condition (recognition phase), infants’ object recognition was assessed through a preferential looking test, where a familiarised object was presented side by side with a novel object. Prior to the interactions, caregivers completed the Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire. During the familiarisation phase infants showed no difference in total looking time at objects between conditions. In the recognition phase, while in the JA condition infants showed a familiarity preference for the previously seen object, in the SP condition they did not show any preference for either object, and this difference between conditions was significant. Interestingly, the parental-reported mobile phone use scores did not predict infants’ object recognition performance. These findings underscore the negative impact of parenting technoference on infants’ object learning, highlighting the need for further research into how technoference influences early learning processes.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between childhood trauma and personality traits among Indian college students, with a focus on how different trauma subtypes influence the Big Five personality dimensions. A sample of 250 students aged 18–24 completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire–Short Form (CTQ-SF) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44). Statistical analyses including Pearson’s correlation, MANOVA, hierarchical regression, and moderation via PROCESS Macro revealed that emotional and physical neglect were the most prevalent and developmentally impactful forms of trauma. Emotional neglect significantly predicted higher neuroticism (β = .38, p &lt; .001), while both forms of neglect were associated with lower conscientiousness and agreeableness. Gender was found to moderate the impact of neglect on conscientiousness, with male students showing greater personality disruption. These findings highlight the enduring psychological consequences of early emotional deprivation and the importance of gender-sensitive, trauma-informed interventions in university mental health frameworks. The study underscores the developmental weight of neglect and invites reconsideration of how trauma is conceptualized in personality formation within emerging adult populations in non-Western contexts.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a crucial yet understudied skill with significant implications for learning and information-seeking. Prior research identifies question complexity as a key predictor of question creativity and problem-solving ability. However, little is known about how accurately individuals assess their own question complexity. Across three studies, participants generated questions and self-rated their complexity and creativity. We then compared their self-ratings to objective computational model scores. In Study 1 (N = 100), self-rated question complexity showed a weak correlation with model ratings (r = .151). Study 2 (N = 100) replicated and strengthened this relation (r = .206), revealing a stronger correlation for question creativity (r = .321). We also found bias effects for complexity: participants underestimated the complexity of their high-level questions and overestimated their low-level ones. In Study 3 (N = 101), participants read a training brief before rating, which significantly improved accuracy in self-assessing complexity (r = .453) and creativity (r = .487) and eliminated overestimation. Our study highlights the challenges in self-assessment of questions and prominent cognitive biases. Crucially, our study also shows that brief explanations of question complexity substantially improve self-assessment accuracy, highlighting practical implications for educational strategies aimed at enhancing metacognitive awareness of question-asking ability.",

          "abstract": "Influential perspectives on polarization in the United States imply that partisans will be more willing to degrade democracy when they are ideologically aligned with their own party and  negatively oriented toward the opposing party. But psychological accounts of political ideology suggest that conservatives will be especially anti-democratic regardless of partisanship.  Integrating insights from these areas, we argue that there are reasons to expect paradoxical partisan asymmetries in the ideological correlates of democratic attitudes. Across numerous surveys we find that cultural conservatism and out-party favorability are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Democrats (but not Republicans), while left-leaning economic attitudes are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Republicans (but not Democrats). These findings provide context for understanding how polarization might impact American democracy. They also suggest that increased centrality of sociocultural conflict and Republican cultivation of a right-wing populist reputation might sort anti-democratic Americans into the Republican Party.",

This review synthesizes recent evidence linking the DMN directly to subjective valuation and value-based decisions. Anatomically and functionally, core DMN regions—including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex—overlap extensively with the brain’s valuation system, suggesting shared computational roles. Recent studies further identify distinct posterior cingulate cortex subregions involved in simulation, memory retrieval, and evaluation. Additionally, the DMN dynamically interacts with reward-related and control networks—such as the ventral striatum and hippocampus—during value-guided social decisions. These interactions vary with motivational context and individual differences, revealing how subjective value emerges across diverse situations. Disruptions in these dynamics occur in aging and psychiatric conditions, linking DMN dysfunction to maladaptive decision-making. Together, these findings position the DMN as an integrative hub critical for internal valuation and goal-directed behavior.",

One challenge is that there are relatively few systematic efforts to explore possible appraisals and the overall contexts in which these experiences take place. We report a validation and extension of a previously designed set of follow-up and appraisal questions to the Inventory of Nonordinary Experiences, with a sample of Brazilian participants (N = 160). After validation, we administered these follow-up questions and appraisals in a general population sample (N = 5,117) in which individuals reported on one of 38 nonordinary experiences. Overall, the patterns suggest that individual response options are normally distributed, suggesting that there are several shared interpretations across a wide range of diverse experiences in the general population.

Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts.

Comparability issues are particularly salient across individuals with varying weight status. In this commentary, we discuss systematic discrepancies between HR-based (relative intensity) and acceleration-based (absolute intensity) classifications of MVPA among individuals with greater adiposity. Using Fitbit data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we illustrate how HR-based PA intensity classification may indicate higher MVPA in youth with greater adiposity despite lower step counts and light PA levels. We highlight implications for research design, public health surveillance, messaging, policy, and interventions. We also call for greater transparency, standardized methodologies, and integrative measurement approaches to ensure more accurate assessment of PA behavior.",

          "abstract": "Creativity is increasingly recognized as a core competency for the 21st century, making its development a priority in education, research, and industry. To effectively cultivate creativity, researchers and educators need reliable and accessible assessment tools. Recent software developments have significantly enhanced the administration and scoring of creativity measures; however, existing software often requires expertise in experiment design and computer programming, limiting their accessibility to many educators and researchers. In the current work, we introduce CAP—the Creativity Assessment Platform—a free web application for building creativity assessments, collecting data, and automatically scoring responses (cap.ist.psu.edu). CAP allows users to create custom creativity assessments in 10 languages using a simple, point-and-click interface, selecting from tasks such as the Short Story Task, Drawing Task, and Scientific Creative Thinking Test. Users can automatically score task responses using machine learning models trained to match human creativity ratings—with multilingual capabilities, including the new Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS), a large language model achieving strong prediction of human creativity ratings in 10 languages. CAP also provides a centralized dashboard to monitor data collection, score assessments, and automatically generate text for a Method section based on the study’s tasks, metrics, and instructions—with a single click—promoting transparency and reproducibility in creativity assessment. Designed for ease-of-use, CAP aims to democratize creativity measurement, for researchers, educators, and everyone in-between.",

          "abstract": "Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments is partly due to problems with auditory selective attention—a process that enhances the neural representation of target sounds over competing sounds. Neurofeedback training that targets auditory selective attention shows promise to improve speech-in-noise perception in normal-hearing individuals. For such training to be effective, the attention decoding algorithm must be accurate, generalizable, and explainable, even for brief, few-second-long EEG signals.\nPrior attention decoding algorithms used for neurofeedback have low accuracy and lack generalizability, despite their explainability. To address these shortcomings, this study developed three attention decoders based on well-established algorithms: forward linear model, backward linear model, and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We assessed the decoder’s accuracy in classifying selective attention from single-trial EEG and its generalizability to untrained participants. For explainability, we examined spatial and temporal features critical for decoding.\nOur findings indicate that decoding selective attention to short, co-located sound is feasible with both linear and CNN models, each offering unique benefits. The CNN showed superior accuracy (72.3%) and cross-subject generalizability compared to linear models (64.9%). Conversely, linear models provided clearer neurophysiological explainability, aligning spatially and temporally with established evidence for attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses.\nThese results support that linear models are more suited for neurofeedback, where understanding the basis of decoding is crucial for effective training. Meanwhile, the CNN remains a strong candidate for applications requiring high performance. This research provides a foundation for developing evidence-based rehabilitation protocols for speech-in-noise perception, enabling interventions grounded in measurable neural changes.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "abstract": "When defining concepts for scientific work, researchers consider various desiderata (desired characteristics) that are derived from higher level meta-desiderata regarding accepted goals of scientific work and how to act towards achieving them. Although these desiderata are often implicit, they significantly impact researchers' processes of defining and selecting concepts, ultimately influencing research outcomes, communication, and knowledge production. We evaluate the selection and application of desiderata for defining cross-disciplinary concepts dependent upon higher level meta-desiderata working from the example that if one believes that science ought to strive for providing systematic knowledge about the world (level 1), and if one believes that the ease of communication will positively affect the process of attaining that kind of knowledge (level 2), then one ought to strive for definitions of concepts that provide as much as possible of the list of features we argue for (level 3). Using psychological concepts as our examples we offer a proposed list of six desiderata: precision, specificity, theory-neutrality, explanation- neutrality, operational ease, folk-level understanding. The goal is to facilitate researchers' consideration of appropriate desiderata and, where their meta-desiderata match the example provided, promote the adoption and utilization of these desiderata in their work. Given the backdrop of conceptual change and conceptual creep, this aspect, though less discussed, plays a crucial role in shaping our research and knowledge production.",

In this commentary we show that the reported null effect was due to the inappropriate pooling of two distinct effect types into a single estimate. This clarification is necessary because meta-analyses are often perceived as the ‘gold standard’ of evidence, and numerous papers have cited Chan and Albarracín1 as evidence that corrections have little-to-no effect on science-relevant misinformation (35% by our estimates; see Supplementary Table 1).",

We review the psychology of information spread, or the psychology of “virality.” Similar types of information tend to spread in many contexts, both online and offline. This is likely because similar psychological processes drive information spread across contexts. We explain how these psychological processes interact with structural features of information environments, including norms, networks, and incentive structures. Surprisingly, widely shared content is often not widely liked—a phenomenon called “the paradox of virality.” We discuss the strengths and limitations of the virality metaphor. We also discuss future directions for the field, such as leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence to better understand how information spreads across cultures and contexts.",

          "abstract": "Food learning in early life largely relies on social learning. Previous research has shown that infants learn something is edible when they directly observe someone else eating it. However, the role of other forms of food-related social information remains largely unknown. Food processing actions (e.g., chopping, mashing) are essential components of human food behaviors and a ubiquitous part of infants’ everyday lives. Here we examined whether infants (i) differentially attend to eating and food processing actions compared to control actions and (ii) learn that novel foods are edible after observing eating and food processing actions performed with them. To do this, we tested 12-month-olds’ responses to three different actions: eating, food processing, and a food-irrelevant control. First, we showed infants side-by-side videos of an adult performing two different actions with novel foods across three between-subjects conditions and measured their gaze and pupil dilation with an eye-tracker. Then, we offered infants the novel foods shown in the videos and measured their choices and eating behaviors. Our eye-tracking results indicate that infants differentially attend to eating and food processing actions relative to the control action, and show increased pupil dilation for the control action relative to the two food-relevant actions. When asked to choose which novel food they could eat, infants chose the novel food they saw an actor eat, but only when that eating action was paired with the control action. These findings help identify important mechanisms that increase acceptance of healthy foods early in life.",

Results showed that overstimulation peaked in the early evening and in the presence of others. A cross-over effect depending on SPS levels was found. More sensitive individuals reported higher levels of overstimulation when auditory and visual stimuli were rated as unpleasant, when fatigued, or in a negative mood. Yet, more sensitive individuals reported lower levels of overstimulation with momentary pleasant auditory and visual stimuli, when not fatigued, and in a positive mood at the current moment. Everyone, but especially individuals high in SPS, might benefit from interventions preventing high levels of fatigue, increasing positive mood and the pleasantness of sensory stimuli in their daily life to reduce feelings of overstimulation.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

The present study investigates whether social attunement (SA) plays a role in higher alcohol use in adolescence as well as a lower alcohol use when aging. \nMethods: This online study included 683 alcohol users (16 – 81yrs). Participants completed a SA Questionnaire, an Implicit SA task (ISAT), and measures of alcohol use. The ISAT measured SA as the change in willingness to drink in response to peer feedback between two blocks of images representing social alcohol, social non-alcohol, and social non-drinking settings. Linear regressions were conducted to assess the association between SA and alcohol use, and the role of age and gender in these associations. \nResults: Interactions between age and SA predicted alcohol use, specifically in social situations involving non-alcoholic or no drinks. In social non-alcohol drinking settings, SA was positively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became negative in older individuals. Contrastingly, in the social non-drinking condition, SA was negatively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became positive in older individuals.\nDiscussion: Depending on age and social setting, SA can be both a risk- or protective factor for alcohol use.",

We find that negative, group-oriented, and dominance-oriented content are consistently the best predictors of engagement, positive content specifically predicts likes, and the effect of threat-related content varies depending on engagement type (e.g., likes vs. replies). We also examine the content of replies and quotes and find it usually mirrors and amplifies the sentiment of the original tweets (e.g., positive/negative/polarizing tweets generate more positive/negative/polarizing responses).

The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Non-suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is a highly prevalent transdiagnostic behavior among treatment-seeking individuals. The use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) shows clinical potential for engaging patients outside the therapy room, but the utility for individuals who self-injure remains unclear. This prospective study evaluates self-reported benefits (e.g., increased self-insight and self-efficacy) and challenges (e.g., beep disturbances and emotional discomfort) associated with using EMA among individuals reporting past-month NSSI at treatment intake.\nMethods:  In this cohort study, 124 treatment-seeking adolescents and adults who self-injure completed baseline assessments and participated in a 28-day EMA protocol with six daily self-monitoring assessments of emotions, cognitions, and behaviors (including self-injury). After one month, participants received an EMA feedback survey assessing general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight, self-efficacy, EMA compliance, beep disturbances, and emotional discomfort.\nResults: Of 124 participants, 98 completed the EMA survey (Response Rate = 79.03%). Average EMA compliance was 74.87% (SD = 18.78) and decreased linearly across time. Four in five patients (78.57%) reported experiencing at least one benefit. After using EMA, 32.65% reported increased general self-insight, 64.58% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight, 9.28% reported increased general self-efficacy, and 41.67% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Across the sample, 7.29% experienced EMA in treatment as tiring, stressful, at times overwhelming, and not enjoyable. Higher levels of emotional discomfort were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-0.29, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.37, p &lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-0.28, p=.006).\nConclusion: Although the use of EMA in treatment may evoke emotional discomfort in patients, it may help promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy outside the therapy room in patients who self-injure.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral sciences now routinely rely on digital data, supported by digital technologies and platforms. This has resulted in an abundance of new ethical challenges for researchers and ethical review boards. Several contemporary high-profile cases emphasize that ethical issues often surface after the research is published, once harm has already occurred. Consequently, implementing safeguards in digital behavioral research is often reactionary and fails to adequately prevent harm. In response, we propose the DECIDE framework which encourages ethical reflections and discussions throughout all stages of the research process. The framework presents several questions designed to help researchers view their work from new perspectives and uncover ethical issues they might not have anticipated. We provide several resources to support researchers with their ethical reflections and discussions, including (i) The DECIDE Framework Spreadsheet, (ii) The DECIDE Desktop App, (iii) Information Documents, and (iv) Flowcharts. This article provides suggestions on how to use each resource to encourage proactive discussions of how ethical issues may apply to specific research contexts. By promoting continous ethical considerations, safeguards can be put in place throughout the research project, even after research commencement. The DECIDE framework shifts ethical reflection away from being reactive towards a more proactive endeavor, reducing the risk of harm, and the misuse of digital behavioral data.",

Groß, Kreis, Blank, and Pachur (2023) found that\nhindsight bias emerged not only when people learned actual values for previously\njudged objects, but also when they learned the values of other objects in the same\ndomain. Moreover, hindsight bias co-occurred with improved estimates for new objects.\nThese findings challenge the traditional view that hindsight bias reflects a cognitive\nerror and instead suggest that it results from adaptive knowledge updating. Groß et al.\n(2023) obtained their findings in the domain of country populations, a domain where\npeople tend to be unfamiliar with the content and the numerical range (up to several\nmillion); this lack of familiarity may affect the link between knowledge updating and\nhindsight bias. In a high-powered conceptual replication (N = 300), we tested whether\nthe findings generalize to the sugar content of food items—a domain where people are\nmore familiar with both content and numerical range (up to 50 grams). Participants\nprovided original judgments for items, learned numerical information, then recalled\ntheir original judgments, and lastly provided judgments for a new set of items.

We reconceptualize free will not as a persistent entity or metaphysical power, but as a rare, computationally intensive, and emergent processing state. We introduce the Recursive Model of Structural Free Will (RMSFW), a cognitive architecture wherein a three-tier language system operates within consciousness to process and reconfigure non-linguistic, motivational inputs. Our central thesis is that free will is enacted when the third tier of language—the recursive reconstruction layer—is directed inward to rewrite the very structure of an agent's reactive pathways. While this capacity is necessary for agency, it is not sufficient; free will is the contingent event of this structural reorganization itself. The RMSFW provides a robust explanation for the findings of the Libet experiment, clarifies the nature of akrasia, and offers a new set of criteria for assessing consciousness in AI.",

Estos vínculos se sostienen como espejos de narrativas internas inconclusas, permitiendo a las estructuras receptoras proyectar, reconfigurar o perpetuar sus modelos vinculares.

To do so, we conducted interviews with 10 Syrian university student refugees in Erzurum, Türkiye, first identifying common themes on the challenges participants experienced and then the ways they contended with these challenges. We used reflexive thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s (2021) instructions. \nOverall, the challenges participants described were similar to challenges described in earlier work. Common themes included challenges of migration, language barriers, xenophobia, effects of policies and legal systems and concealing Syrian identity. Regarding the ways they are coping with the adversities they face underlines the contribution of this work. These themes included adapting to new environment as an agentic coping strategy, gaining strength through the challenges, and resistance to difficulties as an active agent. \nOverall, results highlight the agency individuals show in contending with the challenges they are exposed to.",

          "abstract": "Although many studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between college students’ hope and academic performance, none has tested the potential reciprocal association between these two variables. Research on mediators that explain the longitudinal relationship between hope and academic performance is also scarce. Hence, this longitudinal study was conducted to examine how hope and academic performance predicted one another over time in college students, and whether academic goal setting, self-regulated learning strategies, and academic emotions mediated this association. A sample of college students in Hong Kong (N = 433, Medianage = 18 years old, 63.7% female) was recruited. Results from path analyses showed that academic hope in semester 1 significantly and positively predicted academic performance in semester 3 via academic goal setting in semester 2. Furthermore, academic performance in semester 1 significantly and positively predicted academic hope in semester 3 through academic goal setting in semester 2. The findings revealed a reciprocal process between college students’ hope and academic performance and the significant mediating role of academic goal setting in this process. In terms of practical implications, tertiary institutes and educators can improve students’ academic performance by enhancing their academic hope through helping them set higher and achievable goals and providing positive feedback.",

Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product-moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the re- search community.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have long debated why and how music emerged. One promising answer is that music can function as a powerful form of physiological communication, enabling individuals to encode and convey emotional and bodily states through rhythmic and tonal structures. Building on insights that highlight music’s capacity to unify social groups, mark cultural identities, and elicit embodied participation, this paper proposes “intrinsic entrainment” as a novel concept: the coupling of one’s motor outputs to one’s own autonomic rhythms (e.g., heart rate), modulated by affect. Intrinsic entrainment makes a performer’s autonomic state audible; listeners can then simulate the action, and, via mirror-neuron supported sensorimotor coupling, adjust their own physiology accordingly. This view situates the physiological aspects of musical sound, especially the entrainment of rhythmic impulses to internal parameters, at the core of music’s emotion-conveying power. Ultimately, the notion of music as a tool for physiological communication aligns with multiple evolutionary and ethnomusicological perspectives that underscore music’s adaptability for social bonding, credible signaling, ritual efficacy, and everyday emotional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to implement a form of universal computation, operating as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Background: Several eHealth treatments, including the Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program, are feasible and effective for mothers experiencing mental health concerns. However, little research examines these programs among mothers with mental health concerns and at-risk substance use (ARSU; ARSU+). Prior BEAM trials have identified high rates of alcohol and cannabis use among participants, despite not recruiting based on substance use. To date no studies have evaluated whether implementation and symptom change outcomes differ between mothers with ARSU+ and those without (ARSU-) when participating in BEAM (i.e., a mental health program that does not directly address substance use). This represents an important gap, as integrated treatments are often difficult to access, especially for postpartum mothers.\n\nObjectives: To address this gap, BEAM implementation (e.g., retention, perceived usefulness) and symptom outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety) were compared between ARSU subgroups.\nDesign: This was a secondary data analysis of two BEAM trials for mothers of infants (6-18 months) and toddlers (18-36 months).\n\nMethods: A total of 110 mothers (M age = 20.72) participated in BEAM. Implementation metrics were compared against a-priori benchmarks. Mental health symptom trajectories were examined across time using two-level mixed models.\n\nResults: Treatment adherence, safety, and questionnaire completion time benchmarks were met in both groups, while retention, perceived usefulness, and overall questionnaire completion benchmarks were not. Changes in mental health and parenting stress symptoms did not differ between ARSU subgroups.\n\nConclusion: BEAM demonstrated similar feasibility and symptom change across ARSU subgroups. This study adds to literature examining single-focus eHealth treatments for mothers with ARSU+ and highlights refinements to enhance implementation metrics in future BEAM iterations.",

          "authors": "Kit S Double",
          "abstract": "Emotion regulation and metacognition are two key self-regulatory capacities that contribute significantly to psychological functioning. Emotion regulation involves the strategies individuals use to influence their emotional experiences, whereas metacognition refers to the capacity to reflect on and monitor one’s own mental processes. Both constructs have been the focus of extensive research and are associated with important cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Although theoretical models propose that self-monitoring is a fundamental component of emotion regulation, the empirical link between emotion regulation strategies and metacognitive ability remains poorly understood. This preregistered study (N = 200) investigated the association between self-reported emotion regulation strategies, specifically reappraisal and suppression, and metacognitive ability, which we assessed using a visual discrimination task paired with confidence ratings. We also included self-reported emotional intelligence and rumination as control variables. Our findings indicate that better metacognitive ability is associated with lower use of suppression, but shows no relationship with reappraisal. These results suggest that metacognitive processes may play a meaningful role in shaping how individuals regulate their emotions.",

          "abstract": "We conducted a qualitative analysis of comments posted on news articles and blogs covering the first randomized controlled trial of a generative AI therapy chatbot. Four publications included comments (New York Times [n=258]; Yahoo News [n=36]; Medscape [n=6]; Philly Voice [n=3], total N=300). Negative reactions to AI-provided chatbots (n=213) were more common than positive ones (n=142). Negative comments included: (1) societal concerns (e.g., technology cannot solve structural drivers of mental illness and inaccessibility of care), (2) treatment effectiveness concerns (e.g., the human therapeutic relationship is key), and (3) safety and regulatory concerns (e.g., concerns about data privacy and quality control). Positive comments included: (1) AI avoids some of the downsides of the current mental healthcare system (e.g., mental healthcare is degraded, inaccessible and expensive), and (2) potential upsides to AI (e.g., accessibility and cost, benefits of AI like a lack of judgment). These comments provide insight into broader perspectives on AI therapy chatbots.",

          "authors": "John R. Wooderson; Oliver Roschke",
          "abstract": "Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) was originally developed as a rights-based alternative to coercive and punitive practices in disability services, with the aim of enhancing quality of life through meaningful skill development and greater autonomy. In the Australian context, however, PBS has become increasingly entangled with the regulation of restrictive practices, fundamentally altering its purpose and function. Behaviour support plans are now frequently used to authorise restrictive interventions, effectively transforming PBS into a regulatory mechanism that sustains the very practices it was intended to replace.\nThis paper argues that the prevailing model of PBS in Australia has become pathological, compliance-driven, and misaligned with its foundational values. We propose a shift toward a constructional approach to PBS, drawing on the work of Israel Goldiamond, which centres on building meaningful lives and expanding genuine choice in partnership with the person whose behaviour is the focus of support.\nThe paper concludes by outlining reforms grounded in constructional principles and offering an alternative framework to guide both individual practice and broader systemic change.",

          "authors": "Ciera Arnett; Tess M.S. Neal; Maya A. Irvin-Vitela",
          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

          "authors": "Paulina Szwed",
          "abstract": "One of Festinger’s core assumptions in cognitive dissonance theory was that dissonance reduction is an effortful process whose intensity varies with the magnitude of dissonance. That is, the greater the dissonance, the stronger the motivation to reduce it, and consequently, the greater the invested effort (Festinger, 1957). For many years, this assertion was accepted without direct empirical testing. Moreover, Motivational Intensity Theory (MIT; Brehm &amp; Self, 1989) provides well-established empirical evidence about the factors that determine motivated effort investment and explains why it is inaccurate to perceive dissonance reduction as always, an effortful process. Motivated effort is influenced by various factors, not just motivation, such as the difficulty of the task and the individual’s level of ability (which was incorporated into the original theory by Rex Wright, 1996). I argue that these principles should be applied to other mental activities, like cognitive dissonance reduction. The primary objective of this article is to propose a fusion of Cognitive Dissonance Theory, proposed by Leon Festinger, with Motivational Intensity Theory, proposed by Jack Brehm. I believe this integration significantly contributes to psychological knowledge.",

          "authors": "Manuel J. B. Oliveira; Carlos Zednik; Gunter Bombaerts; Bert Sadowski; Rianne Conijn",
          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

In this study, we explored the relationships between similarity judgments (for 280 objects), fMRI-RSA matrices (11 brain regions), and 14 AI-model matrices trained on object-based properties across diverse similarity metrics. Our results revealed a behavioral distinction between “object-based” (e.g., shape) and “subject-based” (e.g., preference) representational geometries. Object-based categories significantly correlated with neural spaces, particularly from occipital and fusiform regions. However, these results were influenced by the consistency of activation patterns across brain regions, suggesting a higher granularity in sensory cortices compared to multimodal areas. Lastly, only DNNs with high classification performance on specific properties correlated significantly with behavioral and neural data. Our findings provide insights into different human representational spaces, their relationship with brain activity across regions, and under which conditions AI-models can resemble both.",

          "abstract": "Items stored in visual working memory often differ in priority. Typically, observers will shift their\ninternal attention towards items that are relevant for impending behavior and away from those that\nmay become relevant later. These distinct states of priority are theorized to influence bidirectional\ninteractions between memoranda and new visual inputs by modulating their susceptibility to\nretroactive and proactive report biases, respectively. However, prior research has produced limited\nand conflicting evidence on this topic due to reliance on inconsistent retrodictive cues (retro-cues)\nthat incentivize memory prioritization. To address this, we used a double-serial retro-cue paradigm\nthat incentivized the complete prioritization of one of two unfamiliar shape memoranda for use in\na comparison with a perceptual probe before a second, independent cue instructed observers to\nreport one of their two memories (Experiments 1-2) or the perceptual probe itself (Experiment 2).\nWe found that observers reported robust retroactive and proactive biases, but that only retroactive\nbiases were modulated by prioritization. Reports of prioritized memories were more precise and\ncontained smaller attractive biases towards the probe than unprioritized memories, whereas probe\nreports were biased comparably towards each. These findings reveal an asymmetrical effect of\nprioritization on the reciprocal interactions between new and existing visual representations.",

We then assessed the sources of variance in people’s color preferences using images generated by this model, revealing a substantial degree of individual variability. This variability was replicated in an analysis of color preferences collected by other authors (Schloss et al., 2015). Finally, we employed a novel reverse correlation methodology using our generative AI model to construct individual color preferences and show that participants were most sensitive to images generated from their idiosyncratic model.

          "abstract": "The heritability (G) of cognitive ability increases substantially across development. However, previous studies of G x Age interaction—also known as the Wilson Effect—have not controlled for developmental changes in the reliability of cognitive assessment. Unmodeled reliability changes may bias estimates of cognitive growth and G x Age interaction, obscuring the developmental etiology of cognitive ability, but this possibility has not been explored empirically due to a lack of appropriate data and statistical methods. Using an expanded version of the Louisville Twin Study data set in which Ronald Wilson (1983) originally documented G x Age interaction, we first replicated heritability increases between ages 3 months and 15 years. Then, we examined the extent to which unmodeled reliability changes biased estimates of G x Age interaction using continuous time dynamic modeling. Our-best fitting model, which corrected for reliability differences across test battery and age, estimated that heritability increased from .26 to .55. Reliability increased substantially across development, from less than .30 in infancy to approximately .80 at age 15. Models that did not control for developmental reliability increases yielded downwardly biased estimates of cognitive growth and differentiation, G x Age interaction, developmental decreases in shared environmental effects, and increases in non-shared environmental effects. Results indicated that a re-evaluation of previous G x Age estimates may be warranted, and that future studies should control for developmental fluctuations in reliability. Our continuous time dynamic models improved estimation of developmental change in cognitive ability and can be easily adapted to other psychological constructs.",

          "abstract": "Human-annotated datasets are central to the development and evaluation of sentiment analysis and other text classification systems. However, many existing datasets suffer from low annotator agreement and errors, raising concerns about the quality of the data that computational systems should learn from or align with. Improving annotation quality demands close examination of how datasets are created and how annotators interpret and approach the task. To this end, we create AmbiSent, a new sentiment dataset designed to capture cases of interpretive complexity that commonly challenge both annotators and computational models. Using a mixed-methods approach, we investigate how annotation instructions influence label consistency and annotator experience. Two groups of crowdworkers annotated the dataset under either minimal or detailed instructions, allowing comparison of inter- and intra-annotator agreement and annotation rationales. Our findings reveal that detailed instructions alone do not ensure more consistent annotations – either across or within individuals. Their effectiveness appears contingent on participants’ level of task engagement and the extent to which the instructions align with intuitive annotation strategies. Despite the presence of detailed guidance, participants often defaulted to simplifying the task. However, we also observed sentence types where detailed instructions may improve annotation quality, (e.g., sentences with perspective-dependent sentiment, rhetorical questions, and sentences containing sarcasm). A thematic analysis of open-ended responses further contextualised these findings, offering insights into the annotators’ cognitive effort involved and the practical challenges faced. Together, these results inform recommendations for enhancing task engagement and instruction adherence, offering practical insights for future dataset development. Finally, to support diverse use cases, we release three versions of the AmbiSent dataset, each accompanied by detailed annotator information and label distributions to better accommodate different user needs.",

          "abstract": "The heritability (G) of cognitive ability increases substantially across development. However, previous studies of G x Age interaction—also known as the Wilson Effect—have not controlled for developmental changes in the reliability of cognitive assessment. Unmodeled reliability changes may bias estimates of cognitive growth and G x Age interaction, obscuring the developmental etiology of cognitive ability, but this possibility has not been explored empirically due to a lack of appropriate data and statistical methods. Using an expanded version of the Louisville Twin Study data set in which Ronald Wilson (1983) originally documented G x Age interaction, we first replicated heritability increases between ages 3 months and 15 years. Then, we examined the extent to which unmodeled reliability changes biased estimates of G x Age interaction using continuous time dynamic modeling. Our-best fitting model, which corrected for reliability differences across test battery and age, estimated that heritability increased from .26 to .55. Reliability increased substantially across development, from less than .30 in infancy to approximately .80 at age 15. Models that did not control for developmental reliability increases yielded downwardly biased estimates of cognitive growth and differentiation, G x Age interaction, developmental decreases in shared environmental effects, and increases in non-shared environmental effects. Results indicated that a re-evaluation of previous G x Age estimates may be warranted, and that future studies should control for developmental fluctuations in reliability. Our continuous time dynamic models improved estimation of developmental change in cognitive ability and can be easily adapted to other psychological constructs.",

          "abstract": "Elevated rates of psychosis are consistently identified in people from racialised backgrounds, with growing evidence from the systematic review literature that suggests a role for racial/ethnic discrimination. We synthesised current systematic review evidence on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis.\n\nWe conducted an umbrella review, systematically searching Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central and Google Scholar (up to 19 July 2024) for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on psychosis. 2898 citations were de-duplicated and screened, included reviews were assessed for risk of bias using AMSTAR-2 and extracted data analysed narratively following a pre-registered protocol (CRD42023400656).\n\nSeven reviews (reporting 23 primary studies representing 40,300 participants) met inclusion criteria, five of which explicitly reported on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis. All observed evidence of a positive relationship between the two, including meta-analyses for psychotic symptoms (adjusted OR=1.77, 95%CI 1.26, 2.49) and psychotic experiences (pooled OR=1.94, 95%CI 1.42, 2.67). We observed more robust evidence for psychotic outcomes in non-clinical populations. Despite this, results were driven by cross-sectional studies (87%), and were hindered by high heterogeneity and low (n=2) or critically low (n=5) AMSTAR-2 review quality scores. \n\nThe available systematic review evidence supports a role for racial/ethnic discrimination in developing psychosis, but high-quality studies are needed to determine the temporal and mechanistic causal pathways through which this occurs. The current findings add to knowledge on the widespread presence and deleterious impacts of racism on health and inform potential public health interventions that reduce exposure to, and the impact of, racial/ethnic discrimination.",

          "authors": "Sepideh Khoneiveh; Giorgio Manenti; Jan Gläscher",
          "abstract": "Successful coordination in dynamic environments often requires individuals to integrate their own preferences with predictions about others' behavior. In this study, we tested 148 participants in a Social Foraging Task, where pairs selected between resource patches to maximize shared outcomes. Behavioral clustering revealed four distinct coordination profiles: Economic, Sticky, Avoiding, and Mixed. Each group showed characteristic decision patterns and levels of coordination success. To uncover the cognitive strategies behind these profiles, we applied hierarchical Bayesian inference using twelve computational models. These models systematically varied in how participants evaluated options for themselves and how they estimated their partner's behavior, incorporating features such as sensitivity to visible resources, patch preferences, tendency to repeat their own choices, outcome-oriented updating, and leader-follower dynamics. Different clusters were best explained by different combinations of these features. Participants in the Economic and Mixed clusters were best captured by models that combined sensitivity to patch values and stickiness in their own choices, while also assuming their partner used similar decision processes. Sticky participants also used island resources and repetition themselves, but assumed their partner followed a simpler, repeat strategy. Participants in the Avoiding cluster relied mostly on repetition themselves but modeled the partner as someone using complex information, including resource values and outcomes. This suggests that even when participants limited their own engagement with certain patches, they still attended closely to their partner's behavior. Coordination success was linked to similarity in internal value functions between partners. This was especially true in the Economic cluster, where alignment of value representations supported consistent coordination. In contrast, participants in the Mixed cluster showed more variability in strategy and poorer alignment. Together, these findings reveal that people coordinate using diverse mechanisms, ranging from shared valuation strategies to asymmetric social tracking, depending on their behavioral tendencies and mental models of others.\nKeywords: Social Coordination, Foraging, Social Inference, Mentalizing, Social Decision-Making, Cooperation, Competition.",

          "abstract": "Two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) comparison tasks are widely used to investigate how humans process complex information. However, it remains not fully understood how the format of these tasks influences cognitive strategies. In this study, we examined this question within the number domain. We analyzed whether different 2AFC task formats provide converging information on how people process multi-component numbers (i.e., numbers composed of more than one part). In particular, we investigated how the distance and congruency effects—which are interpreted as behavioral markers of holistic and fragmented number processing—vary across simultaneous and sequential versions of two-digit integers, fractions, and decimals 2AFC tasks. Methods: Undergraduate students (n=162) completed both simultaneous and sequential versions of two-digit integer, fraction, and decimal comparison tasks. Comparison pairs varied in numerical distance (near vs. far) and congruency (congruent vs. incongruent). Results: Across all number types, we observed both distance and congruency effects. However, these effects differed by task format. In particular, a linear-mixed model revealed that the congruency effect was stronger in simultaneous tasks with near-distance pairs and weaker in sequential tasks with far-distance pairs. Discussion: The presence of both distance and congruency effects suggests that individuals combine holistic and fragmented processing strategies when comparing multi-component numbers. Furthermore, differences in the strength of the congruency effect across task formats indicate they play a critical role in shaping number processing strategies. Thus, our findings corroborate that simultaneous and sequential 2AFC tasks might engage distinct cognitive processes and should not be used interchangeably in numerical cognition research.",

          "abstract": "Remembering the unfolding of past episodes usually takes less time than their actual duration. Recent work measuring the time required to mentally replay videos suggests that such temporal compression emerges when continuous events become too long to be fully held in working memory. However, in this previous research, the time needed to initiate the mental replay (i.e., to mentally visualize the starting point of events) was not taken into account. In the current study, we developed a corrected measure of remembering duration that controls for this initiation time to better characterize working memory capacity in representing continuous event. Using this corrected measure, we assessed the time needed by participants to mentally replay videos depicting continuous events (e.g., turning a car jack) lasting 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 s. The results showed  that events longer that 3-s were remembered in less time than their actual duration, suggesting  that working memory is limited in its capacity to represent continuous events, leading to the emergence of temporal compression when they exceed 3 s. Exploratory analyses further revealed that faster mental replay tended to be judged less dynamic but not less clear, suggesting that the temporal compression of continuous events likely results from an incomplete remembering of event’s unfolding rather than a complete but imprecise mental replay.",

          "abstract": "This report presents findings from a 20-day self-experimentation study investigating the brightness of ganzflicker-induced visual hallucinations during meditation. While methodologically limited and anecdotal, the study revealed an unexpected and replicable phenomenon: following brief eye closure during exposure to alpha-frequency stroboscopic light, a delayed brightening of perceived hallucinations reliably occurred upon reopening the eyes. This effect is consistent with known alpha rhythm dynamics and supports a model of meditation-induced luminosity by alpha-mediated disinhibition proposed in prior meditation research. Though artificially induced, the bright light experience often evolved into a mild mystical-type state, associated with mood enhancement and cognitive stillness. The observed effects were reproducible in other individuals and occurred independently of beliefs about the origin or nature of the subjectively perceived light, suggesting possible clinical applications. This simple ganzflicker method could serve as a low-cost, accessible adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy or as a stand-alone tool for promoting emotional well-being and creativity.",

Participants (N=803) attempted to identify a ‘perpetrator’ from a categorical voice lineup, a confidence-based voice lineup with deadlines, or a confidence-based voice lineup without deadlines. Taking the results of the accuracy and signal detection analyses together, we do not conclude that confidence-based lineups optimise voice identification accuracy. Neither the deadline nor the no-deadline confidence-based procedures appear to be a promising alternative to categorical voice lineups.

          "authors": "Mehrdad Bahadori",
          "abstract": "Scholars have long debated why and how music emerged. One promising answer is that music can function as a powerful form of physiological communication, enabling individuals to encode and convey emotional and bodily states through rhythmic and tonal structures. Building on insights that highlight music’s capacity to unify social groups, mark cultural identities, and elicit embodied participation, this paper proposes “intrinsic entrainment” as a novel concept: the coupling of one’s motor outputs to one’s own autonomic rhythms (e.g., heart rate), modulated by affect. Intrinsic entrainment makes a performer’s autonomic state audible; listeners can then simulate the action, and, via mirror-neuron supported sensorimotor coupling, adjust their own physiology accordingly. This view situates the physiological aspects of musical sound, especially the entrainment of rhythmic impulses to internal parameters, at the core of music’s emotion-conveying power. Ultimately, the notion of music as a tool for physiological communication aligns with multiple evolutionary and ethnomusicological perspectives that underscore music’s adaptability for social bonding, credible signaling, ritual efficacy, and everyday emotional regulation.",

          "abstract": "School curricula guide the daily learning activities of millions of students. They embody the understanding of the education experts who designed them of how to organize the knowledge that students should acquire in a way that is optimal for learning. This can be viewed as a learning 'theory' which is, nevertheless, rarely put to the test. Here, we model a data set obtained from a Computer-Based Formative Assessment system used by thousands of students. The student-item response matrix is highly sparse and admits a natural representation as a bipartite graph, in which nodes stand for students or items and an edge between a student and an item represents a response of the student to that item. To predict unobserved edge labels (correct/incorrect responses) we resort to a graph neural network (GNN), a machine learning method for graph-structured data. Nodes and edges are represented as multidimensional embeddings. After fitting the model, the learned item embeddings reflect properties of the curriculum, such as item difficulty and the structure of school subject domains and competences. Simulations show that the GNN is particularly advantageous over a classical model when group patterns are present in the connections between students and items, such that students from a particular group have a higher probability of successfully answering items from a specific set. In sum, important aspects of the structure of the school curriculum are reflected in response patterns from educational assessments and can be partially retrieved by our graph-based neural model.",

Observers reported a wide variety of effects, ranging from glowing, deforming, wiggling, rotating, flowing, to changes in depth, or material.

          "abstract": "When asked to remember list of items for later testing, we often repeat earlier items to ourselves as later items are presented. This process, called \"rehearsal,\" develops gradually during childhood. The present study examined the role of rehearsal in recalling lists of semantically related words and used the dual-retrieval model to pinpoint the retrieval processes modified by rehearsal in 8-10-year-olds and young adults. Thirty-one children (Mage = 8.8 years, SD = 0.5, 12 females and 19 males) and 31 adults (Mage = 20.5 years, SD = 2.7, 23 females and 6 males) performed a complex span task consisting of maintaining words to be recalled later in immediate and delayed tests, while performing a concurrent task. Participants performed the task either silently, which allowed them to use rehearsal, or under articulatory suppression, which reduced rehearsal opportunities. The results showed that although adults had a higher correct recall rate, children benefited from rehearsal opportunities for immediate and delayed correct recall. Semantic errors were also fewer in both age groups when rehearsal could be used. The dual-retrieval model revealed that rehearsal fosters direct access to verbatim memory of items and reconstruction of items based on gist memory. Finally, the difference in correct recall and direct access between the two age groups decreased when rehearsal could be used. These findings suggest that, although rehearsal is less efficient for 8-10-year-olds than for adults, children benefit more than adults do from rehearsal for correct recall and direct access to verbatim traces.",

We searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycNET in January 2024 for controlled interventions of hormones involving D&amp;S participants. Each study featured at least one of six hormones (testosterone, oestrogen, cortisol, oxytocin, growth hormone, melatonin). Article screening was conducted independently and in duplicate according to preregistered inclusion/exclusion criteria. Assessing study and participant details, prioritisation grids helped to identify existing hormone-performance measures and highlight any gaps. Study quality appraisals and a narrative synthesis of findings concerning hormonal impacts on cognitive performance were also completed. Twenty articles from North American and Western European research groups met the inclusion criteria. Cortisol and testosterone were investigated the most, whereas oestrogen, oxytocin, growth hormone, and melatonin were less studied within D&amp;S populations. Studies involved a greater proportion of male personnel across land, air, and sea domains. Generally, hormonal concentrations deviating from “normal” levels appeared to predispose psychophysiological states that prompt poorer cognitive performance. However, most studies were appraised as low-moderate in quality as studies were suffused with methodological concerns including high participant attrition rates, a widespread lack of blinding, randomisation, or a-priori sample size calculations. Consequently, for researchers to deduce any meaningful understanding of hormone-performance relationships within D&amp;S contexts, future research must develop the existing evidence base.",

We adapted an existing scale, conducted cognitive interviews with 20 students, and surveyed 1,131 secondary school students. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hexagonal goal structure, showing invariance between genders, age groups, and across six weeks. Correlations with a trichotomous goal orientation questionnaire indicated convergent and discriminant validity. School grades correlated weakly with mastery goals and the normative facet.

However, the psychological mechanisms of the current protocol have yet to be explored, and the current study aims to do so by assessing i) the decisions of the referee at the pitch-side monitor, ii) the likelihood of the VAR intervening. It is of interest to investigate if external factors influence these decisions. 1520 matches were reviewed across 2021/22 – 2024/25 seasons where the referee was advised to consult the pitch-side monitor 250 times, overturning their original decision 95% of the time. Binary Logistic Regression found that season, home advantage, scoreline, time of decision, experience of officials, and crowd attendance did not predict the referee’s decision and season, experience of officials, and crowd attendance did not predict VAR intervention. This may appear as though officials are consistent despite contextual factors, however, the models are unlikely to distinguish between variables due to the high prevalence of overturn decisions. This may indicate that referees are primed to change their original decision under the current protocol. Instead, a captain’s or manager’s challenge may be a more appropriate method to reduce this bias.",

Here, we analyse 379 articles in Chinese media (identified through a systematic search of Chinese databases Baidu, Weibo, CNKI, and Zhihu between 2011and 2021) on the case of ‘Little Yue Yue’ - a Chinese toddler killed in a hit-and-run accident. We coded for the presence of concepts from Western bystander theories (Five-Step model, Arousal: Cost-Reward model, Social Identity), laws, government, trust and technology-use.

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the interplay between language and psychopathology through the framework of\nthe Conceptual Act Theory (CAT), emphasizing the underexplored influence of semantic structures on\nemotional regulation. Using empirical evidence from alexithymia, semantic dementia, and schizophrenic\nflat affect, it proposes that deficits in semantic knowledge correlate with impaired emotional regulation,\nsupporting CAT's constructionist view. Conversely, it examines the lesser-studied hypothesis that\nexcessive emotional labeling may also impair adaptive regulation. This forms the basis for a spectrum\nmodel linking psychopathological states with semantic density, where both ends—semantic deficiency\nand excess—can contribute to emotional dysregulation. The analysis incorporates findings from\nneurophysiology, cultural-linguistic studies, and therapeutic interventions, suggesting that linguistic\nrelativity may partially explain clinical and cultural variation in emotional experience and expression.\nPhilosophical implications include reconceptualizing therapeutic metaphors from vertical (\"depth\") to\nhorizontal (\"semantic modulation\") orientations. The paper concludes with a call for an integrated,\nempirically grounded theory that bridges cognitive linguistics, clinical psychopathology, and cultural\ncontext, while outlining directions for future research and therapeutic application.",

          "authors": "Shahbaaz Mohammed Hayat Chaki",
          "abstract": "Background: Remote working has revolutionized organizational cybersecurity paradigms with workers operating outside the physical security perimeter. While technology continues to evolve, the weakest link in cybersecurity systems continues to be the human factor. Personality differences among individuals can specifically predict cybersecurity compliance behavior in different workplaces; this area of convergence has not yet been explored from a theoretical perspective.\n\nObjective: The current paper introduces theory-based full-scale research investigating how the prediction of cybersecurity behavior compliance can be achieved through Big Five personality traits, specifically highlighting the search for differences between remote and in-house workers to determine environment-specific strengths and vulnerabilities.\n\nTheoretical Framework: We outline a comprehensive Person-Environment-Cybersecurity (PEC) model that synthesizes the theories of personality psychology and cybersecurity compliance theory. The model posits that personality will have differential relationships with cybersecurity behaviors with varying characteristics of the work environment, where conscientiousness assumes a more prominent role in remote work environments, neuroticism increases exposures in distributed work environments, and agreeableness enables compliance through social mechanisms that are more salient in traditional office environments.\n\nImplications: The present theoretical framework promises a basis for the creation of differentiated cybersecurity training strategies, security interventions based on personality, and evidence-based best practices for remote work security policies. The model has testable hypotheses, which can be pursued in future empirical research, and practical uses for organizations looking to maximize human factors in cybersecurity.\n\nConclusions: Examining cybersecurity compliance in personality-environment interactions is an important theoretical advance towards addressing security concerns in more distributed work settings. The conceptual model encourages a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all solutions to context-sensitive, customized security practice.\n\nKeywords: cybersecurity compliance, personality traits, remote work, Big Five, theoretical framework, human factors, organizational security",

          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is feeling at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distribution of the duration of depressive symptoms and the frequency of depressive symptom occurrence. First, we derived probability distributions for the duration of depressive symptoms and the frequency of depressive symptoms. Using the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible depressive symptoms and how to cope with depression. Finally, we discussed the connection with the similarity curves and other results in the previously discussed papers.",

          "authors": "Holmes Finch",
          "abstract": "Latent profile analysis (LPA) is a popular statistical modeling technique designed to identify latent subgroups in the population based on a set of continuous indicator variables.  It is closely related to latent class analysis (LCA), which is the name given to a mixture model using categorical indicators.  In some cases, researchers using LPA may wish to include a covariate predicting latent subgroup membership.  Naively including the covariate in the LCA model (known as the 1-step approach) is problematic because the presence of the covariate is likely to alter the makeup of the latent classes.  In other words, class membership is then conditioned not only on the indicators but also the covariate itself.  The optimal approach for including such covariates for LCA models is the 3-step estimator, which accounts for the random error associated with the latent class model based on the indicators.  This model preserves the latent class structure associated only with the indicators while simultaneously including the covariate in the model.  The goal of the current study is to extend this earlier work on LCA by examining the performance of the 3-step estimator with LPA.  In addition, the study also investigated the impact of the indicator variables’ distribution on the performance of the 3-step estimator.  Results show that for normally distributed indicators with equal latent subgroup variances, the 3-step estimator performs well at estimating the covariate relationship for as few as 6 indicators and 200 individuals.  However, when the indicators were skewed and/or the subgroup variances differed, 12 indicators and samples in excess of 500 were necessary for the 3-step estimator to yield accurate covariate coefficient estimates.",

This study explores the acceptability, feasibility, and short-term effects of a digital, self-guided single-session intervention (SSI) for improving the mental health of Polish and Ukrainian youth, including Ukrainian refugees in Poland. A non-randomized, open pilot trial was conducted from March to June 2024, involving youth aged 10-18 years from Poland and Ukraine. Participants completed an SSI after cultural adaptations and translation into Polish and Ukrainian. Measures assessed hopelessness, self-hate, agency, perceived control, and acceptability. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and effect size calculations to examine intervention effects. Among 176 Polish and 139 Ukrainian youth who began the intervention, completion rates were 80.7% and 62.6%, respectively. Polish participants exhibited significant improvements in hopelessness, self-hate, perceived control, and agency, while Ukrainian youth showed moderate improvements in perceived control but limited change in other mental health indicators. Acceptability ratings were high across all youth. Findings suggest SSIs hold potential as a scalable option for mental health care. However, the varied outcomes across the two groups highlight the need for further refinement, especially for displaced youth.",

          "abstract": "Although mental fatigue is known to negatively impact performance, it remains unclear how cognitive resources interact with fatigue levels across the adult lifespan. Using a dual-task paradigm, we manipulated cognitive load (low vs. high) to induce varying levels of mental fatigue in young, middle-aged, and older adults. We assessed self-reported fatigue, sleepiness, and motivation pre- and post-task, while exploring task-related fluctuations in performance (accuracy and reaction times) and eye-metrics (pupil size, pupillary response speed, and long blinks). Younger adults reported higher subjective fatigue and had lower task performance than older adults. There was no significant interaction between age and cognitive load condition in performance. Results indicated that pupil size and long blinks are useful indicators of cognitive load in younger and middle-aged adults but may be less reliable in older adults. These findings suggest exploring alternative measures to better capture cognitive and physiological responses to mental fatigue in older populations.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists have long sought to explain why social norms vary so dramatically across the globe, but creating predictive, falsifiable models has remained a major challenge. Here, we introduce and validate the Moral Flavors Model, a quantitative framework that accurately predicts a society's judgment of a specific behavior. Our model is built on two components: the intrinsic 'moral flavor' of a behavior (the type of concern it evokes, such as harm or impurity) and a society's 'moral taste' (its sensitivity to these different flavors). By combining global survey data with robust cross-validation, we show the model accounts for up to 78% of the variance in moral norms and 88% in everyday etiquette across dozens of countries. Remarkably, the same societal tastes predict judgments on both profound moral issues, like euthanasia, and mundane behaviors, like singing on a bus. The model can even predict a country's entire landscape of norms without any prior norm data from that society. By establishing a high-performance, quantitative benchmark for norm prediction, the Moral Flavors Model provides a powerful new tool for computational social science and a parsimonious theory of cultural variation.",

          "authors": "David Harris; Gavin Buckingham; Tom Arthur; Shinji Yamamoto",
          "abstract": "Humans control their body movements by exploiting gravity to minimize muscle effort while achieving task goals. While most of these findings come from studies in physical environments, some have also been replicated in virtual settings. However, research using virtual environments to explore gravity-related motor control mechanisms has yet to directly compare motor performance between virtual and physical environments. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine in detail the potential differences in upper-limb pointing movements between virtual and physical environments. To this end, participants performed pointing tasks in four directions (upward, downward, leftward, and rightward, from an allocentric perspective) in both upright and lying postures, under both virtual and physical conditions. Our results showed that relative duration to peak velocity—a well-established kinematic indicator of gravity utilisation—was consistently shorter for upward than for downward movements across both environments and both postures. However, no differences were observed between the two environments when posture and movement direction were held constant. Furthermore, no differences were observed between the environments in terms of whole velocity and acceleration profiles, or in common metrics used to characterise pointing behaviour, including movement duration, peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, and the relative durations to peak acceleration and peak deceleration. The similarity in relative duration to peak velocity between virtual and physical environments suggests that the effects of gravity on pointing movements can be reliably assessed in virtual environments as in physical ones. This supports the use of virtual environments as valid tools for studying motor behaviour.",

While CS-specific research aspects often foster proximity and trust, concerns around power, marginalization, and injustice continue to create distance.

Throughout the task, we recorded checking frequency, ratings of the urge to check and distress, task performance, and corrugator supercilii activity. Key findings included: (1) higher, versus lower threat level increased checking behaviour (at one site but not the other) and improved task performance; (2) no feedback, compared to feedback, was associated with greater corrugator supercilii activity and improved task performance.

          "abstract": "Mental chronometry tasks commonly presume that real-time action imagery indicates high action imagery ability (AIA). However, factors that systematically influence imagery durations undermine the validity of AIA scores based on deviations from real-time action imagery. Therefore, we introduce and validate a novel approach to measure AIA using mental chronometry. This approach relies on the relationship between a movement’s difficulty and its’ duration (stated in Fitts’ law), with AIA scores quantifying the degree to which this relationship is preserved in action imagery. In a Chronometric Radial Fitts’ Task (CRFT), participants (N = 30) executed and imagined both tapping (with a stylus) and clicking (with a computer mouse) radially arranged targets. Single execution and imagery durations were isolated through simultaneous space bar presses. Targets varied in difficulty according to Fitts’ law, which held across all four conditions (for both tools, when executing and imagining the movements). The AIA scores derived from the proposed Fitts’ law approach outperformed those derived from earlier mental chronometry approaches, being the only score to provide consistency across tools. Using the stylus, larger absolute and relative deviations from real-time action imagery were consistently associated with higher subjective AIA, reinforcing validity concerns. Participants struggled to incorporate the computer mouse’s properties into the internal model of the movement, resulting in imagery with the computer mouse relying on internal models similar to the stylus (simpler tool). In addition to offering a promising standardized approach for the measurement of AIA, our study highlights the importance of tool familiarity in mental chronometry.",

          "abstract": "Conscious awareness of actions is known to support the acquisition and skilled execution\nof motor skills, but its contribution to memory consolidation following initial learning\nremains unknown. In two experiments, we investigated the role of subjective action\nawareness within a dual-process framework of consolidation, distinguishing between\nmemory improvement and stabilization. Participants practiced a motor-sequence task\nunder action-awareness or yoked-control conditions, followed by 24-hour delayed\nretention and sequence-knowledge tests. In Experiment 1, individual levels of action\nawareness were positively correlated with delayed performance gains, suggesting a link to\nmemory improvement mechanisms. In Experiment 2, action awareness heightened\nsusceptibility to interference from competing learning, suggesting reduced memory\nstabilization. Findings reveal that conscious awareness of actions has a dual effect,\nenhancing early learning and differentially modulating consolidation pathways. Our results\ndemonstrate that conscious awareness of actions shapes motor skill encoding and\nconsolidation, thus highlighting the role of metacognitive processes in motor memory\nformation.",

          "abstract": "Este artículo presenta una propuesta teórica y aplicada sobre el uso de la sustitución simbólica con objetos transicionales simbólicos como estrategia en el diseño y marketing comercial. La autora expone cómo, en contextos donde una estructura (persona) aún no está lista para integrar una nueva verdad emocional o cognitiva, dicha verdad puede almacenarse simbólicamente a través de objetos físicos (prendas, accesorios, alimentos, etc.) que representan el símbolo latente de esa integración futura.\n\nDesde un enfoque psicodinámico y neurobiológico, se argumenta que el proceso de sustitución simbólica genera una liberación química placentera (dopamina, serotonina, endorfinas y norepinefrina), lo cual lo convierte no solo en un proceso simbólicamente reparador sino también químicamente terapéutico.\n\nAsimismo, se analiza el rol de los objetos simbólicos en el vínculo emocional del consumidor con productos o marcas. Se ejemplifica con campañas publicitarias como la de la “etiqueta roja y letras blancas” (refiriéndose al gigante de las bebidas gaseosas), que anclan valores como familia o celebración navideña en el inconsciente colectivo, perpetuando su consumo incluso frente a evidencia racional sobre sus efectos adversos.\n\nEl texto plantea una invitación ética al diseño consciente y responsable del simbolismo en productos y marcas, sugiriendo que el dominio del símbolo debe ejecutarse con madurez emocional y responsabilidad estructural, evitando la manipulación nociva de la psique colectiva con fines exclusivamente comerciales.",

          "authors": "Maleen Thiele; Gustaf Gredebäck; Daniel Haun",
          "abstract": "Decades of research have highlighted the important role of joint attention in early cultural learning. However, most previous studies focused on a limited range of joint attention settings involving the learner’s first-person participation in joint visual attention, characterized by eye contact and triadic gaze following. This has created an incomplete picture, tending to neglect the diversity in which infants experience social connectedness in their daily lives. To deepen our understanding of the multifaceted nature of joint attention, this study investigated infants’ object memory in previously unexplored joint attention contexts, including physical cues of togetherness within observed interactions. Nine- and 18-month-old German infants participated in an object encoding task featuring videos of two people looking at an object. The videos varied in the presence and combination of mutual eye contact and mutual touch in physical proximity. After each video, the familiarized object reappeared next to a novel object. Infants’ looking time preference for the novel object was used as a measure of their prior encoding of the familiarized object. Eighteen-month-olds demonstrated superior encoding in all conditions involving interpersonal connectedness, expressed through eye contact, proximal touch, or a combination of both. In contrast, 9-month-olds’ object encoding was only enhanced in the presence of eye contact, regardless of proximal touch. These findings demonstrate a developmental refinement from a primary reliance on visual cues to a more comprehensive understanding of third-party jointness incorporating a broader range of cues. Joint attention is a highly flexible social learning mechanism, capable of operating in diverse social environments.",

          "abstract": "The Quantum Psychiatric Field Hypothesis (QPFH) posits that decoherence in\n a quantized scalar field, P(x,t), representing microtubule dynamics, biophoton\n emissions, and neural oscillations, contributes to neural dysconnectivity in\n psychiatric disorders [1]. Extending the Conscious Quantum Field Hypothesis\n (CQFH) [1], QPFH proposes that disruptions in quantum processes, including\n microtubule coherence, biophoton signaling, and theta/gamma oscillations,\n influence transdiagnostic symptoms such as sensory, cognitive, and emotional\n impairments, and subconscious processing deficits [36, 64, 69]. High comorbidity\n rates, including OCD with anxiety (50–60%) [36, 89], depression with anxiety\n (40–50%) [36, 64], and autism with ADHD (10–20%) [51], reflect shared\n dysconnectivity, evidenced by symptoms like emotional dysregulation, sensory\n overload, and cognitive biases [36, 64, 89, 35, 98]. Emerging theoretical findings\n from tryptophan superradiance [6], biophoton dysregulation [7], EEG-cytokine\n interactions [81, 9], and blood-brain barrier dysfunction [10, 11] suggest potential\n quantum contributions to QPFH’s model.\n Eight proposed experiments (2026–2033) using EEG, THz spectroscopy, and\n biophoton analysis aim to test synchrony deficits [33, 32, 111]. Environmental\n stressors, neuroinflammation, genetic variants (e.g., CACNA1C, SCN2A), and\n epigenetic modifications modulate decoherence [10, 16, 30, 96]. Medications\n influence neurotransmitter pathways, with side effects potentially affecting\n microtubule dynamics, warranting further investigation [17, 18, 6, 41]. Targeted\n therapies, including transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) and\n quantum-inspired neurofeedback, enhance neural synchrony [82, 109, 93], while\n proposed interventions like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for\n OCD and schizophrenia, and nanotherapeutics for schizophrenia and BPD offer\n additional avenues for exploration [19, 20, 76, 72]. Diagnostic markers, such as\n olfactory deficits, pituitary endorphin dysregulation, mirror neuron impairments,\n and gut-brain axis alterations, guide transdiagnostic approaches [36, 64, 81, 35, 2].\n Quantum coherence in glial cells and epigenetic modulation of quantum processes\n provide further research directions [61, 97]. Despite its intent, QPFH remains\n speculative, with challenges in measuring quantum coherence [1, 50].",

          "abstract": "In the United States, no jurisdiction guarantees the basic conditions necessary for health, such as\nstable housing, even as homelessness continues to intensify. King County, Washington, the twelfth\nlargest U.S. county, hosts the fourth largest population of people experiencing homelessness, many of\nwhom reside in Seattle. Discouraging encampments and providing shelter beds has proven ineffective.\nWe investigate how encampments’ proximity to basic amenities compares to those in emergency\nshelters and rental units. We analyze rich spatial, administrative, and outreach worker data from\nSeattle’s Evergreen Treatment Services (REACH) on individuals living in tents and on the street from\n2016 to 2022. We discuss the implications of providing effective support for people living unhoused\nand provide, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive and recent study of neighborhood amenities\nproximity among the unsheltered population in Seattle, WA. We find that, in most neighborhoods,\nencampment locations are similarly located in proximity to a range of amenities as rental units.\nAdditionally, encampments were located closer than shelters to certain amenities, especially food-\nrelated ones, excluding food banks, suggesting that they may offer opportunities for meeting basic\nneeds, and accessing WiFi. We conclude that housing options that feel like homes rather than\ninstitutions are crucial in supporting the unhoused population. Our findings suggest that emergency\nshelters should be more integrated into neighborhoods and better reflect the proximity to amenities\nof tent encampments and rentals.",

          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer; Ozan Aksoy",
          "abstract": "The conventional Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE) estimator has come under scrutiny lately. Recent literature has revealed potential shortcomings of TWFE when the treatment effects are heterogeneous. Scholars have developed new advanced dynamic Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimators to tackle these potential shortcomings. However, confusion remains in applied research as to when the conventional TWFE is biased and what issues the novel estimators can and cannot address. In this study, we first provide an intuitive explanation of the problems of TWFE and elucidate the key features of the novel alternative DiD estimators. We then systematically demonstrate the conditions under which the conventional TWFE is inconsistent. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to assess the performance of dynamic DiD estimators under violations of key assumptions, which likely happens in applied cases. While the new dynamic DiD estimators offer notable advantages in capturing heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that the conventional TWFE performs generally well if the model specifies an event-time function. All estimators are equally sensitive to violations of the parallel trends assumption, anticipation effects or violations of time-varying exogeneity. Despite their advantages, the new dynamic DiD estimators tackle a very specific problem and they do not serve as a universal remedy for violations of the most critical assumptions. We finally derive, based on our simulations, recommendations for how and when to use TWFE and the new DiD estimators in applied research.",

          "abstract": "This review reconceptualises internalised misogyny as a clinically relevant mechanism of psychological distress in women, rather than a peripheral sociopolitical phenomenon. Synthesising feminist psychological theory with clinical research, it investigates how internalised sexist beliefs manifest as shame, perfectionism, emotional suppression, disordered eating, and trauma-related symptoms. The paper critiques the Internalised Misogyny Scale for lacking cultural and intersectional sensitivity, rendering them inadequate in diverse contexts like India. Diagnostic frameworks such as the DSM and ICD similarly omit sexism as etiological, leading to fragmented and depoliticised clinical interpretations. Drawing on Indian feminist scholarship, the paper explores how caste, colourism, respectability politics, and religious norms reinforce gendered self-policing. It exposes critical blind spots in mainstream and even feminist clinical models, and argues for feminist-informed therapies, such as narrative and relational-cultural therapy, that validate gendered suffering and challenge oppressive internalised scripts. By framing internalised misogyny as a somatised, culturally entangled, and under-recognised driver of women’s psychopathology, this review advocates for decolonial, trauma-informed clinical practices and culturally grounded future research.",

          "abstract": "The size of the crowd at large political protests is a highly politicized number, as it is often interpreted as the level of popular support. Not surprisingly, it is in the interest of political actors to manipulate perceptions of the crowd size, to boost support for or to delegitimize a particular political issue. This paper examines how perceptions of the crowd size can be manipulated using AI-generated protest images. In an experiment, participants are asked to rate the size of the protest crowd from a series of social media images. These images are manipulated to display larger (or smaller) crowd sizes using a generative image model. Results show that manipulation works, and that AI-inflated (or reduced) crowd portrayals lead to higher (or lower) crowd estimates as compared to the unmodified images. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-generated visual content in shaping popular perceptions of mass protests on social media.",

          "abstract": "Under which conditions are citizens willing to delegate government responsibilities to artificial intelligence? We hypothesize that the identity of incumbent policymakers impacts public support for delegating decisions to AI. In highly polarized societies, AI has the potential to be perceived as a decision maker with apolitical or less partisan motivations in governance decisions. We thus reason that individuals will prefer co-partisans to AI or algorithmic decision making. However, a switch to AI decision making will have more public support when out-partisans hold policy control. To test our hypothesis, we fielded a survey experiment in the summer of 2024 that asked about 2500 respondents in the US to register their support for AI making the most important economic decision in the world -- the setting of the base interest rate by the US Federal Reserve. The basis of our experimental treatments is the fact that Jerome Powell, the current chair of the Fed, was appointed first by President Trump, a Republican, and later re-appointed by President Biden, a Democrat. We find that when we inform respondents that Powell was appointed by a president from another party, support for delegation to AI increases compared to the condition when the Fed chair is appointed by a co-partisan. The complier average causal effect (CACE) indicates that change perception of the Fed Chair to an outpartisan increases support for delegating to AI by over 45%.",

          "abstract": "In contexts shaped by religious conservatism and compulsory heterosexuality (comphet), queer Filipino youth often experience isolation, confusion, and erasure. Drawing on interpretative phenomenological analysis of five in-depth interviews, this article examines how lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in the Philippines negotiate identity and cope with discrimination through queer media engagement. We argue that queer media representations serve as affective mirrors—sites of validation, emotional self-regulation, and parasocial connection—while also reflecting tensions between visibility and stereotype. Participants describe how accessible queer media, from Thai BL dramas to LGBTQ+ TikToks, shaped their sense of self, offered imagined community, and created space for subtle but strategic resistance against heteronormative pressures. However, parasocial relationships were not embraced uncritically; they were navigated with both emotional investment and healthy boundaries. By reframing cultural proximity theory as identity-affective proximity rather than ethnic-linguistic affinity, we advance a more nuanced understanding of how marginalized youth find meaning in media that “sees” them. This study contributes to global queer media studies by foregrounding affective survival, media-based coping, and the ambivalence of representation in Global South contexts of constrained queer visibility.",

          "abstract": "This article develops a model of political polarization as a discursive and performative struggle over meaning. Drawing on Alexander’s civil sphere theory, Laclau and Mouffe’s discourse theory, and Lamont’s symbolic boundaries approach, we reconceptualize ideological and affective polarization through the lens of cultural sociology. Rather than treating polarization as mere attitudinal divergence, we frame it as the symbolic organization of political antagonism. Our model identifies three interrelated symbolic dimensions: (1) the divergence on contested issues conceptualized as signifiers; (2) their consistency, enabling chains of signification held together by “empty signifiers” that mark group identity; and (3) the mutual constitution of opposing semiotic chains and identities. We add a fourth, social dimension by distinguishing symbolic from social boundaries—capturing how cultural antagonisms may translate into structural disconnection and rupture. This framework offers a sociological theory of polarization attentive to meaning-making, boundary formation, and the conditional relationship between cultural and social differentiation.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how Philippine teleseryes construct hegemonic masculinity by disciplining the visibility and credibility of male vulnerability—particularly in contexts of sexual harassment and emotional trauma. Drawing on Fairclough’s three-dimensional model of Critical Discourse Analysis, we examine four high-profile teleseryes (Ang Probinsyano, Maria Clara at Ibarra, Destiny Rose, and My Husband’s Lover), focusing on how narrative tropes, character framing, and discursive silences shape affective norms. Along with analysing the texts, we also used vignettes and interviews with 11 men to see how they understood these portrayals and expressed their emotions in daily conversations. The research reveals that normative affective regimes frequently render male victimhood as illegible or humorous, reinforcing vulnerability and equating legitimacy with stoic masculinity. We propose affective justice as a conceptual lens for assessing media systems, not only in terms of representation but also in their distribution of emotional legitimacy. By focusing on Philippine media as a key area of study, this research adds to larger discussions about gender issues, communication systems, and the importance of emotional acknowledgement in countries that have experienced colonialism.",

          "abstract": "This systematic literature review addresses the intersection of two rapidly evolving areas of knowledge and practice: Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and artificial intelligence (AI). There is growing scholarly recognition of the rich and diverse nature of IKS, which are unique intergenerational understandings of worldly relations from an Indigenous standpoint. There is now a vast literature on the promise and pitfalls of AI. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews showing how these two dynamic literatures are intersecting, and what the major themes are. AI has the potential to assist the promotion of IKS; however, there are also potential risks arising from AI for Indigenous peoples, such as the erosion of cultural knowledge, and data-grabbing that fails to respect the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These risks can exacerbate existing knowledge hierarchies and socio-economic inequalities. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2012 and 2023 (January) on Indigenous peoples and AI. We shed light upon four unique overlapping categories into which existing literature can be classified and comprehensively discuss literature under each category. The first two categories discuss AI’s role in assisting the promotion of IKS and the third focuses on the pitfalls of using AI for Indigenous peoples. The final category discusses how IKS itself can enrich the development of AI. We further identify several gaps in the literature and highlight avenues requiring attention on AI’s role with Indigenous peoples and their knowledge systems.",

          "abstract": "U.S. schools are increasingly threatened by climate-related events such as extreme heat and air pollution, which adversely affect children’s health and learning. Climate risks do not occur in isolation. Adverse exposures intersect with local school socioeconomic and physical conditions that shape susceptibility to risks. Yet, research on how climate risks intersect with school social and physical factors influencing susceptibility remains limited. This study assesses relationships between climate risk and school susceptibility factors across major U.S. Cities and pinpoints school clusters within cities most in need of climate intervention. We analyzed 4,754 public school parcels in 20 major U.S. cities using climate risk and susceptibility indices. Climate risk was defined by PM2.5, ozone levels, and extreme heat days (Heat Index&gt;102°F). School susceptibility included poverty rates (free/reduced lunch), impervious surface cover, and inverse greenspace availability (trees, grass, shrub) based on 1m land-use classifications. Spatial lag regression assessed risk–susceptibility associations, and HDBSCAN clustering identified school clusters with convergence of high risk and high susceptibility within cities. Risk–susceptibility relationships varied by city. Significant positive associations were found in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, New York, and Riverside (.007 &lt; β &lt; .105). These school districts serve nearly 5% of U.S. public-school students. HDBSCAN identified 582 schools with both high climate risk and high susceptibility. Climate vulnerability among U.S. urban schools is spatially uneven. Identifying schools with the highest combined risk and susceptibility provides a foundation for targeted interventions such as greening and HVAC upgrades to support resilience and protect student wellbeing.",

The review demonstrates\nhow racial bias, especially racial stereotypes, impacts results through routine behaviors, policy\ndecisions, and algorithmic systems, drawing on multidisciplinary research from several fields,\nincluding psychology, criminal justice, education, media, and technology. Eberhardt&#39;s research\nshows how perception and behavior are influenced by implicit associations, and how these biases\nbecome more pronounced when they are ingrained in official organizations.This review critically\nsynthesizes empirical findings across sectors, including disparities in school discipline, racialized\npolicing, skewed media portrayals, and algorithmic discrimination in artificial intelligence. It\nalso highlights recent methodological innovations, such as natural language processing and field-\nbased experiments that help uncover and measure structural bias. The paper identifies key\nimplications for institutional reform and outlines future research directions, including global\napplications and participatory approaches. The central argument is that dismantling racial bias\nrequires not only shifting individual attitudes but transforming the systems that reproduce\ninequality. By situating psychological research within broader societal structures, this review\ncalls for institutionally grounded interventions that are empirically supported, ethically informed,\nand socially responsive.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss",
          "abstract": "Research on repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to curb challenges to state power. Such repression tends to draw criticism from the international community and can be counterproductive to shoring up power and legitimacy. To avoid this, states may employ subtler and less violent forms of repression designed to demobilize popular advocacy and capture the benefits of civil society organizations. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society. Because it looks like more standard domestic regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry and condemnation, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even act as a \"canary in the coal mine\" and signal future physical repression. By only looking at physical violence rather than more innocuous legal and policy-oriented action, existing research undercounts repression. The author recalls his experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different national jurisdictions and measuring different forms of *de jure* and *de facto* restrictions, presents key results, and outlines avenues for future research.",

          "authors": "Cleber Ranieri Ribas de Almeida",
          "abstract": "This study presents documentary evidence suggesting that the poem “Relógio do Rosário” (1951), by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, was written in response to Pope Pius XII’s radio addresses condemning existentialists. The central thesis is that the poem was conceived and structured to mirror the form of Greek tragedies, especially Sophocles’ Antigone. Accordingly, the voice that speaks throughout the couplets—reflecting on pain, love, chastity, existence, and nothingness—is that of a tragic chorus, likely composed of young existentialists from Rio de Janeiro at the time. This chorus responds to the “sound,” which, according to the interpretation proposed here, represents the radio broadcast of the Pope’s voice during the proclamation of the Dogma of the Assumption of Mary into Heaven (1950). Contemporary news sources report that this proclamation ceremony was transmitted globally and heard by four hundred million people. The chorus’s response is dramatized following the tragic structure of ancient Greek plays, being rhetorically divided into prologue, parodos, episodes, stasima, and exodus, and employs the dramatic technique of teichoscopy to allude to historical events occurring offstage. The philosophical content of the choral reply is drawn from Schopenhauer’s Philosophy of the Will, specifically from Heraldo Barbuy’s 1938 Portuguese translation of The World as Will and Representation. In addition to adopting Barbuy’s writing style, Drummond reworks several of the translation’s now-forgotten images and metaphors.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how social media platforms influence tourism marketing strategies, consumer perceptions, and travel behaviors, addressing their sustainability implications. It aims to evaluate the current state of research on social media in tourism marketing, identify dominant trends, assess empirical evidence of impact, and critically highlight research gaps. The analysis focuses on three core marketing outcomes: destination image, travel intention, and user engagement—and includes a section examining sustainability considerations across environmental, sociocultural, and economic dimensions. The study uses a systematic critical review of 147 peer-reviewed academic articles published between 2015 and 2025, combined with a meta-analysis of 38 quantitative studies that report statistical effect sizes. The meta-analysis uses a random-effects model to compare the influence of different platforms and study contexts. Moderator variables include geographic region, platform type, and methodological design. Findings show that social media marketing has a statistically significant positive effect on destination image (Cohen’s d = 0.61), travel intention (d = 0.54), and user engagement (d = 0.43). The analysis also reveals geographic bias, limited research on emerging platforms, and a lack of longitudinal and ethical inquiry. Findings suggest that tourism researchers and marketers may have to adopt more context-sensitive, interdisciplinary, and ethical approaches. Critical sustainability concerns emerge, including “overtourism”, cultural commodification, digital inequities, and algorithmic biases. Further studies may focus on specific platform-related behaviors, long-term impacts, and integrated online strategies appropriate for global tourism diversity. Lastly, this paper advocates for context-sensitive, interdisciplinary, and ethically grounded approaches to ensure sustainable digital tourism marketing strategies.",

          "abstract": "Marital surname choices reflect deeply embedded, often unspoken gender norms. According to the marital exchange/bargaining approach, women are more likely to adopt their husband’s surname when they hold lower status—measured by education or earnings—relative to their spouse. In contrast, the compensatory gender display approach suggests that women may also take their husband’s name when their status exceeds their husband’s, to compensate for their deviation from traditional gender roles. Using natality data from 2000 to 2021, we find consistent evidence in support of compensatory gender display. Women in different-sex marriages are more likely to take their husband’s surname both when they have lower and when they have higher educational status than their spouse, with the likelihood increasing as the educational gap grows. Notably, wives with more education than their husbands have remained especially likely to adopt their husband’s name over the past two decades—even as women have increasingly outpaced men in educational attainment and such marriages have become more common. These findings highlight the enduring power of gendered expectations and reveal how traditional norms continue to reinforce male dominance in the symbolic realm of naming, despite women’s rising status.",

Migration Studies has made major achievements in explaining why people move across borders and how societies and states adapt and respond to the movement and settlement of people. However, the discipline possesses a deeply problematic and irreparable ontology. Its focus on the 'migrant' and 'migration' as objects of study necessarily predispose the discipline to statist and anti-migrant forms of study. Many previous works have diagnosed this problem and posed conceptual and methodological means of resolving them. This paper explains why these solutions have not works. Migration Studies' ontology continues to be reinforced by the disciplinary apparatus of Migration Studies institutions and associations. Hence, the paper calls for the dismantling of these institutions and associations and proposes ways in which research on human mobility, state power and territory might develop in less politically problematic ways.",

Drawing on interviews with participants and teachers, we show how deaf epistemologies and pedagogies are enacted through practices such as cross-stage responsibility - horizontal and vertical mentoring – and academic becoming, as deaf scholars shape and affirm their identities. Central to this is realignment: the structural, pedagogical, affective, and linguistic reconfiguration of academic space that centres deaf perspectives. We also identify a distinct deaf rhythm that emerges in this space. While Dr Deaf is context-specific, its values offer a flexible framework for imagining and sustaining other deaf academic and broader educational spaces.",

This study examines the relationship between anxiety and health-related AI use among U.S. college students, using data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study. Results indicate that students with higher anxiety scores were significantly more likely to use AI for health purposes and to access professional mental health services. Among students who use AI for health, those with greater anxiety were also more likely to report using formal mental health services. Gender and academic fields also influenced AI use. Female students were less likely than male students to use AI for health purposes, despite being more likely to seek professional help. Students in health-related and STEM fields reported greater AI use than those in the humanities and arts. These findings highlight the importance of designing responsible AI tools that account for students’ mental health needs and emphasize the need for further research into how students engage with these tools during periods of psychological distress.",

The links between reporting a meaningful experience with and undertaking advocacy and conservation behaviours was particularly strong, with these relationships remaining significant even after human-nature connection was controlled for.\n5.\tPublic policy can do more to promote meaningful experiences in nature to enhance human-nature connection, wellbeing, and environmental stewardship. This includes enabling greater access to green space, providing greater financial support to environmental conservation organisations, providing greater opportunities for children to experience meaningful moments in nature, and structural societal changes to enable people to spend more time in nature.\n6.\tEnabling more people to have meaningful nature experiences can help people to become more connected with themselves, others, and local places, resulting in health and wellbeing benefits for people and environments.",

Drawing from firsthand observations, documented incidents, and interactions with protesters, administrative officials, and peers, the research highlights how hate-laden stickers, verbal threats, and institutional inaction shape a hostile academic climate. By weaving together personal narrative and scholarly frameworks on hate speech, higher education policies, and antisemitism, the study reveals a troubling dissonance between the university’s stated commitment to inclusivity and its inadequate responses to overt acts of discrimination.\n\nThrough detailed descriptions of unfolding events—from the initial appearance of incendiary slogans to meetings with administrators—the analysis illuminates how deeply entrenched biases can circumvent legal and procedural safeguards. In reflecting on emotional responses and the complexities of positionality, the autoethnographic lens underscores the human impact of hostile environments and the gaps in institutional support. The findings urge higher education stakeholders to reevaluate their protocols for handling hate speech and discrimination, calling for comprehensive measures that protect vulnerable groups and encourage critical engagement with contentious geopolitical issues. This work ultimately argues that acknowledging and actively combating antisemitism in academic settings is crucial for fostering genuine inclusivity and upholding the values of open, respectful scholarship.",

One camp argues that voters are largely ignorant of policy outcomes, showcasing when constituents are driven by their identity rooted in affective attachments to social groups. This contrasts the substance-based view, which presents evidence that policy issues and other objective outcomes drive voter behavior. I argue that both sources of motivation can drive behavior, but show how context determines which source increases in influence on decision-making. In contexts where there is greater attribution of substantive outcomes to incumbent actions, this component is weighed more heavily. In contexts where policy outcomes are “noisier,” the identity component attains more weight in decision-making. I design a novel randomized controlled experiment and find evidence for the argument.",

Such models are criticised on the grounds  that conservatism may spring from private and rigid adherence to the status quo, instead of strategic concerns about coordination. We address this by modeling agents with varying pay-off and long-term memories, using an experience-weighted attraction model. When negotiation is costly, agents playing a pure coordination game can coordinate around one spontaneously emerging “status quo” move, whose existence stabilises “flexible conservative” strategies, playing the status quo move by default but open to negotiation, and “rigidly conservative” strategies that invariably play the status quo. This model explains two empirical phenomena—why conservative strategies can remain stable for a minority only, and bounce back once suppressed—without assuming conformity, group identification, or risk aversion.",

This study demonstrates that machine learning models can reliably predict life satisfaction using a combination of mood-based survey data and digital behavioural signals from search engine keyword trends. Applying least-squares boosting ensembles to UK longitudinal data (2020–2024), we find that mood indicators explain 72% of variance (R² = 0.72), while Google Trends search data achieves an inferior but notable accuracy from digital behavioural indicators alone (R² = 0.623) Although developed in a UK context, the framework is designed for adaptation to majority world settings, with low computational requirements, mobile-first compatibility, and a modular structure. We also address key ethical and technical considerations—such as the digital divide, cultural specificity, and data sovereignty—to support equitable implementation. This work offers a scalable, low-cost pathway to real-time well-being monitoring and agile policy response, empowering governments and NGOs with culturally grounded, data-driven insight where it is most urgently needed.",

PRISMA-ScR and thematic content analysis of 36 peer-reviewed articles accessed through Scopus informed the review. The findings indicate that, although UAVs are applied extensively in higher and STEM education, their application in primary and interdisciplinary education is very low. Drones facilitate student participation, allow real-world data collection, and dissociate theory from practice but are limited by teacher training issues, the law, and expense. Pedagogical designs such as experiential, inquiry, and challenge-based learning were adopted universally when drones were employed for learning. This review concludes that UAVs are appropriate pedagogical tools but need broader incorporation into curricula and the generation of ethical standards. Follow-up research needs to respond to closing the under-researched areas, deepening professional training, and inclusive policymaking for fully embracing the learning capacity of drones.",

Employing a mixed-methods approach, it integrates qualitative data from expert interviews with quantitative responses from 391 participants to assess both the potential and limitations of AI personalization strategies. Thematic analysis highlights AI's capacity to facilitate adaptive, real-time marketing and enhance short-term engagement. However, it also reveals persistent challenges, including over-personalization, privacy concerns, and diminished consumer autonomy. Quantitative analyses found no significant associations between AI personalization and customer loyalty or satisfaction, nor between AI use frequency and perceived effectiveness. Notably, only AI’s predictive accuracy showed a weak but significant relationship with customer satisfaction, suggesting limited explanatory power for traditional personalization metrics. Ethical concerns and privacy risks emerged as key drivers of consumer skepticism, reinforcing the need for transparency and data control. The findings challenge assumptions that personalization alone drives customer loyalty and call for context-aware, ethically grounded marketing strategies. FMCG marketers are advised to adopt hybrid models that balance technological capabilities with consumer trust, autonomy, and long-term engagement.",

          "authors": "Daniel Run Han Ho",
          "abstract": "Traditional approach to research is studying a collection of data that is specific to a certain time, space, and level based on a social science theoretical framework. In contrast, this paper synthesises across space, time and level based on system thinking. This method integrates the narrative synthesis with a systemic perspective that recognises the interconnectivity among all global service systems in the global economy. Thus, it  examines, instead of economics, workflows that encompasses all economic phenomena, irrespective of any theoretical framework, in the global economy. The examination is a system thinking on two key definitions: Economic system; Organisational advantages. It substantiates that the social science discipline has yet to realise the systemic perspective for its research on the global economy. Consequently, the result is that an existing insidious hidden non-systemic framework is the root cause of persistent systemic failures in the global economic system that adversely affect all aspects of social life, ranging from financial to healthcare. Thus, the importance of this article is that it brings out the truth about the global economy. That truth is that the advancing global economy is taking the world to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the truth is a paradox that the theoretical framework is unable to unravel due to its non-systemic perspective. Complicating this paradox is the scholarly rigor emphasized by the theoretical framework to keep it as status quo, because the unraveling of truth is a paradigm shift in research on the global economy from economic to system thinking, which is not a social science discipline.",

          "abstract": "The paradigm of scientific medicine is among the most influential epistemic shifts in the past century, wherein randomized clinical trials (RCTs) represent the impartial arbiter of legitimate medical knowledge, a view prevalent among quantitative social scientists. Nevertheless, not all RCTs agree, and systematic reviews are invoked to reconcile them. These assume the wisdom of crowds, which hinges on diverse perspectives and data, across the distribution of analyzed studies, but socio-epistemic bubbles across them may reduce realized diversity. We theorize how tacit knowledge, beliefs, and expectations accumulate within these ‘socio-epistemic bubbles,’ continuous regions of latent social density that may decrease diversity and increase certainty about healthcare studied by RCTs. To assess our theory, we analyze the Cochrane systematic review repository, covering 20,117 meta-analyses extracted from 1,962 reviews. We find that being closer within ‘social space’ inscribed by scientific collaboration markedly increases agreement regarding RCT effect direction and size. Our analysis suggests that this amplified certainty can drive premature convergence and path-dependency affecting medical practice and population health. Moreover, our findings imply hidden limitations associated with unmeasured social influence across the policy sciences through which conflicting claims perpetuate and highlight the necessity of accounting for them to improve collective certainty.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how belief-consistent packaging design influences consumer behavior through the psychological mechanisms of priming and confirmation bias. Drawing on dual- process theories of cognition, the research develops and empirically tests a structural model linking packaging congruence, priming strength, confirmation bias, brand trust, and purchase intention. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining thematic analysis of semi- structured interviews with a survey of 312 consumers. Quantitative findings from regression and mediation analyses reveal that confirmation bias significantly mediates the relationship between packaging congruence and purchase intention, while brand trust moderates the strength of this effect. The results underscore the role of packaging not merely as a visual identifier, but as a cognitive tool that activates intuitive belief-confirming responses. The proposed model advances current understanding by integrating visual and semantic priming with belief-confirmation processes, offering both theoretical refinement and actionable insights for brand managers. Implications are discussed for designing packaging that resonates with consumer values, enhances trust, and drives purchase behavior.",

          "abstract": "Air conditioning (AC) access is a critical adaptation to rising temperatures and extreme heat under climate change. Yet, fine-scale, national estimates of AC prevalence—and the social and geographic factors that shape access—remain scarce. Here, we use an original, nationally representative survey (n = 11,235) combined with high-resolution demographic, administrative, and remote sensing data to estimate AC access at state, core-based statistical area (CBSA), and county levels across the contiguous United States. Applying multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) with machine learning optimization, we map central AC, window units, and lack of AC, and validate estimates using four independent sources. We find sharp regional disparities: while 86% of counties report at least 90% access to some form of AC, prevalence remains low in higher-elevation western regions, particularly the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains. Our analysis reveals that socioeconomic status, housing stock, and local climate are key predictors of AC access. These patterns expose an emerging adaptation gap, with implications for heat vulnerability, energy demand, and climate justice. By identifying where and why AC access is lacking, this work informs targeted interventions to reduce risk in a warming world.",

Furthermore, the study explores the diverse range of primary cord types, structures, and color patterns as potential indicators of distinct khipu genres. This chapter acknowledges the challenges in recording and analyzing the data embedded in these cords due to their complex ply structures and color patterns. In order to further enhance our understanding of primary cords and khipu systems, this chapter emphasizes the need for better resolution data and the broader application of innovative methods of recording primary cords.",

          "abstract": "Contraception is essential for reproductive health and family planning but remains deeply intertwined with socio-economic and gender inequalities. Women disproportionately shoulder the physical, emotional, and logistical responsibilities of contraception – tasks collectively referred to as contraceptive labor. These include method selection, ensuring consistent use, managing side effects, and maintaining adherence, representing a significant yet often overlooked form of unpaid labor. Despite growing recognition of contraceptive labor as a driver of gender inequality, research has yet to systematically quantify both its burdens and returns. We introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and its returns from a female perspective. To address this gap, we introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and returns from a female perspective. Grounded in theories of gendered labor and health economics, the ContraIndex evaluates contraception across two interrelated dimensions: the burdens (labor) and benefits (returns) associated with various contraceptive methods. By facilitating cross-method comparisons, the ContraIndex provides a novel framework for examining the causes and consequences of contraceptive inequality. Its application offers actionable insights for researchers and policymakers, paving the way for strategies to reduce gendered disparities in reproductive health.",

          "authors": "Maijunxian Wang",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of systemic forgiveness—a structural tendency to absolve systems, institutions, and algorithms from responsibility while punishing individuals. Drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks from political theory, sociology, and science and technology studies, the paper identifies three key mechanisms that enable this moral asymmetry: the complexity shield, attribution bias, and de-agentified narratives. Through case studies in finance, healthcare, algorithmic governance, and infrastructure, it demonstrates how systemic actors evade accountability via abstraction, opacity, and narrative displacement, while frontline workers become scapegoats. The genealogy of this phenomenon is traced from bureaucratic hierarchies to algorithmic impunity, revealing how moral responsibility has been reframed as technical failure. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for symmetrical accountability—introducing legal personhood for systems, auditable responsibility chains, reparative indexing, and epistemologically accountable design. Ultimately, it argues that systemic forgiveness is not an ethical oversight but a political logic that must be challenged in pursuit of structural justice.",

          "abstract": "Since the 18th century, policymakers have debated the merits of industrial policy (IP). Yet, economists lack basic facts about its use. This study sheds light on industrial policy by measuring and studying global policy practice for the first time. We first create an automated classification algorithm for categorizing industrial policy practice from text. We then apply it to a global database of commercial policy descriptions and quantify policy use at the country, industry, and year levels (2009-2020). These data allow us to study fundamental policy patterns across the world. We highlight four findings. First, IP is common (25% of policies in our database) and has expanded since 2010. Second, instead of blunt tariffs, IP is granular and technocratic. Countries tend to use subsidies and export promotion measures, often targeted at individual firms. Third, the countries engaged most in IP tend to be wealthier (top income quintile) liberal democracies. In our data, IP is rarer among the poorest nations (bottom quintile). Fourth, IP is targeted toward a subset of industries and is highly correlated with an industry’s revealed comparative advantage. We show that industrial policy is a prominent feature of the global economy and a far cry from industrial policies of the past.",

          "abstract": "Individual social identities indicate group affiliations and are typically associated with group-typical preferences, signals that indicate group membership, and the propensity to condition actions on the social signals of others, resulting in group-differentiated interaction norms. Past work modeling identity signaling and coordination has typically assumed that individuals belong to one of a discrete set of groups. Yet individuals can simultaneously belong to multiple groups, which may be nested within larger groupings. Here, we introduce the generalized Bach or Stravinsky game, a coordination game with ordered preferences, which allows us to construct a model that captures the overlapping and hierarchical nature of social identity. Our model unifies several prior results into a single framework, including results related to coordination, minority disadvantage, and cross-cultural competence. Our model also allows agents to express complex social identities through multidimensional signaling, which we use to explore a variety of complex group structures. Our consideration of intersectional identities exposes flaws in naive measures of group structure, illustrating how empirical studies may overlook some social identities if they do not consider the behaviors that those identities function to afford.",

          "abstract": "Historians and social scientists have long been preoccupied with understanding and documenting periods of crisis. Such emphasis is only growing, and becoming more pressing, as the world continues to face a number of interrelated stressors in the form of irreversible climate change, major ecological shocks and disease outbreaks, eruptions of military violence, economic disruptions and deepening inequalities, political polarization and unrest, the rise of authoritarian and nationalist regimes. Crises in these domains are not new, but have been recurrent features of past societies. Although these periods have typically led to massive loss of life, the failure of critical institutions, and even complete societal collapse, there are instances in the historical record of societies managing to turn the tide of crisis even as violence and social turmoil grow. Here, we focus on four such cases of crises mitigated with structural reforms revealed from our previous historical analyses: early Republican Rome, mid-19th century England and Russia, USA during the the late 20th to early 21st centuries. Utilizing structural demographic theory as a lens to explore these cases, we seek to expose the pressures that built up leading to crisis and the early signs of violent confrontation revealed by these societies, as well as to examine the conditions and key decisions made in the midst of this unrest that allowed these societies to turn the tide and enact significant structural adaptations. Our findings have clear relevance to understanding and navigating similar crises in contemporary societies.",

We validate the metric at the word-level with both expert- and crowd-sourced dictionaries and at the document-level with expert-annotated social media posts.",

This study analyzes how shifts in population aging, immigration, partnership status, educational attainment, and female labor force participation influenced wealth inequality in West Germany between 1988 and 2017, focusing on households with children. Our findings reveal that while overall wealth inequality remained stable, this masks diverging trends across household types and conceals how significant demographic shifts within the overall population, and particularly among households with children, contributed to contrasting inequality trends. Increased immigration and changes in partnership status were associated with rising inequality; however, these effects were offset entirely by the inequality-reducing impact of population aging, educational expansion and rising female labor force participation. The study highlights the importance of these demographic changes for understanding trends in wealth inequality and shows that aggregated measures of inequality may mask countervailing effects of demographic shifts among population subgroups.

The quantitative results of our preregistered study with 550 participants from 64 countries showed that perceived human-likeness was a strong driver of attachment.

We then examine the risks and tensions these opportunities present, including algorithmic bias, hallucination, and the automation of interpretive judgment. In response, we outline a pedagogical and research agenda for critical AI literacy, ethical infrastructure, and methodological pluralism.

We then turn to firms and employees, emphasizing patterns of fragmentation and cohesion created by modern production technologies: while the immediate effects of product-specific tariffs are limited to relatively few firms and their employees, these effects migrate along domestic supply chains. Using the example of the U.S.-China trade war, we document the geography of the direct and indirect exposure to the trade war across U.S. counties. We also outline implications of our preference map for several categories of institutional theories. Finally, we identify a different question: given the considerable economic costs of trade wars, why do governments fail to reach a settlement before escalating?",

          "authors": "Marie-Caroline Compans; Heini Väisänen",
          "abstract": "According to clinical studies, miscarriages, that is spontaneous pregnancy losses before 22–24 weeks of gestation, affect approximately 13 to 18 % of recognized pregnancies. However, clinical studies are rarely representative of the population. Surveys tend to be, but they are subject to misreporting of miscarriages, as suggested by existing work in the US. Thus, existing evidence of social inequalities in miscarriage risk is inconsistent. This study first applies a model to estimate the extent of miscarriage misreporting in the French FECOND survey (2010-11). Estimated 92% of miscarriages were reported and underreporting was slightly more pronounced among women with lower education. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of miscarriages (14% of all pregnancies) remained largely unaffected and only with small educational differences. These findings indicate that estimating miscarriage risk factors can be done without correcting for reporting bias in this survey. Second, we used multilevel multinomial logistic regressions to estimate socio-demographic characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with miscarriage. As in previous work, advanced reproductive ages were associated with a higher miscarriage risk. Our models reveal that the association between miscarriage risk and prior reproductive history is explained by unobserved time-consistent individual characteristics, such as potentially. Conversely, education and self-assessed financial conditions were not associated with miscarriage risk. Younger cohorts exhibit a higher miscarriage risk, suggesting either an age effect on recall, a cohort effect regarding pregnancy recognition, or reduced stigma resulting in more reliable reporting of miscarriage in surveys.",

          "abstract": "This review reconceptualises internalised misogyny as a clinically relevant mechanism of psychological distress in women, rather than a peripheral sociopolitical phenomenon. Synthesising feminist psychological theory with clinical research, it investigates how internalised sexist beliefs manifest as shame, perfectionism, emotional suppression, disordered eating, and trauma-related symptoms. The paper critiques the Internalised Misogyny Scale for lacking cultural and intersectional sensitivity, rendering them inadequate in diverse contexts like India. Diagnostic frameworks such as the DSM and ICD similarly omit sexism as etiological, leading to fragmented and depoliticised clinical interpretations. Drawing on Indian feminist scholarship, the paper explores how caste, colourism, respectability politics, and religious norms reinforce gendered self-policing. It exposes critical blind spots in mainstream and even feminist clinical models, and argues for feminist-informed therapies, such as narrative and relational-cultural therapy, that validate gendered suffering and challenge oppressive internalised scripts. By framing internalised misogyny as a somatised, culturally entangled, and under-recognised driver of women’s psychopathology, this review advocates for decolonial, trauma-informed clinical practices and culturally grounded future research.",

          "abstract": "What this research is about: This research looks at public health responses to homelessness during the COVID emergency in Australia. It identifies barriers, adaptations and lessons learned from increased teamwork between public health and homelessness sectors. It investigates how these partnerships formed and how they can continue with ongoing adequate funding, staffing and logistical support.\n\nWhy this research is important: People experiencing homelessness faced high risks from COVID-19. This was due to their limited ability to practice social distancing, reduced access to infection-prevention items and difficulties self-isolating when required.\n\nSupport measures showed health and homelessness services can work well together given the right operational environments. This highlights that the collaborations need to continue as homelessness remains a significant public health issue.",

          "authors": "Akshay Irudayaraj; Nathan Ye; Yash Chainani",
          "abstract": "Within the field of media framing, homelessness has been a historically under-researched topic. Framing theory states that the media’s method of presenting information plays a pivotal role in controlling public sentiment toward a topic. The sentiment held towards homeless individuals influences their ability to access jobs, housing, and resources as a result of discrimination. This study analyzes the topic and sentiment trends in related media articles to validate framing theory within the scope of homelessness. It correlates these shifts in media reporting with public sentiment. We examine state-level trends in California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, and New York from 2015 to 2023. We utilize the GDELT 2.0 Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) database to gather article data and use X to measure public sentiment towards homeless individuals. Additionally, to identify if there is a correlation between media reporting and public policy, we examine the media's impact on state-level legislation. Our research uses Granger-causality tests and vector autoregressive (VAR) models to establish a correlation between media framing and public sentiment. We also use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and GPT-3.5 (LLM-as-annotator paradigm) for topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between media framing and public sentiment, especially in states with high homelessness rates. We found no significant correlation between media framing and legislation, suggesting a possible disconnect between public opinion and policy-making. These findings reveal the broader impact of the media’s framing decisions and delineate its ability to affect society.",

          "abstract": "Inducing semantic relations in word vector spaces and analyzing how other words or entire documents discursively engage these relations is a popular form of cultural analysis. We propose a reliability metric that is easily interpretable and agnostic to the type of relation. The metric, which we call the anchor reliability coefficient (or relco), is found by creating a synthetic document-term matrix of simulated documents that sequentially shift more of their probability mass from relation-relevant anchor terms to randomly drawn words, and then regressing the documents' similarity to an induced relation by the inverse randomness rank of the documents. We validate the metric at the word-level with both expert- and crowd-sourced dictionaries and at the document-level with expert-annotated social media posts.",

          "abstract": "From a material perspective, both natural magmas and the glass manipulated by artists are one and the same: they are silicate liquids. These materials can change state from liquids to crystalline solids and back again, they variably break and heal, anneal and cool, or they support bubbles and trapped gases. The myriad changes they undergo can be complex. Importantly, the way these materials behave is unlike everyday substances, such that they can confound our intuitive expectations. For these reasons, experimentation with molten silicates can surprise us and we can learn from what we find when we try to bend them to our will. Here, we report the results of a cross-disciplinary fieldtrip to Iceland, creating as we went, and of workshops between students of Earth science and students of sculptural art. We find that all involved have been changed by these experiences and new inspirations or techniques have been garnered as a result. Many magma types are very good natural ‘glass-formers’ and we suggest that this crossover between volcanology and silicate glass art is a fruitful intersection of disciplines.",

          "authors": "Anurag Kadel",
          "abstract": "Generative AI systems are increasingly integrated into knowledge workflows, yet their fluency and speed can obscure a critical threat: the erosion of epistemic integrity. Users may imitate AI outputs, converge prematurely, or misinterpret confidence as understanding—producing brittle knowledge loops that collapse under scrutiny.\nThis paper introduces a dual-friction framework to address these risks. The Memetic Design Loop models how mimetic desire and semantic drift unfold across human–AI exchanges, highlighting the cognitive vulnerabilities induced by fast, confident AI. To counteract this, we propose design interventions that embed intentional slowness, divergence, and reflective scaffolding into AI-mediated reasoning environments.\nDrawing from epistemic friction theory, mimetic philosophy, and regenerative design principles, we present a methodology that resists premature closure by foregrounding attentional rhythm, deliberative pause, and conceptual variation. We also offer a two-layered evaluative lens focused not on performance, but on epistemic resilience: the system’s capacity to sustain plurality, preserve semantic coherence, and foster reflective trust.\nAI systems do not merely process information—they shape the cognitive environments in which decisions are made, beliefs are formed, and knowledge is legitimized. As such, they must be studied not only as technical tools, but as socio-technical systems: assemblages of algorithms, interfaces, cultural norms, institutional logics, and human desires. This paper contributes to an interdisciplinary discourse at the intersection of design theory, epistemology, and social science by articulating how AI interfaces co-produce epistemic authority, and how design choices encode political, ethical, and cognitive consequences. We position friction not just as a technical affordance, but as a cultural and epistemic intervention—opening space for dissent, pluralism, and attentional agency in systems increasingly optimized for speed and conformity. In doing so, the work aligns with ongoing debates in science and technology studies (STS), critical AI ethics, and the sociology of knowledge infrastructures, offering both a critique and a design philosophy for preserving epistemic sovereignty in AI-augmented societies.",

          "abstract": "According to the hostile media effect (HME), individuals perceive balanced mass media coverage as unfairly biased toward opposing sides. This HME may affect intergroup polarization, interpreted here as momentarily enhanced ingroup bias. In two online studies situated in the context of the abortion debate, pro-life vs. pro-choice group members read a counterfeit balanced newspaper article. Among participants showing a HME, we observed a congruent pattern of correlations between the HME and self-reported polarization or enhanced intergroup bias after exposure. We interpret these findings as providing initial evidence that the HME triggers short-term intergroup polarization as a “response with a vengeance.”",

          "authors": "Sara Aref Zahed",
          "abstract": "Fairy tales, folklore, and centuries-old fears have long shaped how humans perceive large \npredators like wolves. In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return \nof wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has \nbecome a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria \n(FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this \nstudy examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this \nstyle are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a \ndetached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity \nand urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates \nan ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and \nideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to \nsymbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while \nselectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male \nactors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable \nmothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how \necological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

          "abstract": "The accelerating decline of biodiversity requires transformative change to protect nature and society, which requires innovative actions and governance strategies. This paper focuses on developing diverse transformative pathways for biodiversity in Europe and advancing methodologies for co-creating these pathways to inform such actions and governance strategies in a transformative and anticipatory manner. Three distinct pathways for a nature-positive Europe from 2024 to 2050 were co-created with 23 participants during a 2.5-day participatory foresight workshop and analysed to understand the main patterns of change. These pathways were backcasted using three desired visions based on the Nature Futures Framework as a starting point. Post-workshop interviews with nine participants helped map their understanding of transformative change and its connection to the pathways. The analysis reveals distinct patterns within each pathway, despite shared elements such as governance changes and sectoral changes in biodiversity. The first pathway, called Dòigh Nàdair, emphasizes bottom-up transformation through community empowerment, focusing on biocultural principles and diverse sustainable alternatives across Europe. The second, NaturAll, combines top-down restrictive regulation with participatory approaches, centring on sufficiency principles. The third, Return to Nature, relies on expert-driven centralized governance and mainstreaming sustainable alternatives across Europe. Diverse understandings of transformative change among participants existed, ranging from reformist to revolutionary approaches. The methodological choices in the co-creation process led to convergence towards dominant frames within pathway groups, resulting in plurality between pathways but limited plurality within group outputs. The first pathway attracted those interested in radical ideas and creative imagination, the second drew a varied group, and the third appealed to those focused on practical and feasible solutions. The pathways demonstrate how diverse patterns of change and understandings of transformative change can result in a range of desired nature-positive futures, effectively turning concepts of transformative change into practical actions. The techniques used to create these pathways play a crucial role in shaping the results, necessitating intentional design that aligns with specific objectives. This highlights the importance of developing plural pathways to investigate multiple potential futures while preserving a strong sense of ambition and urgency for transformative action.",

          "authors": "Anurag Kadel",
          "abstract": "This paper adopts a Research Through Design (RTD) approach to investigate the epistemic consequences of large language models (LLMs). We introduce the concept of Simulacral Drift to describe how recursive training on synthetic outputs displaces empirical reference, leading to a collapse in both model fidelity and user cognition. Rather than collecting empirical data, this work engages in conceptual design research to surface and structure the ethical implications of generative simulation. Through a reflexive inquiry grounded in media theory, STS, and design philosophy, we propose a normative framework of Reflexive Epistemic Ethics, comprising referential integrity, simulation auditability, and epistemic friction. We further integrate recent neurophysiological evidence from Kosmyna et al. (2025), which shows that LLM users exhibit reduced memory recall and neural engagement — validating our claim that epistemic collapse is embodied and co-produced. By treating simulation as a socio-technical condition and knowledge frameworks as designed epistemic artifacts, this paper contributes to the growing body of RTD scholarship that seeks to anticipate, intervene in, and reshape the cognitive infrastructures of AI.",

          "authors": "Réka Juhász; Nathaniel Lane; Emily Oehlsen; Verónica C. Pérez",
          "abstract": "Since the 18th century, policymakers have debated the merits of industrial policy (IP). Yet, economists lack basic facts about its use. This study sheds light on industrial policy by measuring and studying global policy practice for the first time. We first create an automated classification algorithm for categorizing industrial policy practice from text. We then apply it to a global database of commercial policy descriptions and quantify policy use at the country, industry, and year levels (2009-2020). These data allow us to study fundamental policy patterns across the world. We highlight four findings. First, IP is common (25% of policies in our database) and has expanded since 2010. Second, instead of blunt tariffs, IP is granular and technocratic. Countries tend to use subsidies and export promotion measures, often targeted at individual firms. Third, the countries engaged most in IP tend to be wealthier (top income quintile) liberal democracies. In our data, IP is rarer among the poorest nations (bottom quintile). Fourth, IP is targeted toward a subset of industries and is highly correlated with an industry’s revealed comparative advantage. We show that industrial policy is a prominent feature of the global economy and a far cry from industrial policies of the past.",
