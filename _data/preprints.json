          "title": "YU YU HAKUSHO FIRST EPISODE: A semiotic narrative analysis",
          "authors": "João Tenório",
          "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze the meanings and feelings represented by semiotic elements available in the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho. The theoretical approach adopted is the Semiotic Cultural Psychology (SCP) in which considers human beings as meaning makers in the world through the mediation of signs. In this paper we consider signs from the Peirce perspective as the representation of objects in the real world and divided into symbols, indexes and icons. From SCP we considered how these signs can represent mediation by pleromatization and schematization in order to understand meanings and feelings represented by field-like signs and point-like signs. In the excerpt from this article, we selected the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho to understand how meanings and feelings are regulated through existing complexes of signs during the narrative. To achieve this, we cataloged the main semiotic elements of the episode, classifying them as point-like signs or field-like signs. Subsequently, we analyzed which of these signs were part of a semiotic hybrid complex (pleromatization/field-like signs/hyper-generalization) regulating feelings related to the narrative and which expressed constructed and shared meanings (schematization/point-like signs/generalization). In the results, we found that semiotic elements can be considered as narrative devices to involve the viewer in the story based on the intentionality of the author. In the Yu Yu Hakusho first episode, the intentionality is based in the presentation of the character Yusuke and the creation of feelings related to him. In this sense, in order to present who Yusuke is, point-like signs were identified representing some characteristic about him. In the second part of the episode, there was a predominance of field-like signs in order to create some feelings about Yusuke based on the empathy constructed in the first part of the narrative. Then, as related in the literature, mediations by schematization and pleromatization acted all the time in order to relate cognitive elements (meanings constructed about Yusuke) and effective elements (feelings to be felt for Yusuke).",

          "authors": "Sharon S. Wang; Jessica A. Blayney; Anna E Jaffe; Cynthia A. Stappenbeck; William H. George; Kelly C. Davis",
          "abstract": "Objective: The present study aimed to compare post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) severity for three victimization profiles: childhood sexual abuse (CSA)-only, adult sexual assault (ASA)-only, and CSA + ASA. Additionally, the study examined the role that resilience variables–mindfulness and emotion regulation–play in the association between victimization timing and PTSS severity.\nMethod: Participants were 247 cisgender community women aged 21-30 recruited for a larger study on high-risk drinking and sexual behaviors. Victimization history was assessed using the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory and Sexual Experiences Survey-Revised. PTSS severity was measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Emotion regulation and mindfulness were evaluated using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-36 and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Negative binomial regression models tested the hypotheses.\nResults: Analyses revealed significant differences in PTSS severity by victimization timing: CSA + ASA was associated with the greatest PTSS severity, followed by ASA-only, and CSA-only reporting the lowest severity. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were directly associated with reduced PTSS severity across all victimization profiles. \nConclusions: Revictimization was linked to the most severe PTSS, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Mindfulness and emotion regulation may facilitate recovery by alleviating PTSS severity, regardless of victimization timing. Future interventions should prioritize enhancing psychological skills, like mindfulness and emotion regulation, to reduce distress for victim-survivors of sexual victimization.",

          "authors": "Pablo Leon-Villagra; Lucas Castillo; Johanna Falben; Nick Chater; Adam N Sanborn",
          "abstract": "Elicitation methods, such as asking people to produce the deciles of a distribution, are standard practices in policy or applied statistics. Similarly, much of cognitive science and psychology focuses on determining people's people's beliefs or latent traits through questionnaires or judgment tasks. However, these approaches often only capture a rough outline of what people know and are usually limited to point estimates of people's beliefs. Here, we present a novel experimental paradigm that allows us to access people's beliefs and how variable these beliefs are. Our task is based on an established random generation paradigm in which participants produce quantities from a particular domain as randomly as possible. We hypothesize that due to the minds' general-purpose mechanisms for probabilistic inferences, these random sequences represent the participants' underlying prior beliefs. We show that our method can infer participants' beliefs for a wide range of numeric quantities at comparable accuracy as an established elicitation method.\nMoreover, these inferred beliefs are consistent with individual participants' generalization and inference patterns in a subsequent conditional prediction task. We then extend our approach to non-numeric belief elicitation, highlighting how our method can go beyond numeric elicitation and provide insight into complex beliefs that are challenging to assess experimentally. Empirically, our results highlight that people know the rough shapes of environmental distributions, and these beliefs guide inference and generalization. Moreover, using our novel approach, we also show that people know the fine details of environmental distributions. Finally, our experimental results show that random generation paradigms can be a useful tool for cognitive scientists, psychologists, and applied statisticians.",

          "abstract": "Hikikomori is a form of extreme social withdrawal that is characterized by self-isolating in one’s living quarters. While past research had found a correlation between Hikikomori and internet addiction, the research was limited to a sample of college students in Japan. With cases of both Hikikomori and internet addiction being recognized across the globe, more research is required to investigate this correlation in non-Japanese countries. In the current study, we administered the Hikikomori Questionnaire and Young’s Internet Addiction Test to 437 US college students recruited through Prolific. We found a sizeable positive correlation between Hikikomori and internet addiction (r = .30). We also found that the correlation among the US college students in our sample did not significantly differ from the correlation among the Japanese college students in the prior study (r = .39). Although more research is required to further understand the relationship, the present results indicate that extreme social withdrawal could be a risk factor for internet addiction in the US (and vice versa).",

          "title": "Adolescent Emotion Polyregulation Flexibility: An Ecological Momentary Assessment of Multi-Strategy Switching and Effort Scaling",
          "authors": "Xiaomei Li; Megan Wylie; Jessica P. Lougheed; Tom Hollenstein",
          "abstract": "Adolescents draw from a repertoire of strategies to regulate increasingly intense, complex, and changing emotions in their everyday lives. However, little research has systematically examined how much they use multiple strategies in a given emotional event (polyregulation) and how much they use different strategies across emotional events (flexibility), two well-known predictors of regulatory success among adults. Leveraging the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to quantify the collective, multi-strategy modulation from one event to the next, we examined adolescent polyregulation flexibility and its two mechanisms: strategy switching (prioritizing certain strategies while decentralizing others) and effort scaling (engaging or disengaging multiple strategies together). We tested whether polyregulation flexibility was associated with emotional intensity, emotional complexity (multiple emotions simultaneously), polyregulation effort, and trait-level emotional mindset and awareness. We also tested whether polyregulation flexibility uniquely predicted regulatory success. Adolescents (N=117, ages 12-15, 55% girls) completed an ecological momentary assessment for 14 consecutive days (4 prompts per day) reporting on the intensity of four negative emotions, effort for six strategies for a focal emotion, and perceived regulatory success. Using multilevel modeling, both at the within- and between-person levels, adolescents showed greater polyregulation flexibility in response to more intense and complex emotions. Further, greater effort scaling (but not strategy switching) since the last emotional event uniquely predicted greater success at the current event after controlling for emotional intensity, complexity, and polyregulation effort. Findings support the dynamic nature of flexible strategy deployment among adolescents, highlighting the need to overcome more static approaches (e.g., counts, range) of capturing emotion regulation.",

          "authors": "Sofia Abrevaya; Ariana Bordon; Jessica Savino; Sofia Stancanelli; Juana Poulisis; Valeria Pedron",
          "abstract": "Purpose Binge eating involves consuming unusually large amounts of food that another person would not eat in the same period and setting. Emotional eating involves the consumption of food in response to a series of negative emotions. Associated with both are emotional regulation difficulties. People can also be susceptible to overeating because of the hedonic nature of certain foods, such as those high in fat and sugar. We aimed to analyze the differences between increasing levels of binging in hedonic and emotional eating, and its relationship with emotional regulation, and body mass index (BMI). \nMethods 143 adult cis women (between 18 and 59 years old) completed the Binge Eating Scale, the Garaulet Emotional Eating Questionnaire, the Power of Food Scale, and the Emotional Regulation Difficulties Scale. \nResults Participants with higher levels of binging showed greater emotional dysregulation, levels of both emotional and hedonistic eating, and BMI. However, emotional dysregulation and BMI do not predict differences in the two types of feeding behavior. \nConclusions Results are discussed through different perspectives, such as responsiveness to a caloric food environment, an association with a restrictive eating style, an uncontrolled eating pattern associated with impulsivity, or weight bias that generates stress in people with larger body sizes. Interventions based on intuitive or conscious eating are proposed to address some of these problems.",

          "abstract": "Awareness of social biases is crucial as they impact both individual behavior and societal outcomes. Whereas previous research indicates that self-awareness of ego-nonthreatening biases enhances self-regulation, the effects of self-awareness of ego-threatening biases remain underexplored. Preliminary findings suggest that awareness of ego-threatening biases related to rumination and may lead to maladaptive states. However, these findings await replication with standardized instruments. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. In Study 1 (N = 1609), we developed and validated the 12-item Self-Awareness of Ego-Threatening Biases Questionnaire (SAETBQ). Consistent with our hypotheses, self-awareness of ego-threatening biases (as measured by the SAETBQ) correlated with higher moral disengagement, lower self-diagnostic motive, and lower integrative self-knowledge, indicating a tendency towards ego deterioration, whereas self-awareness of ego-nonthreatening biases (as measured by the Metacognitive Self questionnaire) showed the opposite pattern of correlations, indicating a tendency towards beneficial self-regulation. In Study 2 (N = 681), Dark Triad traits correlated positively and Light Triad traits negatively with self-awareness of ego-threatening biases. These results underscore the complex role of self-awareness in managing cognitive biases.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to test whether inducing participants' attention towards the agent or recipient of a moral violation would elicit different emotional responses. Fictional situations were created to spotlight either the recipient's experience (e.g., a person being tripped on the street) or the initiator experience (e.g., a person tripping another). Participants were presented with a series of vignettes describing moral transgressions and asked to judge as quickly as possible whether the emotional reactions of third parties depicted in different facial expressions were consistent with what would be expected regarding the misconduct. In two studies (N = 315) we tested the hypotheses that focusing on the initiator would stress their poor moral character and elicit distancing reactions typical of moral disgust, while focusing on the recipient would emphasize the harmful act and the recipient's resulting personal distress, aligning more closely with moral anger. The results indicate that directing participants' attention to the recipient resulted in a quicker and more frequent selection of angry expressions compared to disgust. However, a preference for disgust was primarily evident in scenarios depicting moral transgressions in the initiator-focus condition but not in the recipient-focus condition, only when compared to neutral affect.",

Additionally, we explored variations in judgments when participants received specific reasons for recommending sterilization (genetic transmission risk and parental ability). Participants first judged incomplete scenarios, then received the doctor’s rationale, and finally reevaluated their views with complete information.

          "abstract": "When learning remotely during a lockdown, students’ online learning engagement decreases while academic stress increases. In the present study, we aim to explain variations in online learning engagement and online academic stress in terms of students’ epistemic beliefs and self-regulated learning skills. We hypothesize that epistemic beliefs indirectly influence online learning engagement and online academic stress through their effect on motivation and self-efficacy. The study involves 398 students in grades 10 and 11. Results from the path analysis suggest that students who believe that knowledge is evolving (development) and gets handed down by authority figures (source) are more likely to be self-efficacious in their learning and exhibit higher levels of both learning- and performance-goal orientations. Additionally, mastery-goal orientation, performance-goal orientation, and self-efficacy are found to positively predict online learning engagement. Specifically, the mastery-goal orientation and self-efficacy are negatively associated with academic stress, while the performance-goal orientation is positively associated with academic stress.",

          "authors": "Benedikt Emanuel Wirth; Andreas Knoblauch; Philipp Müller",
          "abstract": "It is intensively debated whether Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) constitute appropriate models for human vision. Here, we investigated whether CNNs show a typical characteristic of human face perception, namely holistic processing. In Experiment 1, we compared unfamiliar face matching performance between a CNN trained on face recognition and N = 32 human participants for different types of face images: Normal faces (with intact holistic and local feature-based information), Mooney faces (with intact holistic and degraded local feature-based information), and scrambled faces (with intact local feature-based information and degraded holistic information). The CNN showed significantly larger performance decrements for both Mooney and scrambled faces than human participants. In Experiment 2, we trained three CNN architectures on face recognition, one with unrestricted field size and two with field sizes restricted to approximately 1/9 and 1/16 of the input image, respectively. Subsequently, we compared unfamiliar face matching performance between these CNNs and N = 36 human participants who viewed face images either in an unrestricted fashion or through a movable spotlight-like viewing aperture covering approximately  1/9 or 1/16 of the face images. While human face matching accuracy was substantially impaired by restricting the visual input with apertures, CNN performance was not affected by restriction of the receptive field size. These results suggest that (a) CNNs are able to achieve high face matching accuracy without using holistic information (b) the reliance of holistic information in CNNs depends on the specific optimisation conditions under which models were trained.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the role of semantic interpretability and syntactic legality on complex nonword recognition. A rating experiment tested the correlation between these two linguistic factors by asking participants to rate the interpretability of legal and illegal nonwords made up of stem-suffix combinations. Results showed that these two factors are highly correlated. In two further lexical decision experiments (unprimed lexical decision in Experiment 2 and masked primed lexical decision in Experiment 3), we carefully dissociated interpretability and legality by comparing four types of nonwords: high-interpretability syntactically legal, high-interpretability syntactically illegal, low-interpretability syntactically legal, and low-interpretability syntactically illegal nonwords. To test whether or not the activation of embedded stems was modulated by their morpho-semantic and morpho-syntactic context, all complex nonwords were compared against a matched non-stem control.  A significant effect of stem status was found in Experiments 2 and 3, providing evidence for the important role of embedded stems in complex nonword recognition. Moreover, a significant effect of interpretability was found only in the unprimed lexical decision (Experiment 2), but not in masked priming (Experiment 3), suggesting that semantics does not influence complex word recognition until participants have enough time to thoroughly process the nonword. No effect of syntactic legality was found in either experiment. These results highlight the independent roles of semantic interpretability and syntactic legality in visual nonword recognition, supporting an initial semantically blind stage in morphological parsing.",

          "abstract": "Expectancy theory of hypnosis posits that almost any procedure can serve as a hypnotic induction provided it is labelled as “hypnosis”. The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (sham) hypnotic inductions on subjective hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 128 channels.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that one of the unconventional (sham) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable subjective hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. Moreover, EEG correlates of conventional versus unconventional inductions did not substantially differ. Furthermore, we found that labeling a procedure as “hypnosis” resulted in greater hypnosis depth and greater baseline-to-hypnosis reductions in midline frontal alpha activity compared to procedures labeled “control”. However, contrary to the predictions of the expectancy theory, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. The change in midline frontal gamma power negatively correlated with hypnosis depth in both conventional and unconventional inductions. Conversely, correlations of frontal gamma power, occipital theta power, and frontoparietal connectivity in the alpha2 band with hypnotizability differed between conventional and unconventional induction trials.\nOverall, our results provide partial support for the expectancy theory of hypnosis. However, our findings should be considered exploratory. Confirmatory research is required to strengthen our confidence in these effects.",

          "authors": "Bob McMurray; Ethan Kutlu",
          "abstract": "In the last 30 years, the Visual World Paradigm has rapidly become a dominant experimental paradigm for understanding real-time language processing.  Part of this derives from the rich visualizations of the millisecond-by-millisecond timecourse of language processing that it offers.  While the field has converged on strong statistical approaches for this in experimental paradigms, a great deal of recent work has sought to apply the Visual World Paradigm in individual differences paradigms to examine factors such as development and aging, multi-lingualism and various types of communicative and cognitive disorders.  However, sophisticated individual differences work must confront issues of collinearity and co-morbidity among predictor variable, and often seek to examine more than just a simple correlation with some portion of the timecourse of processing.  We argue that existing statistical and methodological approaches are unsuited to this.  Instead, we argue that analysis should start by developing a quantitative “profile” of processing that can be captured in a small number of variables.  These can then be used in more sophisticated regressions like hierarchical regression, commonality analysis and mediation analysis which can unpack shared and unique variance, and test multiple causal pathways.  We illustrate this with tutorials based on our own work on hearing loss, development and language disorders that illustrate how these approaches can provide greater insight into individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Executive function can be defined as the combination of goal representation in working memory and the inhibition of goal-irrelevant responses. This paper comprises two studies that assess these core components of executive function orthogonally and examine their correlation with ASD and ADHD traits in the general population. Both studies utilized a paradigm with two tasks, each assessing working memory and one type of inhibitory control concurrently: the modified Flanker task, which measured working memory and interference control, and the modified Spatial Conflict task, which measured working memory and response inhibition. The study aimed to explore the main effects of memory and inhibitory load in each task, investigate potential over-additive interactions between executive function components, and examine the correlations between autistic and ADHD traits and task performance. Each study involved 100 typically developing adult participants. In Study 1, results showed that reaction time in the Flanker task was significantly influenced by demands on both working memory and inhibitory control. In the Spatial Conflict task, reaction times were affected by congruency, with a potential role of memory load in incongruent trials. Study 2 introduced modifications that revealed effects on reaction time in the Spatial Conflict task due to both memory and congruency load. The Flanker task demonstrated memory effects in reaction time, but congruency effects were only evident under low memory conditions. No interactions between executive function components in an over-additive way were observed in either Study 1 or Study 2. Bayesian linear regression and correlation analyses found evidence against any meaningful correlations between the size of the congruency or memory effect for either dependent variable (accuracy or reaction time) and ASC or ADHD traits in both studies.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Mental health issues among international students are concerning. However, international students tend to underutilize and benefit less from traditional mental health services compared to their domestic counterparts. The current paper proposes digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) as a promising approach to bridge mental health inequities faced by international students. Methods: We explore the definition, types, and efficacy of DMHIs. We outline the unique promise of these interventions in reducing barriers to health service access encountered by international students. To illustrate these points, we discuss example studies of DMHIs for international students. Results: Recent studies have supported the potential benefits of DMHIs for improving international students’ psychological distress, well-being, and help-seeking outcomes. However, many scientific questions remain unsolved. Discussion: To optimize the potential of these interventions for international students, researchers should conduct well-powered randomized controlled trials, examine correlates of intervention use, design single-session interventions, co-develop interventions with the international student community, integrate interventions within the larger system, incorporate ecological momentary assessment and digital phenotyping, and leverage immersive and interactive digital technology.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Although Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) demonstrates clinical utility, its benefits and challenges for treatment-seeking individuals who engage in Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) are not well understood. This study evaluates self-reported benefits (i.e. increases in self-insight and self-efficacy) and challenges of EMA (i.e., beep disturbance, and negative emotional experiences) in this population.\nMethods:  Ninety-seven in-treatment patients with past-month NSSI completed baseline assessments which assessed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Following intake, they completed a 28-day EMA-protocol with six assessments each day. After this self-monitoring period,  a feedback survey was completed in which general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight and self-efficacy, compliance, beep disturbance, and negative emotional experiences related to EMA were assessed. \nResults: Average EMA compliance was 72.14% (SD=20.47) and decreased linearly over time (β=-0.50, p&lt;.001). After using EMA, 32.98% reported increased general self-insight and 9.27% reported increased general self-efficacy. In contrast, 63.91% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight and 41.24% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Additionally, 21,62% experienced negative emotional experiences due to EMA. Higher levels of negative emotional experiences were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-.297, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.383, p&lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-.286, p=.005).\nConclusion: EMA appears feasible and may promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy for most patients.",

          "authors": "Bohan Fu; Alexandra Cook",
          "abstract": "Even when experiencing symptoms, people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) still often go to work, which aligns with the construct of presenteeism - attending work while ill. Existing evidence highlights the detrimental effects of presenteeism in acute conditions, but less is known about chronic conditions. Besides, leadership behavior is critical in follower presenteeism, as leaders’ health-oriented care towards followers (StaffCare) may impact followers’ decisions to work while managing MS symptoms. This study focuses on the reciprocal effects of MS symptoms and presenteeism by analyzing existing data from a 3-wave monthly online study carried out in 2020. Presenteeism remained stable at the monthly level, but we did not find reciprocal relationships between presenteeism and symptoms. StaffCare behavior did not buffer the hypothesized effects of quantitative demands and symptoms on presenteeism but was negatively related to presenteeism. In addition, we extracted three factors from MS symptoms, and further exploratory analyses show a quadratic relationship between presenteeism and symptoms. By highlighting the interplay between disease symptoms and presenteeism, the study extends presenteeism and health-oriented leadership literature to chronic conditions such as MS. It also provides practical insights for individuals, leaders, and organizations on the relation between disease and work.\nKeywords: Multiple Sclerosis (MS), presenteeism, symptoms, health-oriented leadership, quantitative demands",

          "authors": "Christin Scholz; Hang Yee Chan; Hanneke Hendriks; Eva van Reijmersdal",
          "abstract": "Objective: Within complex information environments, persuasive messages are often viewed in close proximity to other relevant and possibly contradictory content. While persuasion research focuses on optimizing individual message types (e.g. anti- or pro-alcohol messages), scarce knowledge about competition between message types hinders the prediction of message effects in real-world settings. We directly compared effects of competing message types to understand relative effects and underlying mechanisms. Methods: Across three studies, English-speaking convenience samples from online panels and our University’s student pool (N=468) viewed a large sample of alcohol-related messages (N=190) of different types (pro-, anti-, and\nnon-alcoholic messages from professional and peer sources). Using within-subject designs, we measured the relative impact of message types on alcohol craving and mechanisms driving these effects. Results: Pro-alcohol messages were more impactful than anti-alcohol messages, especially among frequent binge drinkers. Although emotional responses and familiarity with the alcohol-related content were relevant mechanisms for both pro- and anti-alcohol message effects, both mechanisms were more strongly coupled to craving in response to pro- (vs. anti-alcohol) messages. Conclusions: Accounting for a large variety of messages, our results suggest that restricting pro-alcohol content may be more effective in reducing consumption than producing anti-alcohol content within populations represented by our English-speaking convenience samples. The findings further raise specific concerns about the effectiveness of anti-alcohol messages that target familiarity and emotional processes, especially when viewed in direct competition with pro-alcohol information. Further research on the competition between related message types is crucial to support understanding and prediction of message effectiveness.\nSIGNIFICANCE: We examined how health promotion (professional anti-alcohol) messages perform relative to other relevant confirmatory (peer-produced anti-alcohol messages) and contradictory (professional/peer-produced pro-alcohol) information by comparing alcohol craving across message types. Understanding competition between message types will help improve predictions of message effects in modern, diverse information environments.",

          "authors": "Clara Moeller; Holly Maclean; Paul Hoffman",
          "abstract": "Producing coherent discourse requires us to regulate the content of our speech and avoid interference from discourse-irrelevant concepts that become active in semantic memory. The inhibitory deficit hypothesis proposes that coherence declines in later life are due to a reduced ability to inhibit these irrelevant ideas. However, existing evidence in support of this view is correlational. We performed an experimental test of the hypothesis by asking young (18-25) and older (70-90) participants to produce discourse on a range of topics while attending to two types of visual distractors: images of meaningful concepts and meaningless abstract patterns. The overall global coherence of responses was lower when participants were distracted (cf. no distraction) but this effect was not larger for meaningful distractors. Participants also spoke more slowly under distraction. These effects did not differ between age groups. Critically, however, in the meaningful distractor condition, responses diverged from the original topic more quickly than in the other conditions. This effect was only present in older participants. These results suggest two underlying effects at play. First, performing a concurrent task has a general effect on the speed and coherence of discourse, which in this study was age-invariant. Second, for older people, tasks that activate a series of irrelevant semantic representations have an additional cumulative effect on discourse content, causing it to deviate off topic more rapidly. Our results support the inhibitory deficit hypothesis and suggest that older people can improve their coherence by avoiding semantically-laden environmental distractors like TV or radio programmes.",

          "abstract": "Faces and bodies serve as important cues of physical attractiveness and reproductive fitness. Previous studies however indicate that there are sex-related differences in the visual processing of erotic stimuli. Here we measured eye movements from 43 male and 67 female subjects to investigate gaze patterns and sex differences during perception of dynamic sexual scenes (intercourse; Experiment 1) and static (nude and clothed men and women; Experiment 2) erotic stimuli. Dwell times were longest for faces in both experiments and faces were most likely to be looked at first. In the video experiment, male participants looked more at female chest, buttocks, and genital areas while female participants looked more at male faces. In the picture experiment faces received more fixations when stimuli were clothed, whereas fixations on chest and genital areas increased when the stimuli were nude. Our results show that i) sex differences during sexual perception are larger for static versus dynamic stimuli, ii) that faces are prioritized over sexual signals both while viewing dynamic sexual scenes and static images of humans, and iii) that visibility of sexual cues increases saliency of the sexually relevant body regions (genitals; chest). The overall preference for faces even when viewing sexual intercourse may reflect both the importance of facial characteristics in mate selection as well as the role of facial expressions in evaluating partner satisfaction while having sex.",

          "abstract": "Despite concerns over AI-generated misinformation, it is unclear how much people are impacted by such misinformation or how effective countermeasures are. This study examined whether the influence of AI-generated misinformation on people’s reasoning could be reduced by a pre-emptive, source-focused inoculation or a retroactive, content-focused debunking. In two experiments (N &gt; 1000), a misleading AI-generated article influenced people’s reasoning, regardless of its alleged source (human or AI). In both experiments, the inoculation reduced participants’ general trust in AI-generated information, but failed to significantly reduce the specific influence of the misleading article. Additional trust-boosting and disclaimer interventions used in Experiment 1 also had no impact. By contrast, a debunking used in Experiment 2 effectively reduced misinformation impact, although only a combination of inoculation and debunking eliminated misinformation influence entirely. Findings demonstrate that generative AI can be a persuasive source of misinformation, potentially requiring multiple countermeasures to negate its effects.",

          "abstract": "When individuals are unable to connect to the Internet, they experience anxiety, leading to the phenomenon known as nomophobia. To explain this phenomenon, it is essential to explore the relationship between humans and the Internet. This study investigates that relationship and explains nomophobia through the concept of Internet Extension of Virtual Capacity, which refers to how individuals extend the Internet as part of their own capabilities, unrestricted by specific devices. In Study 1, a Virtual Capability Extension Scale was developed, encompassing four dimensions: intrusiveness, accessibility, functionality, and autonomy. The scale demonstrated a high internal consistency with a Cronbach's α = 0.900, and validity indicators meeting research standards. Study 2 employed a behavioral experiment using a two-group (type of device) and three-phase (the presence or absence of the device) single-factor design to investigate the question \" Where does self-extension occur and what is its content?\". Results indicated: 1) The object of self-extension, and the primary cause of nomophobia, is the Internet rather than specific devices such as smartphones; 2) Internet Extension of Virtual Capacity serves as a precursor to nomophobia; 3) The Internet significantly extends individuals' sense of self-efficacy, more so than simply impacting their broader sense of self. Future research should further explore and apply the Internet Extension of Virtual Capacity, while also considering people's ambivalent attitudes of both love and hate towards Internet.",

A quantitative, cross-sectional design was employed using validated measures to assess leadership perceptions and their impact on students' psychological constructs and career goals. The findings revealed that optimism and hope significantly mediated the relationship between servant leadership and future expectations, highlighting their importance in shaping student ambitions. Life satisfaction, however, played a minimal role. This study underscores the potential of servant leadership in educational settings to foster a positive and future-oriented mindset among students. The limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the study, reliance on self-reported data, and a sample drawn from a specific cultural context. Future research should adopt longitudinal designs and consider diverse psychological constructs to expand the understanding of the influence of leadership.",

          "abstract": "Consensus among sources often signals a claim’s trustworthiness. However, when all sources simply echo information from a single origin, an “illusion of consensus” can arise, leading individuals to feel equally convinced by a dependent consensus (a single, repeatedly cited source) as by an independent consensus (corroborated information from multiple sources), unless their independence is made clear. This effect may occur because repetition can be perceived as a cue for credibility; thus, undermining source credibility might prompt individuals to discount a dependent consensus. We conducted three experiments to test whether whether explaining that source repetition resulted from biases in source selection can enable people to discount a dependent consensus. Participants engaged in a political polling task to assess confidence in claims supported by an independent consensus (news outlets citing different polling companies), a dependent consensus without explanation (news outlets citing the same polling company), or a dependent consensus accompanied by explanations that either boosted or undermined source credibility. While an independent consensus was more persuasive than dependent consensus, explanations alone did not affect claim confidence (Experiments 1-2a, 2b). In Experiment 3, when participants generated their own explanations for why source repetition might undermine reliability, confidence in claims supported by a dependent consensus was reduced. These findings suggest that social inference processes contribute to the illusion of consensus, with implications for interventions designed to mitigate the impact of misleading claims repeated in media.",

During these developmental years, adolescents encounter numerous difficulties, and art therapy is particularly appealing and accessible to them because it uses diverse materials and mediums. Traditional art supplies and structured activities are commonly employed and have proven effective in therapeutic settings. Both long-term and short-term therapy are frequently applied to address complex issues such as PTSD, dissociation, and deep-rooted emotional struggles. Long-term therapy, in particular, fosters deeper emotional exploration and expression through creative mediums, which can sometimes be more effective than verbal communication. The availability of materials like canvas, crafts, and writing tools makes it easier for adolescents to engage with therapeutic practices, supporting their developmental needs for self-expression and exploration.",

          "abstract": "The emotional climate of the family and peer group are theorized to play a central role in the development of emotion regulation (ER) in children and adolescents, such that warmer, more supportive environments promote more effective ER. However, most studies demonstrating associations between social interactions and ER use have focused on individual differences in the regulation of negative affect. This study is the first to investigate whether social interactions with family versus peers are differentially associated with ER, of both negative and positive affect, using a unique multi-timescale approach in which daily assessments were nested within a longitudinal design. Our sample included 112 youths, ages 8-15 at baseline and racially/ethnically representative of our northeast American recruitment area, who completed two waves of daily diaries (21 and 28 days) approximately one year apart. Every evening, participants reported the number and valence of interactions they had had with family members and friends, and their use of ER strategies, producing a total of 5,074 diary entries. We found evidence that: (1) experiencing more positive interpersonal events was associated with greater use of effective ER strategies, whereas experiencing more negative interpersonal events was associated with greater use of counterproductive ER strategies; and (2) family events were more strongly associated with ER changes in younger youths, while friend events were more strongly associated with ER changes in older youths. Altogether, our results provide novel evidence for a social reorientation effect in ER development, highlighting the lasting influence of close relationships during the transition to adolescence.",

Existing research on the dynamics of narcissism and affect has been limited by variations in modeling approaches, overuse of WEIRD samples, and the neglect of their inter-connections and potential differences. The goal of this study is to investigate the dynamics of narcissism and affect with Dynamic Structural Equation Models in a currently being collected Chinese sample (Sample 1, N &gt; 400, observation &gt; 20,000) and two existing U.S. samples (Sample 2, N = 862, observation = 36,631, which measured narcissism dynamics; and Sample 3, N = 222; observation = 20552, which measured affect dynamics). Grandiosity, Vulnerability, Positive affect, and Negative affect were/will be measured by ecological momentary assessment and some traits (e.g., trait narcissism, big five traits, and interpersonal problems) were/will be measured at baseline. We will compare the similarities and differences between narcissism and affect dynamics and conduct a direct cross-cultural comparison on narcissism and affect dynamics. The findings from this study will advance the understanding of narcissism and affect dynamics in terms of their associations with one another and robustness across cultures.",

Active learning have shown to improve learning outcomes and reduce failure rates. However, the interactive nature of active learning classes might lead to fear of negative evaluation among some students that prevent them from engaging in small groups, with the whole class or in conversing one-on-one with the instructor. In this paper, we report the results from two randomized controlled trials (N(study1)=903; N(study2)=817) evaluating two self-guided digital single-session interventions (SSIs) designed to bolster confidence to speak up in different contexts in an active learning class, Anx-SSI (study 1 and 2) and FNE-SSI (study 2) compared to an active control condition. In both studies, we observed that students randomized to the experimental conditions experienced an increase in confidence immediately after completing the intervention compared to the students in the control condition. Both the experimental interventions were acceptable to students. In study 1, the effects on confidence persisted at 1-week follow-up for speaking up in small groups, whole class, and total confidence as well as at 10-week follow-up for confidence in speaking up in whole class. In study 2, however, the gains in confidence did not last at 1-week or 10-week follow-up. Our studies show that brief SSIs (&lt;30 min) can increase confidence among undergraduate students in different contexts within active learning classes. We discuss the lack of long-term effects in study 2 and potential ways to maintain immediate gains in the long-term in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Successful motor coordination in social interactions needs the swift interpretation of others’ actions, yet the pivotal social cues guiding these interactions remain incompletely understood. We conducted three experiments focusing on the execution (Action Execution task) and observation (Action Obseration 1 and 2) of a basic motor act—grasping an object—leveraging ecological stimuli. In the Action Execution task, we compared actions executed with individualistic (grasp to place) or social (grasp to pass) intentions, employing hand kinematics analyses. Grasping with a social intention exhibited slower, more precise execution and distinct hand placement on the object. Video recordings of actions from this first study were used as stimuli for the two subsequent action observation experiments in which two different cohorts of participants had to guess the actions’ outcome by watching the reach-to-grasp phase. In Action Observation 1, participants could only see the arm movement. A classification analysis revealed reaching speed and hand positioning on the grasped object as a major predictor of participants’ responses. Moreover, lower hand placement correlated with perceiving actions as socially directed. This novel finding may be linked to social affordance processing, reflecting the space available for potential interaction. In Action Observation 2, the person in the video was wholly visible, including the face. Using eye-tracking, we identified the face as the primarily attended feature. Our results unveil potential markers of social intentions in motor acts related to goal-oriented hand-object interactions and facial signals, emphasizing individuals’ reliance on multiple bodily cues for action predictions in naturalistic interactions.",

We ran three experiments that varied the time people were allowed to encode items, as well as the order in which they recalled them. Experiment 1 manipulated the free-time benefit in a paradigm in which people recalled items either in forward or backward order. Experiment 2 used the same forward-backward recall paradigm coupled with a distractor task at the end of encoding. Experiment 3 used a cued recall paradigm in which items were tested in random order. In all three experiments, the best-fitting model of the free-time benefit included (1) a consolidation mechanism whereby a just-encoded item continues to be re-encoded as a function of the total free-time available and (2) a stabilization mechanism whereby items become more resistant to output interference with extra free time. Mechanisms such as decay and refreshing, as well as models based on the replenishment of encoding-resources, were not supported by our data.",

This systematic review covers three generalization of extinction learning models: 1) generalization of CS extinction learning, examining how extinction learning to the CS generalizes to novel generalization stimuli (GSs), 2) generalization of GS extinction learning, assessing how extinction learning to a GS generalizes to other novel GSs or the original CS, and 3) generalization of multiple stimuli extinction learning, where extinction learning involves multiple GSs (and sometimes the CS) and its effect on other novel stimuli. Most findings indicate that extinction learning to the CS effectively generalizes to other stimuli. However, extinction learning to a GS or multiple GSs hardly generalizes to other novel GSs or the original CS. Since real-life exposure therapy rarely reproduces the CS, GS extinction learning may better reflect clinical practice; poor generalization of GS(s) extinction learning may constitute another pathway of return of fear. This review also highlights various factors that either hinder or promote the generalization of extinction learning across all three models. Future research should focus on identifying more strategies to enhance the generalization of extinction learning, which can help inform exposure-based treatments.",

          "abstract": "In experience sampling studies, participants are intermittently measured with repeated\nassessments, to track momentary affect changes. The data is collected in specific time\nintervals, leaving information gaps between assessments. To capture affective changes\nbetween assessments, we developed a continuous measure where participants\nretrospectively draw their affective trajectories. This approach, while potentially more\ncomplete, may be influenced by retrospective biases, such as the peak-end effect, where\nintense or recent moments are remembered disproportionately. In an experience sampling\nstudy 115 participants rated their momentary positive and negative affect six times daily,\ndrew affect changes between assessments, reported events, and completed one daily\nhigh-intensity sampling session with up to six additional momentary ratings. We examined\nthe divergence of the retrospective continuous affect drawings from the momentary affect\nand event ratings, respectively. Results showed that for positive affect, divergence between\ndrawings and momentary or event ratings decreased with higher intensity. For negative\naffect, however, higher intensity increased the divergence, but this effect was moderated by\nthe recency of the momentary rating or event. Findings suggest that negative affect tends\nto be reported differently in retrospective assessments compared to momentary evaluations\nor event assessments. This divergence should be taken into account in future studies using\nthis method.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the impact of visually similar flanking stimuli on central target words using the Flanking Letter Lexical Decision (FLLD) task. Specifically, we investigated whether visual similarity effects can explain orthographic relatedness effects observed in previous FLLD tasks. By employing non-reversal mirror letters as visual flankers, we compared their influence on response times to traditional orthographic-related and orthographic-unrelated conditions. Results confirmed the known facilitative effect of orthographic-related flankers on response times (ROCK ROCK ROCK). However, mirror-related conditions showed no facilitative effect (ROCK ROCK ROCK), as evidenced by a Bayesian analysis indicating no significant differences between mirror-related and mirror-unrelated (STEP ROCK STEP). These findings suggest that low-level visual information in the parafovea does not contribute to the processing of the foveal word in tasks requiring specific word identification. The study concludes that only parafoveal information with relevant linguistic content is spatially pooled across target and flankers during word identification tasks. This research highlights the need to consider task-specific attentional demands and the linguistic relevance of parafoveal information in understanding visual and orthographic processing in reading.",

          "abstract": "Background \nEmphasizing herd immunity, a key public health concept often highlighted in vaccine advocacy, could increase or decrease the motivation to get vaccinated due to prosociality or selfishness, respectively, or have no effect at all. Although much research investigated the effects of emphasizing herd immunity, a quantitative research synthesis of the available evidence is lacking. We therefore synthesized findings from more than ten years of experimental research regarding the effect of emphasizing herd immunity (vs. not) on vaccination intention and behavior.\nMethods\nA systematic review and three-level meta-analysis was conducted, utilizing forward and backward citation searches, as well as searching the literature, until May 2024 available in Google Scholar, PubMed, PsychINFO, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science. No language or other formal criteria restrictions were applied. Studies were excluded if they were non-experimental or did neither assess vaccination intention nor actual uptake. Risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. The synthesis was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42024540536).\nFindings \nOur search yielded 5863 records. 3935 were screened by title and abstract, and 281 full-text records were assessed for eligibility. A total of 41 eligible studies remained (65 effect sizes), with 100678 participants, of which 50826 were allocated to intervention groups and 49852 to control groups. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) indicated a small positive effect of emphasizing herd immunity on vaccination intention or behavior, SMD=0·13 (95% CI 0·08 to 0·18, p&lt;0·001) compared to any control/comparator. Between-study heterogeneity was high (I2=91·2%). The communication medium was identified as a moderator, such that experiential methods (VR, simulations) were associated with larger effects. No evidence for publication bias was found.\nInterpretation \nEmphasizing herd immunity has a small positive effect on the motivation to get vaccinated. The communication is more effective when using more elaborate and experiential communication methods.\nFunding \nNone.",

Building on the rejection-identification model, the study additionally explores the indirect effects of interminority ingroup discrimination on negative affect via identification with the devalued or discriminating group. Results from the ethnic context reveal that interminority ingroup discrimination, originating from both the LGBTIQ+ and ethnic groups, is associated with higher negative affect. However, in the health disparity context, this is true only for discrimination coming from LGBTIQ+ people against the health disparity group. No indirect effects of interminority ingroup discrimination via group identification on negative affect were observed. The study highlights the need to identify those affected by interminority ingroup discrimination and the reasons behind it to develop effective interventions for more inclusive and aware communities.

          "abstract": "Animal studies show that novelty boosts memory for unrelated information encountered shortly after the novel experience. Evidence for this effect is less clear in humans. Virtual reality (VR) is often used to simulate spatial novelty in the laboratory, but has led to conflicting results. Schomaker et al. (2014) found that participants recalled more words when encoding followed a novel rather than familiar exploration, which we failed to replicate in two previous studies. Instead, we observed enhanced recall after the first exposure to VR, regardless of the environment being novel or familiar. This suggested distinct types of novelty: spatial novelty resulting from exploring a novel environment and distinct novelty arising from initial exposure to VR. In this study, we investigated the effect of VR, as a distinct novelty, on memory in 35 younger and 32 older adults. We compared memory performance after exploring a VR environment (distinct experience), after exploring another environment through watching a documentary (more common experience) or after no exploration. Results showed better recall after the VR compared to the other conditions, and this effect was modulated by the subjective scores of VR novelty. Despite lower episodic memory performance, older participants benefited as much as the young participants from the VR compared to watching the documentary. We discuss how VR is more than spatial and distinct novelty. VR is a strong tool that fosters positive emotions, feeling of presence, motivation, and self-efficacy, which make it valuable for clinical application in memory rehabilitation.",

The present mixed-methods study queried participant preferences on EMA design and expectancies prior to completing an EMA protocol (Sample 1, N = 1495). We collected survey and qualitative interview data assessing implementation outcomes from a subset of individuals reporting clinical levels of anxiety/stress and frequent alcohol use who enrolled and completed at least two weeks EMA (Sample 2; n = 59). Participants completed three EMA surveys for up to 112 days (M = 76.8 days, SD = 37.88) with an average compliance of 73.8% (SD = 17.18). Descriptive statistics and a hybrid inductive-deductive coding approach were used to analyzed quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. \nParticipants perceived daily variability in most health-related domains (e.g., mental health symptoms, rest), and frequently reported positive expectations for EMA (e.g., anticipated increased awareness). Most participants reported that completing EMA surveys helped them gain awareness of their daily patterns (n = 37, 62.7%) but that study protocols were long and burdensome (n = 44, 74.6%). Qualitative themes of acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity were identified; the nature and frequency of themes varied by level of average compliance. Results help to scaffold ways to leverage preferences for protocol design, expectations for tracking using EMA, and experiences during EMA to guide future work in EMA protocol design, ultimately improving momentary assessment of complex behaviors.",

          "authors": "Simon Myers",
          "abstract": "‘Black box’ AI systems often based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are being developed with astonishing speed. But in critical real-world contexts, such as providing legal, financial or medical advice or assistance, their deployment faces formidable practical and legal barriers. Users, and especially regulators, will demand explainability: that AI systems can provide justifications for their statements, recommendations, or actions. Typically, both regulators and AI researchers have adopted an internal view of explainability: the emerging field of X-AI aims to ‘open the black box’, designing systems whose workings are transparent to human understanding. We argue that, for DNNs and related methods, this vision is both unachievable and misconceived. Instead, we note that AI need only be as explainable as humans and the human brain is itself effectively a black box in which a tangle of 1011 neurons connected by 1014 synapses carry out almost unknown computations. We propose a very different notion, Interactive Explainability: the ability of a system, whether human or AI, to coherently justify and defend its statements and actions to a human questioner. Interactive Explainability requires local, contextually-specific responses built on “mutual understanding” between an AI system and the questioner (e.g., of commonly held background beliefs and assumptions). We outline what mutual understanding involves, and why current AI systems seem far from achieving such understanding. We propose that Interactive Explainability should be a key criterion for regulators, and a central objective for AI research.",

Our study employs sentiment analysis to scrutinize a comprehensive dataset of Telegram messages, aiming to dissect the thematic and emotional nuances of the discourse within these digital protests. This methodological approach allows us to uncover prevailing sentiments, misinformation trends, anti-establishment sentiments, and the broader socio-political ideologies shaping public discourse. Conducted during a crucial phase of the pandemic, our analysis offers deep insights into the role of digital platforms in influencing public opinion, trust in government, and collective behavioral responses.

The co-teaching condition included 70 sixth-grade students in three classes, where mathematics was co-taught by pairs of class teachers and special education teachers. The solo-teaching condition included 76 students in four classes, taught by class teachers. A series of latent change models demonstrated a concurrent decline in students’ perceptions of classroom performance-approach and -avoidance goal structures. Compared to the solo-taught students, co-taught students’ initial perceptions of mastery goal structures were lower, but their change over time was more positive. Overall, these findings shed light on the temporal dynamics of classroom goal structures and demonstrate the positive effect of co-teaching on students' perceptions of the mastery goal structure in mathematics.",

          "abstract": "This study examined components of risky decision making in a large sample of adults with varying degrees of affective distress (N = 526, ages 18-60). Using principal component analysis, five widely used measures of anxiety and depression were dimensionally reduced into a single component representing affective distress. A modified version of an established decision-making task was used to assess whether risky decision making was associated with general intolerance of uncertainty, sensitivity to negative outcomes, or a combination of the two. Distinct choice behavior was observed for lotteries with and without the potential for loss, with loss resulting in choice behavior that was more influenced by whether an option was optimal in terms of expected value rather than degree of uncertainty. This optimal choice preference was attenuated for individuals with higher affective distress. In the absence of loss, choice behavior was less influenced by gain maximization, and sensitivity to high variance options was diminished, regardless of affective distress. These results highlight that decision-making under uncertainty aligns with psychological conceptualizations of risk, where individuals prioritize optimal choices based on expected value rather than strictly avoiding high variance as economic theories of risk suggest, particularly in the context of potential loss. This study clarifies current understanding of how affective factors influence decision-making in the general population.",

When items are distributed uniformly across time as is the standard procedure in \ncategorisation experiments, participants initially classify items based on similarity to category \nprototypes. Over time, as more detailed exemplar representations of categories are formed, people \nshift towards utilising exemplar-based classification for increased performance. By contrast, if items\nare experienced less frequently over time as is commonly observed in real-world conditions, \nparticipants instead seem to initially employ an exemplar strategy and then shift towards prototype \nclassification. By re-analysing the same data, we argue instead that this pattern can be solely \nunderstood as differences in accuracy in categorising exception items over time; consequently, the \npresented evidence is insufficient to distinguish between a strategy-shift and a more parsimonious \nexemplar-forgetting account. Rule-plus-exception category structures are equally well fit by \nexemplar and prototype models when exception performance low; however as exception accuracy \nincreases, an exemplar model advantage emerges. As such, while relative model fit could indicate a \nshift between classification strategies, an exemplar-only strategy can produce identical trends if \nperformance varies. Additionally, although their experimental design successfully introduced a \ndistributional manipulation, this systematically influenced stimulus recency. We found that while a \nmixture model of strategy-shifting provided a good fit to data, an exemplar-only model sensitive to \nrecency was equally effective. While a strategy-shift remains plausible, we suggest that a single system model provides a more parsimonious account of the present data and can also reconcile the perceived tension between categorisation and memory findings.",

We tested these questions in four pre-registered online studies (N=3521), using hypothetical scenarios encompassing four different domains (education, finance, mental health, and fitness) and a willingness to pay task, where we asked participants how much they were willing to pay for a service, offered either with human contact (e.g., a financial advisor), or fully digital (e.g., an app for financial advice). We found that services offering human contact are valued more than their digital equivalent, and people on higher income are willing to pay more for them, but not for digital; crucially, nudging people to perceive human contact as scarce increased its value, in that people were willing to pay more for it. These findings were replicated within a UK and Italian sample and support our intuition that the move towards digitalisation could introduce a new form of inequality, that of access to human contact.",

          "abstract": "International students studying in the UK often face significant challenges, including language barriers, a lack of social networks, and socio-cultural differences, all of which can negatively affect their mental health. For Algerian international students (AISs), these challenges may be heightened due to their distinct cultural background and the fact that English is not their first language. Despite the increasing number of AISs in the UK, little research has explored their specific experiences in relation to mental health. This study aimed to examine AISs' understandings of mental health, the factors influencing disclosure, and their help-seeking behaviours and coping strategies. In-depth, audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 AISs studying at UK universities. An inductive, reflexive thematic analysis was employed to allow for a flexible exploration of participants' experiences. The analysis revealed several key themes, including Algerian cultural influences on mental health understanding, the paradox of family support versus pressure, religion as both a coping mechanism and a barrier to disclosure, and a preference for traditional treatments over professional help. Barriers to professional mental health disclosure were also identified, including reliance on informal peer disclosure. Enhancing practitioners' cultural competence regarding religious coping may support AISs and benefit the broader international student population.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge is an important predictor and outcome of learning and development. Its measurement is challenged by the fact that knowledge can be integrated and homogeneous, or fragmented and heterogeneous, which can change through learning. These characteristics of knowledge are at odds with current standards for test development, demanding a high internal consistency (e.g., Cronbach's Alphas greater .70). To provide an initial empirical base for this debate, we conducted a meta-analysis of the Cronbach's Alphas of knowledge tests derived from an available data set. Based on 285 effect sizes from 55 samples, the estimated typical Alpha of domain-specific knowledge tests in publications was α = .85, CI90 [.82; .87]. Alpha was so high despite a low mean item intercorrelation of .22 because the tests were relatively long on average and bias in the test construction or publication process led to an underrepresentation of low Alphas. Alpha was higher in tests with more items, with open answers and in younger age, it increased after interventions and throughout development, and it was higher for knowledge in languages and mathematics than in science and social sciences/humanities. Generally, Alphas varied strongly between different knowledge tests and populations with different characteristics, reflected in a 90% prediction interval of [.35, .96]. We suggest this range as a guideline for the Alphas that researchers can expect for knowledge tests with 20 items, providing guidelines for shorter and longer tests. We discuss implications for our understanding of domain-specific knowledge and how fixed cut-off values for the internal consistency of knowledge tests bias research findings.",

          "authors": "sharon sherman; Naomi Havron",
          "abstract": "Symbolic play supports crucial aspects of early childhood development, including language and social-cognitive skills. While research has established that parent-child dyadic play facilitates symbolic play development, less is known about how the addition of siblings (triadic interactions) is related to symbolic play development. Previous findings suggest that triadic play may present both opportunities and challenges for symbolic play development. We examined toddlers' symbolic play across dyadic (mother-child) and triadic (mother-child-sibling) free-play interactions. Twenty toddlers (aged 1.7-2.5 years, 8 girls) were observed playing with their mothers and older siblings (aged 3.5-7.5 years, 10 sisters) in two standardized 10-minute play sessions at their homes. We coded five dimensions of symbolic play: frequency, duration, variety, toddler initiative, and complexity. Consistent with our hypothesis, toddlers demonstrated significantly higher levels of symbolic play in dyadic versus triadic interactions overall (p &lt; 0.0001, d = 0.953), and across all measured dimensions (p &lt; .05 - p &lt; .001, d = 0.637 - 0.915). These findings suggest that dyadic parent-child play may optimize conditions for symbolic play development, and/or that the addition of siblings introduces competing demands that reduce opportunities for advanced symbolic play. The results have implications for understanding how family configuration influences early play experiences, and may have implications for designing interventions to support symbolic play development in different social contexts.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between working memory and attention during visual search tasks, focusing on how time constraints affect the encoding of visual information into working memory. The research is based on the premise that under time pressure, participants may be more likely to encode the identity of search array items into working memory to continue processing after the visual stimuli are no longer visible. Experiment 1 and 2 used a surprise trial method to test memory for target identity with long and short presentation times. Despite higher location accuracy with longer viewing, there was no significant difference in surprise identity test accuracy between conditions. To get a more reliable measurement of working memory, Experiment 3 introduced a priming task to measure memory strength indirectly but found no priming effect. Overall, these three experiments did not provide strong evidence to support or negate the hypothesis that short presentation time might enhance working memory strength and thus did not support the possibility of using working memory to conduct visual search on briefly presented arrays. Suggestions on future design of this study interest are provided.",

In response, a community-university partnership formed in pursuit of developing culturally tailored mental health programming. To inform program development, the partnership conducted community-engaged research to understand diverse stakeholders’ relevant concerns, beliefs, and preferences. Methods: In Study 1, community health workers (n=13; 92% Black; 100% women; 23–78 years old, Mage=52) participated in one-on-one semi-structured interviews. In Study 2, community members (n=54; 100% Black; 63% women, 31% men, 6% gender not reported; 18–91 years old) participated in focus groups. In both studies, transcripts were coded using descriptive, semantic, realist thematic analysis. Member checks were conducted with organizational leadership, study participants, and broader members of the community. Results: Across both studies, participants described cultural (e.g., stigma) and material (e.g., insurance) barriers to care; systematic (e.g., poverty) and interpersonal (e.g., lack of social support) mental health risks; willingness to discuss mental health (e.g., increasing over time); and preferences for mental health education and services (e.g., provider authenticity). Individual study results and convergences and divergences across studies are detailed. Conclusions: Results informed the development of a pilot mental health education program, “Witnessing for Mental Health.” The community health worker–delivered program addresses participant-identified cultural, tangible, and systemic barriers to mental health care and leverages increasing community openness and interest in discussing mental health.",

          "abstract": "Children must develop quick and precise eye movements for processing visual information across various domains, including reading, visual search, scene perception, joint attention, and motor control. Prior research suggests that eye movement precision continues to develop through adolescence (Helo et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2022; Reichle et al., 2013) but the underlying factors remain unclear. Reading may contribute to this development, as dyslexia has been linked to unstable oculomotor control in reading tasks (Eden et al., 1994), and reading may provide a form of practice for oculomotor control. This longitudinal study examines factors influencing oculomotor planning in a sample of 206 children aged 7-12 with varying language and reading abilities. Results show that oculomotor planning becomes faster and more accurate as children age, and with better reading. We also observe differences in how oculomotor coordination to properties of the display (e.g., distance and direction) both developmentally and with differences in reading. Findings are discussed in relation to developmental theories of processing speed and reading experience, along with implications for typical developmental experimental paradigms like the Visual World Paradigm or passage reading.",

          "abstract": "Childhood trauma, encompassing emotional, physical, and sexual maltreatment, has profound and lasting effects on adult romantic relationships. This review synthesizes findings from recent studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which childhood trauma impacts marital and relationship satisfaction. Research indicates that childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) undermines relationship quality by fostering negative characteristics such as decreased compassionate goals and increased hostility towards partners. Longitudinal studies reveal that individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment exhibit lower relationship satisfaction, with effects intensifying over time. Specifically, a study found that 68% of individuals with childhood trauma reported significant relationship distress compared to 38% of those without such experiences. Additionally, childhood trauma is linked to insecure attachment patterns, including anxious and avoidant attachment, which mediate the relationship between trauma and poor relationship quality. Depression and anxiety, often stemming from childhood trauma, further exacerbate these issues, leading to lower quality intimate relationships. Dyadic studies highlight significant actor and partner effects, indicating that both individuals’ trauma histories contribute to overall couple satisfaction. For instance, couples where both partners had a history of trauma reported 25% lower relationship satisfaction compared to couples without such histories. This review underscores the importance of addressing childhood trauma in therapeutic settings to improve relationship outcomes and break the cycle of abuse.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces scale2fit, a framework for evaluating multiple factors affecting vowels’ acoustic properties jointly, which proves useful for vowel normalization and avoiding over-normalization. The acoustic properties of vowels stem from a combination of multiple factors including the intended vowel quality, vocal tract length, coarticulation, and speech rate. However, most current vowel normalization approaches do not distinguish among the different determinants. Scale2fit uses mixed effects models to jointly evaluate multiple factors, avoiding their conflation in vowel normalization. Study 1 shows that the new method excels in a series of comparisons with other normalization methods. Study 2 shows that the proposed framework excels at preserving vowel space reduction that follows from short duration, and is therefore more appropriate for studying vowel space reduction. Finally, Study 3 shows that it is possible to establish variety norms and add speakers incrementally",

          "abstract": "Here we explored the potential sex differences in risk-taking behaviors in Jeopardy!, a popular American television gameshow known for its unique blend of trivia knowledge and strategic wagering. Utilizing a retrospective analysis of publicly available Jeopardy! episodes spanning from 1984 to 2022, we investigated contestants’ wagering behaviors during the game’s Daily Double segments. These segments require contestants to make wagers before seeing the clue, introducing a calculated risk that varies with the contestants’ confidence in the category. The dataset included episodes from different decades to assess whether bidding behaviors might have changed over time and whether these behaviors exhibited significant differences between perceived male and female contestants. Analysis did not reveal any statistically significant differences in the wagering patterns between male and female contestants across all Daily Doubles or within specific rounds of play. Even when considering the temporal trends over approximately four decades, the interaction between contestant sex and epoch did not significantly affect the percentage of amount wagered. The absence of significant differences between perceived males and females underscores the complexity of risk-taking behaviors and the potential influence of changing societal norms and cultural contexts on these behaviors. Our study contributes to the broader discourse on risk-taking by highlighting the importance of situational and temporal contexts in evaluating risk preferences. While focused on a specific and unique context, a gameshow, these findings invite further research into the complexities of human decision-making and risk-taking behaviors across different domains and environments.",

          "abstract": "Minority stress may be a family experience: Mounting evidence suggests that (a) LGBTQ+ parents experience marginalization based on their identities, relationships, and families (i.e., individual-, couple-, and family-level minority stress), (b) minority stress is associated with family-related outcomes (such as parenting stress and family functioning), and (c) children in LGBTQ+ parent families also experience minority stress. However, a formal synthesis of this evidence is currently lacking. Within this systematic review, we aim to elucidate whether minority stress is indeed a family experience by synthesizing associations between minority stress across all three levels of the family system and key outcomes for parents, children, and the family. We retrieved 43 publications (1982–2022) based on 30 samples (3,803 families, 332 effect sizes) from a systematic, multi-tiered literature search (including within PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science). Multiverse-based meta-analyses (3,552 models) supported our hypotheses regarding meaningful associations between distal minority stress and child externalizing (mean r = .24), internalizing (.22), and total adjustment problems (.21), as well as parenting competence (-.17), parenting stress (.13), but not regarding the parent-child relationship (-.10), and family functioning (-.11) due to volatile specification patterns. These and further descriptive syntheses support the notion that parents and children in LGBTQ+ parent families experience minority stress, which is linked to key outcomes relating to the health and well-being of individual family members, as well as to the family system. Theoretical (i.e., a Family Minority Stress Model) and empirical advances (e.g., diverse sampling, intensive longitudinal designs) are needed to advance the field further.",

          "abstract": "Rules are deeply ingrained in our cognition; such that deliberate rule breaking incurs a cognitive cost. The current study investigates the influence of rule breaking on explicit sense of agency as well as the implicit perceptual illusion of temporal binding. In two experiments, participants completed a free choice task that involved following or breaking a predetermined rule. The task required pressing a key that matched to a visual stimulus which triggered a corresponding change after a delay. Participants estimated the delay as an index of temporal binding. The results showed similar levels of explicit agency for rule following and rule breaking. Temporal binding, by contrast, was indeed influenced by rule breaking; however, the relationship is complex. Specifically, participants had smaller interval estimates for rule following vs. breaking at the 100ms delay, likely reflecting cognitive conflict during rule breaking, whereas this effect reversed for the 400ms and 700ms delays. We interpret our results in relation to the wider rule breaking and temporal binding literature.",

College students (Experiments 1 and 2) and adult learners (Experiments 3 and 4) participated in two weekly learning sessions, followed by a one-week delayed criterial test. The interleaved group alternated between two tenses per session, while the blocked group learned one tense per session. Results indicated that interleaving improved verb conjugation skills across all experiments, enhanced tense identification in Experiments 1 and 3, and boosted language identification skills in Experiment 4. Notably, interleaving proved beneficial across tenses differing in usage, meaning, and suffixes, suggesting its effectiveness is not restricted to closely related tenses. These findings highlight interleaving as a versatile and powerful strategy for language learning, with benefits extending beyond the confines of similar grammatical structures.",

Our process-based model is illustrated by reproducing inter-individual diﬀerences in a developmental study of noun comprehension (Garrison et al., 2020). In our modeling framework, numerical values of model parameters map onto specific cognitive processes (e.g., attention or working memory) involved in gaze control. Because of the general architecture of the mathematical model and our robust procedures in model inference via Bayesian data assimilation, our framework may find applications in other fields of developmental and cognitive sciences.",

We introduce the Interval Truth Model (ITM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ITM performs better than using simple means of the responses.

While there is consensus that carelessness can jeopardize the validity of survey measures through a variety of psychometric issues, the question when carelessness becomes a serious problem is less well studied.

We leverage statistical robustness theory to derive analytical expressions for the bias caused by careless responding, with a focus on biases in Pearson's correlation coefficient. We find that carelessness incidence rates of as low as 5% can suffice to cause sign flips in correlational estimates. Furthermore, we show that the impact of carelessness varies by the type of carelessness and that psychometric scales that are designed to be reliable are those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of careless responding.",

The multistudy cross-diagnostic analysis of 454 participants revealed that receptive pragmatic skills were impaired in all clinical groups compared to controls, with schizophrenia showing the most severely impaired profile, whereas expressive pragmatic skills were impaired in four neurological conditions (i.e., Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, right-hemisphere stroke, and traumatic brain injury). The association with ToM was limited to receptive pragmatics and moderate in the whole sample. Overall, pragmatic impairment emerged as a diffuse feature of neurological and psychiatric illnesses, which contributes to defining complex socio-communicative phenotypes but cannot be equated to a social cognition deficit and should hence be the target of specific assessment and intervention.",

However, perceived misalignment varies across countries (partial η² = 0.132): Western countries are more skeptical and misaligned, whereas Eastern countries are more aligned, optimistic and trusting. These differences cannot be attributed to familiarity with genAI. Country accounts for over 64% of variance, pointing to cultural factors driving these differences.

          "abstract": "Early exposure to poverty may have profound and enduring impacts on developmental trajectories over the lifespan. This study investigated potential links between childhood socioeconomic position, recent economic change, and temporal discounting in a large international cohort (N=12,951 adults from 61 countries). Temporal discounting refers to the tendency to prefer smaller immediate rewards over larger rewards delivered after a delay, and connects to consequential outcomes including academic achievement, occupational success, and risk-taking behaviors. Consistent with multiple theories about the impacts of stress exposure, individuals who reported lower socioeconomic positions in childhood exhibited greater temporal discounting in adulthood compared to peers who did not. Furthermore, an interaction emerged between childhood socioeconomic position and recent economic change, such that the steepest temporal discounting was found among those from lower childhood socioeconomic positions who also recently experienced negative economic change as a result of the COVID pandemic. These associations remained significant even when accounting for potentially confounding factors like education level and current employment. Findings provide new evidence that childhood socioeconomic position relates to greater temporal discounting and steeper devaluation of future rewards later in adulthood, particularly in response to contemporaneous economic change. This suggests childhood socioeconomic position may have longer-term impacts on developmental trajectories. Speculatively, childhood socioeconomic position may shape adult behavior through increased life stress, diminished access to resources, and lower perceived trust and reliability in social systems. These findings underscore the long-term implications of socioeconomic gaps, cycles of disadvantage and economic marginalization.",

          "abstract": "This research introduces a novel methodology for assigning quantifiable, controllable and\npsychometrically validated personalities to Large Language Models-Based Agents (Agents)\nusing the Big Five personality framework. It seeks to overcome the constraints of human\nsubject studies, proposing Agents as an accessible tool for social science inquiry. Through a\nseries of four studies, this research demonstrates the feasibility of assigning\npsychometrically valid personality traits to Agents, enabling them to replicate complex\nhuman-like behaviors. The first study establishes an understanding of personality\nconstructs and personality tests within the semantic space of an LLM. Two subsequent\nstudies—using empirical and simulated data—illustrate the process of creating Agents and\nvalidate the results by showing strong correspondence between human and Agent answers\nto personality tests. The final study further corroborates this correspondence by using\nAgents to replicate known human correlations between personality traits and\ndecision-making behaviors in scenarios involving risk-taking and ethical dilemmas, thereby\nvalidating the eﬀectiveness of the psychometric approach to design Agents and its\napplicability to social and behavioral research.",

          "abstract": "Romantic attachment orientations are important predictors of individuals’ and their partners’ well-being and health. However, less is known about whether similarity in attachment between partners predicts better well-being and health outcomes. In two studies (total Ncouples = 1,602), we tested with actor-partner interdependence and dyadic polynomial regression models if partners’ attachment and their similarity were linked to their well-being and health (i.e., life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, self-rated health, medical conditions). Results revealed significant actor effects between anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), self-rated health (both studies), and medical conditions (Study 2 only). For avoidance, significant actor effects were found for life satisfaction (Study 1, female partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). Partner effects emerged for anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2) and depressive symptoms (Study 1 only) and for avoidance and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). The results of dyadic polynomial regression and response surface analyses, however, provided no evidence for any similarity effects of romantic attachment on well-being and health in both studies. In sum, the findings suggest that lower anxiety and avoidance in both partners is generally associated with higher well-being and health. However, similarity in partners’ attachment seem unimportant for concurrent well-being and health. Implications of the findings are discussed considering attachment theories and relationship processes.",

To advance a naturalistic understanding, we applied novel computational tools to quantify comprehensive cues based on prior theories (facial, bodily, clothing, environmental cues) (Study 1) and manipulate individual cues realistically (Study 2) in naturalistic images. Across two pre-registered studies (N1 = 2,435 U.S. representative; N2 = 569), we found that with rich information available, the cues predicting trait impressions were sparse. We confirmed for a subset of cues that these predictions were causal. Predictive cues carried unique information beyond the consistent information shared with other available cues. Unpredictive cues played a role by shaping the utilization of predictive cues through interactions. Together, our findings suggest that the mind may have evolved to utilize the naturalistic relations between cues to simplify what information to attend to when forming trait impressions.",

          "abstract": "Praise is not only rewarding but also informative. It can provide children with information about their competence, especially when they are uncertain or unable to judge for themselves. Not all praise is equally meaningful, however: Praise from someone who praises only high-quality work is more informative than praise from someone who praises indiscriminately. Across four experiments, we find that 4- to 5-year-old U.S. children—from both in-person preschool and on- line samples—can infer the informativeness of others’ praise based on the statistical dependence between praise and the quality of work evaluated. Participants were more likely to endorse praise from a teacher whose previous praise covaried with the quality of work over a teacher who praised indiscriminately or a teacher who praised only lower-quality work (Experiment 1). Although chil- dren did not show such a preference when seeking out praise for themselves (Experiment 2), they sought out praise from different teachers on behalf of another learner depending on the learner’s goal (Experiments 3-4). Collectively, these findings show that even young children understand that praise is more than just positive reinforcement. Rather, they can reason about a speaker’s inferred informativeness and use this to guide whose praise to seek out and endorse.",

          "authors": "Ya-Wen Chang; Ian Sotomayor; Erica Szkody; Kathryn Fox; Jessica L. Schleider",
          "abstract": "In the United States, the experience of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth varies across regions with high and low levels of stigma (e.g., laws, policies and cultural norms that limit the lives of individuals with stigmatized identities). Some evidence suggests that stigma can undermine response to individual-level psychosocial interventions among youth, creating a need to identify factors that may buffer against minority stressors’ effects in high-stigma contexts. Social support may be one such factor. Therefore, among LGBTQ+ youth who received a digital, single-session intervention (SSI) focused on minority stress, we investigated whether structural and internalized stigma and social support predicted intervention response, independently or interactively. Specifically, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth in environments characterized by high stigma would report weaker SSI responses. Further, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth who perceived higher social support would report stronger SSI responses. We also tested structural stigma and social support as moderators. Using data from a previously-completed randomized evaluation, we analyzed data from 244 LGBTQ+ adolescents, aged 13 to 16 years, across 181 counties in 46 U.S. states, who engaged with the SSI. We created a factor representing structural stigma using confirmatory factor analysis at the county level. No evidence emerged for structural stigma or social support as a moderator of intervention effects on internalized stigma, identity pride, or mental health-related outcomes, either at post-intervention or at two-week follow up. Results speak to the potentially broad utility of the SSI tested in this trial for LGBTQ+ youth with limited access to mental health support.",

The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines identify a range of standards that journals can adopt to promote the verifiability of the research they publish. We evaluated the adoption of TOP standards within health psychology and behavioural medicine journal policies, as this had not yet been systematically assessed. In a cross-sectional study on 19 health psychology and behavioural medicine journals, eight raters evaluated TOP standard adoption by these journals using the TRUST journal policy evaluation tool. Out of a total possible score of 29, journal scores ranged from 1 to 13 (median = 6). Standards related to use of reporting guidelines and data transparency were adopted the most, whereas standards related to pre-registration of study analysis plans and citation of code were adopted the least. TOP guidelines have to-date been poorly adopted within health psychology and behavioural medicine journal policies. There are several relatively straightforward opportunities for improvement, such as expanding policies around research data to also consider code and materials, and reducing ambiguity of wording.

          "abstract": "Psychological concepts are increasingly understood as complex dynamic systems that change\nover time. To study these complex systems, researchers are increasingly gathering intensive\nlongitudinal data (ILD), revealing non-linear phenomena such as asymptotic growth, mean-level\nswitching, and regulatory oscillations. However, psychological researchers currently lack\nadvanced statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture these non-linear processes\naccurately, which hinders theory development. While methods such as local polynomial\nregression, Gaussian processes, and generalized additive models (GAMs) exist outside of\npsychology, they are rarely applied within the field because they have not yet been reviewed\naccessibly and evaluated within the context of ILD. To address this important gap, this article\nintroduces these three methods for an applied psychological audience. We further conducted a\nsimulation study, which demonstrates that all three methods infer non-linear processes that have\nbeen found in ILD more accurately than polynomial regression. Particularly, GAMs closely\ncaptured the underlying processes, performing almost as well as the data-generating parametric\nmodels. Finally, we illustrate how GAMs can be applied to explore idiographic processes and\nidentify potential phenomena in ILD. This comprehensive analysis empowers psychological\nresearchers to model non-linear processes accurately and select a method that aligns with their\ndata and research goals.",

Understanding why this is happening is crucial to prevent further negative impacts. In this Perspective, we explore one possible reason—digital media use makes people more bored. We propose that digital media increases boredom through dividing attention, elevating desired level of engagement, reducing sense of meaning, heightening opportunity costs, and serving as an ineffective boredom coping strategy.",

This theory resolves the first part, including the philosophical zombie question, as it shows why feeling is an inherent part of consciousness, and the tremendous advantage that a feeling organism possesses, summarised in the word “omnilyo”. While not directly addressing the technological aspects, the theory does define requirements and constraints on the workings of conscious matter, which, while clearly beyond current scientific capabilities, does signpost the invention of artificial consciousness, which, needless to say, would be mankind’s greatest discovery.",

          "abstract": "Whether exposure to a novel environment in virtual reality improves subsequent verbal memory or not is still debated. The present study aims to replicate previous positive findings. To do so, we assessed whether exploration of a novel virtual environment leads to better word memory in a task performed afterwards than exploration of a familiar environment and whether this effect is related to the exploratory behavior. Fifty-five participants completed three sessions that took place on different days. The first session consisted of assessing the baseline memory performance. Participants encoded a list of 40 words and then freely recalled as many words as possible immediately after a 30-second distraction task and a 24-hour delay. In the second session, participants familiarized themselves with a virtual environment and then explored either the familiar or a novel environment before performing the same memory task with different words. In the third, participants explored the familiar or novel virtual environment (according to the counterbalancing design) before performing the memory task. Like some previous studies, our results failed to find a positive impact of exploring a novel environment (spatial novelty) on memory. Rather, we observed that recall is higher after exploring a virtual environment (regardless of it being novel or familiar) compared to the baseline performance. In fact, the experience of virtual reality might induce another type of novelty, called distinct novelty, which could impact memory too. Furthermore, our results suggest a negative correlation between age and the novelty effect, indicating the future investigation of individual factors.",

          "abstract": "Despite being beloved pets, cats pose significant threats to wildlife through predation and competition. Existing legislation struggle to mitigate these impacts, highlighting the necessity for effective communication strategies. This study surveys a mostly female Swiss sample (150 participants) of university students. We investigate how different visual representations of domestic cats categorized as cute, scary, dirty, or neutral influence participants’ recall of information either positive, negative, or neutral about cats. We hypothesized that negative and dirty representations would enhance recall of negative information and cute representation would enhance the recall of positive information.\nContrary to our expectations, our analysis revealed no significant effect of visual representations on the recall of positive, negative, or neutral information. The results suggest that strong emotional and social bonds with cats, as well as their prevalent positive representation in culture, may buffer against the influence of negative imagery. Exploratory analysis indicated that individual factors, such as having a cat allergy, significantly reduced the recall of positive information. These findings show the complexity of altering public perception about the ecological impact of familiar and positively perceived animals like cats. Our study reveals the limitations of using visual representations alone to influence knowledge acquisition.",

          "authors": "Sergio Cervera Torres",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between dispositional empathy and emotional processing during embodied digital interactions. It builds upon the Spatial Affective Interaction (SAI) framework, which integrates neurobehavioral and cognitive perspectives on affective laterality, affective spatialization, and hand-proximity effects. The research particularly focuses on how lateralized manual interactions with emotional images (“emotional grabbing”) affect users’ pleasantness experiences. A sample of 240 right-handed participants used either their dominant right hand or non-dominant left hand to engage with 40 emotional images (20 pleasant and 20 unpleasant) using ipsilateral (same hand-side) or contralateral (opposite hand-side) interactions in a touchscreen environment. Key findings reveal asymmetries in pleasantness experiences that depend on hand dominance, ipsilateral interactions, and empathy levels. Specifically, participants reported increased pleasantness when using the dominant right hand to interact with right-positioned pleasant images, especially at lower empathy levels.\nConversely, interactions with left-positioned unpleasant images using the non-dominant left hand resulted in heightened unpleasantness among low-empathy participants, with the opposite pattern observed in high-empathy individuals. These findings suggest that “emotional grabbing” may enhance sensitivity to emotional content in less empathic individuals, possibly by compensating for impaired activation of the action-observation network (AON), which integrates sensorimotor and empathy processes. The study underscores the relevance of considering hand dominance, emotional valence, and empathy in the future design of embodied digital interactions, to enhance the emotional experiences of individuals with explicit empathy deficits.",

In India,\ngender is often perceived heteronormatively, leaving no room for androgyny and\nexpecting conformity to the gender assigned at birth. This rigid binary system does not\naccommodate those who feel uncomfortable with their assigned gender. Gender\ndysphoria refers to the distress experienced when one's true gender identity does not\nalign with their assigned gender. This condition can be exacerbated by societal labels\nand expectations, such as gender-specific washrooms, which challenge non-cis-\ngender individuals' sense of self. Activities not conforming to gender norms, like a\nmale-presenting individual wearing nail paint, invite judgment and restrict self-\nexpression, leading to a distorted self-identity. This lack of personal expression and\ninsecure self-identity correlates with low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. The\npresent study aimed to highlight the significance of gender dysphoria and societal\nlabels as barriers to self-identity in gender-queer individuals. An exhaustive literature\nreview and purposive sampling of 20 LGBTQIIA+ individuals aged 18-30 were\nconducted.

However, past studies on basic psychological needs often reported ambiguous and unexpected findings for perfectionistic standards. The Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP) recently distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of high yet attainable standards (excellencism). This study investigated their distinct associations with basic psychological needs, using measures taken from the need-as-motives and the need-as-nutriments perspectives. Young adults (n=305) completed the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism and various measures of need-related constructs. A multivariate multiple regression supported the hypothesis that excellencism and perfectionism are differentially linked with psychological needs. Excellencism was positively associated with three approach-oriented motives (need for achievement, affiliation, power) and satisfaction with the need for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Conversely, pursuing perfectionistic standards was positively linked to two avoidance-oriented motives (e.g., fear of failure and losing control) and frustration with the three basic psychological needs. These findings reconcile research and theories by showing that pursuing perfection is not associated with adaptive psychological needs. Perfectionistic standards are linked to two avoidance-oriented motives (i.e., fear of failure and losing control) and frustration of basic psychological needs when properly distinguished from excellencism.",

          "abstract": "Generating a voluntary action typically involves some experience of conscious intention. Prospective theories propose that conscious intention is a readout of action preparation processes, while retrospective theories view conscious intention as an inference retro-inserted into narratives of one’s own behaviour. Studying conscious intention experimentally is difficult, because (a) eliciting voluntary actions in laboratory settings is problematic, and (b) existing measures of conscious intention using post-action reports could involve post hoc biases. We developed touch-typing versions of a verbal fluency task to elicit voluntary actions to address (a), and then interrupted participants quasi-randomly, asking “Were you about to type your next word?”, to address (b). Across two experiments with 51 participants, we found conscious intention emerged at 1079 ms (SD=1366 ms) and 1258 ms (SD=749 ms) before the estimated time of upcoming action. EEG results showed more reduction of beta-band oscillations and a greater readiness-potential-like deflection prior to probes that elicited reports of conscious intention, compared to probes that did not. Our results offer novel support for prospective theories of conscious intention, and may partly address methodological difficulties of previous studies.",

Here, we report three experiments in which monkeys wagered a small, medium, or large number of tokens on the accuracy of their performance (retrospective metacognition), or anticipated performance (prospective metacognition), on each trial of a matching-to-sample task. Subjects’ wagers tended to maximize reward and minimize risk. They were also influenced by the number of tokens needed to earn a reward on each trial. Alternative cues such as reaction time and test difficulty could not account for our results which show, for the first time, that monkeys can make graduated and strategic metacognitive judgments.",

          "abstract": "Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition, significantly affecting movement and coordination ability. Whilst prior work has shown that those with DCD face challenges in motor mental imagery, links between general mental visual imagery skills and movement ability have yet to be identified. We therefore tested the prevalence of aphantasia (i.e., a lack of mental imagery), and general mental imagery skills, in adults with probable DCD (pDCD) using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ). We found 20% of pDCD participants reported comorbid aphantasia, in comparison to 2-6% found in the general population. Strikingly, 100% of pDCD participants meeting criteria for aphantasia had co-occurring developmental prosopagnosia and/or autism, suggesting a strong link between these conditions. Movement difficulties were associated with weaker mental imagery, both in the social and non-social domains. Despite this, single case analyses revealed dissociations between DCD symptoms and mental imagery abilities, i.e., some with pDCD can exhibit hyperphantasia, that is, exceptional mental imagery skills. Given the elevated prevalence of aphantasia in pDCD, and the utilisation of mental imagery related treatments to support this group, we highlight some essential considerations for professionals working with those with DCD in mental health, occupational therapy, and education.",

One difficulty of this line of research is that artworks differ on many dimensions that influence aesthetic appreciation. While trying to keep the out-of-scope dimensions constant is a typical strategy, using a stimulus set with balanced dimensions avoids noise and bias. Although several visual art datasets exist, none have been specifically designed to control many dimensions simultaneously. In response to the need of a well-controlled and balanced stimulus set, the Leuven Orthogonalized Art Dataset (LOAD) controls and balances dimensions related to aesthetic appreciation, including style, content, emotional valence, and liking/beauty. Each artwork in the image set was first carefully selected to fit a balanced design, then annotated by 50 participants on measures of pleasure, fluency, interest, liking, emotional valence, and familiarity for further validation. This careful annotation process also aims to disentangle the often- ambiguous interrelations among several aesthetic appraisals such as pleasure, interest, and liking. By providing balanced designs across multiple dimensions, LOAD serves as a valuable and highly flexible tool for exploring the complexities of aesthetic appreciation.",

The target location task employed in the experiments allows interpretation in terms of spatial attention and response-related processes; the target discrimination task – in contrast – allows unambiguous interpretation of effects in terms of spatial attention. In the present experiment, we replicated Vogt et al.’s procedure while varying the task in a between-participants design. We replicated Vogt et al.’s results in the location task and found a corresponding – albeit significantly smaller – effect in the discrimination task. Stimuli associated with current goals were thus prioritized with respect to spatial attention. However, the reduced effect size in the discrimination task suggests that in the original experiments, response-related processes were at play in addition to attentional processes.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This review will map existing literature to identify and describe the extent to which Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles of engagement, representation, and expression are applied to the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Introduction: UDL is an education framework that aims to create inclusive learning environments for students with diverse needs. Approximately 25% of Australian students are likely to live with language, literacy, and/or learning differences that place them at elevated risk of mental health problems. Many school-based mental health programs exist with the shared aim of promoting positive outcomes for students.  Early prevention and mental health promotion efforts that are inclusive to students with language and/or learning differences are critically important. However, there has been no previous exploration of the extent to which UDL has been applied to school-based mental health programs. This review aims to identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in existing Australian school-based mental health programs. Eligibility criteria: This review will consider studies that report the development and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs within an Australian education context. This review will exclude non-English studies, reviews, books, and theoretical or opinion pieces. Methods: This review will be informed by the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews and will be conducted between October and December 2024. Five databases will be searched (PsycInfo, Medline, Informit, Scopus, and ERIC) and two reviewers will independently screen all identified studies against inclusion criteria by title, abstract, and full text review. Conflicts will be resolved by consensus. Results: Two independent reviewers will extract relevant data from the selected studies and results will be presented numerically and narratively.  The review will identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in descriptions of the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Synthesis and interpretation of included studies will be framed within the three principles of UDL. The review will outline key findings of the included papers, gaps in the literature, and salient directions for future research. Conclusion: The outcomes of this review will be disseminated via publication and plain language summaries. The outcomes may also inform conference presentations relevant to inclusive education, mental health, and child language and learning differences.",

          "authors": "Kentaro Katahira",
          "abstract": "Cognitive and computational modeling has been used as a method to understand the processes underlying behavior in humans and other animals. A common approach in this field involves the use of theoretically constructed cognitive models, such as reinforcement learning models. However, human and animal decision-making often deviates from the predictions of these theoretical models. To capture characteristics that these cognitive models fail to account for, artificial neural network (ANN) models have recently gained attention. One of the roles of ANNs in cognitive and computational modeling is to provide a (upper) benchmark of predictive accuracy for cognitive models, helping ensure that no important factors are missing in theoretical models. For modeling choice behavior involving reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a type of ANN, have been frequently used. RNNs are able to capture how the choice probability changes depending on past experience. In this work, we demonstrate that RNNs can improve future choice predictions by capturing individual differences on the basis of past behavior, even when a common single model is fit to the entire population. We term this property of the RNN the individual difference tracking (IDT) property. While the IDT property might be useful for prediction, it may introduce excessive flexibility when providing an upper bound on the predictive accuracy. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate the properties of RNNs and discuss their implications and issues for further consideration.",

          "abstract": "Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent phenomenon, marked by delusions and hallucinations, along with other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation, depression, anxiety, and apathy. These neuropsychiatric symptoms, also known as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), affect up to 97% of Alzheimer's patients. The presence of psychosis in AD significantly impacts patients' daily lives and places a considerable burden on caregivers. The development of AD-related psychosis (ADP) is influenced by a range of factors, including genetic predispositions and life-acquired factors. AD affects cognitive function and various brain regions, resulting in widespread brain atrophy. In addition to its neurological impact, AD can induce pathological physiological changes that serve as biomarkers for ADP. Research efforts have focused on developing pharmacological treatments for psychosis in AD, aiming to minimize side effects. Brexpiprazole has emerged as a promising medication for ADP, alongside other antipsychotics. Treatment approaches for ADP extend beyond pharmacology, incorporating methods such as sensory stimulation and digital therapeutics. This review will explore the characteristics of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, the pathological underpinnings of ADP, and the current therapeutic landscape, highlighting emerging opportunities for managing this challenging condition.",

          "abstract": "Affect-based impulsivity describes the tendency to behave impulsively while experiencing negative or positive affective states. In the context of psychiatric disorders, the consequences of affect-based impulsivity can be dire, including suicidal behavior and harmful substance use. Here, we articulate a decision neuroscience account of affect-based impulsivity. Recasting this phenomenon in terms of Pavlovian and goal-directed decision systems, we consider how negative affect influences whether to act, what actions to consider, which action to select, and how vigorously to engage in a selected action. Further, we describe the neural and neuroendocrine targets of these computations. Specifically, we propose that modulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during negative affective states enhances the pursuit of rewards by reducing goal-directed computations and increasing appetitive Pavlovian computations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Frequent out-of-home food sector (OOHFS) use is associated with poor dietary intake and obesity. There are limited real-world studies on pricing interventions to encourage healthy eating in the OOHFS. We performed a pilot study to collect preliminary trial data on the potential impact of a price reduction intervention on healthier menu items on purchasing and consumption of kilocalories (kcal) in a full-serviced restaurant among people from both lower and higher socioeconomic position (SEP).  \n\nMethods: The main trial design was a pre vs. post price reduction comparison (within-subjects), where participants (adults aged ≥18 years) received a control menu with standard pricing at visit 1 and a menu with price manipulations (30% reduction for healthy items) at visit 2. A sub-study was conducted with a comparison sample to estimate potential pre-post changes to outcome variables in the absence of a pricing intervention. Linear mixed models assessed pre-post changes in kcal purchased and kcal consumed.\n\nResults: In total, 114 participants were recruited; 92 were randomised to the main study and 22 to the comparison sub-study. Of those participating in the main study, 78 completed and 14 were lost to follow-up. There were no participants lost to follow-up in the comparison study. Of the completers, 46 participants were considered higher SEP (i.e. bachelor’s degree or higher) and 32 participants were lower SEP (i.e. some college or associate degree or lower). Kcal purchased and consumed decreased from visit 1 to visit 2; however, this reduction was only statistically significant for total kcal consumed (regression coefficient: -98.0 (95% CI -181.9, -14.2), p=0.02). There were no notable intervention effect differences between higher and lower SEP participants. In the comparison study, kcal purchased and consumed was also lower at visit 2 compared to visit 1, although this should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.\n\nConclusion: A price reduction intervention on lower energy menu items is potentially effective in encouraging healthier eating in a restaurant setting. Larger studies with inclusion of a control group (e.g., randomised controlled trials) are now needed to confirm intervention effects and whether they are equitable across different socioeconomic groups.",

          "abstract": "Gratitude interventions are known to increase psychological wellbeing. However, it has also been suggested that not everyone experiences equivalent benefits of engaging with gratitude activities, and there have been calls to better understand the moderators of such effects. In Study 1, we explored the effects of writing a gratitude letter, relative to a neutral letter, on changes in positive and negative affect, and observed that the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect was exacerbated in participants with elevated life satisfaction. Study 2 sought to replicate the findings of Study 1 whilst minimising demand characteristics, but failed to observe the moderating effect of life satisfaction. In Study 3, we sought to investigate whether these mixed findings could be explained by demand characteristics. We observed that priming participants with information about the benefits of expressing gratitude ameliorated the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but life satisfaction did not moderate this priming effect. On the basis of the findings from these three studies, we conclude that life satisfaction does not moderate the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but further work should be undertaken to better understand the conditions under which gratitude writing is most effective. Further, we suggest that demand characteristics are an important consideration for both researchers and interventionists delivering gratitude interventions.",

With community (N = 578) and offender (N = 726) samples from China, we examined 60-, 30-, and 15-item versions of the Chinese FFNI in terms of internal structure, external associates, consistency across samples and versions. Our findings demonstrate acceptable internal consistencies and structural validity of each version of the Chinese FFNI, albeit with minor deviations in the Neurotic Narcissism factor. The FFNI demonstrated good cross-sample and cross-version consistency.

          "abstract": "Bayesian evidence synthesis refers to the process of combining statistical evidence between hypotheses from multiple studies. The evidence is quantified by the Bayes factor. Depending on the underlying model assumptions and research question, different methods can be used for a Bayesian evidence synthesis. The current paper gives an overview of possible models that can be used for this purpose which includes a common effect model, a random effects model, two hybrid effects models, and a fixed effects model. Furthermore, the respective synthesized Bayes factors under each modeling framework are given depending on the implied hypotheses that are tested. We also provide recommendations for prior distributions in Bayesian evidence synthesis for the popular effect size measures, including standardized mean difference, log odds ratio, and Pearson correlation. Additionally, the concept of safe evidence synthesis is described which is particularly\nuseful in cumulative/sequential meta-analyses. With this overview and the recommendations for prior specification, researchers can make the best choice to synthesize the evidence from multiple studies. Empirical applications on statistical learning of people with a language impairment\nand the incidence of seroma when exercising after breast cancer are used for illustrative purposes.

While there have been previous attempts to instantiate such theories by building computational models, we currently do not have one model that captures the human mind in its entirety. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behavior in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by finetuning a state-of-the-art language model on a novel, large-scale data set called Psych-101. Psych-101 reaches an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from over 60,000 participants performing over 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behavior of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but also generalizes to new cover stories, structural task modifications, and entirely new domains. Furthermore, we find that the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after finetuning. Taken together, Centaur is the first real candidate for a unified model of human cognition. We anticipate that it will have a disruptive impact on the cognitive sciences, challenging the existing paradigm for developing computational models.",

Here, we develop FPVS as a probe of low-level visual function, with a view to its future use as a sensitive diagnostic marker of visuospatial cognitive impairment. Thirty participants (21 (±5) years, 7 males) completed five FPVS conditions that implicitly measured their ability to discriminate an oddball line orientation (1°,5°,10°,30°,80°), from a standard vertical line, as well as an equiprobable control condition. Twenty-four participants (24 (±5) years, 5 males) completed a retest session around one month later. Following 100s of recording, activity at the oddball presentation frequency, a neural signal of discrimination between standard and oddball stimuli, was observed in response to lines of 5° and above. The magnitude of this oddball response increased as oddball lines deviated more from vertical. Demonstrating consistency in individual participants, oddball responses were present in 30/30 participants in response to a deviation of 30° and 29/30 in response to a deviation of 80°. At larger deviations, oddball responses were highly reliable between sessions, measured using intraclass correlations. Overall, this study showed that FPVS can consistently and reliably measure line orientation discrimination in individual participants. The consistency and reliability of oddball responses in the cognitively healthy, could provide a strong baseline that clinical group’s performance could be compared to, guiding neurocognitive assessment.",

Partial correlation analysis,  Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis, and SEM were employed to explore the relationships between ADHD, reappraisal, suppression, and mental health.\nResults: Adults with higher ADHD tendencies reported greater difficulty using reappraisal strategies and experienced worse mental health outcomes, particularly due to an over-reliance on suppression. In contrast, those with lower ADHD tendencies balanced the use of both reappraisal and suppression strategies and exhibited more adaptive emotion regulation. \nConclusion: ADHD tendencies significantly affect the choice of emotion regulation strategies, which in turn impacts mental health. Specifically, reappraisal was found to moderate the negative effects of ADHD on mental health, highlighting the importance of promoting adaptive emotion regulation strategies in clinical interventions for adults with ADHD.",

          "abstract": "There is growing evidence that the visual system processes objects perceived as closer more quickly and accurately than those farther away, a phenomenon known as the \"close advantage effect\" (CAE). The mechanisms underlying this effect, however, remain unknown. In this study, we assessed whether perceived depth modulates allocation of attention. Using a Posner cueing task in Experiment 1a, we found greater accuracy for close surface targets (demonstrating the CAE). Critically, we also found a smaller Posner effect in the close surface, suggesting that attentional resources are better utilized in this space. Experiment 1b confirmed that these results were not due to differences in background surface sizes. In Experiment 2a, using the Egly-Driver task, we replicated and expended the results of Experiment 1a. Participants were more accurate when shifting attention from far to close surfaces and when shifting attention within the close surface, compared to when shifting attention within the far surface. These results suggest that perceived proximity makes attentional shifts more efficient. This effect persisted in Experiment 2b, even after controlling for the perceived size of the targets. Overall, our findings show that perceived depth modulates attention, with close space receiving preferential processing likely due to its relevance for immediate interaction.",

          "authors": "Karolina Maria Lempert",
          "abstract": "A widely observed phenomenon in intertemporal choice is temporal discounting; people prefer to have rewards sooner rather than later, even if the delayed rewards are larger. Despite the universality of temporal discounting, people vary substantially in their temporal discounting rates, with some people being much more willing to wait for delayed rewards than others. What are the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying these individual differences? This chapter presents the field’s current understanding of the roles of major cognitive capacities (specifically: inhibitory control, episodic memory, and semantic memory) in determining temporal discounting rates. The chapter also argues that, whereas there are circumstances under which inhibitory control and episodic memory retrieval are deployed during intertemporal choice, semantic memory retrieval may actually be the key cognitive contributor to variability in intertemporal preferences. Inhibitory control is likely to be engaged during intertemporal choice when choices are especially difficult or high-stakes. Episodic retrieval is likely to be involved when people are cued to imagine the future before they make these choices. Neither of these processes appear to be necessary for future-oriented choice, however, and there is growing evidence that the structural integrity of the anterior temporal lobe – a hub for semantic memory – is associated with temporal discounting. More research is needed to test this theory and to understand the precise mechanism by which semantic memory supports future-oriented choice. Further research is also needed to test the generalizability of these conclusions to other kinds of intertemporal choices, such as those involving primary rewards, punishments, or temporal uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Background\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) holds promise as a treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Patients with OCD show impairment in specific aspects of executive function of relevance to wellbeing, manifesting as motor impulsivity and cognitive inflexibility. In a recently published feasibility study, tDCS produced a positive clinical effect on OCD symptoms (Fineberg et al 2023). We report a secondary analysis of neurocognitive data collected in this study. Our aim is to investigate whether tDCS additionally changes markers of motor impulsivity and cognitive flexibility. \n\nMethods\nIn this randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over, multicentre feasibility study, adults with DSM-5 OCD received three courses of clinic-based tDCS, targeting the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (L-OFC) and sham, randomly allocated and delivered in counterbalanced order. Each tDCS arm comprised four 20-minute 2 mA stimulations, delivered over two consecutive days, separated by a ‘washout’ period of at least four weeks. Cognitive assessments were conducted before and 2 hours after the first stimulation in each arm, using the Stop Signal (SST) test for motor-impulsivity and the Intra/Extra-Dimensional-Set-Shifting-Task (IED) for cognitive inflexibility. We used a paired samples T-test to compare the baseline and post-stimulation scores for each treatment arm.  \n\nResults\nNineteen adults were recruited. tDCS of the lateral OFC and SMA significantly improved cognitive inflexibility (total errors at the extra-dimensional shift stage of the  ID/ED) (p=0.038 and p=0.030, respectively), while sham treatment did not (paired sample t-test, pre-post effect size, baseline vs. 2-hours after stimulation). No significant effect of tDCS was found for motor impulsivity (stop-signal reaction time, SSRT) in any of the three arms. \n\nConclusions\nNotwithstanding the small sample size, stimulating the OFC and SMA with a single administration of tDCS acutely reduced cognitive inflexibility but not motor impulsivity in patients with OCD. tDCS may act to improve OCD via cognitive mechanisms. A definitive randomised, controlled trial of tDCS targeting both the OFC and SMA, including cognitive markers, is indicated.\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: obsessive compulsive disorder; Cognitive inflexibility; Motor impulsivity; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; tDCS",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis: Individuals with schizophrenia show robust deficits in social cognition, which are associated with symptom severity and functional outcomes. These deficits are also present, but weaker, in those with related diagnoses (e.g., bipolar disorder) and in patients’ biological relatives. Nonetheless, previous work in this area is limited by small sample sizes and use of single social-cognition tasks. We address these issues using a large sample spanning individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (105) and bipolar disorder with psychotic features (37), their first-degree relatives (101), and healthy controls (53). \n\nStudy Design: Participants completed tests of social cognition—including facial/auditory emotion recognition and mentalizing. Social cognition was modeled as a latent variable and its associations with diagnostic group were examined. \n\nStudy Results: There was a significant effect of group on social cognition; individuals with bipolar disorder and relatives performed worse than controls but better than those with schizophrenia. There was also a group-by-task interaction, such that deficits were stronger for mentalizing than emotion recognition. \n\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that social cognitive deficits represent a feature of schizophrenia that maps onto related genetic liability. These deficits may be particularly prominent for higher-level social cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "This article reports the results of a 33-wave longitudinal study of relations between job insecurity and physical and mental health based on monthly data collected between April 2020 and December 2022 among n = 1,666 employees in Germany. We integrate dynamic theorizing from the transactional stress model and domain-specific theorizing based on stressor creation and perception to frame hypotheses regarding dynamic and reciprocal relations between job insecurity and health over time. We find that lower physical health predicted subsequent increases in job insecurity and higher physical health predicted subsequent decreases in job insecurity. However, job insecurity did not have a significant influence on physical health. Furthermore, higher job insecurity predicted subsequent decreases in mental health, and higher mental health predicted subsequent decreases in job insecurity. This pattern of findings suggests a dynamic and reciprocal within-person process wherein positive deviations from one’s average trajectory of job insecurity are associated with subsequently lower levels of mental health and vice versa. We additionally find evidence for linear trends in these within-person processes themselves, suggesting that the strength of the within-person influence of job insecurity on mental health becomes more strongly negative over time (i.e., a negative amplifying cycle). This research provides practical insights into job insecurity as a health threat and shows how concerns about job loss following deteriorations in physical and mental health serve to further threaten wellbeing.",

Unfortunately, the systematic conceptualization and examination of state consistencies has stagnated after the person-situation debate. Moreover, past research has predominantly focused on consistencies of individual differences, neglecting consistencies that play out in the life of the individual. While the study of between-person consistencies provides evidence for the existence of personality characteristics, we argue that person- specific within-person consistencies are necessary to draw inferences about a person’s individuality. To reignite the examination of individual-level state consistencies, we present a framework of basic person-specific consistency types. For the proposed consistencies, we provide examples, discuss their interpretation and relevance, and relate them to prominent theoretical accounts within personality psychology. We conclude with advocating for a stronger focus on person-specific approaches and individuality.",

The debate surrounding nomothetics and idiographics has been brought up repeatedly, but it has never been completely resolved. We therefore aim to provide conceptual clarity on how the terms “idiographic” and “nomothetic” are used and how conflating these with other concepts negatively impacts research. By differentiating distinct inferential goals and research approaches, we disentangle these confounding concepts. We demonstrate that the nomothetic-idiographic distinction alone is insufficient for categorizing research approaches in personality science. Specifically, we present a categorization of research approaches based on (a) the focal entity (person(s) vs. population(s)) and (b) the type of generalization (no vs. entity-specific vs. cross-entity) resulting in a 2×3 matrix of research approaches. Finally, we propose a framework of 25 polytomous criteria to extend upon these three distinctions. This framework can be mapped onto the generic empirical research process and may help researchers to make decisions in the research process more explicit.",

We trained both humans and transformer networks on a rule learning task where they had to respond to a query at the end of a sequence of symbols (the context). At test, we measured both “in-context” learning (the ability to generalise the rule to novel queries) and “in-weights” learning (the recall of past experiences from memory). Manipulating the diversity and redundancy of examples in the training distribution, we found that humans and transformers respond in very similar ways. In both types of learner, redundancy and diversity trade off in driving in-weights and in-context learning respectively, whereas a composite distribution that includes a balanced mix of redundancy and diversity allows the two strategies to be used in tandem. However, we also found that while humans benefit from dynamic training schedules that emphasise diverse examples early on, transformers do not. So, whilst the same data distributional properties promote learning in humans and transformer networks, only people benefit from curricula.",

This study investigated the Collegium Academicum (CA) student home as a setting where shared living is practised with a strong focus on sufficiency. We examined whether such sufficiency settings can enhance the personal meaning of sufficiency compared to ordinary shared living environments. Data were collected from 159 residents of the CA and a standard student home. Our findings indicated that residents of the CA experienced greater meaningfulness of shared living, improved sufficiency attitudes and a higher intention to choose shared living in the future. Experiences of shared living had a lagged positive impact on the perceived meaningfulness of shared living. These results imply that sufficiency settings can strengthen sufficiency-oriented living.

          "abstract": "Understanding variability is a key focus in many areas of psychological research, with growing interest in modeling individual and group variability. While multilevel models such as heterogeneous variance models and Mixed-Effect Location Scale (MELS) models have been used to capture these dynamics, they typically rely on linear assumptions and temporal change of the variability is restricted to one level. Recent calls for nonlinear approaches in psychology highlight the need for more flexible models that can better account for complex, dynamic processes. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) within the framework of heterogeneous variance models to address these limitations. By incorporating GPs, we allow for the modeling of nonlinear variability across multiple levels, including temporal dynamics at both the individual and group levels. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in two empirical applications. Our findings show that using GPs provide an improved model fit compared to traditional linear methods and highlight the utility of GPs in variance modeling, offering new possibilities for studying dynamic and emergent processes in psychological and social science research.",

However, previous efforts to measure inhibition in aging have been hindered by the task impurity problem, where multiple cognitive processes contribute to performance and make it difficult to isolate specific mechanisms. Here, we introduce the Global-Local AtteNtional Control Evaluation (GLANCE), a novel framework designed to 1) assess both global attentional control (between-trial inhibition) and local attentional control (within-trial inhibition) in a unified task; and 2) address the task impurity problem via an accompanying computational model. Behavioral results from younger, middle-aged, and older adults (N=100; age range: 18-73) reveal significant age-related differences in global attentional control, with older adults showing less efficient adaptation to rule changes compared to younger adults. Parameter estimates from fitting the computational model to subject-level data further identified reduced error-related memory suppression as the specific mechanism that accounts for age-related differences in behavior.",

In this context, I offer a three-part vision for cultivating a robust and cumulative psychological science. First, we must know how to produce robust rather than fragile findings. Key ingredients include sufficient sample sizes, valid measurement, and honesty/transparency. Second, we must know how to identify robust (and non-robust) findings. To this end, I reframe robustness checks broadly into four types: across analytic decisions, across measures, across samples, and across investigative teams. Third, we must be motivated to produce and care about robust science. This aim requires marshalling sociocultural forces to support, reward, and celebrate the production of robust findings, just as we once rewarded flashy but fragile findings. Critically, these sociocultural reinforcements must be tied as closely as possible to rigor and robustness themselves – rather than cosmetic indicators of rigor and robustness, as we have done in the past (Klonsky, 2024).",

AGI means that the machine has the ability to approach or surpass human intelligence, and its core elements include super-large-scale neural network system, sensory system and action system, as well as its own life support system to maintain the sustainable interaction of agents in the environment and the motivation system to actively optimize its own viability. The formation process of human intelligence is produced through the interactive evolution process of structure and environment, and this physical structure is abstracted into specific intelligent programs and knowledge data. The method of realizing AGI general artificial intelligence can refer to the physical structure of human intelligence, make an agent system with neural network system, sensory system and action system, and establish an agent support system to ensure the agent's sustainable interaction with the environment. At the same time, it is necessary to manually set or naturally generate an agent's motivation system with the primary goal of improving its own viability.

          "abstract": "There is growing but inconclusive evidence on the effects of motor imagery interventions in neurorehabilitation. Uncertainty regarding potential impairments in imagery ability in adults with neurological conditions may contribute to this controversy. We summarized the evidence on impairments across different aspects of motor imagery ability following Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Six databases were searched up to February 2024. Studies comparing adults with these conditions to healthy individuals were included. Two reviewers independently conducted the study selection and Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment. Motor imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation, assessed through questionnaires, mental chronometry, and mental rotation tasks respectively, were the outcomes extracted. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were applied. Fifty-two studies with low or moderate RoB were included (Stroke: n=26; TBI: n=1; PD: n=14; MS: n=11). Meta-analyses revealed small-to-moderate effects of Stroke on generation of visual and kinesthetic motor imagery, respectively. A moderate effect of PD was found only for visual motor imagery. For imagery maintenance, qualitative syntheses indicated contradictory evidence for Stroke (although it was stronger towards impairment), with PD and MS showing impairment with moderate to strong evidence. Meta-analyses showed a large and moderate effect on the accuracy measures of imagery manipulation in Stroke and PD respectively, while qualitative analysis also supported this effect in MS. For TBI, a limited number of studies impeded performing a formal synthesis of the evidence. We conclude that impairments in motor imagery ability domains are likely present in people with neurological conditions.",

More recently, vantage sensitivity and differential susceptibility were proposed as alternative models, with all three being encompassed in the environmental sensitivity framework. While there are numerous systematic reviews on these models in children, there is limited research addressing their applicability in adulthood. This study aimed to map studies conducted within the environmental sensitivity framework in the prediction of adult mental health. Systematic scoping review reporting followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A forward reference search was employed using eight foundational environmental sensitivity articles through three databases. Thirty-four studies met inclusion criteria, and a narrative synthesis was employed to analyze the findings. The review found variability and inconsistency in testing the models of environmental sensitivity, with most studies not utilizing recommended best practices. All three models of environmental sensitivity were supported, including 53 significant and 80 non-significant interactions. Overall, childhood environments tended to show stronger support for differential susceptibility while adulthood environments showed more balanced evidence for both the differential susceptibility and diathesis-stress models. Most studies focused on genotype and internalizing behaviors, resulting in a limited understanding of person-environment interactions for other individual and mental health factors. Further research is needed to test environmental sensitivity across diverse populations and in a wider range of contexts to guide developmental theory and interventions.",

This theory resolves the first part, including the philosophical zombie question, as it shows why feeling is an inherent part of consciousness, and the tremendous advantage that a feeling organism possesses, summarised in the word “omnilyo”. While not directly addressing the technological aspects, the theory does define requirements and constraints on the workings of conscious matter, which, while clearly beyond current scientific capabilities, does signpost the invention of artificial consciousness, which, needless to say, would be mankind’s greatest discovery.",

          "abstract": "Body movements like walking can synchronize with auditory and visual inputs presented within a periodic frequency range, peaking around 2 Hz. The EEG frequency-tagging approach allows to capture the synchronization of beat perception with neural brain oscillations at the beat frequency. This study used EEG frequency-tagging to explore brain dynamics during rhythmic sensorimotor synchronization with auditory (footstep sound) and visual (walking point-light figure) inputs. Sensory inputs were delivered at different rates (1 Hz, 2 Hz, 3.6 Hz) in rhythmic or random sequences while recording EEG activity. The experiment included three conditions: (i) Auditory, (ii) Visual, and (iii) Audiovisual, including data from 22 participants. Results showed a main effect of rhythmic sequences compared to random sequences across all frequencies in all three auditory, visual, or audiovisual conditions. Specifically, at 2 Hz, rhythmic sequences enhanced synchronization in the sensorimotor cortex for auditory and audiovisual conditions. This effect was absent in the visual condition alone. Notably, 2 Hz rhythmic sequences in the audiovisual condition led to synchronization with temporal, sensorimotor, and occipital regions. The study suggests that attention to rhythmic auditory input at 2 Hz can mediate neural synchronization between auditory and sensorimotor brain areas.",

          "authors": "Tom Fryer; Steven Jones; Bowen Zhang",
          "abstract": "There is considerable debate about the fairness of university admissions processes, particularly in national contexts with substantial prestige differences between providers. However, there does tend to be agreement that admissions processes should be transparent. This study investigates the extent to which undergraduate university admissions in the UK are transparent, particularly with regard to their use of an admissions essay called the UCAS personal statement. Our methods are twofold: 1) we assess whether university staff use the personal statement in ways that align with information on student-facing websites, and 2) we perform an in-depth transparency analysis of fifteen university course websites to assess the extent to which universities helped applicants to understand what a high-quality personal statement looked like. We find considerable evidence of issues related to transparency, with some examples of good practice. The paper concludes with several recommendations for providers to enhance their transparency. The 2025-26 reforms to the UCAS personal statement offer an opportunity for all universities to update their public-facing websites and guidance, so this paper represents a timely intervention.",

          "abstract": "Ideations and intentions are important precursors of actual behaviour but are still understudied in the literature on the transition to adulthood. Our article provides a descriptive overview of ideations and intentions about the timing of four key events in the transition to adulthood (exit from the parental home, cohabitation, marriage, and parenthood) using cross-nationally representative data for 33 Eu-ropean countries from the Generations and Gender Survey and European Social Survey. Results show that ideations and intentions about the transition to adulthood –just like actual behaviours– are gendered and display remarkable country differences. The heterogeneity in the timing of intentions hints that key events, such as cohabitation, are not uniformly pervasive in young adults' lives. Also, a gap exists between ideal and actual ages at which events are experienced, particularly among men who are less likely to experience events at their “ideal” time compared to women. The extent to which intentions and ideations regarding the transition to adulthood translate into actual behaviours varies across countries and gender.",

          "abstract": "Statistical discrimination theory suggests that discrimination arises when gatekeepers lack individual-level information and therefore draw on their knowledge on the group-level. According to this perspective, the policy solution is straight forward: provide gatekeepers with accurate individual-level information and discrimination will cease. Grades are important signals to students about academic ability and influence future educational choices. Previous studies find that teachers exhibit negative grading bias against boys, racialized minority students, and low-SES students so these groups receive signals about lower academic potential than merited. In this study, we test whether grading bias stems from statistical discrimination. First, we leverage a natural experiment in which teachers were given information from standardized tests and see whether this change mitigates grading bias. We further test this mechanism by analyzing the role of the performance of a given social background group at the same school the year prior. We find substantial grading bias but conclude that statistical discrimination is not likely to play a major role.",

          "abstract": "Whenever a person intends to cross a border, citizenship de facto determines—more than any other \nstatus—whether that person can enter the territory of another state. Yet, despite its ubiquity and \ncentrality within global mobility infrastructures, the exact mechanisms through which citizenship \nshapes human movement on the planetary scale remain surprisingly ambiguous. This article examines the multifaceted ways in which citizenship operates as an organizing principle within the complex of rules and norms governing transnational human mobility, including how the increasing acceptance of dual nationality status and the emergence of citizenship-by-investment schemes reverberate throughout the legal infrastructure and create new pathways for elite mobility. Using citizenship as an exploratory lens, the article thereby seeks to theoretically complement and nuance existing scholarship in migration and mobility studies, arguing that physical space remains the dominant structure for human mobility. As we show, legal infrastructures reconfigure access to human mobility in ways that simultaneously fragment and compress physical space as it pertains to transnational movement.",

Consequently, we lack knowledge about even the most basic topological features of the societal-scale instant messenger network. To overcome this knowledge gap, we employ the innovative approach of data donation by respondents of a high-quality probability-based panel in the Netherlands (the LISS panel) to collect user data while preserving their privacy. Focusing on WhatsApp as the most popular MIMS, this study collects the first measurement of MIMS usage on a national probability sample. We find that the degree distribution of contacts is best approximated by a log-normal distribution, while the distribution of group membership is best approximated by the exponential distribution. At the individual level, we find that predictors of degree derived from the literature on extended networks mostly replicate.",

          "abstract": "Setting air conditioners to unnecessarily low temperatures in summer generates a substantial amount of carbon emissions. This study aims to change air conditioner use by tourists – consumers whose sense of moral obligation is reduced and, with it, their level of pro-environmental behaviour. We test several theory-informed interventions aimed at encouraging hotel guests to set their air conditioners to comfortable but less energy-intensive temperatures. We compare cognitive-based interventions, such as activating social norms, with affective-based interventions that anthropomorphise air conditioners to evoke empathy. Intervention effectiveness is tested across three studies: a traditional survey experiment (to measure the manipulation of target constructs), two ecologically enhanced survey experiments (measuring behaviour intentions), and a field experiment measuring air conditioner use indirectly using wireless temperature sensors. Results indicate that interventions leveraging social norms and anthropomorphism, specifically those evoking negative emotions like exhaustion and anger, significantly influence air conditioner use. Enhanced survey formats cannot replace field experiments to assess an intervention’s impact on behaviour. Our findings suggest that simple, cost-effective interventions can promote more sustainable air conditioning practices in hotels, ultimately contributing to reduced carbon emissions and operational costs.",

This study (1) investigates how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors---a fundamental social norm---can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduces a behavioral approach to evaluate the performance of LLM agents in complex decision-making scenarios. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. Our findings reveal substantial variations and inconsistencies among LLMs and notable differences compared to human behaviors. Merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. Despite being trained on extensive human-generated data, these AI agents cannot accurately predict human decisions. LLM agents are not able to capture the internal processes of human decision-making, and their alignment with human behavior is highly variable and dependent on specific model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern.",

          "authors": "Danyelle; Anna Kristina Zinn; Qingqing Chen; Reza Serati; Marius Portmann; Sara Dolnicar",
          "abstract": "In the hotel industry, the management of room temperatures plays a crucial role in both environmental impact and energy costs. Small changes, such as reducing heating by 1°C, can save around 6% on electricity. Despite the significant impact, there is a notable scarcity of interventions aimed at promoting sustainable air conditioner use among guests. Most pro-environmental behaviour-change interventions in tourism focus on environmental messaging and negative appeals, with mixed effectiveness. Positive emotions like amusement (humour) and self-transcendent emotions (compassion) have been largely overlooked but have shown potential in other research contexts. The current series of studies assesses the comparative effectiveness of messages designed to trigger humour, compassion, and environmental beliefs on sustainable air conditioner use. In Study 1, we develop and evaluate four alternative messages for each theoretical construct. We use the most effective message for each construct (e.g., the most amusing humour message) in Studies 2 and 3. Study 2 serves as a manipulation check to ensure the messages effectively triggered the intended theoretical constructs. It also assesses behavioural intentions and emotional reactions. Study 3 tests the impact of the interventions on real behaviour in a quasi-experimental field study. Study 2 shows that each message effectively strengthens its respective theoretical construct (e.g., the environmental message strengthened environmental beliefs). The field study demonstrates that all three messages, along with a basic behaviour instruction message, increase sustainable air conditioner use. The humour message had an advantage over the others, being positively perceived by participants and not causing negative reactions. Therefore, framing sustainable air conditioner use instructions humorously appears to be a promising strategy in the hotel context. While our humour message is tailored to the Australian winter context, future research should explore the applicability of humour-based interventions in diverse cultural and climate settings to enhance sustainable air conditioner practices globally.",

In February 2023, we conducted an online survey of 719 public sector employees, which included both a direct question about turnover intention and a list experiment. We find that 15.07% of respondents reported turnover intention in the list experiment, compared to 7.15% in the direct question, suggesting underreporting. We also find that the difference between these two estimates is greater for female respondents than for male respondents, implying a higher desirability bias among female civil servants.",

          "abstract": "The province of Almería in Spain is home to one of the largest concentrations of greenhouse agriculture in the world, covering over 32,000 hectares and producing more than 3.8 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables largely for export across Europe. Migrant agricultural workers here face precarious working and living conditions, which profoundly shape their relationships with food, ingredients, and cooking. The food system in this region is deeply entwined with global food consumption practices, extractivist supply chains, and irregular migration patterns. While much research has focused on the economic and environmental impacts of industrial agriculture, less attention has been given to how migrant workers’ interactions with food reflect their social and cultural identities amidst these challenges. This study protocol outlines our aims and methods to explore these relationships, examining how migration and labour conditions influence food-related practices, and how these practices serve as means of cultural preservation, adaptation, and survival. Using a collaborative photo-elicitation methodology, we will work with migrant workers in Almería to document their relationship with food through photography and interviews. Participants will be asked to capture images of their daily food practices over a 7-10 day period. These photographs will later serve as both prompts for semi-structured interviews and a source of visual data, facilitating deeper reflections on personal, cultural, and socio-economic contexts surrounding food. Data will be analysed through qualitative content analysis, incorporating co-creation and member checking to ensure accuracy and participant agency. The planned research aims to provide critical insights into the social, cultural, and environmental impacts of industrial agriculture on migrant workers, contributing to a broader understanding of food justice, labour exploitation, and the sustainability of global food systems.",

          "abstract": "How does stakeholder participation in natural resource management change when conservation rules are grounded in near real-time data? Recognition of our rapidly changing climate and recent technological advances have facilitated the increased feasibility of the “dynamic management” of natural resources, which promises to align the spatiotemporal scales of management with ecological variability and resource use. Drawing on Kelty’s (2020) concept of “contributory autonomy,” this article offers a critical comparison of how participation is conceived of in the more established context of static conservation areas and planning versus the emergent field of dynamic management. A systematic review of the dynamic ocean management literature reveals a varied, but shallow engagement with the topic of stakeholder participation in that context. Whereas static management regimes are governed by intuitive and readily contestable maps, dynamic management is governed by models and data flows. Overall, the decision-making stakeholder of participatory mapping processes under static management is displaced by the stakeholder conceived as an “end user” of a dynamic management product. Yet, these shifts also open up potential points of contestation, which may pattern the future theory and practice of participation in dynamic management: counterdata, countermodeling, and data chokepoints. Beyond the empirical focus on oceans, this article contributes to broader conversations about the political stakes of environmental data, and algorithmic and artificial intelligence-driven natural resource conservation by considering how possibilities for participation are foreclosed, enabled, and reconstituted by new spatiotemporal and technological conditions.",

          "authors": "Liberty Chee",
          "abstract": "After nearly half a century, domestic workers were again tabled on the agenda of the International Labour Conference in 2008. Three short years later, Conference delegates voted to establish the International Labour Organization’s Convention on Domestic Work (C189).  This paper builds on the insight that the campaign to push for C189 was taken up by a feminist “velvet triangle”.  These networks are usually comprised of women in social movements, femocrats and academics. The informality of these alliances is due, in part, to the gendered marginality of an issue area, allowing for improvisation and agile coalitions.  The paper traces the origins of this triangle to bottom-up calls to develop measurement methodologies to make women’s labour “visible” in the UN Conferences on Women, and later in discussions about the informal economy.  It then examines the relations among femocrats in the ILO, academics, and the global trade unions in one important element of the campaign – mobilising statistics on domestic workers worldwide.  The paper demonstrates how the production and mobilisation of statistical estimates were crucial in making the sector more tractable.  It attends to the under-explored effects of the “power of cognitive resources” in the literature.  Finally, the article shows that the explicitly political project of the women’s movements yielded not only a normative labour instrument, but advances in different fields of study. This case shows that the production of scientific knowledge, while still an overwhelmingly elite endeavour, need not always cater to elite demands.",

We investigate how GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art model, uses demographics and other contextual information when flagging potential hate speech. The results show that the model attends to context similarly to human annotators. In particular, the race of the author is taken into account when deciding whether the use of racist language or reclaimed slurs violates a content policy. Prompting can enhance contextual awareness, although some demographic bias persists. Models relying solely on visual or written identity signals show significantly less contextual variation, highlighting the value of multimodal approaches to automated content moderation.

          "abstract": "Current approaches to engaging First Nations peoples in urban policy and planning are placing an unreasonable and unsustainable burden, especially on Traditional Custodians, new AHURI research finds. A change of relationship with Traditional Custodians and a rethinking of current engagement approaches could create a more responsible process.\n\nThe research, ‘Voicing First Nations Country, culture and community in urban policy’, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from University of Sydney, RMIT University and University of NSW, examines the relationship of First Nations peoples in Australia to urban policy, and is designed to centre First Nations sovereignty, authority, knowledge, governance and agency as the starting point toward a more responsible relationship.\n\nUrban places, from large metropolitan areas to small towns in regional areas, are sites of intensive dispossession at the same time as being dense networks of community and ongoing cultural practice and connection. Nevertheless, urbanisation and the density of population settlement, private property and the miasma of legislation, policy and regulation imposed on Country hasn’t destroyed First Nations Traditional Custodians connection to ancestral lands or their cultural obligations and rights to lands and waters.\n\nGovernments are asking local planners and developers to consult with First Nation Traditional Custodians with some level of engagement. This has the effect of intensifying pressure on Custodians, with short timeframes and often unrealistic expectations imposed upon First Nations communities.\n\nUrban policy planning can be a tool for healing and repair between First Nations people and the broader Australian community. Engagement can be used to create new opportunities—but current engagement approaches require rethinking and need to include building longer term relationships, long before a project requires engagement. Building and sustaining relationships and creating new processes and models must be supported with resources structures that are secure, ongoing and transcend piecemeal project-by-project funding.",

          "authors": "Sven Broschinski; Martin Heidenreich",
          "abstract": "Faced with the demographic shift to a smaller and older labour force, the recruitment of migrants and their successful integration into the labour force is an essential challenge for all European countries. This article discusses the immigrant-native gap regarding the risk of overeducation for 28 European countries on the basis of the EU-LFS 2021 ad hoc module. Immigrants’ higher overeducation risks are interpreted as the result of processes of legal closure as well as statistical and taste-based discrimination. Higher overeducation rates of third country nationals (TCN) in contrast to EU migrants indicate that EU citizenship reduces discrimination and facilitates the recognition of educational certificates – they are skill-preserving devices for EU citizens but not for TCN. The large overeducation rates in particular in Southern Europe can be explained by segmented labour markets with higher unemployment and lower skill requirements increase overeducation risks, in particular for TCN. Moreover, it can be shown that EU citizenship, a higher educational level of the population, and more inclusive labour markets facilitate the occupational integration of immigrants.",

          "abstract": "In 2020, several governments declared specific occupations as essential for maintaining the functioning of society in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A current question in the public debate on fair pay is whether essential workers are sufficiently remunerated. Using data from the Netherlands, I analyze the wages of essential workers relative to other workers before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Wage decompositions indicate that, between 2006 and 2019, essential workers earned less compared to other workers within higher-paid strata, while they earned more within lower-paid strata of the occupational structure in the Netherlands. These wage differentials are shaped by sex composition and sectoral employment. In addition, I employ a difference-in-differences design based on quarterly data between 2017 and 2022 to assess whether the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic reduced an existing average wage gap in response to an increasing public appreciation of essential work. Results indicate that the collective experience of the Covid-19 pandemic has not benefited essential workers in the short-term.",

          "abstract": "Deflation represents an increase in consumer wealth through postponed consumption decisions. State-imposed \"monetary policies\" not only expropriate this increase in wealth attributed to deflation (a fiscal motive) but also penalize consumers for postponing their consumption of goods and services (a form of social engineering). Consequently, there is a shortfall in the state's legal frameworks adequately protecting consumer freedom and property rights. In response, the Bitcoin network has emerged as a private currency governed by a distinct legal framework rooted in proof-of-work. Consumers holding Bitcoin benefit from the economic advantages of global deflation-advantages often usurped by central banks-and experience enhanced freedom to delay consumption, navigating their life paths free from the constraints of social engineering. Thus, Bitcoin contributes value by addressing the shortfall in state legal systems that safeguard consumer freedom and property rights",

          "authors": "Andrew Van Horn; Alexander Stewart",
          "abstract": "Styles of traditional decorative art vary substantially across cultures. While early theorists attributed this variation to differences in environment, scholarship has long focused on decorative artworks as vehicles of social information and stylistic variation as a consequence of social factors. However, if the capacity to create and consume art evolved as a mechanism to shape shared attention, it is possible that environmental factors may indeed play a role in variation of decorative style. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the compositional structure of 198 textiles from eighteen cultures across the globe using the complexity-entropy plane. Entropy and statistical complexity have previously been used to characterize changes in the compositional structure of paintings of the Western canon over the last millennium. We observed that complexity and entropy are useful measures for characterizing traditional textile designs: high-entropy/low-complexity samples feature dense repetitions of small Euclidean shapes, while low-entropy/high-complexity samples feature large, single-color fields with bold borders. We observed weak-but-significant associations between these measures and three environmental variables: absolute latitude, Koppen climate classification, and a composite variable representing subsistence mode. Interestingly, we observed a significant difference between works from Afro-Eurasia/Oceania and the Americas. Controlling for this and other factors related to social transmission improves the strength of the relationship between compositional structure and subsistence mode. We propose that aesthetic preferences may be affected by subsistence mode as well as cultural factors, and suggest that further studies with more granular environmental data are necessary. We further discuss potential explanations for the observed difference between \"hemispheres.\"",

          "abstract": "In response to a remarkably high out of pocket (OOP) health expenditure in India, various state and the national governments in India, tried to introduce public health insurance programs. Despite being free, the take up and utilization of these programs remain low. In this paper, we seek to explain this puzzle by studying the role of informal networks in explaining insurance-adoption behavior in the context of the Arogyasri health insurance program introduced in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh between 2007 and 2008. We use household panel data from the Young Lives Survey (YLS) to empirically study how the adoption of Arogyasri among poor households respond to their membership in informal networks. In this context, we differentiate between two types of network – financial network and information network. We find that adoption and utilization are significantly higher for households with access to informal financial networks. However, adoption and utilization increases much more for households outside informal networks, after they experience health shocks. Information sharing role of informal networks do not seem to affect the decision to adopt insurance. We also provide a simple theoretical framework to discuss the potential mechanisms underlying our empirical results.",

          "authors": "Andrew M. Black; Sue Bradley; Beth Clark; Ewan Colman; Nicole Gosling; Nicholas Hanley; Lewis Holloway; Rowland Kao; Niamh Mahon; Amy Proctor",
          "abstract": "Epidemiology is a field in which the aim is to identify the characteristics, causes and means of control of conditions that exist outside of physiological norms. For both infectious and non-infectious diseases, genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioural factors can all influence the risk of acquiring disease, meaning that, despite differences in how they manifest, the problems and solutions associated with them can be remarkably similar.\n\nEpidemiology has always made use of ideas and techniques from other disciplines that help to achieve its aims, but typically takes a “toolbox” approach, bringing in data, techniques and methods and insights that support epidemiologists to solve problems they already perceive as important. However, it is not necessarily sufficient for tackling “wicked” disease problems which may require  long-term investments in interdisciplinary teams, with members working together in finding shared solutions to disease, and to educate and be educated in different disciplinary perspectives on the problem. For endemic diseases in particular, while methods of control and even eradication do exist it is often the case that they are not put into practice. Here, we address two exemplar endemic diseases in the context of farming in England: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) in cows, and lameness in cattle and sheep. These diseases were selected because of their significance to UK livestock agriculture and their contrasting epidemiologies. Both are highly impactful and have been recognised for at least half a century as among the biggest threats to livestock health, welfare and productivity in England. In both cases, while historically embedded social factors have been central to their persistence, the reluctance of social scientists and and historians to issue normative guidelines means that they are less able to offer explicit advice to policy, hindering the adoption of broader interdisciplinary perspectives. \n\nTo fill some of the gaps in that advice, here we suggest approaches to bringing a broad range of observers to bear on them.  First, while BVD and lameness are both quite well understood and ‘educating’ farmers (as often advocated in studies informed by ‘theory of planned behaviour approaches’) by treating veterinary perspectives as normative is unlikely to be universally successful. Farmers’ perspectives often have their own logics that are informed by individual circumstances and past experiences which veterinarians and other advisors can fail to appreciate. Second, we note that both farmers and consumers have shown they value health in terms of impacts on welfare and production, however ‘welfare’, like ‘health’ is likely to be perceived differently by farmers compared to veterinarians, and this requires further study. Finally, the new policy contexts of animal health as public good presents important opportunities. \n\nBeyond these general lessons, there are also particular issues for each disease. For BVD, with the uneven distribution of costs and benefits, differences in farming perspectives make it highly unlikely that the industry will come together around a voluntary BVD eradication scheme that rests on testing and trading controls. and much can be learned from the countries that are already on that journey or have reached their destination. By contrast, for lameness, where risk-factors are multi-factorial and usually highly localized, universal approaches make little sense. Here, industry-led schemes make more sense because lameness control (unlike BVD) is not a zero-sum game. Moreover, because lameness is pathologically and epidemiologically complex, and rooted in farming systems that can be difficult to change substantially, eradication is extremely hard if not impossible to achieve so local measures make more sense. In both cases, greater understanding of farmer priorities can help to identify ways to make farmers and other farm-based actors such as family members and farm workers more amenable to scientific advances, by identifying (ahead of time) potential barriers. Animal disease problems inevitably involve a complex presentation of natural and behavioural factors. By working together, we have been better placed to understand how those pieces can fit together.",

          "title": "Endogenous Confounding in Causal Decomposition Analysis",
          "authors": "Ha-Joon Chung; Guanglei Hong",
          "abstract": "Should a set of hypothetical interventions eliminate the Black-White gap in malleable factors such as schooling, how much racial disparity in subsequent youth development would be reduced and how much would remain? To address this question, a causal decomposition analysis must credibly identify the causal impact of intervening on the malleable factors. However, major confounders such as parental SES are intermediate outcomes of systemic racism experienced over generations that place Black households and communities at a great disadvantage. For this reason, an intervention that attempts to eliminate the Black-White gap in schooling within levels of parental SES or other endogenous confounders has two major problems: (1) Such an attempt is infeasible when only one but not both racial groups are present within some extreme levels of parental SES. (2) Even if both groups are present within every level of parental SES, the attempt would nonetheless fail to eliminate the marginal Black-White gap in schooling due to the endogeneity of parental SES. We propose a novel solution that replaces the original scale of an endogenous confounder with a scale preserving one’s within-group relative standing. A semiparametric weighting strategy then emulates the counterfactual outcome of an equity-oriented intervention. Our analysis of the NLSY 1997 data reveals real-world implications of the methodological dilemma posed by endogenous confounding.",

Este problema se ha propagado ampliamente en redes sociales debido a la falta de estrategias regulatorias y a la proliferación de influenciadores no cualificados que se establecen como líderes de información\n\nObjetivos:  Analizar la responsabilidad ética de los profesionales de la salud en la difusión de información nutricional en redes sociales, resaltando la importancia de garantizar que dicha información esté científicamente respaldada.\n\nMétodos: Se realizó un ensayo académico a partir de la revisión de literatura en bases de datos científicas como PubMed, NCBI, BMC Medical Ethics y JMIR, entre otras, basada en estudios recientes sobre la difusión de desinformación nutricional en redes y los principios éticos que guían a los profesionales de la salud en la comunicación digital.\n\nResultados:  El análisis de la bibliografía seleccionada reveló que existe una gran presencia de individuos en redes sociales que comparten datos erróneos no verificables, y que se establecen como autoridades en temas relacionados con nutrición, sin poseer las acreditaciones necesarias, reforzando su credibilidad ante el público mediante técnicas de comunicación novedosas, marketing y publicidad, y compartiendo información falsa en forma de dietas y consejos nutricionales que es recibida ampliamente por un público altamente influenciable. Esta conducta representa un riesgo significativo para la población y la salud pública, ya que la falta de verificación de la información y la ausencia de pensamiento crítico acerca de lo que se publica en las diversas plataformas ha llevado a la propagación de prácticas nutricionales nocivas. \n\nConclusiones: El ensayo concluye que los profesionales de la salud no solo tienen la responsabilidad ética de difundir información científicamente respaldada, sino que también tienen el deber de denunciar activamente la desinformación que encuentren en redes sociales. La formación en competencias digitales y pensamiento crítico son cruciales para que lograr enfrentar eficazmente la desinformación y educar al público. \n_____________",

          "abstract": "Man and his wealth are catalysts for consumption of resources that we refer to as commodities. While this was understood since Engel, who first tabulated these expenditures, the nature of the demand function itself remained unresolved. Economics of consumption is redefined here in terms of its basic variables, income and expenditures, in a self-consistent universal hierarchy. The analyses so far did not take into account a correction for income though the preference for consumption is primarily hierarchical. Using data from National Sample Survey Organization of India, we demonstrate the universality of the rectangular hyperbola that defines the consumption for each commodity on the basis of residual income, by deducting expenditures of higher preference based on elasticity coefficients. Since different commodities show a hierarchy of hyperbolic functions, both in the rate at which the saturation is achieved as well as the saturation itself, we needed a commodity for which the critical time constant (accounting for the hyperbolic function) is known and invariant, viz., educational expenditures. The year-wise income classes of parents that reflect the relevant expenditures for education of Brazilian children, compiled earlier by Costa Ribiero, uniquely show a constant hyperbolic function for all the years when analyzed in terms of ‘residual income’. The study corrects long-standing errors of commission and omission in relevant econometrics and biology of work-calorie relationship.",
