          "authors": "Diego Gómez-Venegas",
          "abstract": "This paper discusses the challenges of tracing the extensive and dispersed archive of Chile's Project Cybersyn and how this process highlights theoretical and political issues regarding who should possess a country's technological and cultural history. By demonstrating that part of this history – and the archive that makes it traceable – continues to resonate with the Chilean working class from which this project emerged, the author concludes that these questions must be addressed by embracing archival openness beyond archival property.",

          "title": "Continuity Intelligence: Establishing a Theoretical and Methodological Framework for Digital Public Health",
          "authors": "Meghnil Chowdhury",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced diagnostics, prediction, and automation, yet its\nability to sustain continuity of care and adaptive ethical learning across populations\nremains limited. This paper introduces Continuity Intelligence (CQ)—the first theoretical\nframework to formalize continuity as a measurable dimension of intelligence within socio-\ntechnical health systems. CQ redefines intelligence as the sustained and ethically\ngoverned capacity to remain contextually aware over time, moving beyond the short-term\noptimization of current AI paradigms. Unlike frameworks such as Learning Health Systems\nor adaptive AI, CQ positions continuity—not iteration—as the defining characteristic of\nintelligent health infrastructures. Drawing on Donna Haraway’s situated knowledges¹⁰ and\nBruno Latour’s actor-network theory¹¹, CQ integrates three interdependent dimensions—\nclinical precision, behavioral reinforcement, and social trust—to transform AI from\nepisodic prediction into continuous and participatory engagement. CQ thus offers a\nconcise, unified conceptual foundation for equitable and human-centered digital public\nhealth systems. Its novelty lies in defining continuity as the operational measure of\nintelligence—linking ethical governance, behavioral adaptation, and clinical precision into\na sustained framework applicable to chronic disease management, mental health, and\nelder care.",

          "authors": "Lamine Ain el djaneb; Dalila Laoufi",
          "abstract": "This article is an inquiry into how digital communication practices affect the strategic vigilance of public institutions in Algeria. On the basis of material collected in the course of a master’s thesis I was able to conduct and additional resources, it looks into whether raising an organization's presence in the digital realm also enhances its capability to monitor changes in environment and take proactive action. It employed a descriptive and analytical mixed method design: interviews were carried out with employees of Rail Logistic; participant observation was conducted over the course of a three-month internship at company headquarters; and finally an official website and Facebook pages were analyzed using quantitative content analysis. The results show that Rail Logistic's limited digital communication, rare updates, a narrow content scope and a low level of basic literacy in its staff regarding digital technologies actually undermines its ability to be strategically vigilant. But this is not because the workers are incapable of bringing about change or do not understand what needs to change. Major obstacles include the absence of real-time monitoring tools, insufficient content diversity, inadequate digital skills, and structural/cultural barriers to integrating digital channels into core strategy. These results highlight the need for Algerian public organizations to develop coherent digital communication strategies and cultures. In particular, establishing dedicated monitoring units and investing in training could leverage social media and web tools for more effective environmental scanning. This article’s contribution lies in articulating a theoretical framework of digital communication and strategic vigilance, and in critically analyzing empirical data from the Algerian public sector to draw lessons for policy and practice.\n\nKeywords: digital communication; strategic vigilance; digital transformation; public sector; digital culture; environmental scanning.",

          "authors": "Bennett McIntosh; Kelsey Ichikawa; Nicole Christine Nelson",
          "abstract": "Over the last decade, the transparency of the scientific data supporting environmental regulations has been the subject of partisan conflict at the highest levels of the United States’ government. Recent attempts by conservatives, industry groups, and dissident scientists to promulgate transparency requirements for such data have been described by partisan opponents and critical data studies scholars alike as ‘Trojan Horses’ designed to exclude nonreplicable studies from environmental decision making. However, if we distinguish between replication (performing a study de novo) and reanalysis (re-examining data from an existing study to confirm or challenge its conclusions), several things become clear. First, these recent clashes are part of a long story, stretching back at least to the 1990s, that is centered on data access for reanalysis: while some actors may be interested in preventing the consideration of certain data, others are interested in reanalyzing data to re-examine the scientific consensus, and in fact have done so. Second, using procedure or methodological quality to adjudicate reanalyses often fails, leading to a recourse to reputational markers that amplifies rather than resolves the lack of epistemic closure. Because the transparency of regulatory data has been a bipartisan priority over the last few decades, we anticipate that adversarial reanalyses will only become more common. The aim of transparent, open scientific data is a laudable one, but as data become more open, advocates, scientists, and policymakers alike will have to be mindful of how to make decisions in the absence of scientific consensus.",

          "abstract": "Mobile messaging interventions provide a scalable, low-cost channel to support health behavior change, yet optimal content design remains uncertain, particularly regarding gain- versus loss-framed messages. Guided by the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), this study examined framing preferences among older adults to inform user-centered digital intervention design for alcohol reduction. In a choice experiment, N=1,348 participants aged 50 years and older evaluated 174 messages (86 gain- and 86 loss-framed) across 6,740 pairwise comparisons. Participants selected which message they would prefer to receive as part of a health messaging program. Gain-framed messages were preferred in 57.8% of direct gain–loss comparisons (95% CI: 0.561–0.594; χ²(1)=83.66, p&lt;.001), independent of message placement or trial order. Substantial variability was observed across individual message content. Results indicate a consistent preference for gain framing but emphasize that framing alone does not determine preference, underscoring the need to study other behavioral mechanisms that can be optimized.",

          "abstract": "Disentangling the cultural drivers of ecological degradation and recovery remains a central challenge for a regenerative future. Here, we use language to develop the first systematic record of global variation in nature attitudes and explore the implications for global environmental health. Using natural language processing (multilingual and contextualized word embeddings) we identify nature representations in 120 languages spoken across 189 countries. Starting with English we find moderate  associations of nature with importance, although this trend has increased over the last 200 years. Despite being the international standard language of environmental policy discussions, English expresses weaker nature-importance associations than 70% of other languages. In contrast, Afro-Asiatic languages, spoken in Global South nations, tend to express the strongest nature-importance associations. Critically, even after controlling for economic, linguistic, and attitudinal factors, the global variation of nature-importance associations in language robustly correlates with national-level environmental health, especially protection of water and land biodiversity areas.",

          "authors": "Rebecca Shiner; William Monti",
          "abstract": "Young adults often grapple with questions of meaning and identity as they begin to define who they are and how their lives matter. Narrative identity theory proposes that constructing coherent life stories promotes self-continuity and meaning, yet this process has rarely been tested experimentally. We tested the Brief Meaning Boost (BMB), a single-session online narrative intervention that guided participants to write about key memories, identify life-story themes, and receive wisdom from their future self. In a preregistered randomized controlled trial (N = 532; ages 18–24; 54% women) with participants recruited through Prolific and residing in Western countries but representing over 50 countries of origin, participants were randomly assigned to the BMB or an active control. Compared with controls, intervention participants reported higher meaning/purpose and mattering immediately after the intervention and at one- and three-week follow-ups (ds = 0.52/0.34 at T2; 0.25/0.19 at T3; 0.27/0.24 at T4). The intervention also increased narrative coherence, uplifted affect, and self-continuity. Mediation analyses indicated that each process independently predicted sustained gains in meaning/purpose and mattering, and that early increases in both thematic coherence and uplifted affect predicted stronger self-continuity one week later, which in turn maintained meaning and mattering three weeks post-intervention. These findings provide the first causal evidence that strengthening narrative identity processes can enhance meaning in life, advancing theories of personality change and offering a brief, scalable approach to help emerging adults cultivate purpose and mattering during a pivotal developmental period.",

Network architecture of T1 and T2 remained stable across timepoints despite COVID-19 disruptions. Findings revealed two distinct clusters: cognitive-language domains and socio-emotional domains. Regarding parental care, home learning support demonstrated stronger centrality and closer associations with CDDs compared to families’ basic care provision. Academic achievement emerged as a bridge node connecting separated clusters. Results highlight the interconnected nature of CDDs and identify strategic intervention points serving the developmental needs and fostering academic achievement of immigrant children from low-income communities.",

          "abstract": "Background: Fluoxetine is among the most used antidepressants for children and adolescents and\nfrequently recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment for pediatric depression. However,\nin contrast to earlier studies and reviews, a Cochrane network meta-analysis from 2021 concluded\nthat the estimated efficacy of fluoxetine was no longer clinically meaningful.\nStudy aim: To explain the discrepant findings between the recent Cochrane review and earlier\nreviews and to explore if this was acknowledged in guidelines and treatment recommendations\nappearing since then.\nMethods: Meta-analytical aggregation of trial results over time, exploring potential biases, and a\nnon-systematic search for recent treatment guidelines/recommendations from major medical\norganizations.\nResults: The estimated efficacy of fluoxetine in clinical trials declined over time into the range of\nclinical equivalence with placebo when more recent studies were included in analyses and when\nconsidering common thresholds of clinical significance. This remains unacknowledged in treatment\nguidelines and related publications, including some that continue to recommend fluoxetine as first-\nline pharmacological treatment. Finally, we find that the loss of efficacy over time is likely\nexplained by biases such as the novelty bias or by variations of expectancy effects.\nConclusions: The seeming lack of clinically meaningful efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of\npediatric depression needs to be considered by those who develop treatment recommendations as\nwell as by patients and clinicians. The biases we observed are not only relevant in the evaluation of\nfluoxetine and other antidepressants for pediatric depression, but also for any new treatment.",

          "title": "Similarity judgments and visual working memory do not share the same cognitive representation",
          "authors": "William Xiang Quan Ngiam; Michael David Lee",
          "abstract": "Many cognitive models assume a set of processes operating upon a psychological representation that is derived using multidimensional scaling (MDS) of similarity judgments. While MDS-based models have been useful in exploring cognitive phenomena, the underlying representation itself should not be left unexplained. The issue of defining the appropriate cognitive representation recently came to the fore in the field of visual working memory (VWM). Most VWM models are constructed on the physical stimulus space, but Schurgin et al. (2020) influentially argued that VWM is better modeled on the psychological similarity space. To address this discrepancy, we took a Bayesian generative modeling approach, applying cognitive models to the open data of three tasks from Tomić &amp; Bays (2024): a perceptual reproduction task, and a memory reproduction task, and a similarity comparison task. We show that the underlying representation for these tasks can be recovered with this approach, and find that there is non-uniformity in the representations with respect to the physical stimuli. Our critical result is that the representation differs between the similarity comparison and stimulus reproduction tasks. This result suggests that the psychological representation derived from similarity tasks cannot be assumed to be the representation underlying VWM. We also show that by including detailed mechanisms in our cognitive models (in this case, swap errors in the memory reproduction task) improves the recovered mental representation. We conclude by arguing that mental representations should be explained by being included in cognitive process models rather than derived from independent tasks like similarity comparisons.",

          "authors": "Dzan Zelihic; Stefania Antonia Kyriakidou; Laoura Ziaka; Bob McMurray; Athanassios Protopapas",
          "abstract": "Recent findings show that lexical activation is slower when words are surrounded by other words, as they always are in natural reading. Here we focus on the proposal that this is due to direct interference from adjacent words that are processed in parallel. In three experiments using a flanked masked visual word adaptation of the visual world paradigm with adult skilled readers, we probed the spatial conditions for interference. Target words were flashed at fixation for 75 ms flanked by other words before being masked; we studied gaze shifts to the image (out of four displayed) corresponding to the target. We found that interference increases with proximity and is asymmetric (stronger from the right side). In the third experiment we included an image for one of the flanker words and we obtained direct evidence for lexical activation of the right-side flanker, consistent with parallel models of word recognition. Intriguingly, the strong asymmetry of lexical activation stands in contrast to a much weaker asymmetry in overall interference, indicating that different levels of representation are differentially involved in the online interactions among adjacent words. In all, our findings constitute strong evidence for distributed attention around fixation differentially affecting diverse word processing stages, and call for a reconsideration of word recognition models that posit independent processing of individual words. They also confirm that the masked flanked visual word visual world paradigm is appropriate for studying attentional allocation during reading.",

          "abstract": "We often give advice to influence others, but could our own advice also be shaped by the very individuals we aim to influence (i.e., advisees)? This reverse flow of social influence—from those typically seen as being influenced to those who provide the influence—has been largely neglected, limiting our understanding of the reciprocal nature of human interactions. Here, we conducted a series of experiments and applied computational modelling to systematically investigate how advisees’ opinions shape the advice-giving process. In an investment game, participants (n = 346, across four studies) provided advice either independently or after observing advisees’ opinions (Studies 1 &amp; 2), with feedback on their advice (acceptance or rejection) provided by advisees (Studies 3 &amp; 4). Our findings consistently reveal that advisors tend to adjust their advice to align with the advisees’ opinions (we refer to this as the alignment bias), even when this compromises advice accuracy (Study 1). This tendency, which is demonstrated to be a deliberate pursuit rather than merely a result of opinion contagion, persists when advisors have a direct incentive to provide accurate advice (Study 2). However, as feedback is introduced, advisors’ behavior shifts, adapting to advisees’ preferences (“advising as one likes”), as described by a reinforcement learning model suggesting advisors’ intention to seek acceptance from advisees underlies the alignment bias (Study 3), even when acceptance is rare (Study 4). Collectively, our findings highlight advisors’ susceptibility to seeking acceptance, which can lead to counterproductive impacts on decision-making processes and misinformation exacerbation in social encounters.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between the Rest’s neo-Kohlbergian approach to moral reasoning and the CNI model of utilitarian-deontological decision-making. Drawing on a sample of adult participants, we examined how individual differences in moral schema adoption—Postconventional (PC), Maintaining Norms (MN), and Personal Interest (PI)—correlate with the three CNI dimensions: Sensitivity to Consequences, Sensitivity to Norms, and Preference for Inaction. Significant linear relationships emerged: PC schema positively correlated with Consequence Sensitivity, MN schema positively with Norm Sensitivity but negatively with Consequence Sensitivity, and PI schema negatively with Norm Sensitivity. A curvilinear pattern was found between MN schema and Consequence Sensitivity, with higher MN adoption initially predicting lower Consequence Sensitivity, but reversing among participants who heavily prioritized MN reasoning. The results underscore the distinct ways in which moral schemas shape sensitivity to moral norms and outcomes, suggesting that PC reasoning may operate more holistically and flexibly than is captured by the CNI model. The study contributes to a more integrated understanding of moral judgment by linking cognitive-developmental and psychological process-oriented approaches.",

          "abstract": "(Potential) users of artificial intelligence (AI) products (e.g., smart fridges, voice assistants) are most often not fully informed about the data security and data privacy (DSDP) of these AI products as such information is not available in an easily accessible format. Here, I argue that it is essential to provide (potential) users with such information presented in an easily accessible and quick-to-process format as this could help instill appropriate levels of (dis-)trust and thus support (trustworthy) AI acceptance and adoption. Testing the effect of AI trustworthiness labels, I presented participants with hypothetical AI products that were versus were not paired with a graphical or text-based label indicating a low to high DSDP level. Trust, AI anxiety, as well as the monetary value attributed to AI products scaled with an AI trustworthiness label’s DSDP level. Importantly, participants’ ratings of unlabeled AI products corresponded to their perceptions of AI products labeled with an intermediate DSDP level. This apparent bias towards intermediate DSDP judgements in the absence of information on AI products underscores the relevance of explicitly communicating AI trustworthiness to (potential) users. Interestingly, differences in trust for AI products with a high as compared to intermediate DSDP level further increased with more positive attitudes towards AI technology.",

          "title": "The ABC of Heuristics: Rules of Thumb as Likelihood-free Approximate Bayesian Computation",
          "authors": "Tianwei Gong; Simon Valentin; Neil R Bramley; Christopher G. Lucas",
          "abstract": "Heuristics have long been viewed as simple decision rules that sacrifice optimality for cognitive efficiency. However, this perspective fails to fully account for their effectiveness in complex, real-world environments. This paper proposes a reinterpretation of heuristics as realizations of likelihood-free approximation to Bayesian inference (LFI), bridging the gap between heuristic and normative approaches to decision-making. We argue that many heuristics can be understood as implementations of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), where observed data are compared to prior predictions via summary statistics (a form of LFI). This view situates heuristics within a probabilistic framework, explaining how they can represent uncertainty and adapt to environmental structure. Our approach addresses three key challenges in the field: It relaxes strong assumptions about cue-target relationships in heuristic models, accounts for implicit uncertainty representation in heuristic decision-making, and invites a more appropriate benchmark for evaluating heuristics' performance. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we present two case studies --- a classic cue-based decision task and an ecological causal learning task. These show that an ABC model using summary statistics can well approximate the benchmark performance provided by unconstrained Bayesian inference, explain the apparent emergence of different heuristics given environmental changes, and capture human behaviors better than a rational Bayesian benchmark without introducing new mysteries. By unifying heuristics and Bayesian inference through the lens of likelihood-free methods, this work provides a more nuanced understanding of human decision-making, and provides a bridge to the literature on inference-by-sampling.",

          "abstract": "Background and Objective. The network approach to psychopathology views mental disorders as dynamic interactions between symptoms, challenging traditional latent-cause models. We applied this approach to individuals with PTSD, using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data to build personalized contemporaneous and directed symptom networks. Our primary aim was to assess whether these network-derived formulations aligned with clinician-generated cognitive formulations. We also tested whether cognitive variables predicted affective variables over time, consistent with the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model of PTSD. \nMethod. Five participants completed 14-21 days of EMA (response rate=90.2+5.48%), yielding 348 observations total. Items were tailored to each patient’s lived experience and mapped to Ehlers and Clark components. Written formulations from patients and clinicians were compared to EMA-based networks generated by three network algorithms.\nResults. Network-derived formulations shared some features with patient and clinician-derived formulations but often diverged in complexity and specific predictions. Data-driven networks had good precision (0.64-0.86) but low sensitivity (0.31-0.35), showing better agreement with patient self-formulations than with clinician models. Evidence for lead-lag effects between cognitive and affective variables was limited. Trauma memory emerged as the most central component, with its association to sense of current threat and matching triggers being the most prominent. \nConclusion. Network analysis may refine clinical hypotheses but has limitations in replicating comprehensive formulations. Instead, we recommend its use for clinical hypothesis testing of specific predictions. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to test its clinical utility and contribution to treatment outcomes.",

Participants reported justice-relevant traits, empathy, ambiguity tolerance, justice sensitivity, and moral indignation, then engaged with counter-attitudinal content. From these data we estimated generalized linear models linking traits to two Hegselmann–Krause parameters: the confidence bound c (openness to differing opinions) and the self-influence weight m (inverse to susceptibility to influence). Empirically, a subset of theorized links was supported: cognitive empathy widened c, moral indignation narrowed c, and victim-oriented justice sensitivity increased m. We then calibrated a bounded-confidence ABM with these mappings and evaluated it against four canonical polarization findings. The empirically informed model substantially\nimproved qualitative replication of group extremization and signed directional change under mixed evidence, matched the backfire contrast as good as the baseline, and, like the baseline, failed to reproduce a superlinear polarization slope. These results show how justice-focused traits, particularly\nempathy and moral indignation, provide a parsimonious, data-driven bridge from micro-level psychology to macro-level polarization dynamics, while also revealing limits that motivate extensions (e.g., identity cues and framing) in future work.",

The method is efficient in terms of participant time, is easy to deploy on an online platform to gather behavioral responses, and allows simultaneous measurement of brain activity without contamination from onset responses. The participant hears a continuous tone within each block, with frequency steps at predetermined intervals, and is invited to respond “up” or “down” to these steps by pressing one of two keys. The magnitude of the steps varies according to a predetermined schedule (constant-stimuli, not adaptive) from large (easy) to small (hard), and the discrimination threshold is derived from a psychometric function fitted to the responses to this sequence. Comparison with earlier published procedures shows that the new method yields comparable thresholds, albeit less variable and slightly lower, and thus presumably closer to sensory limits.",

Because choices, confidence judgments, and reaction times are closely linked in perceptual decisions, it seems only natural to simultaneously model these three outcome variables of a decision.

This paper gives an overview of the package, which provides probability density functions as well as high-level functions for fitting parameters to empirical data, prediction of reaction time and response distributions and simulation of artificial data sets. We describe the mathematical specification of the implemented models and give a detailed description of the implemented likelihood functions. In addition, we outline the workflow for applying the model to empirical data step-by-step: data preprocessing, model fitting, model prediction, quantitative model comparison, and visual assessment of model predictions. Finally, we present results from a parameter and model recovery analyses and assess the precision in calculating probability densities, illustrating the reliability of the implemented computations. Offering intuitive usability and high flexibility, the package is targeted at researchers in the fields of decision-making and confidence and does not require expert-level programming skills.",

This mixed-methods study combines two survey datasets (N₁ = 69; N₂ = 44) with fifteen expert interviews to examine the cognitive, affective, and professional determinants of AI trust. Quantitative analyses indicate that prior AI experience, perceived transparency, and emotional comfort predict willingness to trust AI-assisted decision-making, while accountability is consistently attributed to humans. Qualitative analysis identifies seven recurring themes: emotional reasoning, meta-cognition, AI-augmented creativity and innovation, algorithms codifying injustice, radical skepticism, heuristics and cognitive biases, and algorithmic transparency. Experts emphasized that AI functions as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for professional judgment. Together, these findings highlight that trust in AI emerges through interactional, cognitive, and affective processes, underscoring the importance of explainable, ethically aligned, and human-centered AI design.",

          "authors": "Projnya Mojumdar; Purba Mojumdar",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nEvent-related potential (ERP) research exhibits a critical methodological blind spot: inter-condition correlations (ρ_XY), the parameter that mathematically determines difference wave reliability via the Lord-Novick formula, are systematically unmeasured. This creates fundamental interpretive ambiguity because Classical Test Theory demonstrates that difference wave reliability is inversely related to ρ_XY, with high correlations suppressing reliability even when constituent waveforms are psychometrically sound. Systematic examination of four foundational ERP studies in bilingual language switching (2001-2016, N_citations ≈ 1,575) confirms this pattern: none report difference wave reliability or inter-condition correlations, despite these measures being the primary dependent variables isolating language control processes. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this vulnerability extends across the entire plausible parameter space: even when inter-condition correlations are moderate (ρ_XY = .50-.60), achieving adequate difference wave reliability (ρ_DD' ≥ .70) requires constituent reliabilities approaching the ceiling of current ERP methodology (ρ = .85-.88). When experimental control produces high correlations (ρ_XY ≥ .70, a plausible inference from structural analysis and cross-domain precedent in fMRI and other ERP components, though empirically unverified in language switching), the degradation becomes catastrophic: constituent reliabilities of .85 yield difference wave reliabilities near zero. The conspicuous absence of empirical ρ_XY measurements and reliability verification means the field cannot determine whether two decades of N2 debate reflect genuine neurocognitive complexity, measurement instability, or both in unknown proportions. If inter-condition correlations prove high in tightly controlled paradigms (as rigorous experimental design would predict), inconsistent findings become expected outcomes of unreliable measurement rather than theoretical puzzles requiring reconciliation. However, problems persist even if correlations are moderate, indicating systematic vulnerability regardless of precise parameter values. Three reforms can address this gap: mandatory reporting of difference wave reliability and inter-condition correlations (ρ ≥ .70 for group comparisons, ρ ≥ .80 for individual differences research), adoption of Generalizability Theory frameworks that partition variance across multiple sources, and single-trial analytical methods that avoid categorical subtraction. These principles extend beyond bilingual research to all ERP domains using difference waves. Systematic psychometric verification should precede theoretical elaboration; the measurement revolution Parsons (2022) called for requires not novel techniques but rigorous application of established principles.",

          "abstract": "Despite the very different retinal images that result from different viewing conditions, humans have little difficulty recognising visual objects in varying circumstances. One source of variability is 2-D rotation, which results in an object having different  orientations. Here, we studied how the brain transforms rotated object images into object representations that are tolerant to rotation. We measured time-varying electroencephalography responses to object images shown in eight different orientations, presented at either 5 Hz or 20 Hz. We used multivariate classification to assess when rotation-tolerant object information emerged, and whether the rotation-tolerant processing would be limited at the faster  presentation rate. We compared this to fixed-rotation measures of object decoding, where the classifier is trained and tested on the same orientation. Our results showed that both fixed-rotation and rotation-tolerant object decoding emerged at an early stage of processing, less than 100 ms after stimulus onset. However, rotation-tolerant information peaked later than fixed-rotation information, suggesting rotation-tolerant object representations are most prominent during a late stage of processing, around 200 ms after stimulus onset. Both fixed-rotation and rotation-tolerant object information was lower for the 20 Hz compared to 5 Hz presentation rate, which suggests that object information processing is disrupted, but not eliminated, for fast presentation rates. Our results show that object information arises at similar times in the brain regardless of whether it is investigated with the fixed-rotation or rotation-tolerant object decoding method. An object representation that is tolerant to rotation and generalises across different exemplars of the same object is established in later stages of processing.",

          "abstract": "Gonzalez and Heidari propose cognitive AI—systems that emulate human cognitive processes—as essential for human–AI complementarity in dynamic decision-making. I argue this framework rests on two questionable premises. First, the distinction between cognitive AI and data-driven approaches lacks practical significance: modern AI trained on behavioral data already exhibits emergent human-like properties through implicit modeling of statistical regularities in human decision-making. Second, the framework assumes complementarity requires AI to mirror human cognition, including human limitations and constraints. Yet if noise and systematic biases fundamentally characterize human cognition, complementary AI should compensate for these limitations rather than reproduce them. I propose that effective human–AI complementarity requires design principles emphasizing appropriate role allocation, transparent uncertainty communication, adaptive personalization that improves decision quality, and mutual modeling of functionally relevant features without necessarily replicating cognitive mechanisms. These principles can be instantiated through various technical approaches and should be evaluated by team outcomes rather than adherence to cognitive theories. Complementarity requires AI that augments human capabilities, not cognitive architectures that reproduce human limitations.",

The persistent lack of generalization reflects structural barriers—historical populations are inaccessible, cross-cultural studies costly, marginalized communities resistant to conventional recruitment. As methodological tools paired with human validation, LLMs lower these barriers without creating surrogates. This distinction determines whether LLMs expand or narrow cognitive science's scope. I operationalize this distinction through a decision framework that specifies when LLMs enhance rather than threaten generalizability, providing clear standards for responsible methodological practice.",

          "abstract": "Mindfulness practice is often described as yielding a “quieter mind,” yet the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying this experience remain understudied. This research investigates how focused attention (FA) meditation influences automatic semantic processing through a series of conflict-based tasks (e.g., Stroop). In a between-groups design, participants were randomly assigned to either brief FA meditation or mind-wandering control conditions. Results demonstrated that, compared to the control group, FA meditation significantly reduced the Stroop congruency facilitation effect in the classic color-word task. In two additional non-semantic control tasks, administered only to participants who underwent FA meditation, the facilitation effect was preserved. This selective pattern suggests that FA meditation temporarily inhibits automatic semantic processing rather than enhancing reactive control or general selective attention. Notably, these effects emerged in meditation novices following a brief (10-minute) guided FA session, indicating that even short-term meditation can modulate automatic cognitive processes. These findings provide empirical support for the role of mindfulness in reducing automatic thought processes and contribute to our understanding of its underlying cognitive mechanisms, offering insights into how brief meditation interventions might help individuals better manage intrusive thoughts and automatic cognitive processes in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims\nThe ongoing opioid epidemic remains a major public health crisis in the United States, with over 100,000 opioid-related deaths annually. Mental health disorders are strongly associated with opioid use disorder (OUD), compounding risks of misuse and overdose. Emerging evidence indicates that psychedelics may be associated with reduced risk of OUD. This study aimed to estimate the associations between lifetime psychedelic use and OUD severity, accounting for mental health impairment, and to test whether these associations vary by mental health status.\n\nDesign\nCross-sectional analysis of the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health using structural equation modeling with multiple-group moderation. Reporting follows STROBE guidelines for observational studies.\n\nSetting\nUnited States, nationally representative community survey.\n\nParticipants\n45,133 adults aged ≥18 years (55% female; mean age = 35.6 years, SD = 13.7).\n\nMeasurements\nThe primary dependent variable was OUD severity (no disorder, mild, moderate, severe). Independent variables were two psychedelic factors: mescaline/peyote (Psychedelic_F1) and LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, DMT (Psychedelic_F2). Mental health impairment was modeled as a latent construct (psychological distress, functional impairment, major depression) and also used to define high vs. low impairment groups. Covariates were age, sex, and household income.\n\nFindings \nPsychedelic_F1 was associated with lower OUD severity (β = –0.34, p = .001, 95%CI [-0.550, -0.153]), while the Psychedelic_F2 was associated with higher severity (β = 0.60, p &lt; .001, 95%CI [0.429, 0.759]). Mental health impairment was positively associated with OUD severity (β = 0.21, p &lt; .001, 95%CI [0.184, 0.256]). Multiple-group SEM indicated moderation by mental health impairment (Δχ²(6) = 22.29, p = .001): Psychedelic_F1 was associated with lower OUD severity only in the high mental health impairment group (β = –0.15, p = .041, 95%CI [-0.299, -0.006]), whereas the association of Psychedelic_F2 with higher OUD severity was attenuated in high mental health impairment (β = 0.38, p &lt; .001, 95%CI [0.274, 0.521] vs. β = 0.48, p = .004, 95%CI [0.164, 0.847]). \n\nConclusions\nIn the United States, two distinct psychedelic use patterns were identified. The factor capturing lifetime mescaline/peyote use was associated with lower OUD severity, while the factor including LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, and DMT use was associated with higher severity. These associations differed by level of mental health impairment, with more favorable associations with OUD severity most evident among individuals with greater mental health impairment. More research on the context and intention of psychedelic use in the general public is warranted.",

          "abstract": "Emotion concepts serve as key guideposts for understanding our feelings, communicating them to others, and selecting appropriate actions. Yet people differ in how they represent these concepts—‘anger’ may mean rage for one person and mild irritation for another—even though we typically assume a shared understanding. Because emotion concepts support efficient communication and coordination, such divergences raise a critical question: what happens when an individual’s emotion-concept representations deviate from the group norm? Here we investigate an overlooked aspect of emotion, the degree to which conceptual representations of emotion integrate and align with the normative emotional scaffolding that emerges at the population level. We find across three studies (N=1,490) that greater misalignment from the group-level representation of emotion concepts has broad costs for adaptive social and emotional functioning. Individuals whose concepts are more misaligned are less sensitive to others’ antisocial behaviors during economic games, leading to less strategic punishment of norm violators and poorer social coordination. Consistent with the idea that emotion unfolds between people and the larger social community, greater misalignment also tracks pervasive affective dysfunction, including more severe alexithymia, anhedonia, and depression. That emotion misalignment may be a key through-line or pathway disrupting affective functioning seen in mood disorders, offers new theoretical insight into the possible mechanisms underlying emotion processing. Together, these findings underscore that emotion knowledge is fundamentally social and that systematic deviations from shared emotion concepts undermine both social adaptation and emotional health.",

However, the moment-to-moment details of how creative innovation is accomplished by a collective remain unclear. One challenge is that while creative products (e.g., scientific breakthroughs, technological inventions, rehearsed performances) may be public, the creative processes that generated those products are often private. Here we introduce collective musical improvisation as a model system for the fine-grained study of in vivo collective innovation. In free jazz improvisation, the creative product is the creative process, offering a unique real-time window into the creative process. Using a corpus of free jazz recordings, we embedded each track as a trajectory through a high-dimensional “sonic space” and then analyzed the strategies by which musicians moved collectively through this space of sonic possibility. Despite the cognitive sophistication and cultural richness of musical improvisation, we find that musical ensembles spontaneously adopt a search strategy, Area Restricted Search, with deep evolutionary roots, previously identified in animal foraging. This convergence between behavioral ecology, cognition, and culture suggests deep evolutionary origins of the human capacity for collective innovation.",

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a structured, prompt-based approach that enables LLMs to perform both abstract and full-text screening without programming or API integration. Using datasets from two completed meta-analyses, we implemented a stepwise training framework involving comprehension checks, criterion-specific feedback, and iterative prompt refinement. Study 1 optimized technical parameters, including file format and batch size, using 1,000 abstracts and 50 full texts from a completed meta-analysis. Study 2 validated the approach in an independent dataset on teletherapy for depression (1,321 abstracts, 82 full texts). Human reviewers’ decisions served as the reference standard, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were the primary outcomes. In Study 1, the LLM achieved 98.0% sensitivity and 80.6% specificity at abstract screening, with optimal performance using batches of 50 abstracts in plain-text format. In Study 2, sensitivity reached 100% and specificity 85.6% for abstracts, and 82.1% accuracy for full-text screening, correctly retaining all eligible studies. A structured, prompt-based approach allows LLMs to approximate human-level accuracy in both abstract and full-text screening, with high sensitivity and specificity. This method makes LLM-assisted screening more accessible to review teams. While human oversight remains essential to address false positives and ensure rigor, prompt-based LLM workflows can substantially reduce reviewer burden and accelerate evidence synthesis.",

          "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system, relatively understudied compared to the central nervous system, is thought to play a key role in supporting attentional engagement, a cornerstone of cognitive control in early development. To address the non-trivial challenges that complex autonomic signals present to traditional modeling, we leverage recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), an established nonlinear approach for quantifying the temporal organization of heart-rate dynamics. Here, we compute recurrence metrics to examine trait, or participant level (across the task), and state level (moment-by-moment) autonomic recurrence patterns in relation to infants’ multimodal attentional engagement with objects in a cross-cultural sample from Singapore and Brazil (N = 78, Age = 8.63 - 25.32 months). Across both countries, at the trait level, we observe that for most metrics, lower participant-level autonomic recurrence is related to higher infant attentional engagement and higher parent-reported regulatory capacity. Similarly, at the state level, all recurrence metrics are lower during moments of attentional engagement compared to disengagement. Further, certain metrics show sensitivity to attentional transitions and differentiate between different types of attentional engagement. Findings suggest that reduced autonomic recurrence, indicative of enhanced autonomic flexibility and stronger parasympathetic contributions, supports early attentional engagement.",

          "abstract": "Voting is a critical component of representative democracy but yields consistently low engagement from young Americans. Online communication interventions have the potential to catalyze action, but evidence regarding best practices for digital, youth-focused get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messaging is sparse. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and Reasoned Action approaches, we integrated formative and participatory research approaches to fill this gap. In a partnership between communication researchers and a college student-led GOTV organization, we conducted formative research integrating experiential knowledge from youth partners with scientific evidence to generate a set of voting beliefs. We used the standard Hornik &amp; Woolf method to select promising beliefs to target in messaging but also conducted post-hoc analyses demonstrating the potential of network approaches that take into account relationships among beliefs to identify influential beliefs. We then co-designed belief-informed GOTV messages that could be disseminated via social media and tested message effects in both local and national samples of college students. We found that the messages co-designed with youth to target promising voting beliefs were more motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant than existing GOTV social media messages from a national youth-focused campaign. They were also more motivating and persuasive than prior messages from our student-led GOTV partner organization—which were not designed using formative research—suggesting that the combination of formative and participatory research practices increases message effectiveness. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of engaging youth in voting research and illustrate the benefits of integrating theory-based formative research, network approaches, and human-centered participatory practices to develop messaging campaigns.",

          "abstract": "The world is stochastic, making planning difficult. Despite the ubiquity of stochasticity in real-world environments, it remains an open question how people effectively balance the cognitive costs of planning against its potential benefits when faced with stochasticity. To study this, we designed a planning task where participants face one of three forms of stochasticity commonly encountered in the real world: reliability, volatility, and controllability. We find a robust pattern across all three manipulations: as stochasticity increases, people reduce their planning effort as measured by first-choice response times. To understand the processes underlying this effect, we developed several computational cognitive models to account for participants' choices. We find that rather than calculating expected values optimally, people chose a simpler strategy, acting as if the world were deterministic, a phenomenon known as determinizing. Consistent with our response time findings, we found that planning depth estimated in the winning model decreases monotonically with increasing stochasticity. Our work highlights the often overlooked role of stochasticity in human planning and its impact on planning strategy and effort. Moreover, it reveals the limitations of studying stochasticity solely through single-shot decisions.",

          "abstract": "What humans look at and do when freely viewing a scene is not well understood. We show that free-viewing fixations resemble those of observers describing scenes but differ from those of observers counting or searching for objects. Fixations are more often directed toward people and objects whose removal most alters scene interpretation, rather than toward the most salient or meaningfully judged regions (meaning maps), or objects perceived to be grasped or gazed at. Small image changes that modify scene understanding—but not salience or meaning maps—alter fixation patterns. By instructing observers to describe scenes while fixating on objects either relevant or irrelevant to scene understanding, we demonstrate that free-viewing eye movements are functionally important for accurate scene comprehension. Thus, an important default task during free viewing for the human brain is to comprehend scenes, reflected by frequent eye movements toward people and objects that maximize accurate scene understanding.",

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) are hypothesized to experience impairments in flexible, computationally-intensive model-based decision-making and to over-rely on simpler, more automatic strategies, such as model-free decision-making. However, research investigating model-based versus model-free learning disturbances in AN has been mixed and limited by cross-sectional investigations at a single illness stage. Methods: We administered a Markov Two Stage Decision Task capturing model-based and model-free decision-making to AN (n=23), weight-restored AN (WR; n=34), and non-eating disorder control (NC; n=50) participants. Decision-making differences were examined using Reinforcement Learning and One-Trial-Back Stay/Switch models. Regressions examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relations between model-based and model-free estimates and clinical variables. Results: There were no between-group differences across model-based or model-free estimates (ps=.099-.901). However, the WR group showed some indications of model-based deficits (e.g., difficulty distinguishing rare versus common task transitions). Cross-sectionally, higher model-based estimates were associated with lower BMIs (ps=.014-.017), driven by NC participants. There was an interaction between group and One-Trial-Back Stay/Switch model-free estimates on test meal intake (p=.039); higher model-free estimates were associated with greater intake in NC, but lower intake in WR. Longitudinally, there was a significant group by model-based learning estimate interaction on follow-up BMI (ps=.027-.006); higher model-based estimates predicted higher BMIs for WR, but lower BMIs for AN at follow-up. Conclusions: Model-based and model-free decision-making and their relations with clinical variables differed according to stage of illness, as well as cross-sectional or longitudinal measurement, in AN. Greater attention to contextual variables is needed in future computational models examining decision-making in AN.",

As an alternative, entanglement is posited as proto-mental and a speculative quantum-panprotopsychistic model of consciousness as “constrained superposition” is developed: a continuous dynamic quantum-entangled state shaped by constraints that emerge from neural activity. The model’s explanatory merits are explored, and a potential substrate, an open quantum dissipative network of mitochondria is proposed alongside an evolutionary rationale: ancestral mitochondria as energy parasites may have exploited entanglement as a game-theoretic edge for cooperative alignment, with subjective experience emerging from this quantum consensus. Although highly speculative, the framework yields testable predictions concerning mitochondrial network dynamics, perturbation sensitivity, and phenomenal experiences, and offers a biologically grounded architecture for unified experience.",

          "abstract": "A stick, of course. This masterpiece of human creativity is an example of a dad joke, a clean, good-natured joke founded on puns, literalism, and wordplay. After unpacking the structures, contents, and comedic devices that distinguish dad jokes from related genres, the present research explored both the features of dad jokes that make them funny and the kinds of people who find them funny. Study 1 coded over 32,000 jokes scraped from the Reddit r/dadjokes community. Ridge regression models found that a joke’s upvotes and comments were modestly predictable from its text and topic features (test sample R2 = 4.02% and 4.42%). After curating a hypercube subsample of 501 dad jokes, Study 2 found that both text features (e.g., concreteness, semantic distance, question framing) and topic features (e.g., moms, pregnancy, and numbers) predicted the funniness ratings made by adults (n = 621) much more effectively (cross-validated R2 = 28.2%). Study 3 found that individual differences in people’s funniness ratings were associated with cultural conventionality (e.g., parenthood, more education, affluence, religiosity, and conservatism) and social boldness (e.g., need for uniqueness, low honesty-humility, and boldness; cross-validated R2 = 32.4%), and that dads found the dad jokes funnier. Seemingly simple wordplay humor illuminates the psychology of verbal creativity and extends the psychology of aesthetics into art encounters that provoke feelings of amusement, playfulness, and absurdity. The coded dad jokes are freely available for researchers interested in studying humor or hassling their teenagers.",

Most previous studies simplify tasks to isolate specific variables, creating artificial problems that do not align with those humans have evolved to solve, thus limiting the generalizability of findings. To address this gap, we introduce the Lockbox paradigm: a novel, ecologically valid, and challenging task that promotes active exploration and physical interaction. Data from 91 participants interacting with the Lockbox reveal a remarkable human ability to adapt and solve problems efficiently in complex scenarios. By comparing different interaction methods, we demonstrate the critical role of cost variations, such as physical and cognitive costs, in driving attentiveness and shaping exploration strategies. These findings provide valuable insights into human exploration strategies, with potential applications in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Empirical clustering has identified three distinct personality profiles (over-controlled, under-controlled, and low psychopathology subtypes) among eating disorders, which have predicted clinical outcomes. No prior data-driven subtyping studies have included atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN); thus, it is unclear whether the same personality subtypes emerge within this diagnostic group and similarly predict outcomes. Methods: In this study, undergraduates (N=2384) completed surveys assessing personality, eating disorder, and other psychological symptoms at two timepoints. Participants were classified as having histories of AAN, anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and no eating disorder. Latent profile analysis derived subtypes from personality measures. Regression models determined whether personality subtypes were differentially associated with eating disorder diagnosis and if personality subtype, diagnosis, and their interactions impacted symptoms. Results: Results supported a 3-class solution: Over-controlled (n=243); Under-controlled (n=238); and Low Psychopathology (n=1903) profiles. The Under-controlled subtype predicted AAN and BN diagnoses (ps&lt;.010). Across diagnoses, Time 1 Under-controlled subtype was associated with greater Time 1 depression (p=.017) and alcohol use disorder (p&lt;.001) symptoms and Time 2 binge eating (p=.022). No personality subtype by diagnosis interactions emerged. Conclusions: When including AAN participants, derived personality profiles mirrored prior findings. AAN diagnosis was associated with the Under-controlled subtype; thus, affective regulation may warrant attention in this group. Although personality subtype predicted clinical symptoms, relations did not differ across diagnoses. Integrating personality type into clinical decisions for eating disorders, including AAN, rather than solely relying on diagnostic categories, may inform more precise interventions.",

This cross-sectional population study aims to investigate the prevalence of social disconnection in the general adult population of the Slovak Republic and its associations to socio – demographic/economic and health indicators.\nMethods\nA representative sample of 3006 adults from the Slovak Republic was recruited for this study. Data were collected through standardized questionnaires via face - to - face interviews during November 2024. \nResults\nThe prevalence of social disconnection was found to be 25.3% for loneliness and 19.1% for social isolation. Both lonely and isolated was about 10% of population Significant associations were identified between social disconnection and mental health conditions, with higher levels of loneliness and social isolation linked to increased severity of depression. Several subpopulations showed higher risks of social disconnection.\nConclusion\nThis study highlights the pervasive nature of social disconnection in the Slovak Republic and its substantial impact on both mental and somatic health. Our findings underscore the need for comprehensive national health policies focusing on social disconnection especially in at-risk populations such as elderly women with lower educational attainment, discriminated individuals, individuals in financial strain, and parents on maternity/paternity leave.",

These prime surprisal effects have been found with different age groups and languages. However, previous studies have generally concentrated on datives, while error-based theories suggest that other structures should also be sensitive to prime surprisal. To explore this we carried out a prime surprisal study with transitive as well as dative structures including 114 monolingual English-speaking adult participants. We detected reliable structural priming with both structures and observed a numerical prime surprisal effect in the dative dataset. However, we found no evidence for prime surprisal in the transitive study, where participants showed weaker rather than stronger priming effects after more surprising sentences. We conclude that either prime surprisal effects are only sensitive to overall (but not graded) predictability or that online processing differences between the two structures are behind these results.",

This paper gives an overview of the package, which provides probability density functions as well as high-level functions for fitting parameters to empirical data, prediction of reaction time and response distributions and simulation of artificial data sets. We describe the mathematical specification of the implemented models and give a detailed description of the implemented likelihood functions. In addition, we outline the workflow for applying the model to empirical data step-by-step: data preprocessing, model fitting, model prediction, quantitative model comparison, and visual assessment of model predictions. Finally, we present results from a parameter and model recovery analyses and assess the precision in calculating probability densities, illustrating the reliability of the implemented computations. Offering intuitive usability and high flexibility, the package is targeted at researchers in the fields of decision-making and confidence and does not require expert-level programming skills.",

          "abstract": "Disgust helps humans avoid potentially pathogenic substances such as bodily effluvia. This reduces illness risks, and is difficult to overcome with cognitive strategies or through short-term habituation (minutes to hours). Whether long-term habituation (months to years) exists is an unsolved question. While regular professional exposure to disgust elicitors is associated with lower disgust sensitivity and avoidance, this could reflect selection and survivorship bias. Here, we use the natural quasi-experiment of parenthood: it greatly increases exposure to bodily effluvia, but disgust does not usually inspire individuals to start or stop being a parent. Parents (N=99) and controls (N=50) completed self-report and behavioural avoidance measures. We used parent-specific items in disgust-sensitivity questionnaires, and child-related stimuli (soiled diapers) in a preferential-looking task. These included diapers with pre-weaning (yellow and runny) or post-weaning faeces (adult-like). While the control group showed the expected behavioural avoidance, parents of weaning or weaned children showed almost no avoidance of stimuli depicting child-related or general bodily effluvia. Curiously, parents of pre-weaning children showed similar disgust avoidance to the control group, even if they had older children. These results suggest that parents habituated to disgust induced by faeces in diapers, and that this had generalised to other bodily effluvia. Contrary to our expectations, parents did show disgust avoidance while their (youngest) children were fed only milk, which could point to an adaptive response to reduce the risk of illness in young infants. In sum, after the sensitive milk-feeding stage, continuous exposure to their children’s bodily effluvia inoculates parents to disgust.",

Recent studies indicate that the old naïve, intuitive ideas are not actually replaced but exist alongside the correct but often counterintuitive ones. On this account, newer knowledge for scientific thinking might involve inhibition of the old idea. However, instead of merely inhibiting old ideas, it is possible that switching is necessary to select between new and old scientific ideas. In this study, we explored the direct and indirect contributions of behavioural inhibition, cognitive inhibition and switching to intuitive and counterintuitive science reasoning in adults (N = 167). After replicating the commonly observed processing costs of counterintuitive items relative to intuitive ones, we find that individual differences in switching rather than in inhibition are most strongly associated with variation in the accuracy and speed of adult intuitive and counterintuitive science reasoning. These results suggest that adults switch between older and newer ideas when reasoning about science rather than suppressing one in favour of the other.",

Study 1 (an 18-year global dataset of human+AI chess tournaments) and Study 2 (a three-wave longitudinal study of human+AI renju games) show that individuals have stable human+AI performance over time (controlling for human’s own capability and AI’s capability), suggesting the existence of a stable human+AI capability. Study 3 shows that a general AIQ factor can be statistically extracted from individuals’ performance on a variety of tasks completed with ChatGPT, a more general AI tool. Besides replicating Study 3’s findings in larger samples, Study 4 and Study 5 (preregistered) show that the extracted AIQ factor has both concurrent validity and prospective validity. Regarding concurrent validity, the extracted AIQ factor can predict human+AI performance on a new task using the same AI (ChatGPT) on the same day. Regarding prospective validity, the extracted AIQ factor can predict human+AI performance on other new tasks using different AIs (renju AI or Gemini) in the future. Across studies, we ascertain the unique explanatory power of AIQ by controlling for individual’s IQ, social intelligence (SQ), AI literacy (knowledge about AI), and/or computer literacy. We also explored potential correlates of AIQ (e.g., personality traits, previous AI use, and demographics). Together, our findings suggest that AIQ exists and is measurable. By establishing this new type of intelligence (AIQ), we shed light on individual differences in the ability to use AI, which is increasingly important for individuals, organizations, and society.",

Participants in the intervention condition increased targeted strengths states more than both placebo and waitlist control conditions. However, intervention and placebo participants experienced similar gains in targeted strengths traits, extraversion, and agreeableness, as well as similar decreases in neuroticism relative to the waitlist condition. Thus, some effects may result from non-specific aspects of the structured activity. Informants did not observe any between-condition differences in strengths trait change.

          "abstract": "Stroop effects can be influenced by context-specific cues associated with varying levels of proportion congruency, even for items that occur with equal frequency in each context. This theoretically important result points to the involvement of a cue-driven memory process in the dynamic updating of selective attention. However, attempts to replicate this result have been challenging, potentially due to limitations or confounds in the experimental design, or difficulties in inducing context-specific learning due to the presence of other dominant item-specific cues. The present study aimed to re-evaluate the memory-guided hypothesis using the trial-unique Stroop paradigm, where each trial consists of a unique stimulus and response that never reappear throughout the experiment, thereby preventing trial-to-trial associative regularities. One context was associated with high conflict (20% proportion congruency), and the other with low conflict (80% proportion congruency). The primary finding indicated that trials within the low conflict context exhibited larger congruency effects compared to those in the high conflict context. These results align with the memory-guided selective attention hypothesis, suggesting that selective attention priorities may become associated with contextual cues and are automatically reinstated through a memory retrieval process.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation drives engagement on social media platforms, yet the underlying emotional mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previous studies rely on biased samples and fail to distinguish between discrete emotions, while correlational approaches cannot disentangle the effects of misinformation from confounding factors such as political ideology.  Whether misinformation causally affects online interactions therefore remains an open question. We analyze 9.9M German news tweets and 11M replies on Twitter (Oct 2020–Mar 2022) across news sources of varying trustworthiness. Using machine learning and causal inference methods, we examine whether news trustworthiness influences engagement and emotions in replies.\nDespite comprising only 6% of all news shared, untrustworthy sources receive 39% more retweets, 12% more quote retweets, but 14% fewer likes and 19% replies. Replies to untrustworthy content show 9% more anger, 22% more disgust, and 12% less joy, with anger potentially driven by self-selection. These findings show misinformation leaves distinct fingerprints online, with direct implications for platform design.",

The current study examined the effect of early home-based Parents as Teachers (PAT) intervention, family resources, and home environment on B-SR in kindergarten children from at-risk families in urban high-income European context. The data stem from 248 children from the longitudinal project ZEPPELIN that implemented an RCT design to foster educational opportunities in families with multiple psychosocial risks (73% migrants). Early childhood family resources (economic, cultural, social) and home environment (cognitive stimulation, warmth/responsiveness, physical environment/routines) were assessed in interviews and observations through the Home Observation for Measurement of the Early Childhood Environment (HOME-EC). B-SR was measured with the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders (HTKS) task in the first year of kindergarten (age five). PAT showed an indirect effect on HTKS in kindergarten via cognitive stimulation, while income and maternal education also predicted HTKS. Warmth/responsiveness was neither influenced by PAT nor linked to B-SR. Physical environment/routines trended negatively with HTKS performance. We discuss the implications of the findings for early interventions through developmentally sensitive pathways and highlight meaningful interrelations between broad family resources, home environmental factors, and long-term B-SR outcomes in at-risk families.",

Findings revealed that a more enriching HLE at each wave predicted higher math achievement in each ensuing wave. In turn, children’s math achievement was also prospectively associated with greater enrichment in the HLE over time.

However, there are concerns that these are not meaningfully engaged with –including in relation to restrictive interventions in psychiatric hospitals, which are known to be imposed disproportionately on some patient populations. \nThis study employed a three-stage content analysis to examine EIAs associated with seclusion, restraint, and continuous observation policies in NHS Mental Health Trusts in England. A total of 113 in-date documents were obtained, of which 82% had an EIA. However, 70% of the EIAs denied the possibility of the policy having a disproportionate impact on patients in relation to characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity. The content of most of the documents lacked detail, specificity and clear, tangible actions. However, this is not necessarily a call for more documentation. In isolation, conducting EIAs – or calling for these to be conducted – is insufficient in addressing the harms and injustices associated with coercive and restrictive practices in mental health inpatient settings. More substantial actions and policy change is required.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims. Cannabis is among the most widely used psychoactive substances globally and is often consumed alongside nicotine. Cannabis use has been associated with impairments in attention, learning, and memory, whereas nicotine can acutely enhance, but chronically impair, certain cognitive functions. However, most studies examine cannabis in isolation, leaving the cognitive impact of nicotine co-use unclear. This study aimed to estimate differences in cognitive performance between individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD) and healthy controls, to determine whether cognition relates to heaviness of cannabis use or CUD symptom severity, to test moderation by daily nicotine use, and to assess whether baseline cognition predicts cannabis outcomes one year later. Design. Cross-sectional and one-year longitudinal study. Setting. The Netherlands and Texas, USA. Participants. A total of 231 participants aged 18-30 participated: 130 with CUD (57.7% male) and 101 controls (43.6% male). Measurements. Participants completed tasks assessing interference control, attentional bias, sustained attention, executive functions, emotion recognition, delayed recall memory, working memory, and IQ. Primary outcomes were cognitive task scores; predictors included heaviness of cannabis use, CUD symptom severity, and daily nicotine use. Findings. Compared with controls, individuals with CUD performed worse on interference control (p &lt; .001), immediate recall memory (p = .009), delayed recall memory (p = .013), executive functions (p = .016), estimated IQ (p &lt; .001). Within the CUD group, cognitive performance was unrelated to heaviness of use or CUD severity. Before correction, daily nicotine use moderated the link between CUD severity and working memory (p = .011), with poorer performance observed only among non-nicotine users. Lower attentional bias (p = .027) and sustained attention (p = .023) modestly predicted greater CUD severity at one-year follow-up. Conclusions. CUD was associated with deficits in several cognitive domains independent of use intensity or severity. Nicotine co-use related to relatively better working memory, and attention-related cognition showed limited predictive value for later CUD outcomes.",

Based on these results, we have hypothesized that neural activity during dreaming is mainly driven by sensory experiences (e.g., vision, audition), which predominate our subjective experiences during sleep. Here, we have applied hdEEG (256 electrodes) and the serial awakening paradigm in N2 sleep of 39 participants to study the neural activity during the 30 seconds window preceding each awakening with source localization. We found that having a conscious experience with recall (CE) compared to no experience (NE) is related to increased beta/gamma frequencies in a widely distributed part of the cortex, with peak T-values in posterior occipital-temporal regions (primary and secondary visual cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal cortex). Contrasts also showed increased beta/gamma power in occipital-temporal cortices in high-perceptual dreams compared to NE, while no significant result was found when comparing low-perceptual dreams to NE, suggesting, as expected, that the main result (CE vs NE) is driven by perception. These findings highlight the need to distinguish between different content-specific neural correlates of dreaming.",

It also tests the effects of party cues on the intentions assigned to reformers proposing to alter democratic rules. The results show that (1) the in-party supporters evaluated the intentions to reform checks and balances as benign, whereas the out-party supporters were more vigilant and saw them as malicious; (2) participants were less vigilant of an administrative reform and evaluated it as less ill-intended; (3) these effects held across supporters of different political parties – both incumbent and opposition.

          "abstract": "In contrast to traditional teaching, in problem-solving first followed by instruction (PS-I) approaches students first explore problems with subsequent explicit instruction on the canonical solution. As literature indicates, students' recognition of deep features is crucial for their learning success in PS-I designs. \nIn our PS-I study (12th grade classes, N = 161), as first factor we examined the impact of guidance providing explicit (vs. implicit) deep feature information about the ‘three-finger-rule’ within a computer game-based problem-solving phase. Additionally, we assessed the role of collaboration (individually vs. working in dyads) for learning success as second factor.\nWe revealed a positive effect of collaboration on reproduction, albeit not on near transfer posttest items. Furthermore, no difference between explicit and implicit guidance was found. However, further moderator exploration revealed that students with higher prior knowledge profit most from implicit guidance.  \nAlthough the recognition of deep features is considered crucial in PS-I designs, explicitly providing deep feature information may not universally enhance learning compared to using learning material (like the computer game) that implicitly highlights deep features. Implicit guidance that may provide greater freedom for self-explanation possibly allows students with higher prior knowledge to independently develop beneficial conceptual explanations during the problem-solving phase.",

          "authors": "Nicolas Verger; Vlad Glaveanu",
          "abstract": "This essay examines a detour undertaken in the conceptualisation of creativity, particularly those moving away from a logic of exceptionalism and uniqueness that privileges rupture and disruption. It also interrogates the broader construction of creativity and how this construction has been predominantly economically centred, often to the detriment of ecological systems and habitability. To achieve this, we focus on how the concept of creative preservation enables a redefinition of what counts as creative. That is, we focus on a detour towards a new axiology in creativity research. This shift makes it possible to foreground the social construction of creativity as a process supposed to produce something of value for an individual or a group. The detour through creative preservation thus offers an account of how creative thinking can be applied to sustaining continuity with what we value. This introduces the idea that (a) the application of creative thinking is driven by the perception of reconfiguring what one relates to, and (b) this reconfiguration informs and reflects the value system of those who assess it. This reflection generates several hypotheses about how one might cultivate creative preservation in children – to foster, from a young age, the ability to creatively reconfigure their environment without disrupting it – and how this capacity may contribute to their ecological resilience.",

We evaluate the implementation process through the lens of Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to understand how the documented interventions were adopted and to identify factors influencing its normalisation into routine research practice.\nMethods: A multidisciplinary team implemented an NLP pipeline to automatically extract information on presenting problems, treatments, and outcomes (e.g., engagement, clinical outcomes, side effects) from pseudonymised EHR free-text notes. The implementation followed an iterative seven-phase roadmap: (1) defining research questions; (2) identifying key constructs; (3) co-developing an annotation schema; (4) training human annotators; (5) resolving annotation discrepancies; (6) large-scale annotation of EHR data; and (7) NLP model development and evaluation. Throughout, we applied NPT to guide implementation and evaluate progress. Quantitative outcomes (such as volume of data processed, annotation reliability, and NLP model performance) and qualitative feedback were collected to assess implementation success.\nResults: The NLP intervention was successfully deployed in a real-world clinical research setting, extracted data from 454,127 clinical notes across 5,906 patients. The annotation process achieved a high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff’s α = 0.86; 95% CI 0.83–0.88) after iterative schema refinement, and the trained NLP model demonstrated acceptable accuracy in identifying medications (F1-score = 0.9; 95% CI 0.89, 0.91) and anxiety-related information (F1-score = 0.79; 95% CI 0.77, 0.8).  The NPT-based evaluation revealed that coherence of a shared understanding of the NLP tool’s purpose and value was established among the team. Cognitive participation was generally strong, clinicians and researchers showed growing interest and involvement in the NLP-enabled research workflow. Collective action was facilitated by clear protocols, though challenges such as variability in data quality and the learning curve for new technology impeded smooth operation at times. Through reflective monitoring, the team identified needs for ongoing training and infrastructure improvements. No major adverse event or harm was reported, though additional time was required for data access and computational setup, which considerably extended the project timeline.",

          "abstract": "Attention shapes how information is maintained and retrieved from working memory (WM). Previous research using central retro-cues found no interaction between attentional voluntariness and WM content. However, central and peripheral cues engage attention through distinct mechanisms: evidence from external attention shows that peripheral cues more effectively trigger automatic orienting. This study examined whether that distinction influences how attention modulates perceptual and semantic WM contents. In this preregistered experiment, 100 participants completed two retro-cueing tasks in which peripheral cues directed voluntary or involuntary attention to perceptual (gray vs. sepia) and semantic (natural vs. artificial) features of real-world stimuli competing in WM. Reaction times and accuracy were analyzed with hierarchical drift-diffusion models. Results showed (1) that attentional voluntariness did not differentially affect perceptual versus semantic contents, replicating previous findings; (2) drift rates revealed retro-cueing effects for both voluntary and involuntary attention—voluntary attention produced stronger, cost-driven effects, whereas involuntary attention yielded smaller, benefit-driven ones; and (3) non-decision times showed a similar pattern. Importantly, this involuntary modulation contrasts with results obtained with central cues, where no such effect emerged. These findings indicate that peripheral retro-cues more effectively recruit involuntary attention, automatically reactivating WM representations, and that voluntariness does not interact with WM content type.",

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the scale's underlying dimensions, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure. Additionally, assessments of reliability and validity were performed.\nResults: The ICU-CDS demonstrated a clear multidimensional structure reflecting ICU-specific distress domains. The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.72. The scale also showed satisfactory convergent validity through positive correlations with Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale.\nDiscussion: The ICU-CDS provides a robust, contextually sensitive measure of psychological distress among ICU family caregivers. By capturing specific stressors unique to the ICU setting, this scale addresses limitations of existing general caregiver instruments. Additionally, the scale can also be used to assess distress among ICU patient family caregivers and improve family-centred care in an intensive care setting.\n\n\tKeywords: ICU, distress, caregivers, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, scale development",

          "authors": "Wyatt Thomas Brown; Sydney Kavanaugh; David Skylan Chester",
          "abstract": "Psychopathy is reliably linked to lower empathy. However, this association has focused on negative empathy (i.e., the vicarious experience of others’ distress, pain, and suffering) while neglecting positive empathy (i.e., the vicarious experience of others’ happiness, joy, and pleasure). Across four studies and 1,004 participants (547 U.S. adults from Prolific, 457 diverse undergraduates), antagonistic and disinhibited forms of psychopathy demonstrated stronger negative associations with positive empathy compared to negative empathy. Yet when participants completed a behavioral task that provided participants with opportunities to engage in empathic engagement with virtual strangers, participants exhibited no preference for negative versus positive empathy based on their psychopathic traits. These findings suggest that psychopathy, especially the antagonistic and disinhibited facets thereof, may be more accurately characterized by self-reported tendencies away from positive than negative empathy.",

          "abstract": "Aim\nLarge-scale (online) behavioral experiments are increasingly recognized as essential in psychiatric research based on a transdiagnostic dimensional view of mental disorders. However, advanced programming skills and substantial financial resources are usually needed to conduct such experiments, posing a barrier for new researchers. In this study, we introduce and validate an open-source platform, the Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Assessment Toolbox (CBAT), which enables researchers to conduct large-scale behavioral experiments without the need for advanced programming expertise.\n\nMethods\nTo validate the CBAT, we conducted an online behavioral experiment involving 1,309 Japanese participants. Participants completed four behavioral tasks and eleven self-report questionnaires, including psychiatric symptom scales, all of which can be deployed using the CBAT.\n\nResults\nWe successfully replicated key findings in prior studies that employed the four behavioral tasks. Factor analysis of the questionnaire data revealed three underlying dimensions of psychiatric symptoms—“Self-Regulation Difficulties and Emotional Distress,” “Obsessive-Compulsive,” and “Social Difficulty,” which are broadly consistent with previous findings in psychopathology.\n\nConclusion\nThese findings demonstrate the empirical validity and broad utility of the CBAT. By facilitating behavioral experiments, the CBAT provides a flexible infrastructure to support transdiagnostic psychiatric research and investigations in other related fields. As it does not require advanced programming skills or significant financial resources, the CBAT lowers the barrier to conducting high-quality research and promotes open science in psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Research to date focuses on how people regulate their emotions, but more commonly, people do not regulate their emotions. To understand this phenomenon, we built a bottom-up taxonomy of reasons why people do not regulate. In Study 1a (N=250 UK community members) people who did not regulate during a recent stressful event were asked to describe their reasons. We coded responses to establish a list of 14 reasons, and in Study 1b (N=248 UK community members) presented this list to a new sample who rated their agreement to the reasons relating to a stressful event. Study 2 (N=326 Australian community members) investigated the frequency of reasons for not regulating in everyday life using experience sampling. The most common reasons for not regulating under stress (Studies 1a and 1b) were, believing one’s feelings were valid, not wanting to make things worse, and feeling there was nothing one could do in the situation. The most common reasons for not regulating in daily life (Study 2) were believing one’s feelings were valid, and that regulating didn’t cross one’s mind. In Studies 1b and 2, we tested whether reason endorsement differed based on affect intensity. In times of higher than usual negative affect, people most consistently chose not to initiate emotion regulation because they did not know how. Practically, this work highlights new avenues for intervening to foster emotion regulation, if and when, it is desired. Theoretically, this work highlights the importance of studying emotion regulation as a process that is—and importantly is not—initiated.",

          "abstract": "Climate misinformation has been identified as a barrier to mitigative action. One prominent example occurred when the 2019/2020 “Black Summer” bushfires in Australia were blamed on arson. This claim is cognitively attractive because of its simplicity and was widely publicised at the time, but also thoroughly debunked. In two experiments, we examined the impact of a misleading article implicating arson as the primary cause of the Black Summer fires on Australian (Exp. 1, N = 509) and Canadian (Exp. 2, N = 506) participants’ reasoning, associated donation behaviour, and climate change attitudes. The misinformation significantly influenced reasoning about the Black Summer and future fires in both experiments; it also reduced the donations of Australian participants to a local climate organisation and impacted Canadian participants’ reasoning about a novel, conceptually related (but fictional) flooding event. Corrections were largely effective at mitigating misinformation impact. A bolstered correction that portrayed climate change as an important causal factor through its impact on risks and emphasised the multicausality of natural disasters was more effective than a simple correction that merely refuted the misinformation. Climate change attitudes were largely unaffected by the misinformation and interventions. Our findings demonstrate that event-specific climate misinformation can influence reasoning beyond a specific event, and that corrections are broadly useful for combatting its effects.",

          "abstract": "Positive psychology interventions, such as gratitude practice, claim to substantially improve an individual’s well-being. By focusing on three things one is grateful for each day, gratitude practice may be a promising simple and scalable intervention to support well-being. However, there is mixed evidence of the efficacy of gratitude practice and we lack a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes. Here we develop a computational model of gratitude practice to gain insight into the potential mechanisms of the practice. Employing the active inference framework, we present three simulation results. The first is an instantiation of gratitude practice as the deliberate deployment of high precision (i.e. attention) of three good observations throughout the day. We demonstrate theoretically how agents form their beliefs about their world from the environment they are in, and how these beliefs change positively after gratitude practice. To understand the impact on the agent’s worldview and to connect the modelling results to the empirical literature, we simulate an optimism assessment task before and after the intervention, showing an increase in optimism after gratitude practice. Finally, we simulate a modified version of the Yarbus eye movement task and find that gratitude practice may affect habitual attention patterns, such that agents attend to more positive elements compared to neutral or negative elements in a painting after gratitude practice. Our model provides a conceptual understanding of gratitude practice that can be used in future research to gain insights into who may benefit from gratitude practice, and why some individuals may not.",

          "abstract": "While partisanship is a popular measure for predicting a broad range of political and social variables, its true nature is not well understood, particularly outside the U.S. in multi-party democracies. This study uses a series of open-ended survey questions (Australian sample, N = 81) to inductively examine party evaluation, whether this can lead to identification with parties and for whom. Further, we explore negative partisanship and the nature of political independence. Using qualitative content analysis, we find issues of morality, party effectiveness and value/policy congruence are among the most common factors of positive and negative party evaluation. However, negative attitudes were often directed toward a particular group (not necessarily a political party, e.g. “all left-wing parties”) denoting their most threatening out-group. Most participants claimed not to identify with any political party, due to their values (which some acknowledged a political party represented) being the aspect relevant to their identity, rather than the party itself. Political independents were described in a similar way to previous U.S.-based research, i.e. morally superior and free from party constraints or biases. Overall, our research suggests that more complex measures are required to capture and understand partisanship than what currently exists in political and psychological research.",

          "abstract": "The use of process data such as response time (RT) in psychometrics has generally focused on the relationship between speed and accuracy. The potential relationships between RT and item discrimination remain less explored. In this study, we propose a model for simultaneously estimating the relationships between RT and item discrimination at the person, item, and person-by-item (residual) levels and illustrate our approach through an item-level meta-analysis of 40 empirical datasets comprising approximately one million item responses. We find no evidence of average differences in item discrimination between items of different time intensity or persons of different average RT, while residual RT strongly and negatively predicts item discrimination (pooled coef. = -.29% per 1% difference in RT, SE = .04, tau = .19). While heterogeneity is high, we find little evidence of moderation by overall dataset characteristics. Flexible generalized additive models show that the relationship between residual RT and item discrimination is generally curvilinear, with discrimination maximized just below average RT and minimized at the extremes. Our results suggest that RT data can provide insights into the measurement properties of educational and psychological assessments, but that the relationships between RT and item discrimination are highly variable.",

This study investigated how collaborative versus competitive reward structures influence children's information-seeking behaviour during word learning with a social robot partner. A total of 140 children aged 6–10 interacted with a humanoid robot in a gamified learning task, where they learned and recognized novel object labels under either a collaborative or competitive framework. Results showed robust object-label mapping and flexible adaptation in information sampling aligned to the reward structure; children preferentially sampled the most informative object, with optimal sampling rates increasing with age. Strategic sampling was evident across conditions, but performance was modulated by children's understanding of the reward rules, which was lower in the competitive scenario due to increased task complexity. The findings extend ecological active learning frameworks to embodied, socially interactive settings, underscoring children's ability to tune their learning strategies to both social context and environmental affordances. These insights highlight the need for educational technologies that transparently scaffold reward structures to maximize goal-directed learning.",

          "abstract": "Early identification of startup founders with higher success potential is critical for entrepreneurial finance efficiency. We present a domain-specific framework where founder-specific success characteristics—beyond broad personality traits—account for variance in startup success. The 31-item Startup Founder Success Scale (SFSS) was developed from billionaire-founder autobiographies, mentor interviews, and high-return investor insights, then validated on 10,007 participants (Successful Startup Founders, Corporate Managers, and Aspiring Entrepreneurs). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed six-dimensions—Relentless Resilience, Value-Creating Opportunism, Intrinsic Curiosity, Courageous Decision-Making, Strategic Innovativeness, and Transformational Leadership—explaining 71% of variance in success-relevant characteristics. SFSS yields large effect-size separations (Cohen’s d = 0.83–1.77) between successful founders and comparison groups, substantially exceeding established benchmarks of broad personality models (~10–15% variance; d ~ 0.2–0.5). This 5--7× improvement distinguishes potential for real success from mere intent, reducing false positives. Conceptually, the findings specify a multi-level framework linking founder characteristics to decisions and behaviors under uncertainty, serving as a foundation for future theoretical developments with longitudinal studies. Practically, SFSS offers a validated tool that could potentially enhance investment portfolios by informing early-stage screening for venture capitalists, angel investors, public investment bodies, and innovation funds, while guiding entrepreneurial education and founder training programs.",

          "abstract": "Auditory feedback modulation (AFM) – altering how speakers hear their own voice during phonation – is a well-established method for investigating vocal motor control. Healthy speakers typically respond to AFM with compensatory adjustments in the opposite direction, such as lowering pitch in response to upward pitch shifts. Whether hoarseness-induced auditory feedback elicits comparable compensatory behaviour – specifically, vocal adjustments that enhance acoustic voice quality – remains unknown. To address this gap, the present study pursued two aims: (1) to introduce and evaluate a real-time voice resynthesis system, VQ-Synth, designed to induce the percept of hoarseness in otherwise healthy voices, and (2) to test whether hoarseness-induced auditory feedback leads to compensatory improvements in acoustic voice quality, measured by smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS). In Study 1, participants rated recordings of their own voice processed with four different resynthesis methods. Overall, the anti-peak-window method, which inserted noise between the pitch-related amplitude peaks, produced the strongest percept of dysphonia. In Study 2, this method was applied in an AFM experiment to modulate voice quality in real-time. Participants sustained the vowel /a:/ 140 times. In the AFM group, auditory feedback was modulated according to a phase design (baseline, ramp, hold, after), whereas the control group received unaltered feedback throughout. CPPS in the AFM group increased significantly from baseline through ramp and hold and remained elevated in the after phase, while there was no CPPS increase in the control group. These results indicate that the improvement in acoustic voice quality was not a practice effect but indeed driven by hoarseness-induced AFM. Future work will explore VQ-Synth’s potential in connected speech and its application as a therapeutic tool for individuals with dysphonia.",

          "abstract": "Background: Psychology has struggled to empirically validate complex, holistic systems that produce narrative-based claims. This methodological gap highlights the need for new, more rigorous, and transparent research paradigms. Objective: This paper introduces and validates a novel, fully automated, and open-source framework for testing for weak signals in complex narratives. Using astrology as a challenging case study, we demonstrate a reproducible method for assessing the construct validity of a symbolic system against biographical data. Methods: We programmatically neutralized a library of astrological descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM) to remove all esoteric terminology. We filtered a cohort of 10,707 individuals through a multi-stage, LLM-driven process to a final pool of 4,987 subjects, which we selected for eminence and psychological diversity. We then used independent LLMs as impartial arbiters to perform a series of matching tasks between biographies and personality descriptions. Results: Aggregate analysis revealed a statistically significant but practically negligible signal, creating a statistical tension that motivated a deeper, multi-level analysis. This decomposition uncovered two critical findings: 1) A “Goldilocks effect,” where signal detection peaked at a medium level of task difficulty (k=10), and 2) Extreme heterogeneity across models, with signal detection capability varying by a factor of 575. This demonstrates that framework effectiveness is not universal but requires both a compatible model architecture and optimal task difficulty calibration. Conclusion: This study’s primary contribution is a new, open-science paradigm for psychological research. By demonstrating its utility on a difficult and controversial topic, we provide a robust, methodologically reproducible, and scalable framework for future investigations into complex narrative systems.",

          "abstract": "As a well-established cognitive model of human decision-making, the drift diffusion model (DDM) offers a psychologically intuitive account of the decision-making process by virtue of its four basic parameters. However, the reliance of the DDM on endpoint measures (response times and accuracy) creates a conceptual gap to this process-oriented account, which needs to be bridged with the help of independent process-tracing methods. In this study, we deployed mouse cursor tracking with the aim of validating the psychological interpretation of the basic DDM parameters drift rate, threshold separation, and non-decision time.  In a preregistered replication, 95 participants completed 90 trials of a random dot kinematogram (RDK). Partial least square regression was applied in order to predict the three DDM parameters with the help of 18 cursor measures, which were extracted from the literature. We found support for the psychological interpretation of threshold separation and non-decision time, replicating the results of our previous study, while the analyses of drift rate remained inconclusive. Our results further strengthen our psychological understanding of the DDM, point towards conceptual ambiguities, and encourage further joint application of cognitive models and process-tracing methodology.",

Emotion regulation is a multidimensional construct that is robustly linked to emotional disorders yet remains underexplored in multiple sclerosis (MS), with no studies to date addressing individual differences in emotion regulation difficulties in this population. To address this gap, the current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of emotion regulation difficulties in an MS sample. \n\nMethods. Participants were 259 people with MS (Mage = 42.79, 78.8% female). Participants completed an online survey measuring emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), health anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion regulation was specified as the indicator variable in the LPA, with the additional measures of depression and anxiety utilised to validate the identified profiles.\n\nResults. Three emotion regulation profiles were identified: low impairment (n = 66, 25.48%) characterised by minimal difficulties regulating negative emotions across all domains; global dysregulation (n = 71, 27.41%) characterised by pronounced difficulties in all domains; and goal-impaired regulators (n = 122, 47.10%) characterised by distinct challenges maintaining goal-directed behaviours. Individuals in the global dysregulation profile endorsed the greatest symptom severity on measures of depression and PTSD but reported comparable levels of GAD and health anxiety relative to the goal-impaired regulators.\n\nConclusion. People with MS exhibit distinct emotion regulation profiles, revealing critical subgroups with varying psychological needs. Tailoring psychological assessments and treatments to these profiles can enhance the management of depression and anxiety and potentially improve disease outcomes in people with MS.",

          "abstract": "Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution devices (SSDs) translate images to sounds, enabling a degree of visual perceptual access for visually-impaired and blind individuals. One SSD, The vOICe, converts images into auditory soundscapes using spectral-temporal mappings. Specifically, a pixel’s vertical position translates into pitch and horizontal position into time. This mapping, a priori, is primarily based on technical considerations for preserving image content in human-audible sounds without making claims about intuitiveness, although some literature also invokes crossmodal correspondences in perception, such as pitch for elevation. This presupposition remains to be empirically validated with human subjects. We therefore investigated the efficacy of learning this mapping versus an inverted mapping as well as a single-tone control mapping. Sixty sighted, adult participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups (Traditional, Reversed, or Control) and completed brief learning and evaluation sessions using simplified black-and-white visual stimuli. Both the Traditional and Reversed groups learned mappings within 30 minutes and demonstrated successful recognition of novel stimuli, outperforming the Control group, suggesting that structured mappings facilitate SSD learning. However, there was no evidence of performance or processing time differences between the Traditional and Reversed groups. Mapping pixel position onto spectral-temporal acoustic axes appears flexible. On the one hand, these findings open new possibilities in how SSDs may be rendered bespoke to individual users, specific categories of stimuli, or functionalities (e.g. object recognition, reading, or navigation). On the other hand, indistinguishable performance with different algorithms demonstrates the flexibility in mapping between visual and auditory features, which does not appear anchored to specific notions of cross-modal correspondences.",

          "abstract": "Background: Public health groups have increasingly been adopting a no safe level of alcohol consumption message. We aimed to test how this message affects psychological outcomes relevant for alcohol use and how it compares with a gain-framed message emphasising the benefits of cutting down.\nMethods: Adults who drank alcohol at risky or harmful levels (AUDIT-C ≥ 5; N = 485) were randomised to view one of three messages: Control (n = 165), No safe level (n = 163), or Cutting down (n = 157). Outcomes were problem recognition, defensive processing (message derogation, risk recognition, fear), and self-efficacy. Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, employment status, AUDIT-C score, and drinker identity. Moderation by drinking level was tested using interactions between message condition and AUDIT-C score.\nResults: Compared with the control message, no safe level increased problem recognition (estimate = 0.22, 95% CI [0.03, 0.41]), elicited much stronger fear (0.92, [0.73, 1.11]), and was derogated more (0.89, [0.69, 1.09]). It also reduced self-efficacy (−0.23, [−0.43, −0.02]). Cutting down increased fear also modestly (0.30, [0.10, 0.49]) and lowered self-efficacy (−0.28, [−0.48, −0.08]) but had little effect on problem recognition (0.06, [−0.13, 0.26]) or derogation (0.13, [−0.07, 0.33]). Neither message had a clear effect on risk recognition. When compared directly, no safe level generated more fear than cutting down (estimate = 0.62, 95% CI [0.43, 0.82]) and was derogated more strongly (0.76, [0.56, 0.96]), but any effect on problem recognition was uncertain and likely smaller (estimate = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.35]). There was no clear evidence that effects differed by AUDIT-C score (all interaction p&gt;.13).\nConclusions: The no safe level message increased problem recognition relative to control, though not when compared with cutting down. Compared to cutting down, the no safe level message elicited much greater fear and message derogation. These mixed responses caution against assuming public health benefits of communicating ‘no safe level of alcohol consumption’ type messages.",

          "abstract": "Psychopathology research and treatment is at a crucial juncture. Particularly within the United States, funding for scientific research has been cut drastically; academic freedom is under attack; and efforts to diversify our workforce and mitigate our field's contributions to systemic oppression have been banned outright. Ideologies vie for dominance, with reactionary centrism and institutional capitulation increasingly evident. Gaslighting plays a central role in our politics (academic, national, and beyond), but it is virtually unacknowledged within our science. At the same time, diamonds are formed under pressure. Our collective reckoning brings with it the potential for non-incremental improvements in our ability to assess, diagnose, and treat patients. These improvements arrive in the form of opportunities for paradigm shifts, particularly those involving acknowledging the gaslighting our field perpetuates; resourcefulness in conducting research; values-realignment; coalition-building within and across fields and institutions; and dissemination and outreach.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their perceived task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested whether pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

Usually, our thoughts are able to adapt and reroute in response to our experiences, like a stream in response to a landslide. However, in many clinical conditions, the flexibility of thought is diminished. In this chapter, we use the Dynamic Framework of Thought (Christoff et al., 2016) to discuss characteristic alterations in thought across depression, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We argue that these clinical conditions are marked by strong constraints on thought contents and dynamics, coupled with inflexible neural dynamics. We connect the alterations to thought across these conditions to their underlying neural correlates, demonstrating their overlap with diminished cognitive flexibility. We also present evidence that successful treatment of these conditions may restore flexibility in thought, neural dynamics, and neuroplasticity. This perspective emphasizes the importance of thought dynamics in characterizing cognitive flexibility in mental disorders. Restoring the flexible ebb and flow of thought may be crucial for clinical improvements.",

          "abstract": "The Responses to Positive Affect (RPA) scale is a widely used 17-item self-report measure that assesses positive rumination and dampening, or the tendency to upregulate or downregulate PA, respectively. The RPA includes one dampening subscale and two positive rumination subscales: self- and emotion-focused. Past work has highlighted the theoretical overlap between the two positive rumination subscales, suggesting that they be combined into one overall amplifying subscale. However, there are mixed applications of this in the literature; yet, no factor analyses have been conducted with multiple samples to examine the statistical difference between the 2- and 3-factor solution of the RPA. Thus, the current multi-site design pooled ten datasets in the United States and United Kingdom, with both clinical and non-clinical samples, to statistically evaluate the 2- and 3-factor solutions across all samples (N = 1,995). The current findings indicate that the 3-factor solution (CFI = 0.929, TLI = 0.918, RMSEA = 0.068, SRMR = 0.045) outperformed the 2-factor solution (χ2diff = 140.46, RMSEA = 0.187, p &lt; 0.001) in the 16-item RPA. Further, we found that there were important nuances between the two positive rumination subscales, with each one demonstrating unique associations with psychiatric symptoms and affect that are otherwise not found when combined into a single amplifying subscale. Taken together, our findings provide support for the 3-factor solution across all samples, and future work should further aim to disentangle the two positive rumination subscales from one another given their unique associations with depression, anxiety, anhedonia and affect and affect.",

          "abstract": "Sustained attention is notoriously difficult to maintain over time, with attentional lapses emerging rapidly during prolonged tasks. Motivation has been identified as a key factor in reducing these lapses and enhancing task engagement. According to recent accounts such as the goal competition hypothesis, the perceived benefit associated with a goal helps sustain its active representation in working memory. These benefits can arise from the prospect of gaining a reward, avoiding a penalty, or both. However, it remains unclear whether avoiding a penalty—or the combination of penalty and reward— improved sustained goal maintenance to the same extent as pursuing a reward alone. To address this question, we recruited 30 participants to complete a Continuous Performance Task (CPT) in which the type of benefit associated with the goal varied every 20 trials (reward, penalty, both, or no benefit). Replicating prior findings, we observed that rewards reduced attentional lapses compared to a no-benefit baseline. Avoiding penalties and combining both incentives also improved sustained attention, though the penalty condition was less effective than the combined condition. This suggests that while any perceived benefit can support goal maintenance, the motivational mechanisms may differ depending on the type of benefit—particularly when avoiding penalties alone.",

However, patterns of such self- and child-focused emotion regulation (ER) and their associations with parental exhaustion, children’s internalizing problems, children’s academic achievement, and parent–child relationships remain unexplored. Our preregistered three-wave online study targeted U.S. parents of sixth–ninth graders (N = 1,046; 52% mothers; Mage = 43.22). We employed latent profile analyses and latent transition analyses. Results revealed three profiles of parental self- and child-focused ER strategies, stable across a 4-month timeframe: Reappraisers (T1 ≈ 9%, T2 ≈ 7%) showed high use of self- and child-focused reappraisal, self-ruminators (T1 ≈ 25%, T2 ≈ 31%) reported high self-focused rumination and low use of other strategies, and average regulators (T1 ≈ 66%, T2 ≈ 62%) showed moderate use of all strategies. In addition, reappraisers reported the lowest levels of parental exhaustion and children’s internalizing problems and the highest parent–child relationship closeness. By contrast, self-ruminators reported the highest levels of parental exhaustion and children’s internalizing problems and the lowest parent–child relationship closeness. However, profile membership did not predict children’s academic achievement. The study provides important insights into distinct subgroups of parents on the basis of their combined use of self- and child-focused ER strategies, highlighting the differential impacts of these strategies on parental well-being and child outcomes.

To achieve this goal, I conducted data-driven Bayesian network analysis using data collected from 2,587 college students attending a public university in the Southern United States. In addition to the Bayesian network analysis, I performed a nomological network analysis and an invariance test to support the replicability and generalizability of the findings. The estimated network revealed that empathic traits and purpose were positioned at the top of the prediction network, predicting other variables (i.e., moral identity, reasoning, and growth mindset).

          "abstract": "Objective: Clinical trials play an essential role in evaluating psychological interventions. Owing to limitations of standard analysis of average group-level change when conducted in isolation, it is common for clinical trials to also assess treatments regarding their ability to produce meaningful change for individual patients, known as clinical significance. One feature of clinical significance is the assessment of reliable change, which determines, for each individual, whether they have shown sufficient change to rule out measurement error. However, numerous approaches to assess reliable change have been proposed, and popular methods are underspecified, leading to the potential for inconsistent evaluation of reliable change across studies. Such inconsistencies may render reliable change results incomparable across studies. Methods: Using a methodological scoping review of four clinical psychology journals published between 2020 and 2023, this study evaluated how reliable change is typically operationalized in psychology clinical trials and assessed the impact of different operationalizations on reliable change estimates. Results: Among 226 clinical trials examined, 29 (12.8%) formally assessed reliable change. We identified at least seven distinct operationalizations of this construct, including five distinct operationalizations of the same formula from Jacobson &amp; Truax (1991). Using example data to compute reliable change using each of these operationalizations, the reliable change threshold differed from between 7% and 79%, depending on the specific operationalization. Conclusion: Results show that implementation of reliable change is highly inconsistent in clinical trials, including when ostensibly using the same formula, harming comparability of results across studies.

          "abstract": "Object-based working memory is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows us to encode, store representations of, and use information about objects that are no longer present across short time scales. There is currently a lack of longitudinal research on how this ability develops in infancy. In the present pre-registered study, we used a manual search task, the “Magic Box” task, to assess infants’ ability to represent one or more hidden objects. Across several trials, between 1 and 4 objects were hidden in a box and the number of objects retrieved by the infant on each trial was recorded. Furthermore, on half the trials, 1 object was surreptitiously removed to test whether infants would search longer when they expected 1 more object in the box than was actually in there. The same group of infants completed the task at 10 months (N = 141) and 16 months (N = 75). Results indicated that the capacity to represent objects in working memory increased between 10 months (~1 object) and 16 months (~2 objects). Both age groups searched longer when an object had been secretly removed than when no objects were removed. Increased capacity was also demonstrated by 16-month-olds searching the box significantly longer than 10-month-olds on trials with one object missing, indicating a stronger representation of the ‘missing’ object. However, performance at 10 months was not predictive of performance at 16 months, suggesting instability in individual differences in object-based working memory capacity across this period.",

          "abstract": "Mental speed is a multidimensional construct that encompasses three distinct time-related measures: reaction time, processing speed, and tempo, the latter of which is defined as the rate at which individuals respond to items varying in difficulty. This study applies van der Linden’s (2007, 2009) hierarchical model to jointly analyze item responses and response times from 1,467 adults taking the nine core subtests of the Reasoning and Intelligence Online Test (RIOT; https://riotiq.com). Using Bayesian estimation of the van der Linden model, results showed strong model fit across subtests, with weak correlations between examinee ability and examinee tempo for verbal tasks (r = -.204 to .309) and stronger negative correlations for visuospatial tasks (r = -.508 to -.774), supporting predictions from dual process theory. Item intensity positively correlated with response times with difficulty on most subtests, indicating that item characteristics were the cause of longer response times for more difficult items. Few examinees (2.5%) exhibited dual misfit in responses and times, but the Figure Weights subtest revealed anomalous slow responding. These findings demonstrate that tempo (i.e., examinee response times) is independent of cognitive ability level and that correlations between the two are spuriously caused by item characteristics.

To address this, we introduce the Ecosystem of Love Science framework—a meta-theoretical model that conceptualizes love as a dynamic, interdependent system rooted in shared philosophical, biological, and cultural foundations.

Interleaved practice, defined as mixing different problem types from the same domain within one practice session, has often been shown to enhance learning outcomes. However, its effectiveness for highly complex material and for learners with lower prior knowledge remains unclear. To address this question, a field-experimental study was conducted with 176 high school students, who were randomly assigned to either an interleaved or a blocked practice condition. Students worked on tasks involving the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, a demanding physics topic. Learning success was assessed with an immediate and a delayed knowledge test. The results showed a significant interaction between prior knowledge and practice condition. The relative effectiveness of interleaving increased with higher prior knowledge, whereas the lower the prior knowledge, the more favorable blocked practice appeared. This interaction effect was no longer present in the delayed test after 8 weeks. The findings suggest that the benefits of interleaved practice depend on learners' prior knowledge, particularly when dealing with highly complex material.",

However, its effectiveness appears to diminish when learning material becomes too complex, likely due to increased cognitive load.\nAims: This study investigates whether collaborative learning can enhance the effectiveness of interleaved practice when students engage with complex physics content.\nSample: A total of 376 upper secondary students (Grade 12/13) participated in the study.\nMethods: A 2×2 between-subjects field experiment was conducted with four conditions (interleaved vs. blocked practice × collaborative vs. individual learning). The instructional content focused on the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields. Learning success was assessed through knowledge tests administered immediately after practice and after an 8-week delay. \nResults: The combination of interleaved practice and collaboration led to the highest learning gains, both immediately and after 8 weeks. There was no overall benefit of collaboration. Interleaving showed no main effect on immediate learning success and even a negative main effect on delayed learning success.\nConclusions: The findings suggest that collaboration mitigates the cognitive demands of interleaved practice, enabling its benefits to unfold even in complex learning contexts. The results highlight that desirable difficulties are not universally effective but require appropriate instructional support. Combining interleaved practice with collaborative learning emerges as a powerful strategy to foster lasting conceptual understanding in science education.",

Despite well-documented issues of validity and reliability with polygraphs, they continue to be used in various stages of the legal system.

          "abstract": "A majority of memory research examines a single or a few factors that influence memory, but a broader perspective is needed to form a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of memory. Broadly, prior work has largely focused on observer effects (e.g., individual differences, internal states) and environmental effects (e.g., task, context), with only more recent work focusing on item effects (e.g., the typicality or memorability of stimuli). Here, I analyze 6,223,953 memory decisions made by 13,946 participants on a continuous recognition task for 26,107 naturalistic object images to test how these different factors influence long-term episodic memory. The individual subject and the memorability of the stimulus emerge as the most important factors for predicting successful hits, with surprisingly little influence of the experimental context. In contrast, while less variance is captured by these factors for false alarms, a wider variety of factors are important, including image factors, observer factors, and experimental context. These results suggest that much of what drives our memory is shared and predictable, and demonstrate the need for more research that focuses on multiple factors simultaneously in more representative and naturalistic tasks.",

          "abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is often praised for its ecological validity, under the assumption that change observed in EMA data reflects change in the underlying constructs, independent of study participation. However, participation itself may threaten ecological validity as participants’ involvement in an EMA study may already alter their experiences, behavior or responses. Existing research on such participation effects has primarily documented their occurrence rather than explained the mechanisms through which they arise. To advance this understanding, we developed a taxonomy of potential sources of (measurement-induced) change in EMA data. This taxonomy includes increased reflection on assessed constructs (i.e., measurement reactivity), alterations to daily routines (i.e., measurement interference), shifts in how participants interpret items or response scales (i.e., reconceptualization or recalibration), practice in gauging internal states (i.e., improved introspection), and declining participant engagement (i.e., heightened careless responding or reduced compliance). Identifying these distinct sources of change highlights the need for systematic investigation of their impact and the development of targeted mitigation strategies. We therefore outline a research agenda focusing on assessing and experimentally manipulating each source of measurement-induced change in isolation. In sum, this paper aims to initiate a collective effort among EMA researchers to clarify the mechanisms by which study participation shapes data, and to safeguard EMA’s promise of ecological validity. \n\nKeywords: experience sampling methodology, measurement reactivity, (ecological) validity, response shifts, careless or insufficient effort responding",

          "authors": "Sara Bogels; Tianyi Li; Marlou Rasenberg; Lotte Eijk; Ivan Toni; Wim Pouw",
          "abstract": "A drive towards efficiency seems to regulate communicative processes and ultimately language change. In line with efficiency principles, signed, spoken, and/or gestural utterances tend to reduce in overall effort over repeated referrals in referential tasks. Although theories generally assume multimodality and interaction, this process has mostly been operationalized as individual effort in a single communicative modality. Here we seek to understand reduction of communicative effort in its natural environment, i.e. during multimodal and collaborative face-to-face dialogues about displaced referents. We ascertain that the reduction in joint effort (y) over repeated referrals (x) follows a negative power relationship, y=a*x^c, where a and c are constants. This reduction in communicative effort is multimodal, occurring across gesture, speech, prosody, and turn taking, and it is interactive, based on joint effort. The pattern is robust, being confirmed through reanalyses of published datasets about (individual) effort reduction. Crucially, the pattern is communicatively relevant. The coefficient of the power relationship predicts change and convergence in interlocutors’ conceptualizations of the communicative referents over the interaction. The negative power relationship reflects therefore how effort translates into mutual understanding - a process we call communicative work. We suggest that the power function captures an exploration-exploitation trade-off during human dialogue which emerges from multiscale processes. Joint conceptualization of novel referents benefits from early conceptual exploration followed by later exploitation of selected signals. The current report proposes a novel ‘power law of joint communicative work’ that is relevant for linguistic theory, agent-based modeling, and experimental psychology.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Problematic usage of the internet (PUI) is a growing concern in young adults. Mobile-based approach bias modification (ApBM) has proven efficacious; however, individual differences in intervention response remain poorly understood. This exploratory analysis examined baseline participant characteristics as potential moderators and predictors of outcome following mobile-based ApBM (PROTECTapp) to reduce PUI in university students. Methods: Based on data of 92 university students (Mage = 22.00 years, 69.6% female) with elevated PUI who were randomized to PROTECTapp (n = 45) or a waitlist control group (n = 47), we examined age, baseline PUI severity, motivation to change, comorbid internalizing symptoms, procrastination, and positive intervention expectancies as potential moderators and predictors of PUI (Compulsive Internet Use Scale, CIUS) and adherence at post-intervention. Results: Baseline PUI severity significantly moderated intervention efficacy (b = -0.42, SE = 0.20, p = .040), indicating stronger effects among individuals with higher initial symptom severity. No significant moderating effects emerged for other potential moderators. In a combined cross-over sample, higher baseline PUI severity (aOR = 1.37, p &lt; .001) and younger age (aOR = 0.67, p = .011) predicted greater likelihood of reliable improvement, while adherence was higher in younger participants (b = -2.43, SE = 1.01, p = .019) and those with higher internalizing symptoms (b = 2.68, SE = 1.24, p = .033). Conclusion: Mobile-based ApBM appears particularly effective for young adults with more severe PUI, supporting targeted rather than universal prevention approaches. Other baseline factors did not influence efficacy, underscoring broad applicability across diverse student populations.",

          "abstract": "Mental Workload (MWL) refers to the specification of information processing capacity used for maintaining task performance. Some studies find no effects of high MWL on the timing and quality of takeovers, whilst others have found increases in crash risk and delayed response times. The effect of time budget – the time between event onset and an impending crash - is much clearer; drivers react faster when time budgets are smaller. However, no study has investigated whether the effects of a pure MWL interact with the effects of time budget during critical takeovers from a hands-off Level 2 (L2) driving system. A Bayesian multilevel modelling approach was used to quantify the direction, size, and uncertainty of the effects that MWL and time budget have on driver performance. Drivers (N = 37) used a hands-off L2 driving system: once while completing a pure MWL task (2-back) and another while monitoring the road. Rear-end conflicts were generated via lead vehicles decelerating with short (TTC = 3 s) or long (TTC = 5 s) time budgets. 2-back-induced MWL had no consistent or substantial impact on the timing or quality of takeovers. Conversely, drivers were faster to respond but more erratic in their post-takeover lateral control following events with smaller time budgets. We discuss the reasons for the absence of effects from the 2-back-induced MWL on takeover performance. One suggestion is that rear-end scenarios elicit automatised behaviours that do not rely upon cognitive control and thus remained unaffected by MWL. Conversely, scenarios that require cognitive control (e.g., lane change manoeuvres or hazard perception tasks) may be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of MWL during transitions of control.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescence, particularly for girls, is a period of heightened risk for depressive symptoms and increased interpersonal stress. Although depressive symptoms and problematic interpersonal behaviors are known to co-occur, prior work has predominantly examined between-person associations, leaving within-person processes unclear. This study addressed this gap by testing longitudinal within-person associations between depressive symptoms and problematic interpersonal behaviors in adolescent girls over four years, evaluating whether links were reciprocal or unidirectional. Methods: Participants included 543 adolescent girls from the Pittsburgh Girls Study. At ages 16, 17, 18, and 19, girls self-reported depressive symptoms and eight types of problematic interpersonal behaviors: domineering, vindictive, cold, socially avoidant, non-assertive, exploitable, overly nurturant, and intrusive. For each interpersonal behavior, we fit both constrained and unconstrained random-intercept cross-lagged panel models and selected the constrained model unless it demonstrated a significantly poorer fit than the unconstrained model, prioritizing parsimony. Results: The selected models demonstrated good fit for all eight interpersonal behaviors. Within-person increases in depressive symptoms predicted subsequent within-person increases in overly nurturant and socially avoidant behaviors, whereas these behaviors did not predict subsequent within-person increases in depressive symptoms. By contrast, depressive symptoms and domineering behaviors reciprocally predicted one another over time. Conclusions: This study clarifies how depressive symptoms and interpersonal behaviors influence one another over time within individuals in adolescent girls. Findings highlight domineering behaviors as a potential intervention target for breaking cycles of mutual reinforcement with depressive symptoms. Moreover, addressing depressive symptoms may yield social benefits by reducing subsequent overly nurturant and socially avoidant behaviors.",

Participants identified the personality aspect they wanted to change most, reported their motivation and success in implementing changes over 14 daily diaries, and indicated trait changes across two months. Findings revealed that most adolescents wanted to become more confident, sociable, or composed.

          "abstract": "Objective: Problematic usage of the internet (PUI) has been linked to impaired mental health and academic functioning in young adults. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a 3-week mobile-based approach–avoidance task (AAT) training (PROTECTapp) for reducing PUI in university students. Method: Ninety-two participants (Mage = 22.00 years, 69.6% female) with elevated levels of PUI were randomized to the PROTECTapp intervention (n = 45) or a waitlist control group (n = 47). Primary outcomes were PUI severity and internet-related craving. Secondary outcomes included motivation to change, psychopathological symptoms and academic functioning. Participants were assessed at baseline and postintervention; the intervention group completed additional 3- and 12-week follow-ups. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated greater reductions in PUI following the PROTECTapp intervention compared to the waitlist (p = .003; d = -0.80, 95% CI [-1.23, -0.38]). No significant effects emerged for craving or broader psychological outcomes (ps &lt; .05), though favorable effects were observed on motivation to change (ambivalence: p = .020; d = -0.24, 95% CI [-0.65, 0.17]; taking steps: p = .002; d = 0.45, [0.04, 0.87]). Satisfaction with the intervention was moderate (M = 18.32 of 32), and participants completed on average 35.52 training sessions. Adverse events were reported infrequent (7.1%). Conclusion: PROTECTapp is a promising mobile-based intervention to reduce PUI and enhance motivation to change in young adults. Its brevity, scalability, and safety profile highlight its potential as a low-threshold preventive or adjunctive intervention for young individuals at-risk.",

Although commonly used by other social scientists, this tool remains largely unknown to psychologists. To address this issue, we offer a pedagogical primer tailored for this audience, complete with R, Stata, and SPSS scripts. This primer is organized into three parts. In PART 1, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to clustered cross-sectional data. We introduce the concepts of ‘cluster dummies’ and ‘demeaning,’ and provide scripts to estimate the within-school association between sports and depression in a fictional dataset. In PART 2, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to longitudinal data, and provide scripts to estimate the within-participant association between sports and depression over time in a fictional four-wave dataset. In this part, we cover three additional topics. First, we explain how to calculate effect sizes and offer simulation-based sample size guidelines to detect within-participant effects of plausible magnitude with sufficient power. Second, we show how to test two possible interactions: between a time-invariant and a time-varying predictor, and between two time-varying predictors. Third, we introduce three relevant extensions: first-difference modeling (estimating changes from one wave to the next); time-distributed fixed-effects modeling (estimating changes before, during, and after an individual event); and within-between multilevel modeling (estimating both within- and between-participant associations). In PART 3, we discuss two limitations of fixed-effects modeling: time-varying confounders and reverse causation. We conclude with reflections on causality in nonexperimental data.",

Based on these results, we have hypothesized that neural activity during dreaming is mainly driven by sensory experiences (e.g., vision, audition), which predominate our subjective experiences during sleep. Here, we have applied hdEEG (256 electrodes) and the serial awakening paradigm in N2 sleep of 39 participants to study the neural activity during the 30 seconds window preceding each awakening with source localization. We found that having a conscious experience with recall (CE) compared to no experience (NE) is related to increased beta/gamma frequencies in a widely distributed part of the cortex, with peak T-values in posterior occipital-temporal regions (primary and secondary visual cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal cortex). Contrasts also showed increased beta/gamma power in occipital-temporal cortices in high-perceptual dreams compared to NE, while no significant result was found when comparing low-perceptual dreams to NE, suggesting, as expected, that the main result (CE vs NE) is driven by perception. These findings highlight the need to distinguish between different content-specific neural correlates of dreaming.",

          "abstract": "Depression is a leading mental health concern among children and adolescents, —90% of whom live in developing countries. Accurate measurement of depression in this population is a crucial step toward effective research, diagnosis, and intervention. Although rating scales for children and adolescents are widely used by researchers, clinicians, and large-scale surveys, their heterogeneity in developing contexts has been largely overlooked. To fill the gap, we analyzed the content of 27 Chinese depression scales and self-report data from four commonly used scales (N = 12,764). Our content analysis identified 84 unique symptoms across the 27 scales and low rate of overlap (mean = 0.19, range: 0.09–0.25), suggesting that instruments often assumed to be comparable capture distinct symptom domains. Moreover, few scales included cultural- or age-specific symptoms, suggesting a lack of cultural- or age-adaptation. Analyses of self-report data showed that the four scales produced different detection rates and each identified unique cases. Exploratory Graph Analysis revealed that their items clustered into three distinct symptom communities rather than a unified construct. These findings indicate that depression scales for children and adolescents are not interchangeable and highlight the need for harmonization efforts. Achieving a balance between standardization and contextual adaptation is essential for improving the validity and comparability of depression measurement in global mental health research.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the proportion of individuals who remain single in affluent countries. Considering that romantic relationships have been associated with higher subjective well-being (SWB) in cross-sectional and panel data, this is a potentially worrying trend. However, it is yet unknown if these differences are reflected in the daily dynamics of SWB when comparing single and partnered individuals. Using daily diary data over four months, we compared differences in day-to-day dynamics of SWB in two propensity-score matched samples of singles (n = 85) and partnered individuals (n = 85), consisting primarily of young, female university students. Although equal in trait levels of psychological distress, we found that single individuals experience lower average levels of daily SWB as well as higher variability and instability in SWB variables, compared to partnered individuals, but no differences in resistance to change in SWB (i.e., inertia) could be observed. When analyzing individual components of SWB, singles and partnered individuals differed primarily in negative affect but not in positive affect. Furthermore, singles had greater difficulty in recovering from accumulating negative experiences compared to partnered individuals. Being in a romantic relationship is associated with both higher average levels and stability in daily SWB compared to being single. Both groups experienced decrements in SWB when they spent less time with their social support networks, highlighting the importance of having alternative strategies for handling negative experiences. Singles may also be more accustomed to significant volatility in SWB compared to partnered individuals, thus, considering expected dynamics when determining the magnitude of a problem in clinical practice is of importance.",

          "authors": "Hudson Golino",
          "abstract": "Language conveys meaning through structures that range from concrete description to abstract generalization. This study introduces a computational framework for measuring linguistic depth by quantifying the algorithmic complexity of semantic networks derived from large language model embeddings. Building on Piagetian and Vygotskian theories of cognitive development, this study propose that abstraction, whether in thought, measurement, or language, reflects the compression of distributed information into coherent, generative structures. We operationalize this principle using Kolmogorov complexity, K(G), estimated via the compressed length of network edge lists. Simulation studies demonstrate that networks derived from factor-structured data exhibit significantly lower K(G) than density-matched random controls, with separation accuracy reaching 94% as factor loadings strengthen. In a controlled linguistic experiment comparing 100 pairs of abstract and concrete phrases matched for syntax and length, abstract expressions produced consistently lower algorithmic complexity (M = 726) than concrete expressions (M = 784), t(194.41) = -3.28, p = .001, d = -0.46. These findings establish that semantic abstraction manifests as network compressibility, i.e., abstract language achieves conceptual depth through structural regularity rather than elaborative detail. The framework unites psychometric network theory, complexity science, and computational linguistics under a single information-theoretic principle, offering a model-agnostic measure of abstraction applicable across psychological networks, natural language, and neural representations. By formalizing the intuition that profound expression achieves economy through structure, K(G) provides both theoretical insight into how meaning is organized and practical methodology for assessing semantic depth in text, psychological data, and artificial intelligence systems.",

We evaluate the implementation process through the lens of Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to understand how the documented interventions were adopted and to identify factors influencing its normalisation into routine research practice.\nMethods: A multidisciplinary team implemented an NLP pipeline to automatically extract information on presenting problems, treatments, and outcomes (e.g., engagement, clinical outcomes, side effects) from pseudonymised EHR free-text notes. The implementation followed an iterative seven-phase roadmap: (1) defining research questions; (2) identifying key constructs; (3) co-developing an annotation schema; (4) training human annotators; (5) resolving annotation discrepancies; (6) large-scale annotation of EHR data; and (7) NLP model development and evaluation. Throughout, we applied NPT to guide implementation and evaluate progress. Quantitative outcomes (such as volume of data processed, annotation reliability, and NLP model performance) and qualitative feedback were collected to assess implementation success.\nResults: The NLP intervention was successfully deployed in a real-world clinical research setting, extracted data from 454,127 clinical notes across 5,906 patients. The annotation process achieved a high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff’s α = 0.86; 95% CI 0.83–0.88) after iterative schema refinement, and the trained NLP model demonstrated acceptable accuracy in identifying medications (F1-score = 0.9; 95% CI 0.89, 0.91) and anxiety-related information (F1-score = 0.79; 95% CI 0.77, 0.8).  The NPT-based evaluation revealed that coherence of a shared understanding of the NLP tool’s purpose and value was established among the team. Cognitive participation was generally strong, clinicians and researchers showed growing interest and involvement in the NLP-enabled research workflow. Collective action was facilitated by clear protocols, though challenges such as variability in data quality and the learning curve for new technology impeded smooth operation at times. Through reflective monitoring, the team identified needs for ongoing training and infrastructure improvements. No major adverse event or harm was reported, though additional time was required for data access and computational setup, which considerably extended the project timeline.",

Existing studies often conflate tactile contact with visual or auditory cues, obscuring the neural mechanisms and temporal dynamics of emotional state transmission. Here we isolated tactile channel in pairs of participants who engaged in handholding while one partner (Sender) viewed emotional videos and the other (Receiver) was visually and acoustically isolated. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning revealed that touch aligned partners’ arousal states, enhanced receivers’ sensitivity to emotional cues, and strengthened prefrontal inter-brain synchrony (IBS). Crucially, mediation analyses showed that under the touch level, prefrontal IBS predicted receivers’ arousal estimates, which in turn predicted their emotional sensitivity (d'), indicating a touch-specific indirect pathway through arousal alignment. Time-resolved analyses further revealed that neural activity in the Sender's prefrontal cortex, particularly inferior frontal gyrus, preceded Receiver neural responses by approximately 16 s. \nThese findings reveal a neural mechanism by which embodied contact sequentially aligns emotional states through prefrontal coupling. By elucidating how touch embeds emotional meaning within a shared neural space, our findings advance an embodied account of human communication and provide a biological foundation for developing emotionally attuned, socially embedded artificial intelligence.",

Tanzanian participants (N=103) evaluated utilitarian agents in moral dilemmas, either in native Chagga or foreign Swahili. Agents were rated significantly more moral and brave when evaluated in a foreign language. Bravery predicted morality more strongly in the foreign language than in the native language. Indirect sacrifices were judged more moral than direct ones, but equally brave. These findings extend the moral foreign language effect to informally acquired languages and highlight methodological implications for cross-cultural research.",

Regression models revealed that negative attitudes towards AI and perceived threats to employment were key predictors of heightened fear, while greater usage and familiarity were linked to reduced fear. We also present a short 4-item version of the scale generated by a genetic algorithm and tested with 101 new participants which presents good psychometric properties. \n\nThe FTGAI scale addresses a critical measurement gap and offers a comprehensive tool for researchers and policymakers seeking to understand and mitigate fears towards generative AI’s growing societal impact.",

We investigated whether this adaptation is primarily driven by recently experienced volatility in task demands, or can also be shaped by learned, environmental knowledge indicating expected levels of volatility. To this end, we trained participants on a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test task where different environments required different speeds of task rule updating. We demonstrate that, initially, participants adopted task rule updating strategies depending on the most recent experienced levels of volatility and feedback (Experiment 1). However, after extensive (four days) training (Experiment 2), participants updated task rules using strategies based on developed environmental knowledge. We also show how participants fine-tuned their task rule updating strategies over learning. In sum, our findings provide important insights into how humans update task rules using different strategies and highlight the importance of multi-day training in developing environmental knowledge for the regulation of cognitive control.",

          "abstract": "Reputation is a central mechanism for sustaining cooperation in human societies, yet–unlike in typical theories and most experimental setups–real-world reputational information about others’ past behavior is often noisy, delayed, or deliberately manipulated, raising the question of whether cooperation can survive when reputational signals are unreliable. We experimentally study how cooperation evolves when individuals can strategically manipulate their public image and whether allowing others to verify such information can counteract manipulation and restore cooperation. As a benchmark, we replicate a standard repeated network cooperation game in which participants observe one another’s past actions and freely choose partners for future interactions. This baseline produces stable, high levels of cooperation driven by conditional association and reputation-based reciprocity. When participants can manipulate information about their past behavior at a cost, manipulation becomes widespread and cooperation collapses. Introducing the option to verify others’ reputations does not prevent this decline: verification is infrequent, poorly targeted, and insufficient to restore reliable reputational information. Consequently, cooperation disappears even when truth-checking is possible. These findings expose the vulnerability of reputation-based cooperation to strategic distortion and highlight the crucial role of trustworthy, verifiable reputation systems. This fragility is magnified in the modern digital era, where profit-driven communication technologies and social media make distortion, selective presentation, and manipulation of information cheap and widespread. Such dynamics foster the spread of disinformation, including fake news, climate change denial, and vaccine refusal, undermining collective efforts to address global challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and pandemics.",

          "abstract": "Attention shapes how different types of information are maintained and retrieved from working memory (WM). Previous research examined whether the voluntariness of attention interacts with the type of content in WM using central arrow retro-cues, but found no such interaction. However, central and peripheral cues engage attention through different mechanisms: evidence from external attention shows that peripheral cues are more effective in triggering automatic orienting. Determining whether this distinction influences how attention modulates perceptual and semantic WM contents is essential for clarifying how voluntary and involuntary mechanisms operate on internal representations. In this pre-registered study, 100 participants completed two retro-cueing tasks in which peripheral retro-cues directed voluntary or involuntary attention toward perceptual (gray vs. sepia colors) and semantic (natural vs. artificial categories) features of real-world stimuli competing in WM. Reaction time and accuracy were analyzed using hierarchical drift-diffusion models. Results showed, first, that attentional voluntariness did not differentially affect perceptual vs. semantic WM contents, replicating a previous finding. Second, drift rates revealed retro-cueing effects for both voluntary and involuntary attention: voluntary attention produced stronger effects, primarily driven by costs, whereas involuntary attention yielded smaller effects, mainly driven by benefits. Third, non-decision times showed a similar pattern—larger effects (benefits and costs) for voluntary attention, and smaller, benefit-based effects for involuntary attention. Crucially, this involuntary modulation contrasts with previous findings using central retro-cues, where no such effect was observed. Together, these findings suggest that, prior to decision making, peripheral spatial retro-cues more effectively recruit involuntary attention, automatically reactivating WM representations when cue locations overlap with memoranda. Moreover, the results strengthen the view that voluntariness does not interact with the type of WM content when perceptual and semantic features compete for representation.",

We investigate integration from both a sociological (academic and social integration) and a psychological perspective (self-congruence), to better converge these perspectives in understanding the integration process. 135 first-year university students participated in a daily diary study spanning one week. The data was analyzed through linear mixed-effects models. We found that daily competence satisfaction and studying alone were positive predictors of academic integrations. For social integration, we found that daily autonomy, studying alone, and end-of-the-week (day 5) were a negative predictor, whereas daily relatedness, and participating in lectures and seminars were positive predictors. For self-congruence, competence and relatedness were positive predictors. Our findings show that there are different mechanisms leading to different forms of integration and potential dynamics between different forms of integration, suggesting that integration is multidimensional and broader in nature than generally operationalized.",

          "abstract": "Emotional events are remembered better than neutral ones. While many human neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions involved, relatively few—and typically small—studies have disentangled how arousal and valence shape the neural substrates of this enhancement. We leveraged a large single-centre fMRI sample (n=1006) in which healthy young adults viewed negative, neutral, and positive pictures during scanning followed by an unannounced free-recall test. Using whole-brain subsequent-memory analyses (PFWE&lt;.05), we contrasted successful encoding of emotional (negative + positive) vs neutral items, then tested valence-specific effects (successful encoding: negative &gt; neutral; positive &gt; neutral), and finally controlled for subjective arousal via serial parametric modulation. Behaviourally, recall was higher for emotional than neutral pictures. Consistent with prior meta-analytic evidence, emotional &gt; neutral successful encoding engaged occipito-temporal visual cortex, anterior cingulate, insula, and amygdala. Additionally, we observed an extensive temporoparietal network, while hippocampal/parahippocampal activations were absent. After controlling for arousal, amygdala and insula effects were no longer significant, indicating these regions were sensitive to arousal rather than valence. Overlap of negative- and positive-valence enhancement localised primarily to the occipito-temporal cortex. Negative-specific enhancement recruited the lateral occipital/fusiform and bilateral supramarginal regions; positive-specific enhancement involved the rostral/caudal anterior cingulate, superior frontal, and parietal cortex, as well as the precuneus. Successful neutral encoding preferentially engaged frontoparietal control regions and bilateral lingual/parahippocampal cortex. Together, these findings dissociate valence-dependent from arousal-dependent mechanisms and reveal both partially overlapping and distinct networks for negative and positive memory enhancement, refining neurocognitive models of emotional memory encoding.",

          "authors": "Umerasundasu Horii",
          "abstract": "Digital environments have reconfigured the psychological architecture of identity.  Classical theories of selfhood, from Erikson’s (1968) psychosocial model to McAdams’s (1993) life-story framework, position the individual as the primary author of identity; integrating memory, motivation, and reflection into a coherent narrative.  Yet identity formation now unfolds within predictive systems that record, rank, and respond to expression.  This paper introduces Delegated Personhood, a sociotechnical framework describing how authorship of the self becomes distributed between human cognition and algorithmic optimization processes.  Integrating self-determination theory (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017), cognitive feedback models (Conway &amp; Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), and digital sociology (Bucher, 2018; van Dijck, 2020), the model specifies five mechanisms, algorithmic identity fragmentation, mimicry under perceptual surveillance, autonomy attenuation, identity fatigue, and chrono-social drift, through which predictive feedback loops reshape perceived agency.  Each mechanism is linked to empirical analogues in motivation, social influence, and temporal cognition.  Delegated Personhood defines co-authorship as the point at which algorithmic feedback materially alters self-categorization, producing measurable shifts in coherence, volitional clarity, and temporal continuity.  The framework reframes identity as a hybrid system of human intention and computational inference, advancing testable propositions for social-psychological research in algorithmically mediated contexts.                                                                                                \n    Keywords: delegated personhood, identity, algorithmic authorship, self-determination, digital environments, autonomy",

          "authors": "Hao Qin; Rafael C. Gonçalves; Courtney Michael Goodridge; Natasha Merat",
          "abstract": "The implementation of Partially Automated Driving (PAD) systems is increasingly common in consumer vehicles. While these systems support longitudinal and lateral vehicle control, they still require drivers to monitor the environment and intervene when necessary. Therefore, drivers must continue to allocate their visual attention effectively and remain aware of potential hazards. However, increased engagement in non-driving-related activities (NDRAs) has been observed during PAD. While the detrimental effects of visual-manual NDRAs on drivers’ visual attention during PAD is well-established, the impact of cognitively demanding NDRAs that take drivers’ mind off but allow their eyes to remain on the roadway is poorly understood. It is also unclear how the effects of cognitive load vary across automation levels. A driving simulator study was conducted to examine drivers’ visual attention under cognitive load, induced by a 2-back task, during both manual driving and PAD. An urban section of road, with a range of vehicles and other road users as potential hazards, was used to study drivers’ allocation of attention. Results indicated that, during PAD, drivers adopted a broader visual search strategy, directing more attention to the peripheral driving environment. However, drivers’ visual search was more restricted under cognitive load, with attention concentrated on the road ahead, accompanied by fewer and shorter glances to the periphery, regardless of driving mode. These findings add knowledge on how cognitively demanding NDRAs affects drivers’ visual attention, under different driving automation levels, and highlight the need for targeted countermeasures to ensure drivers safely monitor PAD and the driving environment.",

          "abstract": "Object-based working memory is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows us to encode, store representations of, and use information about objects that are no longer present across short time scales. There is currently a lack of longitudinal research on how this ability develops in infancy. In the present pre-registered study, we used a manual search task, the “Magic Box” task, to assess infants’ ability to represent one or more hidden objects. Across several trials, between 1 and 4 objects were hidden in a box and the number of objects retrieved by the infant on each trial was recorded. Furthermore, on half the trials, 1 object was surreptitiously removed to test whether infants would search longer when they expected 1 more object in the box than was actually in there. The same group of infants completed the task at 10 months (N = 141) and 16 months (N = 75). Results indicated that the capacity to represent objects in working memory increased between 10 months (~1 object) and 16 months (~2 objects). Both age groups searched longer when an object had been secretly removed than when no objects were removed. Increased capacity was also demonstrated by 16-month-olds searching the box significantly longer than 10-month-olds on trials with one object missing, indicating a stronger representation of the ‘missing’ object. However, performance at 10 months was not predictive of performance at 16 months, suggesting instability in individual differences in object-based working memory capacity across this period.",

          "abstract": "We conducted a theoretical exploration into how human-LLM collaboration can enforce the emergence of creativity through the lens of concepts—a notion that is central in the philosophical discussions regarding human knowledge creation. Kant considers ‘concept’ to be an epistemological tool that transforms people’s perceptive, intuitive experiences into knowledge, while Hegel further postulates that ‘concept’ has a broader, ontological meaning: Through concepts, individuals’ experiences are socialized to a collective level, eventually becoming part of the external world which, in turn, to be experienced and learned by other individuals. Specifically, this paper first reviewed the philosophical discussions revolving around ‘concept’ and discussed how creativity is reflected in and can be facilitated through concept generation. We then reviewed the development of artificial intelligence (including LLMs) and mapped it onto the development of human intelligence based on concepts. Eventually, we identified the commonalities and unique strengths of human (providing drive to start and constraints based on their inherent embodiment) and artificial intelligence (carrying out boundless exploration of new concepts to supply potential options for reaching a creative goal) and based on which proposed a hybrid cycle of concept generation as a general framework or working approach to achieve human-AI creativity.",

          "abstract": "In this preregistered study, we tested competing hypotheses on how social anhedonia is related to the affective response to social interaction: i) diminished forecasting and ii) experience of positive affect, iii) increased forecasting and iv) experience of negative affect. For this, we obtained trait-level measures of social anhedonia and, as covariates, of social anxiety and suspiciousness from N = 100 young adults who engaged in k = 50 dyadic affiliative interactions. We assessed affective forecasting on a day before the interaction and the affective experience during the interaction with five intermittent ratings and via ratings obtained from participants watching replays of their interaction. Controlling for social anxiety and suspiciousness, results showed that social anhedonia was related to diminished positive, not increased negative affect, both in anticipation of and during the social interaction. Negative affect was specifically related to social anxiety. We also found an indirect effect of social anhedonia via diminished experience of positive affect on proxies of social motivation and volition. Exploratory analyses suggested an unexpected comforting effect of social anhedonia on interaction partners’ affect that warrants further inquiry. Limitations include a rather WEIRD sample and that the replay ratings were likely not a valid self-assessment of experienced affect. We conclude that social anhedonia is specifically related to diminished positive affect for social interactions whereas increased negative affect is better explained by co-present social anxiety. Future research should investigate whether these distinct affective trajectories trace back to a common etiological factor.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents’ romantic relationships are consistently rated as some of their most stressful experiences, ranging from a breakup to decoding subtle relationship cues on social media. For help, most adolescents turn to friends (74%), but a majority also turn to parents (69%). In parallel, nearly three-quarters of U.S. teens have experimented with Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Model (LLM) companions. Which source of advice is most effective and trustworthy: Parents or AI models? In the present research we report a pre-registered [osf.io/md2ek; 2], randomized experiment (N=404 adolescents aged 13-17) to rigorously compare the quality of relationship advice from parents to the advice generated by LLMs. In a within-subjects, repeated-measures design, participants read three realistic dating conflict scenarios, each drawn from a popular relationship advice application, and then read advice about how to respond. The advice was randomly assigned (and counter-balanced) to come from either an LLM or from a parent of a teenager. The LLM-provided advice was split into two sources: an LLM that was fine-tuned to provide relationship advice (called “AskElle”) or an off-the-shelf (untuned) LLM. Participants then rated the responses its help with coping, its implementation likelihood, and trustworthiness. Data were analyzed using a random-intercept model estimated with a Bayesian, machine-learning method (stochtree). Overall, the LLMs outperformed parents’ advice by approximately .3SD across the primary outcomes, all pr(ATE&gt;0)&gt;.99. The LLM that was specially tuned for teen dating advice (AskElle) was just as effective as the commercially available LLM, when averaging across the three trials. Secondary analyses (see Figure 1A) showed that participants preferred the off-the-shelf LLM when it was the first piece of advice they saw, pr(Diff)&gt;.99. But they strongly preferred the specialized LLM (AskElle) when it was third. Thus, once participants could directly compare all three sources, then they preferred the specialized advice, pr(Diff)&gt;.99, and didn’t distinguish between parents and off-the-shelf LLMs. Thus in real-world contexts, with repeated consultation of an AI tool, then generic advice from an LLM is likely to lose its advantage, and adolescents are likely to require more attuned relationship advice. Qualitative, natural language analyses identified the elements of the advice that were most and least successful. Parents’ language tended to diminish adolescents’ feelings, dismissing their relationship problems as temporary and superficial. Off-the-shelf LLMs were overly-accommodating and affirming, sometimes reinforcing more extreme appraisals and possibly entrenching young people in harmful patterns of rumination. The best answers validated what young people felt but then challenged their appraisals of the situation and led to a better, more optimistic, appraisal—accompanied by clear action steps with example scripts.",

Despite increasing awareness of these systemic barriers, little is known about the lived experience of adults awaiting psychological treatment for EDs. This study explored the psychological and emotional impacts of being on a waitlist and the coping strategies individuals employ during this time. Fourteen females (M=27.1 years) who were currently, or had recently been, on a waitlist for ED treatment in Australia participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2022) within a critical-realist framework. Participants described feeling deprioritised, not “sick enough”, and that the waitlist itself contributed to symptom escalation. Four key themes were generated: living in limbo, reflecting uncertainty and disempowerment; incubation period, describing exacerbation of ED symptoms and psychological distress; reliance on other support, illustrating variable use of formal and informal networks; and alternative coping mechanisms, highlighting use of previously learned strategies. Findings suggest that prolonged waiting can intensify distress, entrench ED behaviours, and undermine recovery motivation. Enhancing communication, interim support, and structured self-help may help mitigate these harms and improve service responses during the waitlist period.",

To answer these questions, N=604 participants had a three-round dialogue with an LLM that either (i) corrected participants’ misconceptions about Islam and Muslims (treatment) or (ii) discussed sports (control). As expected, we find that the treatment significantly improved attitudes towards Islam and Muslims relative to the control. Furthermore, we do not find that improving attitudes towards Islam and Muslims comes at the cost of worsening attitudes towards Jews. On the contrary, we find some evidence that the treatment also improves attitudes towards Jews, Judaism, and Christianity.

These constitute a new form of scientific literacy that builds on traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we show how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy.

We show that free-viewing fixations resemble those of observers describing scenes but differ from those of observers counting or searching for objects. Fixations are more often directed toward people and objects whose removal most alters scene interpretation, rather than toward the most salient or meaningfully judged regions (meaning maps), or objects perceived to be grasped or gazed at. Small image changes that modify scene understanding—but not salience or meaning maps—alter fixation patterns. By instructing observers to describe scenes while fixating on objects either relevant or irrelevant to scene understanding, we demonstrate that free-viewing eye movements are functionally important for accurate scene comprehension. Thus, an important default task during free viewing for the human brain is to comprehend scenes, reflected by frequent eye movements toward people and objects that maximize accurate scene understanding.",

          "authors": "Ellis Cain; Elizabeth Geballe; Tyler Marghetis",
          "abstract": "Many theories of cultural evolution emphasize the influence of repeated transmission. Folktales, myths, and other cultural stories offer a testbed for these theories [1, 2]. In the real world, however, the transmission of a cultural story is often confounded with large-scale changes in linguistic or cultural context, making it difficult to identify the mechanisms of cultural change and stability. Here, to unravel this theoretical tangle, we analyze an unusual natural experiment: due to a misunderstanding, a story attributed to the Russian novelist Tolstoy was translated repeatedly in a full cycle, with the first and final versions published in the same language (English), country (USA), city (Chicago), and decade (1890s) [3]. Since this cycle of cultural transmission began and ended in the same linguistic-cultural context, it offers a unique opportunity to isolate the effects of repeated transmission from the effects of changing the broader sociocultural context. We transformed each version of the story into a high-dimensional trajectory through a shared, multilingual semantic space. We find that the story’s overall shape was preserved throughout the translation cycle. Versions produced within the same linguistic-cultural context, moreover, were especially similar. Each step of the translation process, however, incrementally distorted the story; the final English version was thus more similar to the Russian and French than to the original English, despite both English versions appearing in the same language and location. These findings demonstrate how cultural transmission can preserve complex meanings while introducing incremental changes that reflect both individual-level and broader sociocultural influences. Cultural evolution is shaped both by the transmission process and the broader cultural milieu in which it occurs.",

          "authors": "Hudson Golino",
          "abstract": "Language conveys meaning through structures that range from concrete description to abstract generalization. This study introduces a computational framework for measuring linguistic depth by quantifying the algorithmic complexity of semantic networks derived from large language model embeddings. Building on Piagetian and Vygotskian theories of cognitive development, this study propose that abstraction, whether in thought, measurement, or language, reflects the compression of distributed information into coherent, generative structures. We operationalize this principle using Kolmogorov complexity, K(G), estimated via the compressed length of network edge lists. Simulation studies demonstrate that networks derived from factor-structured data exhibit significantly lower K(G) than density-matched random controls, with separation accuracy reaching 94% as factor loadings strengthen. In a controlled linguistic experiment comparing 100 pairs of abstract and concrete phrases matched for syntax and length, abstract expressions produced consistently lower algorithmic complexity (M = 726) than concrete expressions (M = 784), t(194.41) = -3.28, p = .001, d = -0.46. These findings establish that semantic abstraction manifests as network compressibility, i.e., abstract language achieves conceptual depth through structural regularity rather than elaborative detail. The framework unites psychometric network theory, complexity science, and computational linguistics under a single information-theoretic principle, offering a model-agnostic measure of abstraction applicable across psychological networks, natural language, and neural representations. By formalizing the intuition that profound expression achieves economy through structure, K(G) provides both theoretical insight into how meaning is organized and practical methodology for assessing semantic depth in text, psychological data, and artificial intelligence systems.",

Drawing from qualitative data from over 560 Black Americans’ reports of racially charged medical encounters, Dr. Amanda Almond illustrates how microaggressions rooted in racial stereotypes, size bias, and biological myths of race undermine patient trust and health outcomes. Integrating the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) and Bystander Intervention Theory, the framework identifies stage-matched processes for promoting anti-racist action among healthcare providers. A new Decisional Balance Measure is introduced to assess attitudes toward DEI training and align interventions with varying levels of motivation. This readiness-based approach advances DEI beyond compliance by addressing provider ambivalence, fostering accountability, and promoting equitable systems of care rooted in validation, affirmation, and transformation.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental property of human memory is its ability to organize a continuous stream of information into discrete, searchable events. Although empirical work supports hierarchical memory representations in the brain, we lack a formal theory of how humans search this structure. Here, we present a hierarchical model of memory search that unifies a wide range of phenomena under a single framework. By tracking mental contexts at multiple levels, the model captures memory behavior across different timescales, from recalling single lists of information to navigating materials consisting of a series of lists. It explains enhanced recall at list boundaries by proposing a top-down hierarchical search: higher-level contextual cues are retrieved before activating lower-level item information. This mechanism also accounts for recall transition patterns across list boundaries, reproducing effects observed in the event memory literature. Taken together, these results provide a unified account of how humans efficiently organize and search their memories.",

          "abstract": "Early and accurate identification of students who struggle with learning to read is essential for providing timely and effective interventions. This requires universal screening tools that not only produce reliable and valid results across linguistically diverse student populations but also support scalability and allow teachers and clinicians to interpret the results meaningfully. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework for the development and evaluation of linguistically fair universal reading screening tools for use in educational settings. As part of this framework, we consider (i) classification accuracy, (ii) instructional relevance, (iii) clinical utility, and (iv) operational feasibility. We apply this framework and propose a series of reading screening algorithms that accurately predict end-of-year reading risk in English, with sensitivity exceeding 80% in kindergarten and grade 1, and 90% in grade 2. The Spanish algorithm achieves similar sensitivity levels, though kindergarten screening remains more challenging for bilingual students. Notably, the inclusion of oral language and expressive vocabulary measures enhances specificity when administered in students' first language, while these same measures may introduce systematic bias (in the form of reduced specificity) when administered in English to students classified as English learners. While very promising, these findings underscore the critical need for developing and validating reading screeners in languages beyond English, as well as creating comprehensive multilingual screening protocols that leverage students' full linguistic repertoires across all their languages.",

This study evaluates motor, autonomic, affective, and neural, responses during a drum playing task with varied music playing (improvisation vs maintaining the beat) and music accompaniment (live vs recorded) conditions, completed by sixteen survivors of stroke and sixteen neurologically normal control (NC) participants. Motor responses were characterized by total acceleration of hand movements (accelerometry) and wrist flexor activation (electromyography; EMG). Autonomic response was evaluated with tonic response of electrodermal activity (EDA). Affective responses were evaluated with 5-point Likert ratings of pleasure, physical effort, and cognitive challenge. Neural response was evaluated in a subset of eleven stroke and eleven NC participants with fMRI, using region of interest analysis in the supplementary motor area (SMA), upper limb region of the primary motor cortex (M1ul) and ventral striatum (VS). Findings demonstrate that improvisation increased total acceleration, EMG, tonic EDA, and brain activity in the SMA, M1ul and VS. Improvisation and live accompaniment increased pleasure ratings. A composite score of reward-related responses was positively associated with both total acceleration and EMG. Survivors of stroke had higher ratings of physical effort and cognitive challenge compared to NC participants. These findings support the benefit of music improvisation for improving motor response and reward among survivors of stroke. The positive association between reward and motor responses suggests an important role of reward for improving motor performance, which may be beneficial for enhancing stroke rehabilitation outcomes",

Using the context of biases favoring more over less physically attractive people, results found that each intervention was able to reduce some component of discriminatory judgment, and with effects that were similar in magnitude to prior work that tested each strategy within a single study session. These findings demonstrate the potential for such interventions to yield long-term reductions in biased judgements and provide insight into the processes that may create more effective bias-reducing strategies.",

An automated quantitative measure of interpersonal coordination would enhance assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring of treatment-related change in autism and other psychiatric conditions. Introduce and apply a novel AI-based measure (’concurrence’) to quantify and compare nonverbal interpersonal coordination during naturalistic conversation in individuals with and without various psychiatric presentations. \nMethods: The primary analysis included 224 12–18-year-olds with neurotypical development (NT), autism (AUT), or other psychiatric conditions (PSY), recorded during videoconference get-to-know-you conversations with a research staff member (‘partner’). Replication analyses included 59 12–18-year-olds with NT or AUT, recorded during face-to-face conversations. \nA self-supervised AI method (concurrence) was applied to time series data representing facial expressions and head movements of participants and their conversation partners. This yielded interpersonal coordination scores for all participant-partner dyads, which were then compared transdiagnostically. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed using annotated subsamples from a combined sample of 430 5–52-year-olds. Convergent validity was assessed with measures of social gaze, motor imitation ability, and conversation quality; discriminant validity was assessed with IQ.  \nResults: In the videoconference sample, AUT demonstrated significantly lower interpersonal coordination than PSY (unadjusted Cohen’s d=0.56, p&lt;0.05) and NT (d=1.06, p&lt;0.0001), with PSY also lower than NT (d=0.43, p&lt;0.05). The AUT&lt;NT effect was replicated in the face-to-face sample (d=0.7, p&lt;0.05). The group-by-context interaction was nonsignificant (p=0.13), suggesting group differences are robust to recording context. Convergent and discriminant validity was demonstrated through positive associations between coordination and mutual social gaze (r(102)=0.43, p&lt;0.0001), gross motor imitation ability (r(31)=0.44, p&lt;0.05), and conversation quality ratings (r(211)=0.34, p&lt;0.001), but not IQ (r(216)=-0.0003, p=0.99).\nLimitations: Generalizability is limited by sample characteristics including language and cognitive ability, age, and sex.\nConclusions: The study demonstrates reduced interpersonal coordination in adolescents with autism and other psychiatric conditions (AUT&lt;PSY&lt;NT) using a novel, transdiagnostic computational measure. This finding replicated across different conversational contexts and the concurrence measure demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity, highlighting its potential as an automated and scalable individual-level measure of social skills.",

We analyzed everyday driving patterns from 2,658 older adults who also completed self-reported measures of general well-being and health across cognitive, physical, social, and mental domains. Driving behaviors predicted both overall well-being and specific health domains beyond demographic variables. Physical and social health were most strongly associated with driving variables. Furthermore, we identified several driving signatures of health that were highly specific in their predictions. Finally, including driving variables improved out-of-sample predictive performance relative to a demographic-only model. Overall, these findings position driving behavior as a potential new source of personal sensing that can be leveraged to understand and promote health and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Debates across the behavioral sciences have long examined whether ambiguity avoidance in decision-making reflects stable preferences for certainty or uncertainty in beliefs formed through limited experience. Prior studies have commonly used the max–min expected utility (MMEU) model to interpret ambiguity-related decisions, but MMEU confounds preferences with beliefs by focusing on the range of possible probabilities rather than how individuals form them. We conducted two experiments (N = 53; N = 298) using a Linked Colored Lottery Task to test whether ambiguity avoidance reflects stable preferences or beliefs about outcome distributions. Participants first learned to associate colors with distinct outcome distributions by sampling from them and then made incentivized choices between options that varied in ambiguity. This design allowed us to observe how beliefs about distributional variance influenced decisions and to distinguish whether choices reflected belief construction versus uncertainty evaluation. We compared models based on MMEU and on subjective recursive expected utility (SREU), which explicitly separates beliefs from preferences. In both experiments, model comparison favored SREU, and participants with more dispersed inferred beliefs were more likely to avoid ambiguous options. Sampling patterns and memory for outcomes showed similar effects. Apparent age-related differences in ambiguity avoidance were also better explained by belief variance than by preferences. These results suggest that ambiguity avoidance often reflects perceived imprecision in learned beliefs rather than an inherent aversion to uncertainty, a cognitive rather than affective phenomenon, with implications for understanding decision-making across learning, memory, and uncertainty processing domains.",

          "abstract": "The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) are “interpretable” and whether the information extracted from LLMs via interpretability methods can be seen as corresponding to these models’ “mental states” is currently the subject of lively debate among scientists and philosophers interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some people think that interpretability methods already provide evidence that LLMs genuinely represent the external world in virtue of the fact that we can assign semantic content to their internal states. Other people think that the project of attributing semantic contents to LLMs’ internal states is still very much in its infancy and could take decades. Nevertheless, these people seem to think that, first, such a project is worth pursuing and will eventually succeed and, second, current interpretability methods are where our best hopes reside. In this paper, I argue that the ‘mission’ of LLM interpretability should be re-framed. Instead of understanding interpretability as the project of ‘mapping’ the internal states of LLMs (and assigning representational contents to them), we should understand it as the project of experimentally interacting with LLMs in order to study their behavior during these interactions. Interpretability methods, in other words, are ways to actively manipulate the LLM to elicit certain responses, not ways to ‘dissect’ and ‘catalog’ its inner structures.",

The average statistical power of the unadjusted analysis (independent t-test) was not improved when using covariate-based assignment as compared to random assignment. However, with random assignment, the statistical power of the unadjusted analysis depended on observed covariate imbalance; with covariate-based assignment, the statistical power of the unadjusted analysis was less affected by covariate imbalance because imbalance was minimized.

CAPL-2 total scores, combinations of CAPL-2 subscores by sex and combinations of movement behaviour metrics across physical literacy profiles (‘Beginning’, ‘Progressing’, ‘Achieving’, ‘Excelling’) were compared using nonparametric analyses. Boys appeared stochastically superior to girls for CAPL-2 total score (P = 0.002). Boys and girls differed in terms of combinations of scores related to the CAPL-2 dimensions (P = 0.005), with scores that were generally stochastically superior for boys, specifically regarding affective dimension. Physical literacy profiles differed in terms of combinations of movement behaviour metrics (P &lt; 0.001), in particular when considering step-based metrics and percentage of wear time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

          "abstract": "Recent meta-analyses and large-scale longitudinal studies have shown that the mean-levels and rank-orders of personality traits change throughout the lifespan. However, people differ from each other in their patterns of personality development. These individual differences in personality trait changes provide important insight into the sources and course of personality development. The present meta-analysis quantified the magnitude of individual differences in personality trait changes and their fluctuation across time and age by integrating findings from 229 longitudinal studies (N = 230,492). Results indicated significant individual differences in change in all traits, with neuroticism showing the most pronounced differences, and openness and agreeableness the least. Charting effects across the lifespan, individual differences in change were most pronounced in childhood, decreased during young adulthood, but were significant across the entire lifespan. The age at which individual differences in change were smallest varied across traits, from ages 30 to 75. Finally, individual differences in personality trait changes were larger over longer assessment intervals, for facet-level traits, and among measures that were not designed to examine the Big Five taxonomy. Our findings support theoretical claims that highlight the relevance of genetic and environmental sources of personality development and suggest that individual differences in change endure, challenging the predictions of set-point models of personality development. Moreover, our results provide benchmarks for individual differences in change that can be used to compare the magnitude of differential personality development in future research.",

          "abstract": "Irritability and anhedonia are two prevalent, co-occurring, and impairing symptoms of major depression that are proposed to result from dysfunctions in reward processing. While irritability is associated with heightened sensitivity to reward receipt, anhedonia is linked to blunted sensitivity to reward receipt. Given these supposed paradoxical effects on reward sensitivity, it is noteworthy that no studies have examined how both symptoms interact to affect reward sensitivity. In a community sample of young adults (N=73, Mage=21.21±2.27, 56.16% females), we evaluated the interacting effects of dimensionally-assessed irritability and anhedonia symptoms on neural (i.e., event-related potentials and time-frequency) measures of reward and loss sensitivity during the Doors task, a well-known reward paradigm. We used univariate and multivariate (based on generalized eigendecomposition) approaches to isolate patterns of delta and theta activity in response to reward and loss. Linear-mixed models tested the unique and interacting effects of irritability and anhedonia on EEG measures of reward sensitivity (FRN/N2, theta, and delta power). Participants with above-average irritability and anhedonia displayed larger (more negative) FRN/N2 amplitudes across feedback valence, and reduced theta power following reward feedback, whereas no associations were observed at lower symptom levels. These effects remained significant when controlling for broader depressive symptoms, gender, and income. These findings provide preliminary evidence of an interactive effect of anhedonia and irritability on neural sensitivity to feedback in individuals without clinical levels of symptoms. Awaiting validation in clinical samples, our results highlight the importance of considering symptom interactions to better understand reward-related mechanisms in depression.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Migration and integration are complex processes that impact the mental health of immigrant populations. This study focuses on the mental health challenges faced by first-generation Iranian immigrants in Germany, specifically examining the role of depression, discrimination, and social integration. \n\nMethods: A cross-sectional, online survey was administered to 401 Iranian immigrants across 122 cities in Germany. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the PHQ-9, while perceived discrimination, social support, and integration were measured with custom scales. Multivariable statistical analyses (OLS regression, multinomial logistic regression) were employed to identify significant predictors of depression and re-migration intent. \n\nResults: The study found that about 60% of participants exhibited moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Higher levels of perceived discrimination (b = 1.246, p = 0.001), lower social support (b = -0.671, p = 0.096), and negative comparisons of life in Germany versus Iran (b = -2.457, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. Employment and higher education were protective factors, while unemployment was linked to increased depressive symptoms (b = 2.571, p = 0.007). A substantial proportion of participants (63.6%) expressed intent to leave Germany, with re-migration intention negatively associated with perceived happiness in Germany (OR = 0.21, p &lt; 0.001). \n\nConclusions: The findings highlight the significant mental health burden experienced by Iranian immigrants in Germany, with discrimination and lack of social support being key contributors to depressive symptoms. Policy implications include addressing structural barriers such as discrimination, enhancing social support networks, and improving integration pathways. These interventions could reduce mental health disparities and contribute to the social cohesion of migrant communities.",

However, this approach ignores relationships between outcomes, which can reduce estimate accuracy and make it difficult to examine how effects are related across outcomes. A multivariate approach addresses these issues by modelling all outcomes jointly. This tutorial illustrates how to fit Bayesian multivariate linear mixed-effects models using the R package brms.\nMethod: We present three example applications in phonetic research, using data of L+H* accents in Greek varying in accentual context and stress location.\nResults: The multivariate approach reduced uncertainty in population-level effect estimates compared to univariate models and provided a convenient way to examine correlations among effects across outcomes.\nConclusions: This tutorial provides guidance on implementing Bayesian multivariate linear mixed-effects models and demonstrates their potential.",

This longitudinal study investigates how stress-related vulnerabilities and relationship dynamics contribute to psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimisation in Brazil and the United Kingdom (UK). Drawing on the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation (VSA) model, we examined how individual differences (e.g., attachment orientation), mate-retention tactics (benefit-provisioning and cost-inflicting strategies), and COVID-19-related-stressors (e.g., impact, uncertainty) predict IPV over time (i.e., at two time points, one month apart). Findings revealed that all forms of IPV decreased over time but were more prevalent in the UK than in Brazil. COVID-19 uncertainty and the use of cost-inflicting mate-retention strategies were positively associated with IPV, particularly in the UK. Country significantly moderated several associations: avoidant attachment and cost-inflicting strategies were positively linked to IPV in Brazil, but negatively or weakly associated in the UK. Similarly, COVID-19 uncertainty predicted IPV more strongly in the UK during Wave 1, while in Brazil the associations persisted across both waves. These results highlight the need for context-sensitive IPV interventions and show how interpersonal vulnerabilities interact with societal stress to affect relationship harm across cultures.",

The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (sham) hypnotic inductions on hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 128 channels. We computed EEG features that were identified in previous studies as correlates of hypnosis or hypnotizability.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that one of the unconventional (sham) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. However, contrary to its predictions, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. \nMost EEG features we explored did not differ between conventional and unconventional induction conditions. A possible exception is frontal theta activity, which appeared to increase more in conventional induction trials. The change in frontal gamma power negatively correlated with hypnosis depth, and occipital theta activity positively correlated with hypnotizability in both conventional and unconventional inductions. \nOverall, our results provide partial support for the expectancy theory of hypnosis. However, our findings should be considered exploratory. Confirmatory research is required to strengthen our confidence in these effects.",

Remarkably, retention with fluent texts was similar across WMC levels, while, counterintuitively, higher WMC descriptively predicted lower comprehension. This data pattern underlying their significant interactions is noteworthy and based on a small sample. Due to researchers’ degrees of freedom in analytical decisions, we explored the replicability and analytical robustness of the primary findings by modeling different subjective choices in the analytical approach via multiverse analysis. In our (pre-registered) direct replication in the laboratory (N = 220) disfluency, WMC, and their interaction showed null effects on retention, comprehension, and transfer across all multiverse specifications, including when WMC was operationalized via OSPAN. This reflects a consistent lack of (analytical) replicability.\nKeywords: disfluency, working memory capacity, operation span task, ATI-study",

          "abstract": "Context has been theoretically proposed to exert greater impact on face emotion processing when expressions are ambiguous. However, evidence for such ‘context-weighting’ as a function of expression ambiguity is very limited. We investigated the presence of context-weighting using emotive sentence cues that provided a predictive context for a neutral face that changed expression in response. Emotional expressions were either congruent or incongruent with the sentence cue. To modulate expression ambiguity we manipulated expression intensity: low (80%-intensity) and high (20%-intensity) ambiguity in Experiments 1a/b using angry and happy faces, with medium ambiguity (50%-intensity) added in Experiment 2 using disgust and sad faces. Participants categorised the face emotion. Across all experiments error rates were lower when face expressions were congruent vs. incongruent with the predictive context; crucially congruency effects were larger when expressions were more ambiguous, thus indicating greater context-weighting. Drift Diffusion Modelling revealed that this effect was underpinned by use of predictive context to improve the efficiency of face expression evidence accumulation. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence that emotion perception is based on flexible integration of both face and prior context within a predictive processing framework, with the degree of context-weighting determined by the level of expression ambiguity.",

          "abstract": "Phenomenological control is the stable trait ability to alter subjective experience according to one’s goals. Although voluntary, experiences arising from phenomenological control are experienced as involuntary and may be incorrectly attributed to external causes. Such experiences may influence related beliefs about the world. In a large sample pre-registered study (n = 503), we tested predictions arising from the theory that this ability evolved to promote experiences of a spirit world in order to support religious beliefs. Reports of three types of unusual experience and associated beliefs were measured: of past lives, of being outside one’s body and of contact with incorporeal beings. Demand effects were minimised by the presentation of measures in separate procedures, run by multiple researchers. Consistent with predictions, linear regression of reports of both these unusual experiences and of their related beliefs on Phenomenological Control Scale (PCS) scores showed positive relationships with small intercepts. These results are contrasted with weaker relationships with large intercepts for regression on PCS scores of flow experience reports, which are not posited to depend on phenomenological control. Finally, the relationship between phenomenological control and belief in a spirit world was partially mediated by the tendency to have related unusual experiences. These results are consistent with the theory that paranormal experiences of a spirit world depend on phenomenological control, and that these experiences support belief in a spirit world; corroboration of these predictions in turn support the theory that phenomenological control evolved to support and take advantage of the spiritual beliefs of a community.",

However, patterns of such self- and child-focused emotion regulation (ER) and their associations with parental exhaustion, children’s internalizing problems, children’s academic achievement, and parent–child relationships remain unexplored. Our preregistered three-wave online study targeted U.S. parents of sixth–ninth graders (N = 1,046; 52% mothers; Mage = 43.22). We employed latent profile analyses and latent transition analyses. Results revealed three profiles of parental self- and child-focused ER strategies, stable across a 4-month timeframe: Reappraisers (T1 ≈ 9%, T2 ≈ 7%) showed high use of self- and child-focused reappraisal, self-ruminators (T1 ≈ 25%, T2 ≈ 31%) reported high self-focused rumination and low use of other strategies, and average regulators (T1 ≈ 66%, T2 ≈ 62%) showed moderate use of all strategies. In addition, reappraisers reported the lowest levels of parental exhaustion and children’s internalizing problems and the highest parent–child relationship closeness. By contrast, self-ruminators reported the highest levels of parental exhaustion and children’s internalizing problems and the lowest parent–child relationship closeness. However, profile membership did not predict children’s academic achievement. The study provides important insights into distinct subgroups of parents on the basis of their combined use of self- and child-focused ER strategies, highlighting the differential impacts of these strategies on parental well-being and child outcomes.

Here we tested associations between personality and perceptions of adulthood in a UK sample (N = 714, age 18-77 years, MAge = 39.30). Regression analyses indicated that subjective adult status, or feeling like an adult, was predicted by low Neuroticism and high Conscientiousness. Personality independently explained 27% of variance in subjective adult status. Older age and being a parent also significantly predicted subjective adult status. Endorsement of the Markers of Adulthood scale (MoA) subscales had mixed predictors, as the role transitions, independence, and legality markers subscales were predicted by high Neuroticism and low Openness, whereas endorsement of the relative maturity subscale was predicted by high Openness and high Conscientiousness. These results illustrate the presence of individual differences in perceptions of adulthood, and that personality shapes whether we see ourselves as adults, and how we define adulthood. Findings have implications for research on perceptions of adulthood and life outcomes, arguing for the inclusion of personality as a covariate in future studies.",

This is thought to be due to an increase in the rate of the pacemaker (inferred from the slope when estimates are regressed against stimulus duration) of an internal clock, said to be triggered by physiological arousal. Work with emotional stimuli suggests similar temporal dilations, and there is (mixed) evidence suggesting this effect may be due to physiological arousal. We therefore aimed to test the assertion that click trains increase duration estimates due to increased physiological arousal. We compared estimates of tone durations following negative sounds, neutral sounds, click trains, and silence, while recording pupil size and heart rate as measures of arousal. Contrary to click train literature, estimates did not significantly differ following any of the stimulation types, possibly due to large trial baseline periods. However, pupil size change was significantly higher during negative and neutral sounds than both click trains and silence, and higher during click trains than silence. Heart rate change was higher during negative sounds than click trains. Finally, while pupil size change did not correlate with estimation slopes, heart rate change correlated with estimation slopes for neutral sounds and click trains (significantly) and negative sounds and silence (moderate and anecdotal Bayes factors respectively). In conclusion, there was evidence to suggest that click trains increased physiological arousal (pupil size) compared to silence, and that higher arousal (heart rate) during click trains correlates with estimation slopes (pacemaker rate) following click trains.",

          "abstract": "Trains of auditory clicks increase subsequent judgements of stimulus duration by approximately 10%. Scalar timing theory suggests this is due to a 10% increase in pacemaker rate, a main component of the internal clock. The effect has been demonstrated in many timing tasks, including verbal estimation, temporal generalisation, and temporal bisection. However, the effect of click trains has yet to be examined on temporal sensitivity, commonly measured by temporal difference thresholds. We sought to investigate this both experimentally; where we found no significant increase in temporal sensitivity, and computationally; by modelling the temporal difference threshold task according to scalar timing theory. Our experimental null result presented three possibilities which we investigated by simulating a 10% increase in pacemaker rate in a newly-created scalar timing theory model of thresholds. We found that a 10% increase in pacemaker rate led to a significant improvement in temporal sensitivity in only 8.66% of 10,000 simulations. When a 74% increase in pacemaker rate was modelled to simulate the filled-duration illusion, temporal sensitivity was significantly improved in 55.36% of simulations. Therefore, scalar timing theory does predict improved temporal sensitivity for a faster pacemaker, but the effect of click trains (a supposed 10% increase) appears to be too small to be reliably found in the temporal difference threshold task.",

In the set of three studies, we explored how the general public (study 1) and a pro-environmentally engaged group (study 2) perceive different pro-environmental collective actions and how support for these is associated with political beliefs, including right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and environmental identification (study 3). In Study 1 conducted on a representative national sample (N = 530), we assessed perceptions of 97 diverse climate-related actions across six dimensions: general affect, non-normativity, use of violence, effectiveness, perceived legality, and willingness to engage. We identified four clusters of actions: positively assessed (e.g., publishing literature), moderately assessed (e.g., political mourning), negatively assessed (e.g., organizing demonstrations), and very negatively assessed (e.g., vandalizing artworks). In Study 2, we checked and compared how these behaviours were evaluated on the same dimensions by the environmentally engaged group (N=49). Pro-environmental sample perceived collective actions generally more favourably than the general sample on all dimensions except for effectiveness, where no significant differences were present. Study 3 (representative national sample, N = 1016) revealed that support for the most moderate actions (Cluster 1) was negatively associated with RWA and SDO and positively associated with environmental identification. Similar associations were observed for Clusters 2 and 3. In contrast, support for the most radical actions (Cluster 4) was positively associated with SDO and negatively with environmental identification, showing no significant relationship with RWA. These findings indicate that the relationships between the variables and support for radical climate actions differ significantly from those for moderate environmental actions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Social cognition is essential for forming and maintaining intimate relationships. Individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM) often show impairments in interpersonal functioning, including trust and romantic attachment. The oxytocin system has been implicated in social behavior, yet the role of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in CM-related social functioning remains insufficiently understood. This study examined the impact of CM on social cognition in a large web-based sample and explored the association between CM and OXTR gene expression in a well-characterized clinical cohort.\nMethods: Both studies were preregistered (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KNC2X), and data and code are available at OSF (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4DZWK). Study 1 assessed the relationship between CM severity, interpersonal trust, and romantic attachment in a web-based sample (N = 252). Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Generalized Trust Scale, a behavioral distrust game, and the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire. Study 2 analyzed OXTR gene expression in peripheral blood samples from N = 92 CM-exposed individuals and examined associations with self-reported CM severity. Exploratory analyses additionally included measures of interpersonal sensitivity, social functioning, and maladaptive personality traits.\nResults: In Study 1, greater CM severity was significantly associated with lower interpersonal trust (both self-reported and behavioral), and with higher levels of attachment-related anxiety and avoidance. In Study 2, no significant association was found between CM severity and OXTR gene expression in blood. However, exploratory analyses revealed that CM severity was associated with social interaction difficulties, while OXTR gene expression was associated with the maladaptive personality trait of detachment.\nConclusions: The findings highlight robust associations between CM and impairments in trust as well as insecure romantic attachment. Although no direct link was found between CM and OXTR expression, future research should investigate gene–environment interactions using larger samples and alternative tissue sources. Interventions targeting trust and attachment processes may offer promising avenues to improve relational functioning in individuals with a history of CM.",

In a preregistered spatially correlated bandit experiment, we manipulated (within-subject) whether past observations remained visible (low load) or disappeared (high load). Greater memory load increased \"forgetfulness\", as captured by parameters indexing recency- and surprise-dependent decay of memory precision. These parameters also predicted individual working memory capacity and explained differences in performance and search patterns. By formalizing how generalization operates under limited memory, our model links episodic reinforcement learning to theories of adaptive memory compression and resource rationality.",

          "abstract": "Traditional evidence-based psychotherapies based on the protocols-for-syndromes approach often lack flexibility and fail to address the comorbidities and complexity of mental health problems adequately. Process-based therapy offers a theoretical framework for tailoring and personalizing psychotherapy by identifying individual patterns of psychological, biophysiological, and sociocultural processes. This study developed a Japanese version of the Process-Based Assessment Tool (PBAT), which assesses multidimensional factors influencing the process of change that occurs within an individual. The translation followed the 10-step guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, which recommends cognitive debriefing (i.e., evaluating draft translations for comprehensibility to laypeople). Semi-structured interviews with six Japanese adults in their 20s–40s revealed that 13 of the 21 draft-translated PBAT items required linguistic revision, and some expressions were unfamiliar to Japanese laypeople. Based on these findings and discussions with the original PBAT author, we revised the wording of the Japanese PBAT items and improved its linguistic validity. Future directions for its clinical and research application are also discussed.",

The 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) is widely used to measure shared decision-making (SDM) across clinical settings, but no study so far has synthesized its psychometric properties. Purpose. We systematically reviewed and synthesized psychometric evidence of the SDM-Q-9. Data Sources. MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Study Selection. Original studies in English or German, providing any information on psychometric properties of the SDM-Q-9 considering all possible interpretations and constructs measured by the instrument. Data Extraction. Details on study design, sample characteristics, and any information on psychometric evidence were extracted. Data Synthesis. 83 studies were included, with 73 articles contributing evidence on validity, 46 on reliability, and 3 on fairness. We found a high amount of psychometric evidence on validity and reliability of the SDM-Q-9, interpreting the score as SDM perceived by the patient. Evidence is lacking for other interpretations and fairness. Notable is the weak association of the SDM-Q-9 with physician-rated SDM. Conclusions. The SDM-Q-9 is highly reliable and valid for the subjectively experienced level of SDM by the patient. Further research is needed on alternative interpretations, and on fairness of the measure.",

Data collection included interviews with managers, peer support workers (PSW), and nurses, along with participant observations. Findings were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. This article follows SRQR guidelines.\n\nResults: Clients and staff reported high satisfaction with PSWs but PS was only implemented at the client level. Challenges included unclear job descriptions, low PSW working hours, limited understanding of PS, and financial constraints.\n\nDiscussion: There was a lack of adequate training on PS and recovery. PSW were seen somewhat external by the CMHN teams which weakened integration.  \n\nConclusion: Aligning with best practice guidelines, our findings suggest that successful implementation of PS requires standardized PSW training, financial recognition, comprehensive team training and internal efforts on PSW team integration.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The community setting represents a key environment for the provision of mental health care. Community mental health nurses (CMHNs) play a vital role in delivering person-centred care in outpatient settings. But they are not only essential providers of care but also key actors in coordinating and integrating support across fragmented systems. However, the specific tasks and contributions of CMHNs—particularly those in advanced practice roles—remain insufficiently defined in the literature.\nAim: To synthesise and thematically analyse international research on the tasks and activities of CMHNs, including those attributed to advanced practice nurses (APNs).\nMethods: An integrative review was conducted using systematic searches in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and selected publisher databases. Studies published between 2008 and 2024 in English or German were included. Thematic analysis followed Braun and Clarke’s six-step approach. The review adheres to ENTREQ guidelines and is registered with the Open Science Framework.\nResults: Thirty-seven studies were included. CMHNs perform a wide range of tasks across seven domains: direct care, care coordination, health promotion, education, leadership, management, and research. APNs were particularly active in leadership and service development. However, distinctions between generalist and advanced roles were often unclear.\nConclusion: CMHNs provide complex, person-centred care across diverse settings and contribute to integrated, interprofessional mental health care. APNs contribute additional system-level competencies. The findings support educators, policymakers, and workforce planners in understanding current nursing practices and identifying development needs especially in countries where community mental health nursing and advanced practice roles are not yet widely established.",

          "abstract": "Although terms such as neurodivergent and neurodiverse are increasingly used in policy, education, and workplace settings, little is known about whether the people these terms describe endorse these collective identities. This study examined how 740 adults with autism (n = 189), ADHD (n = 190), dyslexia (n = 179), or co-occurring Autism+ADHD (n = 182) identified with their diagnostic and broader “neurodivergent” identity. Participants completed measures of diagnostic and neurodivergent identity and provided open-text response to what a neurodiversity identity meant to them. Quantitative analyses revealed that while diagnostic and neurodivergent identities were positively related, endorsement of the superordinate identity was modest overall and uneven across groups. Autism+ADHD participants reported the strongest identification, while dyslexic participants reported the weakest. Subscale analyses reflect lower normative and comparative fit of the neurodivergent identity across groups. Qualitative findings highlighted shared understandings of neurodivergence as “difference, not deficit,” but also supported the findings of poor fit, with some participants describing the identity as overly broad, limiting relevance. For some dyslexic participants, neurodiversity described other groups (e.g., Autism, ADHD). Together, these findings suggest that while the idea of a shared neurodivergent identity offers potential for solidarity, it is not yet a widely resonant or unifying identity.",

The study included 28 samples using meta-analysis of single means for frequency determination and a mixed-effects model to examine correlations. The results show that TRI occurs 23% of the time and is not correlated with learning outcomes. TUTs occur 29% of the time and are negatively correlated with learning outcomes. Overall, based on a separate meta-analysis, off-task thoughts occur 51% of the time and are negatively correlated with learning outcomes.

The research sought to understand the unique challenges faced by this demographic, especially in the context of recent political events and the broader U.S.-Iran relationship in a sample of 139 Iranian immigrants currently residing in the U.S. (62% Female, M age = 35.54, range age = 21–85). We investigated whether subjective well-being in Iranian immigrants in the US was associated with their demographic characteristics (e.g., age, relationship status, health) and the degree of discrimination they faced at work and in everyday life. We also examined whether social support would buffer the effect of discrimination on subjective well-being for this group. Consistent with MST, both everyday and workplace discrimination were linked to lower well-being, while older age, being in a relationship, and better health and were associated with higher well-being. These findings refine MST by showing that, within collectivist immigrant communities such as Iranians, social support may promote well-being broadly but may not fully mitigate the stress associated with systemic or institutionalized discrimination. The results highlight the need for culturally informed approaches that address both individual and structural dimensions of immigrant well-being.",

          "authors": "Connor Spiech; Mario Gómez Martínez; Giorgio Lazzari; Virginia Penhune",
          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1). Non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and groove before and after stimulation. Following inhibitory stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the SMA may have disinhibited the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA and V1 play critical roles in embodied rhythm processing.",

          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music, termed “groove,” is thought to arise from the tension between top-down metric expectations or predictions and rhythmic complexity. Specifically, groove ratings are highest for moderately complex rhythms, balancing expectation and surprise. To test this, meter and rhythmic complexity need to be manipulated independently to assess their impact on groove. Thus, we compared Western listeners’ ratings for musical clips of varying rhythmic complexity composed in either the most common Western meter (4/4) or less common meters (e.g., 7/8). In several behavioral studies (Experiment 1, N = 143; Experiment 2, N = 120; Experiment 3, N = 120), we used Bayesian regression to show that groove is greatest for moderately complex rhythms, but only in 4/4. In non-4/4 meters, simpler rhythms elicited the greatest groove. This provides support for the theory that bottom-up rhythmic features interact with meter in a way that shapes the pleasurable urge to move to music.",

Compared to the control, all messages were equally effective at increasing belief in climate change’s impact on extreme weather, support for government action, and worry about extreme weather and climate change.

Method: Participants completed measures of eating disorder symptoms, internal and external shame, childhood trauma, maladaptive personality, mentalisation, emotion regulation, alexithymia, and broader psychopathological domains, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, insomnia, psychosis, dissociation, and suicidality. Results: Moderate to severe emotional abuse was reported by 35.4% of participants, physical abuse by 21.6%, and sexual abuse by 17.8%, and participants were grouped accordingly. Across groups, internal shame, and to a lesser extent external shame, emerged as central nodes, densely interconnected with core eating disorder symptoms such as drive for thinness, bulimia, and body dissatisfaction. Emotion regulation and awareness, together with eating disorder-specific and self-concept variables, served as bridges between communities, linking eating disorder pathology with maladaptive personality traits and broader psychopathological domains. Network comparison tests indicated no significant differences in global structure, edge weights, or centrality indices across trauma groups. Discussion: These findings underscore the central role of shame in eating disorder psychopathology and suggest that trauma-informed interventions should prioritise shame reduction while strengthening emotion regulation and mentalisation capacities.",

          "abstract": "Discovering computational models that explain human cognition and behavior remains a central goal of cognitive science, yet the reliance on hand-crafted equations limits the range of cognitive mechanisms that can be uncovered. We introduce SPICE (Sparse, Interpretable Cognitive Equations), a framework that automates the discovery of mechanistically interpretable cognitive models directly from behavioral data. SPICE fits recurrent neural networks to capture latent cognitive dynamics and then applies sparse equation discovery to extract concise mathematical expressions describing those dynamics. Theory-guided priors make the approach data- and compute-efficient, while a hierarchical design reveals individual differences in the algorithmic structure of cognitive dynamics rather than in parameters alone. In simulations, SPICE accurately recovered the structure and parameters of known reinforcement learning models. Applied to human behavior in a two-armed bandit task, it uncovered new equations that outperformed existing models and revealed structural alterations in reinforcement learning mechanisms among participants with depression, such as a loss of nonlinear exploration dynamics regulating behavioral flexibility. This approach provides systematic insights into structural individual differences in cognitive mechanisms and establishes a foundation for automated discovery of interpretable behavioral models.",

Participants from culturally adjacent regions reported similar emotional experiences, with clear differences between culturally disparate regions such as South America, Asia, and Europe. People’s emotional experiences became more similar with age among peers but differed across generations. Women and men reported similar experiences, particularly among older groups. In contrast, the average facial expressions evoked when people reported the same experience were highly consistent across countries, sexes, and ages.

In two studies (NS1 = 238 with spoken sentences, NS2 = 88 with spoken words) university students engaged in exposure, rating, and validation tasks. We observed increased liking of voices with 8 initial repetitions for the sentences. Voices initially presented 2 and 5 times were liked less than unfamiliar voices and recognised as familiar with less confidence than voices initially presented 8 times, forming an inverted “U” in likeability and familiarity. Less experience with the speaker’s accent weakened the inverted “U” in liking. Our words data are insufficient for inferential conclusions, but the sentences results indicate an uncanny valley of “familiarly unfamiliar” voices, which are more familiar than never heard stimuli but not familiar enough for the mere exposure effect of increased liking.",

          "abstract": "By exploring the boundaries of systems, we learn about their capacities and their forms. We believe that studying edge cases of what human cognition can do is an important supplement to studying prototypical human cognition. This paper describes a class of experiences we call  induced sensory experiences, which we think are (1) rare, (2) trainable, and (3) singularly effective in certain kinds of problem solving. People consistently report non-drug-induced hallucination-like experiences in religious and spiritual contexts. These sensory experiences are often induced through explicit training and practice designed, in part, to invoke them. Here, we report the results of a survey extending this phenomenon to the case of professional and highly trained mathematicians. We document the prevalence of  powerful, sensory or quasi-sensory experiences of non-physical objects.  In short, we find them to be extremely common: Individual mathematicians nearly universally describe experiences and activities that closely match the pattern of induced sensory experiences. These sensory experiences can be seen as an achievement of mathematical thinking: they tend to develop with time and experience in a domain, and many participants find them to be unique in some way to mathematical thinking. These experiences were not reported to be rare. Mathematicians reported having meaningful amounts of control over their visualization.  Finally, explicit belief in the ‘reality’ of these objects was largely unrelated to any measures of sensory vividness or control. Altogether, we believe this work demonstrates how humans are able to build complex and abstract reasoning out of sensorimotor components through extensive training.",

          "abstract": "Mental health stigma is defined by the negative attitudes, stereotyping beliefs, and discrimination affecting the social experiences of individuals facing mental health conditions. Ethnic minority communities in the United States face a disproportionately greater stigma than the majority White group. Stigma can manifest in discourse concerning mental health on social media platforms. While previous studies have used social media to explore mental health, little qualitative social media research has been conducted to gain an understanding of stigma in ethnic minorities. This study used a qualitative content analysis design to explore mental health discussion forums on Reddit. By analyzing 150 posts from three different subreddits representing three communities with varying ethnic compositions, eight themes surrounding stigma were identified. From the Asian-American subreddit, family-based prejudice, culture-based self-stigma, and stigmatization of therapy were found. Posts from the Black mental health subreddit demonstrated culture-based prejudice affecting Black males, stigma influenced by systemic biases, and religion as an influence on culture-based prejudice. Supportive community norms and depressive self-stigma were found in the last subreddit, a group without ethnic specifications. The deep understanding of ethnic mental health stigma achieved in this study can equip the development of interventions addressing this phenomenon. Future research should concern a broader array of online communities, mental illnesses, and ethnic groups.",

          "authors": "Annabel Dare Gereau; Neil Mulligan",
          "abstract": "Retrieval practice improves memory compared to strategies such as restudying and is thought to do so in at least two ways — the direct testing effect (improved memory for tested material) and the forward testing effect (improved memory for material learned after a practice test). Recent research implies that many studies of “the testing effect”, though usually defined in terms of the direct testing effect, conflate direct and forward testing effects (Mulligan et al., 2022). This motivates a new meta-analysis on testing effects with free recall that distinguishes between studies capable of isolating the direct effect of testing (direct studies) from those susceptible to both direct and forward testing effects (mixed studies). The results show that the large majority (67%) of the “testing effects” are from mixed studies, confounding direct and forward testing effects, and only 33% are from direct studies, with mixed studies producing larger testing effects than direct studies. Furthermore, the mixed studies differed in terms of whether the purported forward testing contribution should act to increase, decrease, or have an intermediate effect on the observed testing effect. The effect sizes differed across the mixed subtypes confirming this characterization of the mixed effects as a confounded mixture of forward and direct testing effects. Separate moderation analyses were conducted for the direct and mixed effects further indicating differences between the two population of effects. The literature on the testing effect is not a coherent body and does not clearly tell us about a specific memory phenomenon. Rather, it is a mixture of direct and forward testing effects, in which the forward component sometimes increases, sometimes decreases, and sometimes has an intermediate influence on the observed testing effect.",

          "abstract": "The validity of using non-physically co-located (NPC) robots versus physically co-located (PC) robots in human-robot interaction research remains debated, with mixed empirical findings threatening study reliability and theoretical frameworks. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined whether robot interaction modality significantly affects human acceptance by analyzing 30 studies representing 1,944 participants across eight acceptance sub-dimensions. Using psychometric meta-analytic methods with corrections for sampling error and measurement unreliability, we found no significant overall effect of robot representation type on acceptance (r² = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.16, k = 25). Non-significant effects emerged across acceptance sub-dimensions including attitude, trust, social presence, intention to use, perceived enjoyment, anxiety, and actual use, with effect sizes ranging from -0.13 to 0.16. Moderator analyses examining representation type (screen-based versus virtual reality), contextual factors (field of application, human role), and measurement type (objective versus subjective) failed to explain the moderate to high heterogeneity observed across studies. Publication bias assessment revealed relative symmetry, and risk of bias evaluation indicated moderate robustness across included studies. These findings challenge the embodiment hypothesis in human-robot interaction, suggesting physical co-presence may not provide presumed advantages over virtual representations, and support investigating when rather than if differences between robot modalities emerge.",

          "abstract": "While mental imagery and music reward have each been studied extensively, their interrelationship remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether individual differences in imagery vividness are linked to the capacity to experience music as rewarding. Across 4 experiments, we examined the relationship between imagery vividness and sensitivity to music reward. Experiment 1 (N=1342) showed a significant correlation between sensitivity to musical reward and visual imagery vividness. Experiment 2 replicated the association in an independent sample (N=84). Experiment 3 compared individuals with aphantasia (inability to form mental images; N=25) to controls (N=25), finding lower sensitivity to musical reward among aphantasics. Strikingly, 44% of the aphantasics also met criteria for music anhedonia (i.e., inability to experience music reward), whereas only 12% of control participants showed similar deficits in music reward. In experiment 4 (N=19), aphantasics who were music anhedonics (N=7) reported reduced auditory imagery vividness and fewer, shorter involuntary musical imagery experiences (i.e., earworms) compared to aphantasics without music anhedonia (N=12). Moreover, all aphantasics with music anhedonia met the criteria for anauralia (i.e., inability to form auditory imagery). These results show a robust link between visual imagery vividness and sensitivity to musical reward, and suggest that auditory imagery plays a key role in the experience of music reward. As music unfolds over time, impaired auditory imagery may weaken retention of musical sequences in auditory working memory, and disrupt the formation of musical expectations, a process critical for music reward.",

          "abstract": "For decades, advancements in understanding and treating mental illness have been hindered by a categorical psychiatric nosology that fails to describe and explain how symptoms emerge and relate to one another. In response, two separate initiatives have contributed to a renewed sense of optimism for scientific and translational discovery. First, quantitative models of psychopathology improve clinical description by relying on empirical data to provide a more accurate representation of the structure of mental illness. Chief among these approaches is the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP), which organizes psychopathology based on patterns of symptom covariation observed across numerous studies. In parallel, computational psychiatry seeks to identify neurocognitive processes that give rise to psychopathology and leverage them to forecast important clinical and functional outcomes. Here, we highlight points of convergence and complementarity between HiTOP and computational psychiatry and propose further integration. HiTOP provides an empirically based approach to understanding the structure of psychopathology, but lacks strong explanations of how symptom dimensions are connected to underlying neurocognitive processes. Conversely, computational psychiatry’s emphasis on cognitive processes and multivariate prediction make it well-suited to linking lower level dynamics with symptom variability. Yet, many contemporary computational psychiatry findings lack specificity and validity as a result of a continued reliance on categorical diagnoses. We conclude by highlighting potential barriers that will need to be addressed to maximize the productivity of future collaborative efforts between these initiatives.",

          "abstract": "Because most validated personality measures were designed to capture relatively general and stable characteristics, they do not specify a particular timeframe for respondents to consider. It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week. However, nuances such as lower average scores when referencing the past week should be kept in mind when comparing results between studies using different reference time frames.",

In associative learning, blocking occurs when people learn less about a novel cue in the presence of another causally predictive cue. Here, blocking was examined in a conspiratorial context. In the task, participants were told about a foreign politician and a possible conspiracy: This politician had allegedly been poisoned at a given location. Participants were then presented with a set of pairing between locations and illness; the conspiracy-congruent location was always presented together with a novel location. Learning about this novel location was blocked by the conspiracy-congruent location and, on aggregate, participants endorsed the conspiracy theory. There was, however, no evidence that conspiracy theorists were more likely to demonstrate blocking in general. Conspiracies can thus be acquired and maintained through similar associative-learning processes as other beliefs.",

In recent years, researchers have expanded the study of social impression formation beyond impressions of a single individual and towards how we form impressions of multiple individuals through observing their interactions with each other. Mimicry, as a ubiquitous phenomenon of nonverbal social interaction, is very likely to play a part in the formation of such encounter-based impressions of multiple others. The mimicry and action response video library (MARVL) aims at expanding the possibilities of researchers to study third-party inferences based on observing behavioral mimicry and other nonverbal action-response patterns in dyadic interactions. It provides a set of interaction videos of multiple dyads, both male and female, addresses relevant confounds, and features movements both within and across effector systems (arm and leg movements).

          "abstract": "This study examines emotional tone and linguistic framing in newspaper reports of violent crime, specifically in their evolution across two distinct periods (1995-2000 and 2020-2025) in the UK and USA. Using a mixed-methods design, 560 articles were analysed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool, followed by critical discursive psychology (CDP) on a stratified subset of the data (N = 12). An exploratory factor analysis identified three linguistic factors: Social Moral Framing (SM), Evaluative Structure (ES), and Personal Expressiveness (PE) which were used to predict emotional tone through cross-temporal hierarchical regression. Quantitative results showed ES and PE to consistently predict emotional tone in both timeframes, whereas SM to be the strongest predictor only in the contemporary/later time frame. The qualitative analysis highlighted that recent reporting prioritises moralised and emotionally-charged narratives, with the origin country and political leaning influencing both the style and framing of information. The findings show a shift towards personalised and empathetic coverage from the earlier to the later time periods, providing implications for support regarding rehabilitation, public perceptions of crime, and punitive attitudes. Thus, the dual role of media is prevalent, as an informer and influencer, emphasising the need for ethically responsible reporting that considers psychological and societal impacts of violent crime narratives.",

          "abstract": "Background: Community Mental Health Nursing (CMHN) has gained importance in Switzerland as part of a broader shift toward community-based psychiatric care. While CMHN services are increasingly implemented, empirical evidence on their effectiveness in reducing psychiatric hospitalisations remains limited. This study aims to evaluate the effect of CMHN on psychiatric hospitalisations and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation during CMHN care.\nMethods: We conducted a naturalistic observational study using data from two linked national databases: the HomeCareData register and the Medical Statistics of hospitals. The study included adults who were admitted to CMHN services between January 2020 and December 2022 and whose data was documented in HomeCareData. With mirror-image methods we compared psychiatric hospitalisation rates in equally long pre-index and post-index periods, defined by each individual’s duration of CMHN care, with each participant serving as their own control. The start of CMHN care was defined as the index date. For a sensitivity analysis individuals hospitalized within 60 days before start of CMHN were excluded to address potential regression to the mean effects. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify risk factors of hospitalisation during CMHN care.\nResults: The study sample comprised 5,252 individuals with a mean age of 52 years; 66% were female. The primary mirror-image analysis revealed a significant reduction in psychiatric hospitalisations following the start of CMHN (unadjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.60; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.55–0.65). No significant effect was observed in the sensitivity analysis (unadjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.97; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.87–1.09). Multivariable logistic regression identified previous psychiatric hospitalisations and compulsory admissions as significant risk factors of hospitalisation during CMHN care. Sociodemographic and diagnostic variables showed no significant associations.\nConclusions: This is the first study to show a reduction of psychiatric hospitalisations after participation in CMHN services in Switzerland. However, this effect was not confirmed in the sensitivity analysis which may suggest a regression-to-the mean effect. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using linked routine data to evaluate real-world mental health interventions and underscores the need for broader data coverage and improved documentation to strengthen future research.",

The unprecedented scale and reliance on information disseminated through these systems substantially expand the scope of information-based influence that can both enable and undermine sound decision-making. Consequently, understanding and protecting decision-making today faces growing challenges, as individuals and organizations must navigate evolving opportunities and information-based threats across varied domains and information environments. While these risks are widely recognized, research remains fragmented: work evaluating information-based threat phenomena has progressed largely in isolation from foundational studies of human information processing. In this review, we synthesize insights from both domains to identify shared cognitive mechanisms that mediate vulnerability to information-based threats and shape behavioral outcomes. Finally, we outline directions for future research aimed at integrating these perspectives, emphasizing the importance of such integration for mitigating human vulnerabilities and aligning human-machine representations.",

          "abstract": "Cognition is not a static process but is subject to substantial and meaningful variation within individuals over time. This has led to an increase in studies that aim to describe cognition in daily life by sampling participants repeatedly and remotely. Such studies, which we call high-frequency cognitive assessment or HFCA, tend to use a limited number of brief cognitive tests. This focus on a small number of tests leaves open questions concerning the psychometric characteristics of a wide array of cognitive tasks useful for HFCA that can guide researchers on appropriate task selection. We developed the Cognitive Variability Battery (CVB) a series of 9 cognitive tests clustered into three distinct cognitive domains, attentional control, processing speed, and episodic memory. CVB was administered to participants 3 times per day for 3 weeks. Cognitive tests were rotated to reduce the length of any single testing session. Each test was administered up to 60 times. We provide detailed descriptions of the performance of each task including variability, skew, and reliability statistics using intraclass correlations. We examine the sensitivity of each test to several contextual factors including stress, affect and social interactions. Finally, we provide power analyses on each cognitive test to determine how many assessments and participants are needed to detect effects of interest. These analyses will be essential to anyone seeking to implement HFCA testing in their own research programs by providing guidance on which cognitive tests to select and how many participants and observations may be needed.",

          "abstract": "Social anxiety represents a significant burden to well-being and is characterized by enhanced negative affect in social situations. Affective processes in anxiety are usually investigated as a single response that represents the overall magnitude of affect elicited by an event. However, social events and the emotions that they elicit unfold over time. Importantly, individual differences in temporal dynamics of affect within fear-relevant situations might explain differences in social anxiety symptoms. The first aim of this study was to develop a paradigm to quantify individual differences in within-situation affect dynamics. The second aim was to test whether affect dynamics were associated with social anxiety symptoms. 84 young adults with low to high social anxiety symptoms viewed movie clips of negative, positive, and neutral social situations. They continuously rated their affect while viewing the scenes, and we measured their negative and positive facial expressions over time with facial electromyography (fEMG). Consequently, we could quantify subjective and expressed affect dynamics in terms of intensity, variability, instability, and inertia. Our results showed that affect dynamics unfolded on the timescale of seconds and differed between positive, negative, and neutral situations. Crucially, individuals differed in subjective and expressed dynamics even when viewing the exact same situation. In contrast to our expectations, only intensity but no other affect dynamics was associated with social anxiety. We argue that for comprehensive insights into the affective processes that underlie social anxiety, future research should investigate affect dynamics within fear-relevant situations on short timescales and distinguish between different types of anxiety.",

To quantify the changes, we tracked the adoption of Bayesian inference and open science practices across 15,634 empirical articles from six leading psychology journals over a twenty-year period (2004–2024). Human (50%) and LLM-assisted (50%) full-text coding revealed that in 2024, about 1 in every 4 articles (26%) reported a Bayesian analysis, about 2 in every 5 articles (40%) included a preregistration, and about 3 in every 4 articles (73%) provided open data. From 2004 to 2012, these practices were virtually nonexistent. Application of a Bayesian logistic growth model suggests these practices will continue to rise in the future, although the extent of their growth remains uncertain. In addition, our review revealed that mixed-effects models have become more prevalent; software reporting has improved, with growing use of R alongside a relative decline of SPSS; and that estimation-focused reporting showed only modest gains. Despite considerable heterogeneity between journals, our results present a detailed account of the ways in which articles from 2024 differ methodologically from those that were published only a decade before.",

We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses.

To overcome these weaknesses, we analysed data from a uniquely large and longitudinal dataset containing 191 verbs, collected via an educational online platform from 38,550 Dutch-speaking children aged 8-12 years old, an age range in which errors are still present. We examined whether form-frequency, phonological neighbourhood density (PND), their interaction and telicity predict the verb-specific difficulty of past tense forms in Dutch.  Our findings suggest a key role for form-frequency in the simple past and present perfect, while there is no evidence for PND and telicity.",

But why are some people more likely to experience loneliness than others?\nAttachment theory provides a possible explanation: stable patterns of emotions, cognitions,\nand behaviors rooted in early relationships shape the quality and stability of social\nrelationships throughout life, and consequently, the likelihood of experiencing loneliness.\nWhile previous research has consistently linked insecure attachment orientations to higher\nlevels of loneliness, important questions about the strength, robustness, and moderators of this\nassociation remain open. We addressed these gaps in a meta-analysis of bivariate correlations\nbetween loneliness and attachment orientations, using random-effects robust variance\nestimation. Across 91 publications, 108 independent samples, and 441 effect sizes, we found\na strong and robust association: individuals with higher attachment-related anxiety or\navoidance reported higher levels of loneliness (overall r = .38). Moderator analyses and\nrobustness checks revealed that this association holds across various populations and study\ncharacteristics, including age, gender, relationship status, and sample type. However, the\nstrength of the association varied depending on socio-cultural context and the attachment\nfigures considered. Moreover, we observed differences between loneliness facets and\nattachment dimensions, though these may also reflect scale characteristics rather than to\ngenuine conceptual distinctions. Overall, these findings highlight a substantial association\nbetween attachment insecurity and loneliness and suggest that targeting attachment-related\nvulnerabilities could be crucial for preventing or reducing loneliness.",

We propose that specific dimensions of inner speech—such as egocentricity, intrusiveness, and valence—are systematically altered in BPD. Such alterations may both arise from, and in turn exacerbate, BPD symptoms.

          "abstract": "In social interactions, we constantly need to keep track of both, our own affective states and the affective states of others. We therefore employ mechanisms to distinguish between the mental representations of our own and others’ affective states, which is called affective self-other distinction. Affective self-other distinction may be less effective, leading to an emotional egocentricity bias or an emotional altercentric bias. Deficits in affective self-other distinction are characteristic of several psychopathologies, highlighting the need for reliable and valid measures to understand its cognitive, affective and neural basis. Here, we present a novel paradigm, which uses short videos of the other’s facial expressions, allowing for a direct perception of the other’s feelings, presumably challenging self-other distinction. In a series of studies (including in total n = 125 participants), we show that the paradigm successfully elicits emotional ego- and altercentric biases. Interindividual differences in the emotional egocentricity bias were stable over time, demonstrating that the paradigm can be used to reliably study interindividual differences in affective self-other distinction. The results also indicate that self-salience should be taken into account when interpreting interindividual differences in emotional biases. All paradigm materials are openly available, which will hopefully facilitate future research on affective self-other distinction. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on affective self-other distinction and expand it by elucidating the psychometric properties of emotional ego- and altercentric biases.",

          "authors": "Anaëlle Gonzalez; Darian Harff; Laura Vandenbosch",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ favorite media actors (e.g., influencers, celebrities or sports stars) are known to share political opinions on their social media accounts amid their entertainment and lifestyle content. Through engaging political posts, these actors have the potential to empower the political self-efficacy beliefs of their (young) audiences, but research on such effects is missing. The effects of political content by mediated role models (short: MRMs) on adolescents’ political self-efficacy may further depend on the source (comparing influencers and celebrities/athletes) and users’ level of elaborate political information processing on social media. However, knowledge of these potential boundary conditions is lacking. A three-wave panel study among 648 French adolescents (Mage = 15.21, SDage = 1.89, 56.6% girls) in 2021-22 addressed these research gaps. The between-person results from the random-intercept cross-lagged panel models showed that higher trait-like levels of exposure to the political content of a favorite role model were significantly related to higher trait-like levels of political self-efficacy. None of the explored reciprocal relationships emerged on the within-person level, and neither the type of role model nor the elaborate processing of political information moderated the relationships.",

We use AI-driven tools to track children's physical proximity and their corresponding referential expressions. Quantitative analyses reveal that when children are closer together, they tend to use less explicit referential forms, whereas greater distance is associated with more explicit lexical forms. The relationship between distance and referential form usage is highly dynamic, with distinct patterns emerging at different developmental stages. The linear mixed-effects models reveal that children employ both stable, context-dependent usage patterns across all ages, and that some of these patterns undergo significant developmental change. This study demonstrates the power of integrating motion analysis with corpus-based linguistics to unravel the multimodal fabric of early peer interaction, illuminating how synchronized interaction evolves in parallel with communicative skills and underlying cognitive development.",

          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

          "abstract": "Personality is highly consequential for important life outcomes, and many people are motivated to change aspects of their personality. This implies a high potential for volitional personality change interventions, which are on the rise. However, their effect sizes tend to be small and heterogeneous. A key reason may be that intervention designs remain largely disconnected from current work on dynamics relevant to personality change. We argue that personality interventions should be enriched by work on personality dynamics, which focuses on momentary states and their patterns (mean-level, variability, state-state associations, situational contingencies, temporal dynamics). We outline three opportunities for more effective personality interventions incorporating personality dynamics. First, dynamics can serve as novel targets of intervention, representing key mechanisms underlying personality change (e.g., decreasing stress reactivity in neuroticism interventions). Second, dynamics can be used to personalize interventions at a between-person level (e.g., promoting person-specific activities associated with desired states). Third, dynamics can be used as momentary within-person triggers of adaptive interventions (e.g., encouraging the planning of social activities following a day with little social contact). Key advantages of the proposed approach include potentially more effective, safer, and more inclusive interventions with stronger downstream effects on life outcomes. We provide guidance on the methodological implementation and discuss limitations and future directions. Ultimately, leveraging personality dynamics could enable a novel generation of personality interventions.",

          "abstract": "Parental burnout, which includes emotional exhaustion, emotional distance, and feeling fed up with parenting, is a chronic and potentially debilitating stress condition that has become highly prevalent in Western countries. Yet uncertainty remains about parents’ daily experience of burnout and how their experiences interact with their family environment. In this study, we surveyed a sample of 40 parents (who felt overwhelmed and exhausted by parenting) daily for eight weeks about their experiences of parental burnout, interactions with their children, and family environment, yielding 1541 total observations; main analyses focus on 36 mothers. We estimated a multilevel vector autoregressive model and created three distinct graphical networks to best reveal the dynamics of these interactions. All models point to interactions with children as a key determinant in the parent’s daily experience of parental burnout—particularly predicting emotional distance and feeling fed up. At the temporal level, parental burnout symptoms were characterized by strong self-prediction (autoregression). In addition, the severity of parental burnout was negatively correlated with daily variation of parental burnout features. Together, these results suggest that mothers in a severe state of burnout are less sensitive to their context, with the exception of interactions with their children.",

The results showed that: ① The themes distribution of student DT tends to follow a power-law distribution; ② The semantic similarity (SS) quartiles of divergent thinking are generally consistent, but there are significant fluctuations in the outlier value region, which may indicate that the so-called \"Divergent\" of DT is more reflected on the outlier value side; ③ The fluctuation of SS is mainly influenced by the number of theme topics, and is not significantly affected by the sample size.",

          "abstract": "Developing expertise when learning a motor sequence involves optimization of bodily movement. Although there is understanding of the stages of learning development from reactive responses to accurate and well-represented sequence performance, very little is known about the contribution of movement variability for learning. Fractal scaling can quantify the complexity of variability in learning behavior, yet motor sequence learning studies have not applied it. These results could offer valuable insights for profiling learners in real-world settings. The aim of this study was to understand fractal scaling differences in movement kinematics between learners of different expertise levels performing the Dance Discrete Sequence Performance task. We recorded Centre of Mass accelerations using a lower-body seven sensor setup with the Movella Xsens MVN Awinda and extracted Hurst Exponents of the accelerations as a representation of fractal complexity, between 11 High and 11 Low expertise learners (top 50% versus bottom 50% percentile). The results of the mixed effects models showed significant differences with increased fractal scaling during preparation, but decreased scaling during movement periods for the High expertise group. Our findings show that differences in fractal scaling can quantify motor learning expertise and their contribution to learning for different phases of the task.",

This editorial synthesizes expert discussions from the First Theoretical and Applied Advances in Motor Learning Conference to address key issues impeding further progress. We are hampered by the science of averages, characterized by an over-reliance on data from homogenous, Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) populations and a flawed assumption of cognitive uniformity. This approach masks critical individual differences, limiting the translational potential of our science and leading to one-size-fits-all enhancement strategies. We propose a multi-tiered roadmap for the maturation of our field. The foundational priorities are structural: embracing co-creation with diverse communities, moving beyond WEIRD science, and implementing structured mentorship and active sponsorship to empower a new generation of scholars. Building on this, we advocate for technology-driven individualisation like using advanced Mobile Brain/Body Imaging techniques for the development of neurophenotypes, to fulfill the potential of Brain-Computer Interfaces. Finally, we call for a precision enhancement framework, shifting from learning boosters to a diagnostic-to-prescriptive model that targets specific, identified bottlenecks. This roadmap allows our field to build upon its foundational principles to create a more effective, accessible, and equitable motor learning science for all.",

The literature on paediatric gender-affirming care has paid little attention to non-binary young people’s clinical presentations, including their desires for gender-affirming interventions.\n\nObjective. To describe the gender-related presentation of non-binary children and adolescents first attending a paediatric gender clinic, exploring differences based on birth-registered sex and between young people with non-binary and binary identities.\n\nDesign. In this cross-sectional study, young people and a parent/caregiver completed online questionnaires prior to their first appointment between Feb 2017-Dec 2023. Analyses were conducted in January 2025.\n\nSetting. Multidisciplinary gender clinic at a public children’s hospital in Victoria, Australia. \nParticipants. Of those attending an initial appointment (n=2,303), those included in the analytic sample had available questionnaire data (n=2,138) and reported a gender identity that discorded with their birth-registered sex (n=1,745). \n\nMain Outcomes and Measures. Validated measures assessed gender dysphoria, body image, embodiment goals, gender-diverse behaviour, voice dysphoria and chest dysphoria. Gender identity was assessed on the Gender Slider, and social transition via reported changes to presentation, name and pronouns.\n\nResults. The ratio of non-binary to binary young people increased over time, from 1:6 in 2017 to 1:1.6 in 2023. The non-binary group exhibited high levels of body dissatisfaction (m=3.3; 95% CI=3.3,3.4) and gender dysphoria (m=42.0; 95% CI=41.2,42.8). They reported similar levels of gender dysphoria to binary young people (m diff=0.3; 95% CI=-2.3,2.9) and slightly less body dissatisfaction (m diff=-0.3; 95% CI=-0.4,-0.2). Among non-binary people, medical/surgical change to breasts was desired most frequently of all body characteristics (90.1%, n=263). Fewer non-binary than binary individuals reported desires to medically/surgically change their body characteristics [e.g. breasts (% diff=-7.5; 95% CI=-11.1,-3.9)]. Some differences were also observed between non-binary young people assigned female at birth and assigned male at birth [e.g., desire to change body hair (% diff=-39.1; 95% CI= -51.7,-26.5)]. Further between-group differences were observed regarding gender-diverse behaviour and social transition.\n\nConclusions and Relevance. Non-binary children and adolescents accessing gender-affirming care experience significant gender dysphoria, body dissatisfaction and desires for medical/surgical affirmation. While it is important for clinicians to be aware of potential differences in clinical presentation based on gender identity, an individualized, person-centered approach remains priority.",

The smartwatch collected multimodal physiological and behavioral signals (e.g., heart rate, movement), while the smartphone delivered seven randomly timed ecological momentary assessments per day to capture state anxiety. These multimodal data formed the basis for anxiety modeling. We present a weakly supervised multimodal framework that trains a base model on a public dataset, then transfers learning and personalizes predictions via meta-learning.

While the use of this controversial mode of punishment might be justifiable from a consequentialist perspective, its effectiveness as well as factors affecting individuals’ endorsement of its use are largely unexplored. Focusing on dishonesty and rule breaking as two prominent examples of unethical and often illegal behavior, we herein address these gaps by testing the effectiveness and endorsement of collective punishment across six preregistered experiments and survey studies with samples from three countries (overall N = 11,020). Exploring the role of inter-individual differences, we tested whether the HEXACO dimensions and the Dark Factor of Personality (D) interact with the implementation of collective punishment in predicting dishonesty and relate to the endorsement of collective punishment (in context of the COVID-19 pandemic). Our results provide substantive evidence for the effectiveness of collective punishment. Further, both honesty-humility and D predicted dishonesty irrespective of the presence of collective punishment, while individuals high (vs. low) in emotionality reacted more to the implementation of collective punishment and more strongly endorsed its use. Combined, these results provide important implications for the evaluation and consideration of collective punishment, including the role of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "This article advances the debate on artificial intelligence (AI) use in education by moving beyond the mechanistic notion of prompt engineering and the human-centered focus of prevailing AI-literacy frameworks. We introduce prompting (l)iteracy, a sociotechnical capacity that is simultaneously iterative (built through cycles of prompt revision and reflection) and critical (attuned to the economic logics, linguistic hierarchies, and distributed agencies that shape AI dialogue). Four theoretical lenses scaffold the concept: (1) post-Fordist political economy explains how each prompt exploits commodified linguistic labor embedded in large language models; (2) Bourdieu’s linguistic-capital thesis illuminates the social inequities likely reproduced by differential prompting proficiency; (3) Latour’s actor-network theory highlights non-human agency, as humans do not only prompt AI, but they are also prompted by AI; and (4) de Certeau’s tactics foreground users’ creative appropriations and resistances. Vignettes of AI interactions illustrate these dimensions and expose the twin pitfalls of techno-solutionism and techno-pessimism. We argue that future research must abandon self-report surveys in favor of authentic, trace-centered mixed methods that record authentic prompt–response logs and machine telemetry. Prompting (l)iteracy thus offers a richer analytic lens for understanding, and ultimately mitigating, AI-mediated educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "Attentional bias to drug-related cues is widely considered a core feature of addiction, yet its empirical detection is highly sensitive to task design and stimulus selection. In this study, we used a computer mouse-tracking paradigm to examine attentional bias toward cigarette-related, pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral images in 96 participants (49 smokers, 47 nonsmokers). Trajectory deviation, measured via maximum absolute deviation (MAD), served as an index of attentional bias. Both groups showed stronger bias for emotionally salient distractors, especially pleasant images, highlighting how the inclusion of emotionally matched control stimuli could reveal overlooked confounds in addiction research. Contrary to expectations, smokers did not exhibit greater attentional bias to cigarette cues than nonsmokers. Prior work has identified individual differences in cue reactivity among smokers. To investigate whether similar differences were present here, we applied k-means clustering to the MAD data. This analysis revealed two subgroups of smokers: one selectively biased toward cigarette cues, and another more reactive to pleasant stimuli. We replicated these results in an independent sample of 85 smokers. This dissociation aligns with prior neuroimaging findings, and suggests that the mouse-tracking paradigm may serve as a scalable, cost-effective tool for detecting reliable individual differences in reactivity to drug-related and non-drug-related pleasant stimuli.",

          "abstract": "The present study is a direct replication and extension of Fogel and Kovalenko’s (2013) work on the association between viewing reality television (TV) and engaging in one-night stands among college students. Using an online survey, a total of 686 Canadian university students provided comprehensive data on their reality TV consumption patterns, sexual attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Our results replicated several findings from Fogel and Kovalenko (2013), such that participants who reported engaging in one-night stands within the past year demonstrated higher scores on measures of sexual empowerment, sexual permissiveness, and perceived realism of reality show content. Demographic factors such as ethnicity and relationship status were also associated with one-night stand engagement. Additionally, compared to viewers of dating reality TV, viewers of sexual reality TV reported stronger parasocial connections, greater interest in characters, and perceived the show as more realistic. Our results suggest that while reality TV consumption is associated with one-night stand engagement, there are additional factors associated with this outcome and the causal relationship cannot yet be established. We conclude that a broader perspective is needed when assessing reality TV viewership that includes individual and contextual factors.\n\nKeywords: reality television, sexual behaviors, replication, open science",

This systematic scoping review aimed to (1) provide a critical assessment of the methodologies, identify (2) relevant predictors of PA and diet throughout the cycle based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and (3) knowledge gaps. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched from inception until September 2024. Peer-reviewed English publications were included if they reported on PA or diet and TDF constructs in relation to the menstrual cycle in biological female populations of reproductive age currently not suffering from conditions impairing PA or diet. Of 9,247 screened records, 36 were included, comprising 28 primary studies and 9 reviews. The TDF component of emotions was the most explored in both diet and PA studies, although the latter investigated a broader range of constructs (e.g., social influences, attention). The menstrual phase, pain and bleeding impaired PA and performance. The results on diet remained inconclusive. Small samples, cross-sectional designs, heterogeneity of menstrual cycle assessments and a lack of explicit sex-based recruitment limit generalizability. Gaps include several TDF constructs (e.g., self-efficacy). Longitudinal designs and objective assessments of the menstrual cycle and behaviours in larger heterogeneous samples are needed.",

          "abstract": "The number of available response options is a central design feature in any experimental psychology paradigm, with binary response paradigms restricting the range of behavioural responses into staying or shifting. Participants (n = 72) played nine blocks of a novel zero-sum game, Dice Dual, while we parametrically manipulated the different number of response options (2, 4, 6) against an unexploitable computerized opponent. When the number of responses exceeded two, this allowed us to identify two types of shift behaviours: between-category shifts relevant to mental model exploitation, and, within-category shifts reflective of random exploration. Between-category shifts were sensitive to outcome valence, exhibiting an increased shift rate when more response options were available after-win, while shift rates were independent of response availability after-loss. In contrast, within-category shifts were only sensitive to response availability, with increased shift rates when more response options were available, irrespective of outcome valence. Identifying multiple, functionally different classes of shift behaviour using non-binary response paradigms allows us to more easily separate attempts at exploitation and exploration. The data also offer more general models of performance regarding sub-optimal decision-making, where negative outcomes constrict the range of factors considered in future mental model updates.",

          "abstract": "Efficient manual interactions rely on predictive cues to object weight. While familiar cues (e.g., size) readily support motor planning, it is unclear whether newly learned cues can enhance performance in demanding tasks. Understanding the predictive utility of novel cues has implications for sensory augmentation. We investigated this using a goal-directed hitting task, where participants earned a performance-based reward for squashing virtual bugs. Targets appeared briefly at unpredictable locations on a touchscreen, and participants used light and heavy containers to squash the bugs. Container weight was signaled with a familiar (visual volume), novel (checkerboard patterns), or no cue (identical containers). The number of bugs hit was highest with the familiar cue, followed by the novel cue, and smallest with no cue. Response time followed a corresponding pattern: movements were fastest with the familiar cue, followed by the novel cue, and slowest with no cue. No differences were found in precision, but constant bias was highest with the novel cue, followed by no cue, and smallest with the familiar cue. These findings demonstrate that novel cues, though less effective than familiar ones, can be rapidly integrated to guide efficient motor behavior, suggesting their potential for augmenting human performance in real-world tasks.",

          "abstract": "Personality pathology often emerges in adolescence—a period marked by increasing autonomy and complex peer dynamics —but its moment-to-moment interpersonal expression remains poorly understood. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female; ages 12–21) across 13,190 real-world interactions over 14 days. Using the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we examined how maladaptive traits (Criterion B) relate to interpersonal functioning (Criterion A), operationalized via momentary reports of mentalizing, enacted warmth and dominance, and perceptions of others’ warmth and dominance. Multilevel structural equation modeling revealed that self-reported maladaptive traits predicted lower perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, trait pathology was unrelated to average mentalizing but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Different pathological traits were associated with distinct patterns in how moment\nto-moment mentalizing related to interpersonal behavior, with some traits strengthening rather than weakening these associations. These domain-specific patterns indicate that personality pathology affects not only overall interpersonal functioning but also shows distinct coordination patterns between social cognition and behavior. Our findings illustrate how adolescent personality pathology manifests in everyday social interactions, highlighting the need for interventions that target both mean levels and variability in social processes to stabilize momentary social cognition and promote affiliation over control.",

Across 34 countries purposefully sampled to cover a broad set of cross-cultural differences (total N = 10,772), we experimentally tested the effects of 6 popular gratitude practices on subjective moods, life outlooks, and social evaluations. Consistent with multiple theoretical accounts, gratitude practices produced immediate (but small) improvements in positive affect (d = 0.36), negative affect (d = -0.22), optimism (d = 0.24), life satisfaction (d = 0.11), indebtedness (d = 0.15), and envy (d = -0.16). Notably, these effects varied across different gratitude practices (0.00 &lt; τpractice &lt; 0.08) and countries (0.10 &lt; τcountry &lt; 0.19). For instance, based on existing evidence, stakeholders can expect gratitude interventions deployed in a randomly-selected country to improve positive affect – but not our other measured outcomes.

Regression analyses revealed few differences in mental health severity and barriers to accessing campus services between most REM subgroups and white students. Most REM subgroups reported lower rates of substance use, greater awareness of campus services, and found services more helpful relative to white students. Sexually minoritized students reported greater severity of mental health symptoms and more barriers to accessing campus services relative to heterosexual students.

          "abstract": "Increasing evidence demonstrates an association between social isolation and psychosis risk. In this perspective, we attempt to account for why that is. Drawing from work in social psychology, social neuroscience, and clinical psychological science, we present two frameworks for understanding the association between social isolation and psychosis risk: the social needs framework and the social processing framework. Social needs states that due to people’s inherent social needs, isolation produces increased social attention, perception, and thought to fill the social void, resulting in the perception of anomalous social information and social meaning. Social processing states that the lack of exposure to social stimuli during isolation diminishes social processing (i.e., social thought, social perceptions), and may lead isolated individuals to turn their attention inwards, blurring internal and external worlds in a way that creates reality monitoring disturbances and anomalous self-experiences. Conveniently, these frameworks can be empirically arbitrated. We review the literature connecting social isolation to psychosis, the frameworks, their empirical support, and the predictions they make. Ultimately, a better accounting of isolation’s pro-psychotic effects might lead to better efforts at psychosis prevention.",

Despite the pervasive nature of PES, its functional significance, developmental trajectory, and relation with error processing in middle childhood are still debated. This study examined how PES changes throughout middle childhood and relates to neural markers of error processing, Pe amplitude and midfrontal theta (MFT) power. Participants aged 5-12 years (n = 182, 41.8% = female) completed a task-switching paradigm where response times (RTs) and electrophysiological (EEG) data were collected. PES increased with age, primarily on repeat trials. Pe increased after errors in 11-12-year-olds, but not younger children, whereas MFT was elevated post-error across all age groups. MFT power modestly correlated with Pe and, importantly, predicted PES. Greater PES and more efficient error processing with age suggest that PES reflects adaptive adjustment of cognitive control. \nKeywords: Post-error slowing (PES), error monitoring, cognitive control, Pe, midfrontal theta power, middle childhood.",

          "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is typically characterized by executive dysfunction, yet emerging evidence points to spatially asymmetrical features of cognition. We examined whether transsaccadic working memory (tWM), the mechanism that integrates visual and motor signals across eye movements, shows directional vulnerability in ADHD. Participants with ADHD completed a spatial tWM task in which memory arrays (one or three items) were presented before leftward, rightward, or fixation trials, and repositioned a probe to the remembered target location. For comparison, data from a previously tested neurotypical sample were included in group-level analyses. Errors were decomposed into systematic and unsystematic components. Compared to controls, ADHD participants showed a modest but reliable rightward-saccade disadvantage, with greater systematic distortions after rightward than leftward eye movements. Saccades disrupted working memory in both groups, but the typical load-dependent increase in unsystematic error observed in neurotypical participants was absent in ADHD. Two complementary interpretations may account for this asymmetry. The integration-imbalance hypothesis attributes it to weakened right-hemisphere contributions to spatial working memory, which impair integration of left-hemisphere oculomotor and right-hemisphere spatial signals during rightward saccades. Alternatively, the anchoring-disruption hypothesis suggests that rightward eye movements destabilize the spatial scaffold anchoring remembered locations, producing geometric distortions without increased error. Together, these findings identify a direction-specific fragility of visuomotor-cognitive coupling in ADHD not explained by general capacity limits. More broadly, they reveal a partial neglect-like pattern of transsaccadic vulnerability: selective impairment for rightward saccades without a left-field deficit—highlighting the utility of oculomotor paradigms for revealing hidden spatial asymmetries in neurocognitive function.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Aphasia rehabilitation increasingly emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms and ingredients underlying behavioral interventions. Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) is a commonly-used intervention for anomia in aphasia but there is little evidence directly examining its active ingredients. Using within-trial responses during SFA, we sought to explore how generating semantic features might facilitate naming improvements. \n\nMethod: A retrospective analysis evaluated data collected from a clinical trial focused on intensive SFA treatment for individuals with chronic aphasia. The study included 44 adults with chronic aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke. A pre-trained semantic model was used to estimate the semantic relatedness between  features and targets.\n\nResults: Participants were 2.6 (95% CI: [2.16, 3.12]) times more likely to correctly name target words after engaging in feature generation. Each additional feature generated was associated with a three percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.2, 0.4]) in the probability of a correct response at the end of the trial; a one standard deviation increase in semantic similarity (i.e., feature quality) was associated with a six percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.4, 0.10]). Model comparison favored semantic similarity over feature generation count in predicting final response accuracy.\n\nConclusions: Findings provide converging evidence that semantic feature generation is an active ingredient in SFA treatment, emphasizing the importance of feature quantity and semantic quality, consistent with a spreading activation account of SFA’s benefits. Further research is warranted to validate relatedness values from semantic model embeddings, and to explore the relationship between within-trial feature generation and generalization to semantically related but untreated words.",

          "abstract": "Aims: It is generally believed that the younger the age of first alcohol consumption, the higher the risk of developing physical/psychosocial alcohol related problems, but not all studies support this association. Differences among findings may stem from heterogeneity in the definitions of alcohol initiation and its operationalization. This problem has already been recognized in the literature, but it is unclear whether recent studies have taken steps to improve this issue. In this context, we investigate current practices in inquiring about alcohol initiation. Methods: Our goal was to obtain a representative sample of recent publications and to review the questions used to assess alcohol initiation in studies with children/adolescents. To that aim, we searched PubMed for empirical studies published between 2018 and 2024 on early alcohol use and which claimed to have assessed alcohol initiation. Findings: Our search returned a total of 523 documents, of which 59 met our eligibility criteria. Overall, the questions used to assess what constituted alcohol initiation varied widely in terms of the quantity of alcohol consumed, from just one or a few sips to at least a full drink, with some studies having no definition of alcohol initiation and many failing to define alcohol and/or doses. Only 17 studies enquired about context of use, focusing on excluding drinking in religious ceremonies and parental consent. Conclusion: Definitions of alcohol initiation remain highly heterogeneous and sub-optimal in terms of clarity in respect of the quantity/context of alcohol consumption. We suggest a comprehensive and standardized set of questions to change this state of affairs.",

Using both person (N=392) and activity (N=1,179) level data, preregistered analyses tested whether hedonic and eudaimonic well-being emerge from alignment among these systems rather than from their independent effects. Type of activity engaged in showed no significant main effects (ps &gt; .15), whereas hedonic and eudaimonic motives were associated with corresponding forms of well-being (βs = .34–.59, ps &lt; .001). We found a motive–orientation congruence interaction for social well-being (β = .14, p = .015), and four small but interpretable personality–motive interactions (βs = ±.03–.09, ps &lt; .05) indicated that traits such as openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism calibrate motivational benefits. Collectively, the findings suggest that motivational coherence may represent a particularly consistent pathway to flourishing, advancing an understanding of well-being that sets the stage for further longitudinal tests of flourishing fit.",

We found discrepant decreasing and increasing prospective effects and a meta-analytic aggregation of these discrepant effects did not differ significantly from zero. Moreover, a good fit of the spurious prospective associations model (SPAM) indicated that the meta-analytic data may have been generated without any direct effects between peer relationships and internet addiction. Hence, we conclude that the meta-analytic data does not support conclusions of decreasing prospective effects between peer relationships and internet addiction.

          "abstract": "People’s choices involving money, health, and other matters can often be steered toward safer or riskier options by framing the options as gains or losses. This risky-choice framing effect is well established, but its direction and magnitude depend on whether the options are described completely or incompletely and whether the descriptions are matched or mismatched (in terms of good and bad outcomes) in the gain and loss frames. In a recent experiment involving 18 combinations of option descriptions (nine in each frame), DeKay and Dou (2024) found that the valence or gist of the descriptions accounted for substantial variation in risk preferences, favoring categorical theories of framing over more mathematical theories. However, a residual framing effect and a framing effect in choices between completely described options contradicted the categorical theories and previous results. The effect for completely described options was especially surprising, but it was based on data from only 97 participants. The experiment reported here replicated all these effects in a large sample (N \"=\" 1,697) well-matched to U.S. Census data and with many more participants (477) making choices between completely described options. Risky-choice framing effects do stem partly from mismatched option descriptions, but a framing effect persists even when descriptions are matched and complete. The latter results expand the effect’s relevance to situations where it was thought to be absent. Among several theory specifications, only a new rescaled version of the explicated valence account explains these effects in the replication and in DeKay and Dou’s online and student samples.",

Additionally, we found that participants' rating of a sentence's perceived rhythmicity predicted response times to the sentence.

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and wearable devices afford opportunities to collect real-time data on events experienced in daily life. Examples of event-based data in the psychological and behavioral sciences include smoking a cigarette, experiencing a stressor, having a disruption to sleep, experiencing a depressive or manic episode, drinking an alcoholic beverage, or engaging in a bout of exercise. The increasing availability of dense sampling approaches allows for the measurement of such events at relatively fast time-scales (e.g., occurring across minutes, hours, days, or weeks), expanding the possibilities for how time can be conceptualized and modeled. Survival analysis is a modeling approach that allows researchers to address scientific questions regarding whether and when events occur in time. Although not often applied to EMA data, there are myriad research questions relevant to psychosocial and behavioral scientists which can be addressed using survival analysis. This article provides an overview of survival analysis, describes several time-based considerations for modeling event-based EMA data using survival analysis, and provides several illustrative examples of the different time-based considerations. Altogether, the goals of this article are to enhance knowledge of the types of research questions that can be examined using survival analysis, to illustrate nuances of applying the method to EMA data, and to spark ideas for future empirical and methodological research.",

          "authors": "Rachael Corbett; Zayba Ghazali-Mohammed",
          "abstract": "Neuroscientific research has shown that structural and functional adaptations occur in the maternal brain during matrescence: a neurodevelopmental period in which neural refinement within and between brain regions is thought to prepare mothers to acquire the skills required for caregiving. Nevertheless, societal stereotypes frame pregnancy and postpartum as a period of cognitive decline. Whilst objective evidence of impairment is mixed, subjective reports of cognitive decline persist. This study therefore qualitatively explored maternal cognitive changes through the lens of matrescence as an adaptive developmental process, without a deficit-focus. Eight mothers took part in one-to-one audio recorded semi-structured online interviews, in the United Kingdom, during December 2024. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to examine participants’ lived experiences, resulting in three overarching themes (1) the overloaded brain (2) thinking beyond the self (3) solidarity. The findings highlight that maternal cognition cannot be fully understood through objective measures alone. Societal expectations and the availability of meaningful support inform how mothers makes sense of their experiences, making cognitive changes inseparable from their social context.",

However, they did not evaluate this model. In our contexts, capstone projects require a higher level of individualisation. Furthermore, project students value choice, autonomy, and ownership. Consequently, we’ve iteratively developed a variation of Heyman and Vanpaemel’s model in which students choose their own effect/dataset for an individual multiverse capstone project. \nObjective: To evaluate student-led individual multiverse capstone projects. \nMethod: One cohort of five project students qualitatively reflected on designing, running, and reporting an individual multiverse project in a small group supervision context. We thematically analysed these reflections.\nFindings: Two themes captured (a) the factors promoting project success (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual) and (b) the outcomes of a multiverse capstone project (the range of skills developed and multiverse’s potential contributions to psychology).\nConclusion: Individual multiverse projects are a meaningful, desk-based alternative to traditional capstone projects, and address many key undergraduate research methods learning outcomes.\nTeaching Implications: We propose an evidence-based ‘recipe’ for successful individual multiverse projects. In a post-COVID world, all project supervisors should have possibilities like this ‘up their sleeves’.",

This study aimed to contribute to the literature by directly gauging incivility, over time, in a non-U.S. context. A preregistered longitudinal content analysis of 34 televised election debates in the Netherlands in the period 1981-2023 was conducted. This dataset included 9,159 speech acts by 68 unique politicians. The results showed that, although most speech acts were classified as civil, the prevalence of political incivility in Dutch televised election debates did increase in the second half of the investigated time period. In addition, incivility was associated with the speaker’s party’s populism, but not gender and incumbency status, and was more likely when a previous comment had been uncivil. Finally, incivility was more prevalent in debates or debate segments featuring only two, rather than three or more, politicians. Potential causes of the increase of incivility in recent years, such as the rise of populism, are discussed.",

          "authors": "Sofia Calderon; Erik Mac Giolla; Karl Ask; Timothy John Luke",
          "abstract": "Construal level theory (CLT) proposes that psychological distance influences the level of abstraction at which something is mentally construed: things perceived as less probable (likelihood) or further away from the here (spatial distance), now (temporal distance), or self (social distance) are thought about more abstractly. This international multi-lab study tests four basic hypotheses derived from core assumptions of CLT and explores potential moderators and boundary conditions of the effects. Participants (N = 11,775) from 27 countries and regions were randomly assigned to one of four experimental protocols focused on different types of psychological distance (temporal, spatial, social, or likelihood), and each experiment manipulated psychological distance (close vs. distant). The protocols for temporal distance (N = 2,941) and spatial distance (N = 2,973) were direct replications of Liberman and Trope (1998, Study 1) and Fujita et al. (2006, Study 1), respectively. The remaining two protocols were paradigmatic replications, applying to social distance (N = 2,926) and likelihood (N = 2,936). The effects of psychological distance on construal level for the four present studies were (original effects within parentheses; positive effects are consistent with hypotheses): dtemporal = 0.08, 95% CI [0.003, 0.16] (cf. d = 0.92); dspatial = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.11] (cf. d = 0.55); dsocial = -0.27, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.19]; and dlikelihood = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.11]. Pretests indicated that valence and abstraction were confounded in response options on the outcome measure. Controlling for this confound eliminated the hypothesis-inconsistent effect of social distance, d = 0.006, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.07]. These findings provide limited evidence for the predictions of the theory and present a critical challenge for CLT.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Mental health concerns are rising, particularly among post-secondary students, who may lack access to traditional therapeutic resources due to barriers like long wait times and high costs. To help address these challenges, we explored the potential of large language model-based chatbots for supporting mental health and wellbeing in student populations.\n\nMethods: We conducted two studies, lasting one week and four weeks, to examine the effectiveness of chatbot interventions over different durations. Both studies compared two chatbot interventions—one mindfulness-focused and one value-focused—against an active check-in-only control condition. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in wellbeing through the mindfulness-to-meaning (MM) pathway, a process in which enhanced decentering, the ability to see one’s experience from a wider perspective, leads to improved positive reappraisal, the ability to find constructive and empowered interpretations of experience.\n\nResults: All conditions showed evidence of stress reduction. However, compared to the active control group, both intervention styles at both durations resulted in improved wellbeing via the MM pathway. This effect was primarily driven by significant improvements in decentering. For the longer duration only, we also observed enhanced reappraisal. \n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the potential of chatbot-based interventions to support the development of regulatory skills by leveraging the MM pathway to enhance mental health. Educational institutions and mental health providers might consider integrating such tools into scalable and accessible student support systems, addressing a broader and more diverse audience while promoting sustained wellbeing through skills development.",

It is currently unknown whether daily deviations in cognitive performance have implications for real-world behaviors or merely reflect short-term change of limited scope, perhaps due to assessment artifacts. Daily driving behavior was captured in a group of adults using GPS tracking and participants also completed daily repeated assessments of high frequency cognitive testing. Multilevel negative binomial models were constructed to relate daily cognitive performance to adverse driving events (e.g., speeding or hard braking). Results indicate that on days when cognition is poor relative to the participants’ average functioning, incidence of adverse events increased. Global cognitive ability did not predict driving behavior. These results show that deviations in cognitive performance are not merely “noise”, as they have measurable implications on real-world outcomes that may have implications for driver safety.",

The aim of our studies was to replicate Mueller’s methods and extend her work by evaluating whether membership in animal-focused youth programs moderate any associations between interactions, attitudes, and positive youth development. We did not find strong relationships among human-animal interaction and positive youth development, which failed to replicate Mueller’s findings. However, we did find relationships between animal attitudes and positive youth development, replicating Mueller’s findings. Membership in animal-focused youth programs did not moderate any observed effects. Thus, though animal attitudes are associated with positive youth development, membership in a youth program does not seem to enhance these relationships, and human-animal interactions do not seem to have strong associations with positive youth development.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened emotionality. Past research indicated that the biased interpretation of social situations (i.e., interpretation bias) might contribute to these aberrant affect dynamics in adolescents’ daily life. Social situations are, however, constantly changing. Therefore, the ability to flexibly revise social interpretations (i.e., interpretation flexibility) might be equally important as interpretation biases for explaining affective outcomes during adolescence. The present study examined whether interpretation bias and inflexibility predicted two major affect dynamics features (i.e., mean and standard deviation) in children and adolescents. At baseline, N = 154 children and adolescents (M = 12.81 years; 48.70% female; 49.35% male; 1.95% non-binary; 72.08% White) completed a task assessing bias and inflexibility in interpreting social situations. Then, for 28 days, participants rated their positive and negative affect. Results showed that inflexibility in revising positive and negative interpretations in light of disconfirming evidence predicted higher intensity of negative affect. When controlling for interpretation inflexibility, positive interpretation bias predicted higher positive affect, whereas negative interpretation bias was associated with more variable negative affect. The results emphasize the predictive utility of interpretation biases and inflexibility for daily affective experiences in youths.",

These classes predicted cognitive decline over time but were unrelated to changes in the microstructure of the cerebellar peduncles in a subsample of 60 individuals for whom sufficient longitudinal neuroimaging data was available. \nDISCUSSION: There are substantial individual differences in NPS trajectories. Distinguishing classes of NPS trajectories is important to predict cognitive decline.",

Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals\ntoo slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons.\nA popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback\nfrom higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields.\nThis paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings:\nthe conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly\nwith the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual\ninfluences.

Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. \nSample: Participants were 135 Undergraduate Psychology students.  \nMethods: Participants completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. They were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Self-reported motivation was measured.  \nResults: Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation differed depending on whether gestures were present: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning gains primarily when they also reported higher motivation to study further, whereas the presence of gestures was associated with more consistent learning gains across motivation levels. \nConclusion: These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks achieve impressive success in many vision tasks. Nevertheless, previous work has suggested that their representation of geometric shapes only partially captures the representations found in humans, who additionally require a symbolic “language of geometry”. In this study, we evaluate the progress in this area by systematically comparing human performance in three geometric shape perception tests, with the predictions of recent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, varying in size, training datasets and training methods, to recognize and process geometric shapes and compare these representations to the ones found in humans. In two tasks probing quadrilateral and geometric shape perception, introduced by Sable-Meyer et al. (2022, 2025), recent neural networks exhibit representations similar to humans and predict human performance better than a symbolic model. In a third task, involving geometric drawings, the networks still fell short of human performance. Across the three experiments, the main factor driving similarity between human and neural network representations was the size of the training dataset, rather than a specific architecture or the number of parameters of the model. Together, our results show that a massive scaling-up of the training data helps neural networks approximate human-like representations of geometric shapes, but that they still fall short of fully capturing the human representations of geometric shape.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) promise an opportunity to streamline and automate this process. However, there is currently little experience or practical insight into how such automated workflows can be implemented in research practice. In this article, we illustrate an LLM-based abstract screening workflow using a set of human-rated abstracts from a recent meta-analysis. We describe how we developed and evaluated different prompting strategies and structured output formats, compared the performance of multiple LLMs, quantified model uncertainty, and automated the entire workflow within the R environment. We also provide R scripts and implementation guidance to support psychological researchers in adopting LLM-based workflows for research synthesis. Our comparisons show how different types of LLMs vary in accuracy relative to human raters, and how prompting strategies and hyperparameter settings affect model performance and uncertainty. We demonstrate that LLM-assisted screening can substantially reduce the time and cost of review preparation while maintaining accuracy comparable to human raters. At the same time, we emphasize that this work represents an initial step, and that continued refinement and validation are essential as LLM technologies and their applications continue to evolve rapidly.",

A key feature of games is their potential to reframe failure as a learning opportunity, supposedly leading to persistent engagement and competence. This study empirically tested this idea by developing a platformer game in two versions: one with regular checkpoints (resulting in less negative consequences of failure) and one without (resulting in more negative consequences of failure, i.e., having to restart the level). Among 172 participants, those randomly assigned to the checkpoint condition completed more levels of the game on average, but were less committed to individual reward opportunities within each level. Importantly, they also reported significantly lower frustration and higher perceived competence, an essential predictor of intrinsic motivation, compared to participants in the condition without checkpoints. Subjective frustration of the basic need for competence partially mediated game-induced frustration, suggesting that reducing negative consequences of failure facilitates reframing failure as a learning opportunity. These findings illustrate how game design can reduce frustration and enhance motivation and engagement.",

          "authors": "Michelle Achterberg",
          "abstract": "Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research, relying on real-time data collection via mobile devices,  provides unique insights into adolescents’ daily lives. However, concerns about digital distraction and overstimulation have led to shifting societal norms and consequently, increased restrictions on smartphone use—both institutionally (e.g., school bans) and informally (e.g., parental rules, self-regulation). These constraints raise questions about the feasibility and ecological validity of using ESM in adolescent samples. In this study, 195 adolescents (Mage = 16.12) participated in a 17-day ESM protocol, completing six prompts daily. Most adolescents reported facing school-based (88%) and parental (56%) smartphone restrictions. Despite these constraints, compliance was moderate to high (M = 78%), and analyses of nonresponse patterns revealed when and why prompts were most likely to be missed. Early morning prompts were often missed due to sleep, late morning prompts due to school, and evening prompts due to work—highlighting the importance of context-sensitive sampling strategies. Moreover, data quality was high: careless responding was rare, and participants reported high levels of integrity and motivation. Most participants evaluated the study as positive, with financial incentives, scientific contribution, and social connection as key motivators. These findings underscore that adolescent ESM studies remain feasible and ecologically valid when protocols are flexibly aligned with real-world constraints. Given that societal norms on digital well-being are in flux and smartphone restrictions intensify, aligning ESM design with adolescents’ everyday realities becomes increasingly essential to preserve both feasibility and ecological validity in research on adolescence.",

Participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more causal, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that moral character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments, challenging the view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act influence blame.",

          "abstract": "Technology plays a central role in shaping contemporary daily life and exerts a profound influence across social, economic, and cultural domains. This study aims to develop and validate instruments for assessing users’ attitudes toward technology use, with particular attention to older adults’ perceptions of its integration into their everyday lives. The research further seeks to explore the influence of technology on user and consumer experiences and to establish a conceptual framework for measuring attitudes toward technological adoption.\nThree primary objectives guided this research: (1) the development and validation of questionnaires designed to assess attitudes toward the use of technological means, particularly in the context of online services; (2) the collection of data to examine the association between age and attitudes toward technology; and (3) the exploration of the relationship between attitudes toward digital services and attitudes toward traditional, non-technological services. These issues are considered in the context of previous research, with renewed attention to the perceived distinctions between different types of services.\nThe data were collected through questionnaires adapted from previous studies, in which participants evaluated statements on a five-point Likert scale, where 5 indicated the highest level of agreement.\nThe findings of the study demonstrate high reliability across all measurement indicators. In the second experiment, age was negatively associated with attitudes toward online shopping, while showing a positive association with attitudes toward shopping in physical stores. The third experiment revealed a negative correlation between attitudes toward online and in-store shopping, consistent with prior research and reinforcing the stability of the assessment instruments employed in this study.",

          "authors": "Pablo Martínez-López; Antonio Vázquez-Millán; Francisco Garre-Frutos; David Luque",
          "abstract": "Animal research has shown that repeatedly performing a rewarded action leads to its transition into a habit—an inflexible response controlled by stimulus–response associations. Efforts to reproduce this principle in humans have yielded mixed results. Only two laboratory paradigms have demonstrated behavior habitualization following extensive instrumental training compared to minimal training: the forced-response task and the “aliens” outcome-devaluation task. These paradigms assess habitualization through distinct measures. The forced-response task focuses on the persistence of a trained response when a reversal is required, whereas the outcome-devaluation task measures reaction time switch costs—slowdowns in goal- directed responses conflicting with the trained habit. Although both measures have produced results consistent with the learning theory—showing stronger evidence of habits in overtrained conditions—their construct validity remains insufficiently established. In this study, participants completed 4 days of training in each paradigm. We replicated previous results in the forced-response task; in the outcome-devaluation task, a similar pattern emerged, observing the loss of a response speed advantage gained through training. We then examined the reliability of each measure and evaluated their convergent validity. Habitual responses in the forced-response task and reaction time switch costs in the outcome-devaluation task demonstrated good reliability, allowing us to assess whether individual differences remained stable. However, the two measures were not associated, providing no evidence of convergent validity. This suggests that these measures capture distinct aspects of the balance between habitual and goal directed control. Our results highlight the need for further evaluation of the validity and reliability of current measures of habitual control in humans.",

          "abstract": "The question of which words are the most central or important to a language has been explored in various ways. In this study, we propose definitions of core vocabulary that are based on how language is learned, represented, and processed from psychological perspectives, and test these on a word prediction task. We aim to (1) compare core vocabulary based on word frequency in natural language, the content of word associations,\nand age-of-acquisition in terms of how well they are guessed in word prediction contexts, and (2) investigate the extent to which word prediction in language models aligns with humans, and if there are systematic differences between them, whether these can be captured by core vocabulary measures. Across two experiments, 867 participants completed a task which involved guessing target words that were missing from sentence contexts. Natural language-based core words were generally easier to guess, but when the degree to which these words were naturally predictable in the linguistic environment was taken into account, word association- and acquisition-based core words were easier to predict for reasons that went beyond this. Additionally, language models were able to account for people’s word prediction responses to a considerable extent, but there were also systematic deviations from these predictions which were able to be captured by word association-based coreness. The findings suggest that distributional relationships between words in text is not all there is to human word prediction, but that people may also rely on factors like communicative usefulness and multimodal or extralinguistic information.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates intelligence-related differences in the adjustment of brain activity and connectivity to varying cognitive demands, testing for a moderation of an association between intelligence and neural efficiency by task difficulty. In 72 young adults (34 female, 38 male), fMRI brain activity changes during a decision-making task with five levels of difficulty were related to intelligence scores from a non-verbal matrix reasoning test. In fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions activated during task processing, we observed smaller increases in brain activity in more intelligent participants – independent of task difficulty. However, in two regions of the default mode network, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and left angular gyrus (AG), more intelligent participants showed greater decreases in activity with increasing task difficulty. Furthermore, with increasing difficulty, more intelligent participants showed greater increases in functional connectivity of DMPFC and AG. These findings suggest a more dynamic adjustment of neural processing to varying cognitive demands in more intelligent individuals. Particularly when it comes to more difficult tasks, more intelligent people seem to be better able to down-regulate activity in the brain's default mode network. Due to the relatively small sample size, these findings must be considered preliminary. While their interpretation should therefore be treated with caution, they suggest conceptually new avenues for replication in larger samples. As far as the observed processes reflect the suppression of task-unrelated neural processing and a better focus on the task at hand, they can potentially explain the general performance advantage of more intelligent individuals across various cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Reliability is a key concept in psychology that has been broadly studied since the introduction of Cronbach's alpha, which is a measure of the internal consistency of a test. Despite its importance, this is a topic that is relatively understudied when dealing with intensive longitudinal data. In particular, when studying the psychological dynamics of affective states, there is no warranty that intensive longitudinal measurements are reliable. Given this, empirical researchers need tools to study and report the reliability of the scales used in intensive longitudinal research. In recent years, different approaches to estimate the reliability of the scales and the items used when studying psychological dynamics have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are unclear, making it difficult to determine when a certain approach would be preferred over the others. Specifically, these approaches estimate reliability indices based on different statistical models, such as linear multilevel analysis, vector autoregressive models, and dynamic factor models. Furthermore, while some methods involve estimating one reliability index for the scale that applies to the whole sample, others estimate person-specific reliability indices. This wide variety of approaches can provoke some confusion for empirical researchers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used to estimate the reliability of intensive longitudinal data. We also showcase their application with empirical data.",

          "abstract": "Debates about adolescent online risks often overlook the lived realities of young people navigating structural adversity and digital inequality. This qualitative study explores how 20 adolescents in a low-income, semi-rural South African community navigate the double-edged nature of social media. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we show how offline violence, gendered power dynamics, and structural inequalities are entangled with online experiences, creating overlapping risks that amplify existing vulnerabilities. At the same time, social media is a source of entertainment, belonging, and glimpses of alternative futures, particularly for adolescents with personal smartphone access. Digital literacy in this context is largely informal and reactive, shaped by peers and trusted adults rather than formal education. These findings contribute to debates on adolescent online risks and digital inequality by showing how local contexts structure both the benefits and harms of social media as well as the forms of digital competence that develop. We argue that understanding adolescent digital life requires attention to structural adversity, everyday social dynamics, and the interdependence of online and offline worlds.",

Informed by the existing ESM literature, we illustrate our decision-making process while designing an ESM study on the temporal associations between momentary life meaning, eating disorder symptoms, and negative affect. While grounded in our specific research questions, this paper provides practical guidelines on how to decide among various methodological options for researchers across psychological fields.

          "abstract": "Background: This study evaluated barriers and facilitators to implementing, delivering, and participating in an enhanced smoking cessation service for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). The service, delivered across four pilot sites in the North East and North Cumbria (NENC) of England between April 2023 and March 2024, used a primary care referral model and a 20-week ‘cut down to quit’ approach combining behavioural and pharmacological support.\nMethods: A mixed methods approach was used, including analysis of aggregated recruitment and outcome data, coding documents for Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), a quantitative survey with purposively recruited service providers (n = 20), and qualitative interviews with service providers (n = 14) and service users (n = 4). The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behaviour (COM-B) model informed survey and interview design and analysis. A purposively recruited Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP) (n = 6) contributed to protocol development, study materials, and interpretation of findings.\nResults: In Pilot Sites A and B, nearly half of service users who set a quit plan had quit smoking at 28 days (~45%). Documentary analysis found the most common BCTs were pharmacological support, adding objects to the environment, and restructuring the environment. Survey findings indicated that providers had the capability, opportunity, motivation, and intention to deliver the service and found it acceptable, though perceptions of required effort varied. Interview findings showed that facilitators for service implementation were primarily linked to motivation (e.g., positive user feedback, staff motivation), whereas barriers were linked to capability (e.g., data recording) and opportunity (e.g., primary care links). For service delivery and participation, facilitators linked to capability (e.g., tailoring support, understanding social determinants) and motivation (e.g., benefits of quitting, goal setting).\nConclusions: Service delivery was perceived as effective due to flexibility and tailored support. Recommendations for improving service implementation should focus on strengthening primary care engagement and referral pathways, enhancing training and skills development for Stop Smoking Advisors, and improving data management systems and evidence gathering early in implementation. Future research should engage more service users and referrers to better understand barriers to service implementation and participation.",

Robust predictors of faith development included low agreement with the truth of texts and teachings subscale of the Religious Schema Scale (RSS), low frequency of prayer, and high openness to experience (NEO-FFI), while xenosophia/inter-religious dialog emerged as a moderately significant predictor. Predictive validity of FDI was demonstrated, though with limited strength.

          "abstract": "Self-other relations are fundamental in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal aspects of the social self can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. We hypothesized that individual differences in sociality, in particular friendships and loneliness, depend not only on interpersonal factors, but also on intrapersonal personality features. We administered a comprehensive set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Relational outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis confirmed the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results showed that intrapersonal traits exert a critical influence on friendships and loneliness of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and COVID-19 pandemic effects. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. Our study empirically supports a central role of self-concept in individual sociality. These findings provide a novel perspective on low social life quality combined with possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. The results also offer potential contributions to prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

Emotion regulation is a multidimensional construct that is robustly linked to emotional disorders yet remains underexplored in multiple sclerosis (MS), with no studies to date addressing individual differences in emotion regulation difficulties in this population. To address this gap, the current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of emotion regulation difficulties in an MS sample. \n\nMethods. Participants were 259 people with MS (Mage = 42.79, 78.8% female). Participants completed an online survey measuring emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), health anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion regulation was specified as the indicator variable in the LPA, with the additional measures of depression and anxiety utilised to validate the identified profiles.\n\nResults. Three emotion regulation profiles were identified: low impairment (n = 66, 25.48%) characterised by minimal difficulties regulating negative emotions across all domains; global dysregulation (n = 71, 27.41%) characterised by pronounced difficulties in all domains; and goal-impaired regulators (n = 122, 47.10%) characterised by distinct challenges maintaining goal-directed behaviours. Individuals in the global dysregulation profile endorsed the greatest symptom severity on measures of depression and PTSD but reported comparable levels of GAD and health anxiety relative to the goal-impaired regulators.\n\nConclusion. People with MS exhibit distinct emotion regulation profiles, revealing critical subgroups with varying psychological needs. Tailoring psychological assessments and treatments to these profiles can enhance the management of depression and anxiety and potentially improve disease outcomes in people with MS.",

This narrative review identifies and describes core types of functional social support relevant to mental health and wellbeing. Three literature searches across three databases were used to select papers reporting taxonomies of social support, social support questionnaires, and reviews of social support. A taxonomy of social support types was constructed using inductive qualitative synthesis. Five core types of social support were identified and described: (1) emotional support, (2) social contact and companionship, (3) belonging support, (4) information and guidance support, and (5) tangible support. Emotional and tangible support were most frequently identified. Core elements of emotional support are opportunities for confiding provided by sympathetic listening and caring, which included affectionate support and esteem support. These five types of social support provide a robust set of criteria for informing the development of social support interventions and assessing the adequacy of social support measures.",

          "abstract": "Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM), the inability to recall specific events and instead recall general memories, is a well-known feature of psychopathology. Although OGM has been regarded as a deficit in generative retrieval, recent studies highlight the role of direct and involuntary (associative) retrieval in OGM. We propose the accessibility model, which discards the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory and truncated search hypothesis. The accessibility model assumes that memory representations of different specificities are structured in parallel, and compete to be retrieved. The model contends that direct and generative retrieval are serial processes (i.e., direct retrieval initially, followed by generative retrieval), and specific and general memory accessibility each affect OGM. We argue that increased accessibility of negative general memories and decreased accessibility of positive specific memories underlie OGM in depression. These changes in accessibility are differentially associated with hippocampal abnormalities, memory suppression, self-referential processing, and positivity biases, suggesting different mechanisms depending on emotional valence. Furthermore, we propose that metacognitive monitoring and control are required to initiate generative retrieval when retrieved memories are goal inconsistent. The accessibility model integrates existing basic memory and OGM research, which may lead to improved memory therapeutics, and new avenues for research development.",

          "abstract": "Operational efficiency is critical for large beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi County as it directly impacts their ability to meet the country’s growing demand for beverages while maintaining competitive pricing and quality standards. However, large beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi County face significant challenges in achieving their performance. The general objective of the study is to assess the influence of warehousing automation technologies on operational efficiency in large beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi County, Kenya. Specifically, the study sought to examine the influence of automated storage, retrieval systems, autonomous mobile robots and robotic picking systems on operational efficiency in large beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi County, Kenya. This study was guided by Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) Theory and Lean Management Theory. This study adopted a descriptive research design. The target population of this study was 130 registered large beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi County as per KAM Directory 2024. The study targeted management employees. In this study, the sampling frame was a list of all 130 registered large beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi. The Yamane formula was adopted to calculate the study sample size. Therefore, the study sample size was 264 respondents. This research used a questionnaire to collect primary data. Data from questionnaires were coded and analyzed using the latest Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer software. The study used descriptive and inferential statistics for data analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, mean (measure of dispersion), standard deviation, and percentages were used. Inferential data analysis was conducted by use of Pearson correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. The study results were presented through use of tables and figures. The study concludes that automated storage, retrieval systems, autonomous mobile robots and robotic picking systems has a positive and significant effect on operational efficiency in large beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi County, Kenya. Based on the findings, the study recommends that the management of large beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya should expand the deployment of these robots within their production and warehouse operations. By leveraging their capabilities in material handling, inventory movement, and order fulfillment, firms can significantly reduce manual labor, minimize human error, and speed up processes",

Pearson correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations between service delivery and human resource strategies(r=0.822),supply chain strategies(r=0.737),operational strategies(r=0.714)and technological strategies(r=0.811),,all statistically significant(p&lt;0.01).A multiple regression model revealed that these functional strategies collectively accounted for 52.1%of the variance in service delivery.Notably, technological strategies emerged as the most potent predictor(β=0.539), followed by human resource strategies. This indicates that while an integrated approach is essential, strategic investment in technology may currently offer the highest leverage for improving service delivery in Kiambu County. The study concludes that a concerted focus on these functional strategies is crucial for enhancing service delivery. It recommends that the county government invest in advanced technologies, enhance human resource incentives and performance evaluations, strengthen supply chain vendor accountability, and optimize operational processes for continuous improvement",

          "authors": "David Roberts",
          "abstract": "The Eligibility as Environmental Construct (EEC) framework interprets IDEA eligibility through an ecological lens, deepening the law's focus on access and participation. EEC repositions educational impact as a relational phenomenon emerging from the interaction between learner and environment. The framework draws on Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, Vygotsky's social constructivism, and neurodiversity-affirming ethics to align IDEA's guarantees of Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) and Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) with ecological reasoning. The accompanying heuristic—the context-dependent communicator/learner—shows how this perspective can inform eligibility documentation and goal writing without creating new diagnostic categories. Assessment centers on contextual access rather than categorical severity, asking whether specialized instruction is needed to enable participation in environments typical for age peers. By integrating ecological theory, jurisprudence, and inclusive ethics, EEC offers practitioners a coherent framework for interpreting eligibility as environmental access.",

The media cascade was a probabilistic outcome that could not in general be repeated through the same sequence of prior event. Two seemingly irrelevant events may have affected the outcome, one that facilitated a connection between a journalist and bloggers and another that apparently competed for attention from national activists and media.

The focus of the survey is on uses of unedited machine translations. A sample of 2,520 UK professionals submitted valid responses to this survey. A total of 33% of them had used machine translation at work, most often in contexts involving direct communication with others in a shared physical space. The professionals were highly satisfied with the tools they used. They were also confident in their ability to use the tools successfully, even though it was uncommon for machine translation to be mentioned in workplace training. Google Translate was by far the tool used most often. The use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT also ranked highly. The tools were often accessed on personal devices using an openly available browser interface, practices which pose significant risks to privacy and information security.",

          "abstract": "The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce “truthful” entries via the large language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 1,800 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia, drawn from the 2,000 most-edited Wikipedia pages. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and greater structural variability. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia’s informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the effects of storytelling traditions on language evolution via two case studies analysing the oral storytelling tradition associated with Tlingit, an Indigenous Alaskan language, and written storytelling in British and American English. It suggests that Tlingit oral literature distinctly influenced both the morphology and vocabulary of the modern Tlingit language, and that changes in English storytelling style and transmission did the same throughout the history of the English language, supporting an argument that storytelling tradition has the potential to impact the evolution of associated languages. To develop its argument, the paper describes the differences between oral and written storytelling, and draws comparisons between Tlingit and other languages to demonstrate the areas in which Tlingit language structure reflects the oral format of its literary tradition. Then, it outlines Tlingit literary and cultural philosophy to demonstrate the influence of literary themes on the language’s vocabulary. The second half of the paper draws comparisons between historic shifts in English storytelling and concurrent changes in the language, suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship between literary style and evolution in English vocabulary. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a linguistic correlation between storytelling and language which merits further exploration and research. Where cited authors have both Indigenous and Western names, they are listed in order of individual preference whenever possible.",

Alongside these state-led initiatives, grassroots actors have mobilized to contest dominant narratives positioning AI as a driver of competitiveness and economic growth. This article examines how Italian social movements articulate alternative sociotechnical imaginaries of AI and emerging digital technologies. Drawing on participant observation, interviews, and activist documents collected between 2023 and 2024, we employ inductive thematic analysis to explore how activists critique existing AI systems and envision socially just futures. Our findings identify three co-existing imaginaries—AI Utopia, AI Dystopia, and Solarpunk AI—that both challenge prevailing governmental discourses and experiment with grassroots technological agency. By centering activist perspectives, the article contributes to scholarship on sociotechnical imaginaries and highlights how movements reimagine AI through lenses of justice, sustainability, and democratic participation.",

          "abstract": "The recent internationally driven sustainability discussions and the need to embrace circular economies have sparked off intense studies of bio-based materials as alternatives to the synthetic, petroleum-based composites. One of these, jute, a lignocellulosic bast fiber, has become a leader because it is renewable, has high specific strength and is also biodegradable. The paper will look at the expanding opportunities of the jute composite materials as covers its material properties, earlier methods of its fabrication and the newer usage that it opens in various industries. In this review, jute composites are shown to have excellent environmental benefits regarding a smaller carbon footprint and recyclability at the end of their life through a qualitative synthesis of existing literature. Nevertheless, commercial proliferation of such composites would hang on the achievement of the internal hurdles like hydrophilic vulnerability and inconsistency in the characteristics of fibers. The paper wraps up with strategic materials science research, scale-up, and cross-sectoral investigation recommendations, assuming that jute composites will play a significant part in the shift to more sustainable material systems in the automotive, construction and packaging sectors, among others.",

          "abstract": "This article re-examines Thomas Sankara’s revolution in Burkina Faso (1983–1987) to explain why postcolonial revolutions in Africa, though morally compelling, rarely generate enduring institutions. Using process-tracing of speeches, policy documents, and secondary sources, it analyses the mechanisms that transformed a project of emancipation into political isolation and collapse. The study identifies two interlocking dynamics – ideological ambiguity and confrontational state-building – that shaped both the rise and the demise of the Sankarist regime. It argues that revolutionary governments in Africa operate within structural constraints that reward moral purity but penalise institutional compromise. Comparison with Ghana under Rawlings and Uganda under Museveni shows that revolutions endure when moral authority is translated into hybrid institutions able to negotiate legitimacy across social and cultural cleavages. By conceptualising African revolutions as state-building experiments under constraint, the article bridges debates on revolutionary politics, postcolonial governance, and indigenous legitimacy, offering a new theoretical lens for understanding the fragility of moral authority in African state formation.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes and quantifies a novel ‘grey zone hybrid warfare’ model: without formal declaration of war, the aggressor employs multiple, small-scale, deniable infiltration units to orchestrate infrastructure disruption incidents. Concurrently, it pre-positions short positions in global capital markets through sovereign credit default swaps (CDS), put options and similar instruments. amplifying narratives of ‘state failure’ to mislead markets into interpreting localised incidents as systemic collapse. This triggers sovereign rating downgrades, soaring spreads, and rapid market capitalisation erosion among leading enterprises, achieving ‘credit damage’. The paper proposes a ‘dual-layer coordination model’ (destruction layer/financial arbitrage layer) alongside three metrics: market overreaction coefficient β, self-financing ratio SFR (SFR&gt;1 indicates industrialisability), and credit damage index. Results indicate this model circumvents traditional collective defence mechanisms. Consequently, defence priorities must shift from ‘preventing single-point breaches’ to ‘disrupting closed-loop systems’—namely, integrated early warning through intelligence-financial regulation-public clarification. Legally, ‘infrastructure sabotage + financial arbitrage’ should be elevated as a primary threat, with ‘credit firewalls’ suppressing β and SFR to prevent this model evolving into replicable, profit-driven attack supply chains.",

Using data from Japan’s largest job-matching intermediary that tracks full recruitment processes, we find elasticities near one for upper-wage workers but insignificant elasticities for lower-wage workers, while little variation across employment types are found. Elasticities are higher in small firms and in competitive occupations. Because both sides’ outside options matter, controlling for choice sets is essential. Posted wages mainly influence the application stage, suggesting that applications\nreliably approximate matches in estimating recruitment elasticity.",

          "abstract": "Working from home (WFH) was the only option of operation for many businesses and organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic where social distancing measures were introduced by governments worldwide. In an attempt to adapt to WFH, businesses, organisations and professionals of all backgrounds had to modify their previously established practices as well as adopt new practices and tools to enable remote working. To date, no previous study has explored how project managers of UK software businesses adapted to WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this mixed-methods study was to explore how project managers adapted to WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic. 16 experienced project managers (11.3±8.8 years of experience), ranging from junior to senior level, took part in this study. For the quantitative part of this study, 16 project managers took part in a 22-item survey and answered questions in relation to their experience with WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the qualitative part of the study, 5 project managers took part in semi-structured interviews with questions relating to being a project manager and WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic. The triangulation of the results from the survey and semi-structured interviews showed that WFH had a neutral to positive impact on the project management (PM) practices of software businesses with some of the challenges that emerged from WFH relating to delays in project time delivery and communication. Overall, new communication tools and practices were adopted by project managers as a result of WFH and project managers felt that WFH had a neutral effect on their position within their respective businesses.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: In an era of polarized judiciaries, re-evaluating the role of courts in shaping public opinion is vital. This study meta-analyses 114 effects from 21 experiments (1981-2025, N=31,523). I find that as average statistical power has risen dramatically over time, experimental estimates of court influence have fallen dramatically, with average effects of just 0.06 standard deviations post-Citizen’s-United. These effects, when they appear, are non-heterogeneous by partisanship, moving Democrats and Republicans in the same direction. These minimal, parallel effects are confined mostly to narrow  specific variables, especially specific support and social beliefs. How the court’s decisions are framed in the media is, on average, more consequential for opinion formation than the court decision itself. Encouragingly, I find no evidence of publication bias, overall or in any decade. This paper increases understanding of court influence on public opinion along several dimensions while outlining important directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Sufficient accessibility means that all individuals have a minimum level of access to essential opportunities such as work, school, healthcare, and leisure, making it possible to meet their basic needs. In this study, we integrate “measured accessibility” and “perceived accessibility” within a quality-of-life (QoL) framework to empirically determine what constitutes “sufficient” accessibility. Using community survey data from Austin, Texas, we combine a composite accessibility index—built from both primal (cumulative opportunity) and dual (minimum cost) measures across auto and transit modes—with self-reported QoL and perceived accessibility. We develop a sufficiency threshold by identifying the level of perceived accessibility associated with median QoL under different levels of measured accessibility. Our results indicate that perceived accessibility is a stronger predictor of QoL than measured access. A sufficiency threshold is derived using a normative regression-based approach, identifying the minimum perceived accessibility score required to reach the median QoL benchmark under typical access conditions. Logistic regression analyses further reveal that women, renters, long-term residents, and full-time workers are significantly less likely to report sufficient perceived accessibility—suggesting that social and structural barriers persist even in areas with good physical access. The study underscores the importance of integrating user- and system-level indicators into transport equity analyses. Policy applications include using sufficiency thresholds to evaluate whether new investments help lift disadvantaged groups out of accessibility poverty and enable more equitable QoL outcomes.",

          "abstract": "In polarized societies, basic questions about what constitutes prejudice can become deeply contested. After Hamas’s October 7 attack and Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza, discourse about the conflict has been marked by disputes over antisemitism. We investigate what are and what shapes American beliefs about antisemitism. Analysis of over one million Google restaurant reviews shows that ratings of Israeli restaurants declined as Israel’s ground war intensified. We then use this finding to interrogate American perceptions of antisemitism. A nationally representative survey experiment (N = 3, 200) finds that perceptions of whether such behavior is antisemitic are deeply polarized along partisan lines—but largely unaffected by media framing of the conflict. A follow-up survey (N = 3, 000) conducted unexpectedly during Israel’s strike on Iran, shows that Americans surveyed after the attack were less likely to interpret controversial behavior and speech as antisemitic. Our findings reveal the polarized and contingent nature of antisemitic beliefs.",

          "authors": "Bang Quan Zheng",
          "abstract": "Negative voting, casting a ballot more against a disliked candidate than for a preferred one, reveals how people translate political evaluations into expressive behavior. Existing accounts often assume that partisan hostility is symmetric, with Democrats and Republicans equally motivated by animus toward the other side. This study challenges that assumption by arguing that negative voting can be asymmetric: it emerges most strongly when psychological biases interact with political context. Specifically, negativity bias and affective polarization shape how voters interpret performance-based judgments, especially under a polarizing incumbent. Using panel data from the 2016–2020 Nationscape surveys and the 2024 American National Election Study (ANES), I show that negative voting was roughly balanced in 2016 but became sharply asymmetric in contexts like 2020, when Democrats and Independents engaged in negative voting far more than Republicans. Analyses across 2016, 2020, and 2024 indicate that these patterns are contingent on incumbency and electoral context. Overall, the findings suggest that negative voting is not a fixed feature of electoral politics but a context-dependent response—one in which affective polarization channels dissatisfaction into opposition rather than support.",

We assessed collaboration across multiple categories: project participation; coauthorship in conference papers, journal articles, books, book chapters; and other scholarly outputs, based on information reported in Lattes CVs. A key distinction of our approach is that we operationalize scientific collaboration beyond journal coauthorship alone. Results indicate a lightly fragmented collaboration network: among those who attended at least three editions, 92% belong to the largest connected component. The plurality of research foci within Physics Education does not appear to fragment the collaboration network. Event attendance breadth does not translate into high centrality scores. The network formed by SNEF and EPEF participants shows no actors with pronounced dominance in collaboration terms, suggesting substantial opportunities to form new ties among researchers and educators in Physics.

Qualitative studies\nindicate that parents play a crucial role by either supporting or hindering their children's\nengagement in gender-typical and gender-atypical sports; however, little is known about\nthe influence of specific parental attributes. We argue that parental physical activity (PA)\nexerts a gendered influence on children's participation in gender-(a)typical sports, and\nthat parents with high education promote children's engagement in gender-atypical\nsports. We test these hypotheses using a large dataset of children and adolescents in\nGermany (N = 9,224). Overall, we find that parental PA exhibits the expected gendered\nassociation: boys are more likely to practise (only) male-dominated sports when only\ntheir father does PA, and girls are more likely to practise (only) female-dominated sports\nwhen only their mother does PA. Regarding parental education, we find limited support:\nboys with highly educated parents are less likely to participate (exclusively) in gendertypical sports, whereas no such pattern is observed for girls. We discuss the broader\nimplications and limitations of our findings.",

          "authors": "Leandro Ivan Canzio; Valentina Di Stasio",
          "abstract": "Migrant-origin workers in Western European countries are more likely to hold low-quality jobs compared to native-origin workers. According to adaptation-level theories and theories of immigrant socioeconomic integration and segmented assimilation, this difference may be due to migrant-origin workers having lower job quality expectations and weaker reactions to low-quality jobs, due to their awareness of structural labour market disadvantages. However, these assumptions have rarely been tested empirically. First, we expect migrant-origin workers to have lower job quality expectations than native-origin workers. Second, we expect that migrant-origin workers will experience less job dissatisfaction when their job quality expectations are unmet. Third, we hypothesize that, among migrant-origin workers, job dissatisfaction will be a weaker predictor of turnover intentions and job changes. We analyse a longitudinal sample of workers in the Netherlands, focusing on job quality facets concerning wages and working hours. We examine differences between Dutch-origin workers and first- and second-generation migrants estimating random-effects and fixed-effects models. We find that migrant-origin workers have similar wage and working hours expectations as Dutch-origin workers. They also report similar or higher levels of job dissatisfaction when their job quality expectations are unmet. When dissatisfied with their jobs, migrant-origin workers are as likely as Dutch-origin workers to express turnover intentions. Despite their intentions being similar, migrant-origin workers are generally less likely to change jobs in the following year. Overall, our findings indicate that migrant-origin workers neither settle for nor conform to low-quality jobs, and that their structural disadvantage may be better explained by demand-side constraints.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the effects of self-esteem on depression among Korean high school students who experienced school violence. Using data from the 2018 Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS, Wave 6), the sample included 94 high school seniors (aged 18) who had experienced school violence at least once. The IBM SPSS Statistics 31.0 software was used to conduct descriptive, correlation, and multiple linear regression analyses, with self-esteem entered as the independent variable and gender as a control variable to predict depression levels. The regression results indicated that both self-esteem (𝛃 = -0.613, p &lt; .01) and gender (𝛃 = 0.194, p &lt; .05) were significant predictors of depression. Notably, self-esteem showed a substantially stronger effect, suggesting that it serves as a critical protective factor against depression among students who have experienced school violence. These findings underscore the importance of developing school-based interventions that enhance self-esteem to mitigate depressive symptoms in victims of school violence. Moreover, practitioners should recognize that female students may be particularly vulnerable to depression following such experiences. Finally, future research directions and study limitations are discussed in this study.",

          "abstract": "The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce \"truthful\" entries via the large language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 382 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and more variable structural depth. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia's informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.",

          "abstract": "Understanding population-level long-term changes in travel behaviour is vital for assessments of transport planning and policies and for informing the development of future transport systems. In this research, we present a conceptualisation of travel behaviour within the age–period–(birth) cohort (APC) framework. Building upon this conceptualisation, we argue that any attempts to investigate these changes must first scrutinise the necessity of adopting such an analytical framework designed to simultaneously disentangle these three intertwined yet distinct time-related dimensions. We further formulate theory-driven insights for travel behaviour analysis within such a framework, addressing issues of operationalisation, interpretation, and reflection on its limitations. Using a case study application, we examine changes in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) by car in England, from 2002 to 2023. Our theoretical insights and empirical evidence call for a reorientation of transport planning philosophies that recognise and address demographic dynamics (i.e. shifts in age-cohort composition), cohort succession in particular, as an independent, active driver of change. We discuss the capacity of our research, situated within this recognition, to provide a foundation for projecting and understanding future landscapes of travel behaviour and related outcomes of more direct policy relevance.",

          "abstract": "Housing dynamics in the United States were racialized by decades of State-sponsored racist policy. Exposure to particular neighborhoods yields benefits and harms that are vastly different across racialized populations. One outcome of that association is an ideology of racialized space that could both naturalize and perpetuate spatial racial inequality. Using 500k listings from the rental platform Craigslist spanning five years and 16 U.S. metropolitan areas, I show that descriptions of neighborhoods reflect the legacy of more traditional forms of neighborhood racialization, but are also the site of counter-narratives that resist that legacy. Advertisements tend to describe Asian and White neighborhoods more positively than other neighborhoods, while failing to positively describe Latino and Black areas, though that difference is less for Latino neighborhoods when accounting for socioeconomic status. In contrast, even high-income Black neighborhoods are not described as positively as poor White neighborhoods. Black and White neighborhoods are recognized for being historic, but, even accounting for housing stock age, Asian neighborhoods are not, reflecting the ‘permanent foreigner’ stereotype.",

          "abstract": "Population forecasts at the intra-urban level are crucial for governments to implement spatial planning and for businesses to identify potential markets. However, population forecasts are often produced at coarse geographic scales, namely national and regional. In addition, state of the art small-area forecasting methods are scarce and adjusted to work on Global North countries due to the lack of demographic data in the Global South. We aim to explore the accuracy of ARIMA and Hamilton-Perry models to forecast population totals and populations by age-group at the intra-urban level for the municipalities of Greater Mexico City. We used WorldPop 2000-10 population estimates as input data and performed retrospective forecasts for 2011-20. Comparing our forecasts with actual population counts, we found that ARIMA and Hamilton-Perry models return median errors of 1.5% and 3.1%, respectively, when forecasting population totals in a 10-year horizon. Median errors reached 5.7% and 4.1% for population forecasts by age-group. The age-groups 0-14, 15-39 and 40-64 performed particularly well, with errors below 10% in most municipalities, while the age-group ≥65 displayed higher errors, typically over 20%. We found no linear relationship between forecast errors and population size, but small municipalities often presented larger errors. We conclude that ARIMA and Hamilton-Perry models produce accurate forecasts and require minimum input data, which is an advantage in developing countries with no demographic data. Yet, both models present limitations. They are powerful when population change is consistent over time but cannot predict unexpected changes in demographic components.",

In contrast to scholarship in business and strategic communication, the analysis examines how advocacy campaigns render grievances legible. Drawing on sociosemiotic analysis, the study identifies three strategies—visionary, sensitive, and reflexive—that establish thresholds of legibility and organize the affective registers through which campaigns become recognizable. Recognition here operates through ontological erasure, which names the structural condition in which subjects are excluded not through misrepresentation but through the denial of legitimacy itself. What emerges is a paradox in which recognition constrains the horizon of justice more effectively than exclusion, since empathy, once instrumentalized, disarticulates collective struggle and reconstitutes it as individualized affect and sanctioned emotion. The article concludes that the regulatory dynamics of brand governance reproduce moral hierarchies of recognition, privileging Northern perspectives and marginalizing grievances from the South.",

This article integrates cleavage theory with meta-perceptions—beliefs about the political attitudes of social groups—to examine how people cognitively map political divides. Using original survey data from Germany and focusing on immigration as a key issue in the socio-cultural cleavage, we theorize and test three cognitive biases: egocentrism, conservatism, and false polarization. Results show that citizens project their views onto others, overestimate societal negativity toward immigration, and exaggerate group polarization. These biases are unevenly distributed across cleavage groups, reflecting the structure of political conflict. Moreover, their interaction produces distinct misperception patterns: biases reinforce each other among anti-immigration individuals and offset each other among pro-immigration individuals. The findings suggest that meta-perceptions are shaped by both psychological biases and social divisions, providing new insights into the cognitive foundations of political conflict.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely regarded as one of today’s most transformative technologies. As for each of its predecessors, such as the TV and smartphones, the rapid expansion of AI into everyday life is followed by fears, hopes, and ambivalent expectations. These so-called “socio-technical” imaginaries are especially studied among AI users and regulators, but little is known about its pioneers, such as AI founders and developers. This is particularly important in the current moment of fast technological developments—by understanding how AI pioneers imagine the future we can better understand, discuss, and regulate the envisioned directions of such systems. This article fills this gap by first compiling a dataset with nominees of the TIME 100 / AI lists, their TED talks, podcast interviews, and socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race, education). It next leverages computational methods (i.e., word embeddings, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis) and regression analysis to explore the prevalence, topical distribution, temporal developments, emotional engagement, and socio-demographic differences in socio-technical imaginaries of AI among its pioneers. Results reveal a dominant tone of optimism and anticipation centered on business and industrial progress, alongside ambivalent positions emphasizing ethical and existential concerns. Socio-demographic patterns further suggest the unequal segmentation of such profiles, as marginalized groups (e.g., women, lower-educated, and Black or Brown pioneers) voiced more critical and cautious perspectives, while White and Asian men with advanced degrees expressed more techno-optimistic visions of the future.",

Social identity theories have explained how mechanisms of social comparison encourage outgroup hostilities, leading to hate crimes against targeted identity groups. Social movement theories have suggested how mobilization by identity movements for expanded rights often initiates reciprocal action against them by opponents. These theories suggest hypotheses that exposure to protests, hate crimes, and hate groups increases ingroup solidarity, raising support for the focal identity group. Analyzing panel data from the American National Election Surveys conducted in 2016 and 2020, this research examines shifts in attitudes toward four distinct identity groups: Black, Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual, Transgender, and Jewish individuals. Contrary to expectations, peaceful protests by identity groups did not affect their levels of support. The findings show that hate crimes or hate group activity increased support for Black, Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual, and Transgender individuals.",

          "abstract": "The shock-absorbing capacity of Ghana’s inflation targeting (IT) policy has been under scrutiny, especially following COVID-induced inflationary pressures that drove real interest rates to a negative territory with implications for saving. This study examines IT policy’s role in moderating the real interest rate-saving nexus through the lens of the McKinnon-Shaw Hypothesis (MSH), from the perspective of private savings’ adaptation to real interest rate fluctuations. The study applies linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to time series data spanning 1986-2023, augmented by non-linear ARDL analysis. We uncover no stable long-run relationship between real deposit interest rate and private financial saving as there prevails only a short run nexus. This finding suggests that the MSH might be delayed than implied by theory, which is likely due to asymmetric responses in the saving-interest rate nexus with positive and negative interest rates affecting saving differently. Results indicate a short run positive nexus between financial saving and negative real interest rate, while the relationship between positive real interest rate and saving is insignificant. IT policy, however, strengthens the relationship between saving and real interest rate over the long run, indicating that further strengthening of the policy could address asymmetric responses in the saving-interest rate nexus and help realize the MSH.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how the German public perceives Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) amid escalating geopolitical tensions and deepening China–EU economic interdependence, complemented by evidence on Chinese perceptions of German FDI. We combine data from a large-scale survey experiment embedded in the 2023 German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Sample (N = 2,365) with a descriptive survey in China (N = 2,000). German respondents substantially overestimate the scale of Chinese investment—believing it accounts for about 30% of total inward FDI, compared to an actual share of roughly 1%—and evaluate it significantly less favorably than investment from other EU countries or the United States. In contrast, Chinese respondents express consistently positive views of German FDI, revealing a pronounced asymmetry in mutual perceptions. To probe the origins and malleability of these views, we implement three randomized interventions in Germany: a factual correction of actual FDI shares and two narrative framings emphasizing either positive or negative aspects of Chinese investment. While factual information modestly improves perceptions of FDI’s economic benefits, none of the treatments meaningfully shift deeper, ideologically anchored attitudes toward Chinese investment. Quantile treatment effect analyses indicate, however, that these interventions reduce anti-China biases among respondents who are initially more receptive to Chinese FDI. Taken together, the results—consistent across direct evaluations, conjoint choice experiments, and Willingness-to-Accept (WTA) measures—underscore the limits of informational interventions in reshaping entrenched geopolitical or identity-based biases toward foreign investment.

          "abstract": "Cultural markets are characterized by uncertainty, prompting consumers to rely on various forms of social information. Personal recommendations, particularly from close networks, stand out as an important component. However, in different social settings, consumers may encounter recommendations from advisors outside their close network. Focusing on the movie market, this study investigates how different characteristics of such movie advisors influence the value placed on their recommendations. A factorial survey among students is employed to investigate the role of gender, migration background, socio-economic position (SEP), and patterns of movie consumption (voraciousness) in drawing the intentions to watch movies in three genres – action, comedy, and drama. The results show that recommendations from women and individuals extensively involved in movie watching hold higher value. There is a lack of evidence supporting gender-essentialist beliefs about advisors, since genre-based differences remain minimal. In-group favoritism is observed among women, whereas men are found to be indifferent. This study underlines the importance of advisors’ characteristics in predicting the weight of recommendations.",

          "authors": "Viktor Decker; Marco Seegers",
          "abstract": "The relative merits of vocational and general education remain central to debates on sustainable careers. Vocational pathways facilitate smoother school-to-work transitions but rely on occupation-specific skills that may become obsolete, whereas general education yields weaker entry prospects but greater adaptability to changing demands. A key question is whether further training can offset these trade-offs. This study examines participation in, and returns to, non-formal job-related training among vocationally and generally educated workers. Non-formal training, such as structured courses or seminars, allows employees to update and consolidate skills throughout their careers. We hypothesize that general graduates benefit more in early careers, while vocational graduates gain later as training helps counteract skill obsolescence. Drawing on longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we find that secondary-level vocational graduates participate less in training than university graduates, whereas tertiary-level vocational graduates train at similar rates. Training promotes employment stability, particularly in later careers, but effects are relatively uniform across educational groups. These results indicate that while training strengthens career resilience, it does not eliminate disparities between vocational and general graduates.",

          "authors": "Angelo Capodici; Alberto Pirni; Anna Gadignani; Francesca Noci; Lucia Giardelli; Michele Emdin; Alberto Giannoni",
          "abstract": "Background: The rapid expansion of telemedicine promises enhanced healthcare access but risks eroding the relational foundations of care, particularly in remote and underserved communities. Standard bioethical frameworks, often focused on principlism, inadequately address the complex intersubjective and systemic challenges posed by digital mediation. There is a need for an ethical framework that centers human dignity and recognition within technologically mediated care.\nObjective: This perspective paper develops and applies a critical ethical framework for telemedicine grounded in recognition theory, aiming to evaluate how digital systems can support or undermine the recognition of persons, especially in vulnerable contexts.\nMethods: We synthesize Axel Honneth's recognition theory with insights from relational ethics, phenomenology of illness, and critical disability studies to propose a tripartite framework comprising three interdependent dimensions of recognition: Ascertaining (epistemic recognition of the patient as an embodied knower), Acceptance (normative inclusion respecting vulnerability and difference), and Approval (institutional legitimation of telemedicine as genuine care). We conduct a critical conceptual analysis applying this framework to the Tuscany Health Ecosystem project, a telemedicine initiative in remote Italian regions.\nFindings: The application of the Ascertaining-Acceptance-Approval framework reveals both the potential of hybrid, community-integrated telemedicine models (like Tuscany's) to foster recognition through nurse-mediated presence and relational continuity, and significant unresolved tensions. These include persistent epistemic compromises, ambiguities in power-sharing and patient choice, undertheorized socioeconomic vulnerabilities, and structural contradictions between relational care demands and system pressures for efficiency (e.g., the efficiency-recognition dilemma, risk of technological solutionism).\nConclusion: Recognition theory transforms telemedicine from a purely technical challenge into an ethical-political project. Ensuring digital healthcare humanizes rather than diminishes care requires moving beyond simple access metrics. It demands ethical vigilance focused on hybridity, perpetual reflexivity, and meaningful community participation to ensure technology supports recognition and resists deepening health inequities.",

          "abstract": "Under compounded crises of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss, researchers are exploring more-than-human co-design to involve and engage human and non-human entities, such as animals and plants, and their constituted ecosystems in creating health and wellbeing solutions. We scoped 64 studies that involved and/or engaged humans and non-humans as stakeholders and classified methods and tools across three more-than-human modes: co design with living entities, through human representation of non-human perspectives, and for more than human outcomes. Reported outcomes for humans included increased environmental awareness, empathy, mental wellbeing and community cohesion. Outcomes for non-human were less frequently measured but included prototypes, spatial planning and, in a few cases, direct welfare gains. We discuss both ethical and methodological barriers and facilitators. The recuring barriers and challenges include recognising non-human agency without anthropocentrism, specifying indicators of non-human wellbeing and flourishing, and achieving genuine and high-quality participation. We also highlight potential facilitators, such as triangulating ethology, sensors and creative tools, longitudinal research and interdisciplinary teams, and propose standards for reporting primary non-human outcomes. Positioned alongside One Health, EcoHealth and Planetary Health, more-than-human co-design provides participatory infrastructures for multispecies justice in urban sustainability and climate change adaptation. We conclude with a research agenda to normalise non-human outcome metrics, strengthen evaluation, and integrate more-than-human co design into policy and planning for multispecies flourishing.",

          "authors": "Katja Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Recent reports have drawn attention to a growing ideological divide between young men and women in Western societies, with women becoming more progressive while men lean increasingly conservative. Yet, empirical evidence and theoretical grounding for this phenomenon remain limited. This study is the first to examine this divide in the German context, drawing on original survey data collected in 2022. It compares socio-cultural attitudes across cohorts and explores mechanisms underlying these gender gaps. The results reveal that gaps are substantially larger among the youngest and middle cohorts – roughly twice as pronounced as among older ones. While young women (16–29) emerge as the most progressive group, men aged 30–49 hold the most conservative views, each diverging sharply from their female or male peers. These findings align with modernization theory on the one hand, and with gender threat perspectives on the other, suggesting that men, in part, perceive emancipative progress as a challenge to their social position. Linking these perceptions to broader shifts in socialization, the study contributes to theorizing the mechanisms behind gendered attitudinal gaps in Western societies. Although the cross-sectional design precludes causal claims, the findings highlight a distinctive cohort pattern with implications for social and political cohesion.",

          "authors": "Dulce Manzano Espinosa; Hector Cebolla-Boado",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes that, under specific conditions, wars can shift family investments decisions toward more portable and less susceptible-to-confiscation assets, such as education. To test our theory, we examine the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), a violent conflict that did not specifically disrupted family dynamics or targeted children or educational infrastructure. We compare the educational attainment of individuals exposed to the war with that of cohorts from preceding and subsequent periods. Using a regression discontinuity approach, our results reveal that individuals who reached school age during the conflict exhibited higher completion rates for both primary and secondary education. The benefits were especially pronounced for individuals whose parents were less-educated, utterly impacting the allocation of educational opportunities. These findings support a new framework for exploring educational gains in conflicts where violence is not targeted indiscriminately at entire social groups including children and the destruction of civil and educational infrastructures is relatively contained. Beyond our historical case, our framework is particularly relevant for studying contemporary, lower-intensity conflicts (excess of mortality not concentrating on children or women) that may foster long-term educational benefits across generations.",

          "abstract": "Southern Africa possesses a deep archaeological record, spanning more than a million years, which has attracted over a century of research. As a result, it offers one of the densest and most detailed pictures of Stone Age occupation history in Africa. However, certain time periods and regions have featured more prominently in research, particularly the later Middle Stone Age of the coastal and mountain zones. Moreover, the modern emphasis on absolute dating and well-resolved chronologies often excludes open-air and surface sites from reviews and syntheses, meaning that environments lacking deep, stratified rock shelters remain underrepresented.\nTo address this, the Southern African Stone Age Site Index (SASSI) provides a centralised, openly accessible resource for archaeological research, featuring 485 reported Earlier, Middle and Later Stone Age sites from South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini and Namibia. It includes both dated and undated sites, and encompasses diverse contexts. The database integrates spatial, chronological, cultural and contextual information, following FAIR data principles. While previous synthetic datasets have emphasised chronology and systematics, SASSI instead prioritises spatial coverage, offering a foundation for new perspectives on demography, settlement patterns, and landscape use in southern Africa’s past.",

Although Marcuse never contributed directly to the formulation of Theodor Adorno’s The Authoritarian Personality (1951), his research into the ideological roots of arbitrary authority is central to its findings. Marcuse’s supplement to the social psychology of authoritarian politics is presented in Eros and Civilization (1964), through the theories of surplus repression and regressive de-sublimation, which explain how discontent with civilization can be mobilized by authoritarian personalities to wider their support base. These theories supply the key to understanding the rancorous atmosphere of rightwing populism, authoritarian resentment and aversive prejudice now politically resurgent around the world on the Far Right. Marcuse anticipated the political events today unfolding in the USA in a crucial essay on the “Historical Fate of Bourgeois Democracy” (1972), which provides an analysis of the objective and subjective preconditions for the rise of the authoritarian personality. Bringing together the strands of Marcuse’s analysis of the relation between crisis dynamics, authoritarian regimes and the authoritarian personality, this chapter develops a Marcusean analysis of the extremely dangerous conjuncture unfolding in America (and beyond).",

Since the 1970s, such fictions have provided imaginative representations of anti-liberal theologies and the customary-rights-based way of life that belongs to Christian fundamentalism. The development of a fundamentalist counter-public sphere, including Christian fiction, provided the cultural substructure for the politicization of American fundamentalism into the Christian Right. In turn, this politicization, culminating in Christian nationalism, has been reflected in the political redirection of religiously-inspired fiction towards millenarian themes. Doctrinaire fictions of “spiritual warfare” and “tribulation insurgency” have radicalized Christian literature in America, militarizing spiritual revenge fantasies into representations of terrorist violence. These aggressive fictions are forms of anti-Enlightenment and anti-democratic ideological propaganda, which promote the rightwing authoritarian social attitudes and aversive prejudices of today’s Christian nationalism.",

          "abstract": "Recent advancements in the availability and sophistication of generative artificial intelligence has been accompanied by widespread concerns regarding the ability for the public to navigate the digital information environment, especially during social and political events. A growing consensus across policymakers, academics, and industry leaders has emerged around the need for applying labels communicating whether AI was used in content creation. Labeling as a media literacy strategy and policy intervention has gained momentum, but what impacts do synthetic content labels have on the public? We run two online experiments to measure the effect of content labeling on perceptions of political images—their perceived provenance, veracity, and engagement intention. We find that AI labels effectively communicate content provenance, significantly reducing perceived human involvement in image creation regardless of whether images were actually AI-generated. At the same time, labels have no impact on perceived veracity or self-reported engagement intentions. In a follow on study, we find limited evidence of the \"implied authenticity effect,\" whereby exposure to labeled synthetic images increases the perceived human provenance of subsequent unlabeled synthetic images. However, we show that the near-zero total effect is the result of two offsetting pathways: exposure to labeled synthetic images implies subsequent unlabeled synthetic images are more authentic, but this effect is countered by an increased skepticism caused by prior exposure to labeled content. Taken together, our research contributes to the growing academic literature on content labeling as a media literacy intervention, as well as to ongoing efforts to develop evidence-based strategies to mitigate the harmful political effects of generative AI.",

In this light, the second thing I do in this article is to present the case that the fourth camp, the PD-type argument, is on the right track.

Using nationally representative data from the 2013 and 2015 China Household Financial Surveys, we find a clear and persistent wealth premium among public-sector employees that remains significant after controlling for education, occupation, and other characteristics. The results point to three reinforcing mechanisms: redistributive power through party membership and cadre hierarchy, market power through firm listing and industry position, and behavioral differences in income, debt, and expenditure. These findings suggest that the public sector functions as a hybrid institution combining administrative protection with partial market participation. Unlike the Eastern European cases where privatization eroded state influence, China’s public sector continues to organize wealth accumulation through employment and credit access. The enduring wealth advantage of public employment shows that the “hand of the state” remains active in shaping post-socialist inequality.",

This assessment is timely as widening geographic wealth gaps in the USA fuel disparities in access to public goods and amenities, positioning community wealth as a critical determinant of cognitive health. Conditioning on personal wealth and other risk factors, we find that a standard deviation increase in community wealth is associated with a 6.7% relative risk reduction in cognitive impairment across the national population of older adults, rising to 13.7% for those residing in the poorest fifth of communities. Community wealth matters more than relative inequality, and its associated protective effects are larger for non-white, non-college educated, and low net worth householders. This is plausibly because these individuals rely more on the public goods and services underwritten by local affluence. The economic fragmentation of American communities thus poses a growing threat to the cognitive health of Americans, especially among those from socially vulnerable and marginalized backgrounds",

This paper presents an empirical analysis of five CS pilots addressing urban sustainability challenges, conducted within or in close collaboration with six GLAMs. In Barcelona, a university partnered with a public library to assess heat exposure in public spaces. In Delft, children’s perceptions of urban spaces were collected and discussed through a collaboration between a university and a public library. In Tallinn, a community museum supported the testing of a digital visualization tool to enhance citizens’ feedback in urban planning. In Vienna, an urban research institute and an academic library co-designed two pilots addressing urban heat and the transformation of public spaces. Findings draw on GLAMs’ distinct contributions, the structural organization of the pilots, and the perceptions of librarians and researchers, collected through surveys, interviews, and collective writing processes. A strong community-oriented focus and the engagement of underrepresented citizen groups were common features across all pilots, though organizational structures and actor typologies varied by city. GLAMs consistently acted as powerful connectors between researchers, citizens, and local stakeholders. Embedding CS initiatives within social and community-oriented venues helps mitigate power imbalances and foster horizontal, mutual learning between academics and GLAM staff. GLAM can also provide the crucial social infrastructure to significantly embed sustainability challenges-related CS initiatives in many knowledge ecosystems, over different countries and cities.",

          "abstract": "Widowhood is a common yet critical life event, associated with significant risks to mental health.  This study aims to understand the individual and contextual factors that may moderate the short-term decline in mental health and recovery in the medium-term associated with widowhood.  Data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe are applied to between-within random-effects linear regressions to estimate average within-individual change in mental health following spousal death across fifteen countries. Rather than a summary score of depressive symptoms, this study focuses on affective suffering and changes in motivation.  This allows us to differentiate between depressive symptoms that manifest in the course of bereavement (affective suffering) and symptoms that indicate a more severe depressive episode (changes in motivation). In addition, we consider the role of institutional, social and compositional differences between countries to account for cross-national variation.  Widowhood is associated with higher affective suffering in the short-term and recovery in the medium-term across all countries. However, there is more cross-national variation in the appearance of changes in motivation following spousal loss. Findings suggest that compositional differences, specifically the mean age of widowhood and the gender composition of the widowed population, account for cross-national heterogeneities in the consequences of widowhood for affective suffering and motivation.",

          "abstract": "Normative fertility reflects broader societal trends but curiously changed little despite shifts in families. Changes in general ideal fertility, however, may be hidden by omitting nonnumeric ideals. Using GSS data, I analyze trends in and predictors of nonnumeric fertility ideals between 1975-2022. I further examine ideals for a subset nudged for numeric responses. Findings underscore a spike in nonnumeric ideals (9% in 1975 to 23% in 2022) paralleled by a waning two-child ideal. Shifts to web-surveys account for some of the growth, but nonnumeric ideals increased even when only examining interviewer-surveys (9% to 15%). Notably, when nudged, nonnumeric respondents offer nonnormatively high or low numeric ideals. Nonnumeric predictors also point towards two groups likely to give opposed extreme ideals (e.g., high and low gender role and sexuality attitudes, frequent religious attenders and non-attenders). Over time, those with large-family ideals may have initially drove nonnumeric responses, with a bifurcated pattern emerging later. The high and increasing proportion of nonnumeric ideals may suggest a shift from broadly held two-child norms toward bespoke smaller families that facilitate self-actualization emerging alongside a continuing counterweight favoring large families. Like work on nonnumeric personal fertility preferences, attention to nonnumeric normative ideals offers insights into fertility decision-making.",

          "authors": "Babu George",
          "abstract": "State Public Service Commissions face complex decisions when utilities incur extraordinary costs\nfrom disasters, fuel price spikes, or emergency infrastructure repairs. This paper examines five\nprimary cost recovery methods, i.e., immediate pass-through, short-term amortization, rate base\ninclusion, securitization, and deferral, analyzing their distinct impacts on utility financial stability,\ncustomer affordability, and regulatory transparency. Drawing on a literature review of utility\nregulation theory, financial mechanisms, and empirical evidence, the study synthesizes theoretical\nfoundations including natural monopoly theory and the regulatory compact with practical regulatory\nconsiderations. A detailed hypothetical case study included as appendix demonstrates how a $25\nmillion extraordinary cost would be recovered under each method, providing complete mathematical\ncalculations, customer bill impacts across residential, commercial, and industrial classes, and total\ncost comparisons over recovery periods ranging from three months to twenty years. The analysis\nreveals fundamental trade-offs: immediate recovery minimizes total costs but creates severe bill\nshock, while securitization offers the lowest monthly impact but highest total cost due to extended\ninterest payments. The paper emphasizes that transparent modeling, reproducible calculations, and\nmeaningful public engagement are essential for regulatory legitimacy. It concludes with best practice\nrecommendations for regulators, utilities, and consumer advocates, arguing that method selection\nmust be context-dependent, balancing cost magnitude, customer economic conditions, utility\nfinancial health, and regulatory precedent to achieve equitable and sustainable outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that certain sanctioning institutions can play an essential role in maintaining human cooperation in public goods experiments. However, in reality, the outcome of sanctions can be subject to stochasticity. In a public goods experiment with peer punishment, we investigated the comparative advantage of certain versus uncertain sanctioning institutions by allowing participants to repeatedly choose between the two. In one institution, sanctions issued by individuals were multiplied by three, while in another, the consequences of sanctions were multiplied by a random factor between 0 and 6. Initially, the uncertain institution was the majority choice, but it eventually tended to become the minority choice. We found less punishment, due to less antisocial punishment, in a certain institution, leading to higher contributions and payoffs. Hence, when participants learned about the difference in payoffs, they chose a certain sanctioning institution more often. Especially, prosocial and risk-averse individuals with strong contribution norms were more likely to choose certainty. Additionally, we investigated the motives that may influence pro- and antisocial punishment, as they influence an institution's success. We find that hypersensitivity to punishment, non-prosocial punishment motives, weak contribution norms, and normative hubris reduce the effectiveness of sanctions in establishing cooperation.",

Yet, since this approach is limited to certain posts, content types, and platforms, new methods beyond URL matching are required. This study applies retrieval-augmented classification (RAC) to detect misinformation in free text, enabling broader platform coverage and more fine-grained content analysis. We analyze a unique dataset of over half a million posts from all German members of parliament and their official party accounts across four platforms – Facebook, X, Instagram, and TikTok. Using RAC, we match these posts with more than 5000 fact-checking articles and 1500 community notes. Our method reveals an absolute amount of misinformation nearly ten times higher than the URL-matching method would capture, while the relative share among all posts with text remains low. However, patterns differ across parties and policy issues, as misinformation is unevenly distributed among political actors. For some parties and specific issues, misinformation shares exceed ten percent. Our findings expand the scope of misinformation research through a text-based matching method, offering a more nuanced distinction between high- and low-prevalence segments, and highlighting the role of populist and conservative parties in spreading misinformation.",

          "authors": "Yoav Roll",
          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, right-wing populism has steadily risen to prominence across the world. Yet a crucial socio-economic context for its development - the household and its underlying gender dynamics - remains under-explored in research on right-wing populism. This study investigates how the income, level of education, and class within cohabiting couples in the Netherlands, shape their support for right-wing populism through three diverse predictors, ranging from behavioural to attitudinal: voting for right-wing populist [RWP] parties, aim to vote for RWP parties, and sympathy towards RWP parties. Four models are tested to explain these relationships: male dominance, sharing, individual, and economic dominance models. Based on previous studies focusing on non-RWP parties, I expected the individual model for men and the sharing model for women to provide the best fit. Using data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences, this paper utilises diagonal reference models [DRM], for men and women separately, to trace the relative influence of the respondent and their partner on their RWP support. As far as I know, DRM has never been used to predict support for RWP parties. As expected, gender differences are evident. However, the data show, contrary to expectation, that the sharing model provides the best fit for men, while the individual model provides the best fit for women when it comes to income and education. Regarding class, as expected, the sharing model provides the best fit for women. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the diverse characteristics of the economic standing predictors and the different facets of RWP support tested. As women increasingly join the workforce and occupy diverse roles, the ways in which men and women perceive their economic circumstances - particularly within households - diverge significantly. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for household context and gender dynamics in understanding the rise of right-wing populism in developed democracies such as the Netherlands.",

This study critically examines the quality of policy briefs from European SBS advisory bodies written during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers independently scored 117 policy briefs from 4 countries using the newly-developed 25-item Policy Brief Checklist. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the results. We found considerable heterogeneity in the quality of policy briefs. Key items like the summary, aim, policy problem addressed, and actionability of the recommendations were adequate in 34% to 59% of policy briefs. Policy briefs containing urgent advice scored better than less urgent briefs on some items (e.g. clear aim) but worse on others (e.g. explication of the policy problem). Hence, although challenging in the high-pressure context of a pandemic, the impact of SBS policy advice during a major infectious disease outbreak could potentially be enhanced if advisory bodies improve the quality of their policy briefs. We recommend that SBS advisory body develop crisis-specific policy brief templates that meet the needs of the advisory body and policymakers, and invest in training so that scientific insights are presented more effectively.",

While previous research has explored various associations between specific aspects of religiosity, such as frequency of prayer or religious service attendance, with flourishing and health, this study makes a distinct contribution by analyzing the effects of an innovative concept of religiosity by Stefan Huber –centrality of religiosity– on a multidimensional human flourishing scale. The analysis is based on survey-weighted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models, allowing for population-representative estimates across the six countries studied (analytic N =84,399). The findings show that although all forms of religiosity are associated with higher flourishing outcomes, the highly religious benefit the most. Among the dimensions of human flourishing, centrality of religiosity is especially strongly associated with meaning and purpose across all countries. Effect sizes differ substantially between the analyzed countries, suggesting that the religious context and culture shape how religiosity influences flourishing and health. In light of the rapidly progressing secularization in Europe, the results invite a reconsideration of the value placed on of peripheral and central religiosity.",

          "abstract": "In this natural experiment, we study the effects of added years of school and different exposures to Home Economics (HE) on adult men's self-reported time spent on housework. Using data from the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey (LNU), we run difference-in-differences analyses and a cohort analysis. The first test the effect of the Swedish nine-year elementary school reform and its preceding assessment period, with more added years of HE that included teaching of practical housework. The second compares birth cohorts before and after an important curricular change, for the first time adding HE for boys, in Swedish schools 1955/56. The data confirm previous findings about Swedish men’s housework: a general increase over time, mainly driven by more time spent on foodwork (e.g., food shopping, cooking, after-meal clean-up). We also confirm that men’s housework participation is positively associated with their educational level. However, the overarching picture of the study is a null result, except for an effect on time spent on laundry. Thus, while it is clear from previous findings that men in Sweden have increased their time spent on routine housework, especially foodwork, it is difficult to pinpoint any particular policy effect from the statistical noise of reforms and cultural transformation. Our study design could, in theory, identify the causal effect of school reform, focusing both on educational duration and curricular content, yet the findings suggest no such specific effect, indicating instead that other social factors have driven this development.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines how the far right in Germany and Austria responded to Russia’s full-\nscale invasion of Ukraine of February 2022 by societalizing the ensuing energy crisis. Rather\nthan addressing the war as a breach to European values, and a fundamental realignment of\nrelations between Eastern and Western Europe, far-right actors depicted rising energy prices\nand inflation as breaches to national values, in particular industrial power in Germany and\nneutrality in Austria. Through a process of societalization – the dramatization of institutional\nproblems into moral crises threatening society at large –, economic strain was transformed into\na collective moral grievance, allowing far right actors to redirect public anxiety away from\nUkraine and toward domestic narratives of decline. The chapter demonstrates how the relevant\nparties mobilized existing cultural codes of economic power, national independence, and anti-\nEU sentiment to delegitimize support for Ukraine. It argues that civil sphere theory must more\ndirectly engage with the cultural framing of economic crises, especially in times of polycrisis,\nwhere certain actors infuse material disruptions with symbolic meaning to undermine\ndemocratic cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Objective. This study aims to propose the Internationality Index (IdI) and test its applicability in a case study, revealing critical gaps in institutional data availability of a Research Center (RC), the \"Dr. Eduardo J. Usunoff\" Plain River Hydrology Institute (IHLLA) in Argentina, from 2010 to 2018. It introduces and applies the composite Internationality Index (IdI) to assess institutional performance across education, publication, and financing dimensions.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach. The research employed a documentary analysis using IHLLA’s annual institutional reports (2010–2018) and publicly available data. The IdI was constructed from three subindices: International Education Index (IEI), International Publication Index (PI), and International Financing Index (IFI). Due to limitations in explicit reporting, the final analysis relied on adjusted budget figures for financing, raw publication counts, and formal foreign degree attainment among research personnel for education.\nResults/Discussion. Data analysis revealed moderate international engagement in terms of research personnel training, with 41% of scholars and researchers holding a foreign degree. However, inconsistent reporting, a lack of systematic documentation on short-term mobility, and the absence of journal quartile classification in institutional reports constrained a complete longitudinal IdI calculation. The findings underscore the gap between the need for robust evaluation tools and the availability of standardized institutional data.\nConclusions. The IdI is a viable tool for longitudinal analysis and strategic decision-making, but its effectiveness is severely limited by inconsistent institutional reporting of international variables. RCs must adopt systematic metrics to accurately capture internationality, particularly in international short-term training, international financing and publication quality, to enable effective monitoring and strategic improvement.\nOriginality/Value. This study pioneers the application of the IdI as a synoptic measure to assess internationality specifically within Research Centers, distinguishing it from traditional HEI-focused models. It provides empirical evidence on an Ibero-American RC, contributing to the development of robust evaluation frameworks for science policy.",

Drawing on extensive interviews and archival data, we show that occupational members rely on a number of governance mechanisms to counteract the slippages and sustain a coherent professional logic: (1) practicing professional neutrality, (2) seeking professional autonomy, (3) acquiring and developing logic-bridging expertise, and (4) engaging with peer networks. Combined, these mechanisms both help sustain the occupation’s mandate and jurisdiction, and guide ESG analysts in reconciling competing logics. This study addresses recent critiques that governance is a critical yet understudied dimension of institutional logics research.",

          "abstract": "The two-tier Lowry model brings dynamic simulations of population and employment directly into the planning process. By linking regional modelling with neighbourhood design, the framework enables planners to explore how alternative planning scenarios may evolve over time. The upper tier captures regional flows of people, jobs, and services, while the lower tier allocates these to fine-grain zones such as neighbourhoods or parcels. Implemented in CityEngine, the approach allows interactive visualisation and evaluation of multi-scale scenarios. A case study in South Yorkshire (UK) illustrates how regional forecasts can be translated into local design responses, connecting quantitative modelling with 3D spatial planning.",

          "authors": "Samet AYDIN",
          "abstract": "Rapid advances in technology have created a need for businesses to not only adapt to these developments but also to restructure themselves to place their customers at the center. The rapid adoption of digital innovations by consumers, coupled with their heightened expectations from every business interaction, has rendered digital transformation a necessity. Businesses that fail to successfully implement this transformation will face the threat of extinction sooner than predicted. This disruptive effect has already begun to show its impact on various sectors. In the digital transformation process, businesses’ main goal should be to ensure that all new applications provide added value to their existing or future customers. This study examines changes in customer expectations and behavior in the digital age from a marketing perspective. It states that businesses need to update their marketing mixes to appeal to consumers’ emotions and support their self-expression, while also considering the effort and change required from them and ensuring accessibility anytime, anywhere. Additionally, the concepts of personalization, access instead of ownership (sharing economy), and omnichannel, which have emerged as new trends to meet the expectations of digital customers, are addressed.",

          "abstract": "In diverse societies, how do individuals form views about different groups? We argue that individuals learn norms of interaction in bundles: strong signals about norms toward one marginalized group can diffuse to norms about another. Empirically, we study the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a moment that spurred reckoning with violence against Black Americans. Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology. These results show how salient events shape intergroup norms and highlight the importance of local preference distributions in processes of normative change.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "Semiconductors have become central to geopolitical rivalry and national strategy. This article examines Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a paradigmatic case of institutional transformation in strategic industries. More than a technological leader, TSMC has emerged as an institutional mediator—navigating overlapping policy regimes, supply chain fragmentation, and diverging state agendas. Drawing on TSMC’s global expansion, especially its fabs in Arizona and Kumamoto, I show how firms are increasingly expected to perform quasi-sovereign functions: ensuring supply continuity, managing regulatory tensions, and absorbing geopolitical risk. I argue that prevailing discourses of “decoupling” and “reshoring” misdiagnose the problem, treating physical relocation as a proxy for strategic autonomy. Instead, I theorize institutional absorptive capacity as the foundation of long-term sovereignty: the ability of firms and states to learn, adapt, and coordinate across volatile environments. This requires shifting policy focus from industrial control to institutional design—investing in learning systems, governance capacity, and trust-based cooperation. TSMC’s trajectory thus signals a broader reconfiguration of state–firm boundaries and the emergence of a multipolar, narrative-driven political economy. The article concludes by outlining future research on cross-border institutional agency, strategic narrative construction, and techno-industrial governance beyond the U.S.–China binary.",

          "abstract": "For years, instrumental variables (IVs) based on parity-specific twin births have been considered the “gold standard” method for estimating the causal effect of how the number of children in the family affects parents and children. However, recent research questions the validity of these IVs. This paper argues that the issues with twin birth IVs are more profound than previously recognized. The empirical literature has overlooked the need for a definition of causality. The definition used when applying IVs is the potential outcomes framework. This framework requires clear definitions of the active and control treatments because the causal effect is defined as the difference in outcome between the groups undergoing these two treatments. Previous research using twin birth IVs has failed to provide clear and accurate definitions of the treatments, making it impossible to accurately interpret the estimated effects or assess the validity of the study design and IVs.",

          "authors": "Mohit Singhal",
          "abstract": "Background:\nThe U.S. opioid epidemic imposes a persistent and disproportionate economic burden on payers and communities, driven by complex interactions among clinical utilization, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) policies, and social determinants of health (SDOH). Despite extensive research on overdose and prescribing risk, few studies have quantified the cost burden of opioid use or examined how policy and community-level factors jointly shape it.\n\nObjective:\nThis study develops an interpretable, machine-learning framework integrating PBM cost levers and SDOH indicators to predict and explain county-level variation in opioid-related spending from 2013–2023. The goal is to identify structural drivers of cost, simulate potential savings under policy and social interventions, and support data-driven resource allocation.\n\nMethods:\nUsing CMS Medicare Part D data linked with County Health Rankings and U.S. Census indicators, a Random Forest regression model was trained on ten years of county-level data (≈3,000 counties, 2013–2023). Key predictors included unemployment, income ratio, obesity, smoking, provider density, and PBM variables such as cost per claim and opioid prescribing rate. Model interpretability was achieved through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis and policy simulations testing both PBM and SDOH interventions.\n\nResults:\nThe model achieved high predictive accuracy (R² ≈ 0.97), explaining nearly all observed variation in opioid cost per capita. SHAP analysis revealed unemployment, mental-health-provider density, and income inequality as dominant drivers, while provider access and preventive-care variables exerted cost-mitigating effects. Simulated PBM levers (e.g., formulary tightening, utilization management) reduced predicted costs by 4–6%, while integrated SDOH improvements (e.g., +20% behavioral-health access, +10% primary care) achieved up to 17% savings—equivalent to approximately $23 billion nationally. The combined model demonstrated both statistical robustness and policy relevance.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study reframes the opioid crisis through an economic and structural lens, demonstrating that predictive modeling can translate public-health and PBM data into actionable fiscal insights. The proposed PBM–SDOH integration provides a scalable, transparent framework for targeting interventions in high-burden counties, optimizing healthcare spending, and informing evidence-based opioid policy.\n\nKeywords:\nOpioid costs, pharmacy benefit management, social determinants of health, Medicare Part D, machine learning, SHAP, predictive modeling, public health economics, health policy",

          "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the financial performance of the Gampong Padang Kawa Village Government in managing Village Fund Allocation (ADD) in the 2019–2023 period. The main focus of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the use of village funds, village income growth, and the level of village financial independence. The method used is a descriptive quantitative approach with financial ratio analysis techniques, including effectiveness ratio, growth ratio, and independence ratio. The data used comes from the APBG realization report collected directly from the village office. The results of the study show that the effectiveness of village fund management is relatively high, with an average effectiveness reaching 98%. The income growth ratio shows a positive trend with an average of above 90% per year. However, the village financial independence ratio is very low, which is 0.30%, indicating that the village is still very dependent on central government transfer funds. This finding shows that although the village is able to manage the budget effectively, it has not succeeded in increasing its fiscal independence.\n\nKeywords\nFinancial Performance ; Effectiveness Ratio ; Growth Ratio ; Independence Ratio ; Village ; Fund Allocation",

          "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the influence of economic growth, unemployment rate, and income inequality on crime rates across 23 regencies/cities in Aceh Province during the 2020–2022 period. Using a quantitative approach with panel data and the Fixed Effect Model (FEM) regression method, the results show that economic growth (measured by GRDP per capita) has a positive and significant effect on crime rates, indicating that uneven growth can increase social tension. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has a negative and significant effect on crime, possibly due to the strong role of social networks, government assistance, and the dominance of the informal sector in Aceh. Income inequality (measured by the Gini Ratio) was found to have no significant effect on crime levels. These findings provide critical insights for designing more inclusive, equitable, and context-specific development policies. By strengthening social capital, expanding access to decent employment, and ensuring equitable development outcomes, the results of this study offer a strategic foundation for reducing crime rates while improving the quality of life in Aceh through enhanced public safety, social stability, and sustainable well-being.\n\nKeywords\nCrime ; Economic Growth ; Unemployment ; Income Inequality ; Social Paradox",

Based on data from 23 regencies/municipalities, the findings reveal that both education and poverty jointly have a significant effect on crime. However, only poverty shows a statistically significant partial effect (p = 0.0524), with a negative coefficient, while education does not have a statistically significant influence (p = 0.9654). The adjusted R² value of 63.64% indicates that the model provides a strong explanation of the variance in regional crime rates. The counterintuitive result regarding poverty suggests that in the context of Aceh, strong social cohesion and religious norms may mitigate the criminogenic effects of economic hardship. These findings imply that crime prevention strategies must go beyond economic indicators and incorporate local socio-cultural dynamics. Policy recommendations include implementing context-based educational reforms, promoting community-driven poverty alleviation programs, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration among education, social welfare, and public security stakeholders.\n\nCrime Rate ; Education ; Poverty ; Panel Data ; Aceh ; Fixed Effects Model (FEM)",

While dual-process models were introduced to sociology via Bourdieusian practice theory, Bourdieusian DPT has proven inadequate for theorizing reflective cognition and action, with sociologists looking to pragmatism as an alternative. To support these efforts, I provide a synthetic, elemental account of the pragmatist theory of reflection, delineating reflective cognition’s defining characteristics, core components, its relationship with non-reflective cognition, and its interindividual variation. I then outline the merits of the pragmatist theory of reflection for dual-process research, arguing that it addresses major limitations of Bourdieusian DPT, has broad interdisciplinary support, provides advantages in terms of conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement, and offers sociology a novel research agenda. Overall, I argue that pragmatism provides a robust framework to enhance the study of reflective cognition and is a valuable, if not superior, theoretical alternative for dual-process research. I conclude by discussing the implications of this framework for research on discrimination, inequality, and culture.",
