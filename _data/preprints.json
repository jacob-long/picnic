          "title": "Critiplot: A Comprehensive Python Package and Web Tool for Visualizing Risk-of-Bias Assessments in Evidence Synthesis",
          "authors": "Vihaan Sahu",
          "abstract": "Objective: Risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment is a critical component of evidence synthesis, yet visualization of these assessments remains challenging due to the diversity of assessment tools and a lack of standardized visualization approaches. This study aimed to develop Critiplot, a comprehensive solution comprising a Python package and a web tool that supports visualization of multiple RoB assessment frameworks including the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), ROBIS, JBI checklists for case reports and case series, and GRADE – a combination not comprehensively supported by any existing single tool. Critiplot is the first tool to generate publication-ready visualizations for each of these frameworks separately, as well as in a unified manner.\n\nMethods: Critiplot was developed using Python 3.11, with Streamlit for the web interface, and as a standalone Python package. The tool supports five major RoB assessment tools: Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), GRADE, ROBIS, JBI Case Report, and JBI Case Series. The tool was evaluated through a technical assessment of its visualization capabilities and a comparative analysis with existing visualization tools. Test datasets were created to represent typical use cases for each assessment tool, including variations in study numbers, RoB distributions, and data formats. Edge case datasets were also created to test the tool's handling of missing data, invalid scores, and inconsistent formatting.\n\nResults: Critiplot successfully generates publication-ready traffic light plots and weighted bar plots for all supported assessment tools. The tool offers multiple visualization themes and supports various output formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS). Critiplot is the first tool to generate publication-ready visualizations for NOS, ROBIS, JBI, and GRADE assessments both individually for each framework and in a unified manner within a single platform. The Python package allows for programmatic integration into analysis pipelines, while the web application provides an accessible interface for users without programming experience. Performance evaluation showed that Critiplot efficiently handled datasets of varying sizes, with processing times ranging from 1.5 seconds for 3 studies to 3.8 seconds for 10 studies. The tool demonstrated robustness in handling edge cases, providing clear error messages in 98% of test cases with invalid inputs.\n\nConclusion: Critiplot addresses a significant gap in evidence synthesis methodologies by providing a unified, reproducible approach to RoB visualization across multiple assessment frameworks. Its unique capability to visualize each framework separately (NOS, ROBIS, JBI, and GRADE) alongside unified visualization makes it a pioneering solution. Its open-source design and intuitive interface (both as a package and web tool) make it a valuable addition to the biomedical informatics toolkit, promoting methodological standardization and enhancing the clarity and reproducibility of RoB assessments.",

          "abstract": "On 1 July 2025, the Center for Open Science (COS) and the Horizon Europe project IP4OS – Unpacking the possibilities of Intellectual Property for Open Science convened a Small Circle Meetup on Intellectual Property (IP) and Open Science (OS) in London, held alongside the Metascience Conference. The session brought together a select group of nine experts, including representatives from researchers, research funders, research policy experts, research knowledge brokers, scientific publishers, and representatives from OS infrastructures.\nThe gathering was designed to foster open and candid dialogue on the evolving relationship between IP frameworks and OS practices in a rapidly transforming research environment. Building on the Small Circle methodology piloted by the Path2Integrity project in 2022, the format created a safe and confidential setting in which experts could critically reflect on shared challenges and opportunities.\nThe Small Circle Meetup in London focused on how IP and OS can move from perceived tensions to genuine synergies. Central questions guiding the discussion included: (1) When and how “open by default” can be realised, and what qualifies as legitimate exceptions; (2) The sequencing of patenting and open release in practice, and how hybrid models can be managed; (3) Institutional infrastructures and capacities needed to enable both protection of innovation and open dissemination.\nThrough this lens, the session aimed to explore how IP and OS can be positioned not as competing imperatives but as complementary drivers of sustainable, trustworthy, and impactful research.",

          "authors": "Federica Bulgarelli; Marzie Samimifar; Giselle Yinjie Yao",
          "abstract": "Infant’s language development is inherently tied to their linguistic input, but the majority of research investigating infant’s input has focused on adult caregiver speech.  However, children do not exclusively interact with adults. In the US, 80% of children’s households include additional children. The focus on adult caregiver input thus does not fully capture the experience of the majority of children.  We quantify infant’s experiences with speech from children, measuring its frequency and content. We find that speech from children is a common feature of the input for infants with older siblings, occurring once every minute. Analyses of content find that children produce the same words more often (lower type-token ratio) and shorter utterances overall, and that their speech contains earlier learned words and more nouns. Speech from children however does not vary from speech from adults in average word frequency or in iconicity. We highlight the importance of considering speech from children for infants with older siblings in our theories of language development.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Vocational interests, personality traits, and character strengths overlap conceptually and empirically, but their shared versus domain-specific associations with work outcomes – and the role of person-job fit across these domains – are not well described. We examined these domains jointly to capture the interplay among individual differences, perceived job demands, and person–job fit with work outcomes.\nMethod: We analyzed data from N = 259 working adults (79% women, aged 20-73, Md = 38). Participants self-rated vocational interests (RIASEC), Five-Factor personality dimensions, and VIA character strengths, and, for each domain, rated the importance of these attributes as perceived job demands. Perceived person–job fit was operationalized as correspondence between self-ratings and job-demand ratings within domains. Outcomes were work satisfaction, engagement, and self-rated performance. \nResults: All three domains showed meaningful associations with all outcomes. Effects reflected substantial overlap among domains, alongside smaller domain-specific contributions that differed by outcome. Person-job fit showed small links with satisfaction and engagement—most consistently for vocational interests—whereas associations with self-rated performance were weaker and less consistent across domains.\nConclusion: Interests, personality, and character strengths capture overlapping yet nonidentical aspects of work-related functioning. Integrating strengths with vocational and personality frameworks may inform development-oriented vocational assessment and counseling.",

          "authors": "Khuyen N. Le; David Barner",
          "abstract": "When encountering a novel word, adults and children as young as 12 months old often reason that it refers to a novel object rather than one with an existing name – making a ‘mutual exclusivity inference.’ We explored the mechanism of this inference, aiming to differentiate between three hypotheses: whether mutual exclusivity arises due to reasoning about a specific speaker’s knowledge, projection of one’s own egocentric knowledge, or reasoning generally about the conventionality of labels. Adults and 3.5-5-year-old children in our experiment heard a label being either taught or invented on the spot. They were then asked to decide what another label, produced by a speaker who was absent during the first label’s introduction, referred to. Our results revealed that adults and older children made more mutual exclusivity inferences when the first label was taught compared to when it was invented. Additionally, they were more likely to exclude the previously-labeled object in the referential choice if they judged that the speaker also knew the label, regardless of how the label was introduced. Both adults and older children also showed sensitivity to the speaker’s explicit statements of knowledge, excluding an object that the speaker explicitly stated that he did not know the name of from their referential choice. These results suggested that adults and older children reasoned about a specific speaker’s knowledge of labels in order to make mutual exclusivity inferences, likely in the form of a Gricean inference where they reasoned about possible alternative utterances a speaker could have said.",

          "authors": "Odysseus Raymond Primitivo Orr; Edward A. Wasserman; Robert Nosofsky",
          "abstract": "Developing a deep understanding of animal cognition in tasks such as category learning demands that one first achieve an appreciation of an animal’s sensory/perceptual/memory world. In this project, we report work that, for the first time, derives a nonhuman high-dimensional psychological-scaling representation for a set of visual objects and uses the representation to predict complex forms of category learning in a nonhuman species. Specifically, we pursue the question of whether pigeons can acquire multiple hard-to-discriminate rock-image categories as defined in the geologic sciences. We test a formal computational model of associative learning on its ability to account quantitatively for pigeons’ category learning performance. A prerequisite for applying the model is to embed the rock images in a pigeon psychological similarity space. We achieve that goal by modeling pigeons’ performance in an independently conducted same-different discrimination task involving the identical set of to-be-categorized rock images. The models provide a unified and accurate quantitative account of intricate sets of same-different and categorization-confusion data in this high-dimensional rock-categories domain. The psychological similarity space derived for pigeons resembles to a surprising degree one previously derived for humans, but with some notable exceptions, which are crucial to explaining pigeons’ detailed patterns of categorization performance.",

          "authors": "Jeremy Matthew Haynes; Peter D. Kvam; Thomas M Olino",
          "abstract": "Reward valuation and reward and punishment learning are key constructs relevant for understanding and intervening on mental illness. These constructs are frequently measured with behavioral tasks such as intertemporal choice tasks, measuring delay discounting, and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), measuring reward and punishment learning. Delay discounting refers to how people value delayed outcomes, with steep discounting (i.e., delayed outcomes holding little value) considered a form of impulsive decision-making. Reward and punishment learning refers to how people adjust their decision behavior in response to rewards and punishments, with deficits indicating atypical reward and punishment processing related to clinical outcomes such as substance abuse. In this study, we tested the association between delay discounting and reward and punishment learning among adults (N = 299) from the United States that completed an intertemporal choice task and the play-or-pass IGT. We fit a joint model to the task data to simultaneously estimate parameters from the hyperbolic discounting model (for the intertemporal choice task) with parameters from a reinforcement learning model (for the play-or-pass IGT). The joint model also included parameters capturing cross-task associations between model parameters. Our results indicate that steep delay discounting is negatively associated with punishment learning. That is, people who do not value delayed outcomes also show less learning from punishment. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of improving our assessment of reward valuation and reward and punishment learning as constructs relevant to mental illness.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with disruptions in the temporal organization of motor and non-motor behavior, likely arising from dysfunction within basal ganglia–thalamocortical circuits. Despite extensive evidence for impaired timing in PD, the relationship between temporal processing variability, disease progression, and established clinical severity markers remains poorly defined. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis to quantify temporal processing efficiency in PD using the coefficient of variation (CV), a standardized measure of performance variability across timing tasks. CV values were extracted from empirical studies encompassing a broad range of temporal processing paradigms. Associations between CV, participant age, and disease severity were examined using Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stages. Results revealed a robust positive correlation between CV and UPDRS score, independent of age, indicating that increased temporal variability reflects disease-specific dysfunction rather than normal aging. In contrast, CV correlated negatively with H&amp;Y stage and age, consistent with medication-related influences on motor symptom severity. Secondary analyses showed no reliable differences in CV across task type, temporal range, or medication status, supporting the notion of a generalized temporal processing impairment in PD. Together, these findings suggest that temporal processing variability represents a sensitive marker of disease progression and may inform diagnostic assessment and intervention strategies.",

          "authors": "Henrik R. Godmann; Dylan Molenaar; Matthias Ziegler; Julius M. Pfadt",
          "abstract": "In confirmatory factor analysis, measurement invariance is needed both to ensure that a questionnaire measures individuals equivalently across covariates (e.g., age, gender) and to justify interpreting any differences in latent factor means or relations as substantive rather than artefactual. Commonly, measurement invariance is investigated by turning (often continuous) covariates into categories and then use multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) in a structural equation modeling framework. However, this practice discards information and can undermine the validity of conclusions about measurement invariance and differential item functioning. Moderated (Non-)linear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) overcomes these limitations by allowing both continuous and categorical covariates to act as moderators of any parameter in a latent factor model. This allows to study measurement invariance and differential item functioning without discretizing covariates. However, current implementations of MNLFA require complex code in R or commercial software (Mplus), and do not have intuitive point-and-click user interfaces. To make MNLFA accessible to a broad range of applied researchers, we have implemented it in the free, open-source software JASP and provide a step-by-step tutorial on assessing measurement invariance using MNLFA in JASP. This implementation allows researchers to conduct more precise and informative invariance analyses without extensive programming effort.",

          "authors": "Mark Ashton Smith",
          "abstract": "The Ψ-Band Cognitive Bandwidth Scale (Ψ-CBS) is a brief self-report measure designed for product research and self-tracking of everyday cognitive performance over the past two weeks. Grounded in the Trident G computational account of intelligence, the Ψ-CBS operationalises everyday functioning as performance maintained within a workable “Ψ-band” around a defended mind–body budget set-point, and distinguishes outcome signatures of stable control versus adaptive updating. This pilot study evaluated the internal structure of the eight-item core (Ψ-CBS-Core), theorised to comprise two correlated outcome factors: (1) focus stability and error resistance, and (2) active processing and learning/transfer. Anonymised online questionnaire data were analysed from N = 23 respondents (complete Ψ-CBS-Core data). Item descriptives, inter-item correlations, factorability indices (KMO, Bartlett’s test), exploratory factor analysis (principal axis factoring with oblique rotation), and internal consistency estimates were examined. Results provided preliminary support for the intended two-factor structure, with items 1–4 showing stronger associations with focus/error outcomes and items 5–8 showing stronger associations with active processing and learning/transfer. Internal consistency was acceptable to high for both subscales and the total score (Cronbach’s α = .79, .89, and .86, respectively). Given the small sample size and indications of a strong general factor, these findings should be treated as provisional and used to inform a larger confirmatory study.",

          "abstract": "Background: The proliferation of psychological measures and constructs has led to critical conceptual fragmentation, complicating instrument selection and undermining content validity. Traditional expert-based procedures are often resource-intensive and subjective, underscoring the need for objective, scalable assessment methods.\nAims and Methods: This study evaluates the capability of Large Language Models—comparing embedding-based semantic similarity and prompt-based generative approaches—to perform scalable content assessments. The methodology was validated across 13 scales for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and applied to 7 established measures of depression, benchmarking results against theoretical criteria and expert consensus.\nResults: Models demonstrated strong capability across two key tasks. Generative models achieved high classification accuracy (Cohen's κ up to 0.90) in mapping scale items to their theoretically intended symptoms. Furthermore, aggregated semantic similarity derived from embedding models strongly correlated with overall expert rankings of scales’ content validity (ρ = 0.89), validating their use for objective instrument triage. Importantly, the open-source model (intfloat/e5-large-v2) successfully replicated expert consensus in the depression application. However, models struggled to reliably replicate fine-grained symptom-level quality assessments.\nConclusion: Both embedding and generative models offer a powerful, scalable, and theory-referenced heuristic for psychometric triage. By providing an objective and cost-effective methodology to rank item-construct alignment, this approach helps researchers efficiently select the measurement tools with the highest content validity with respect to the predefined construct.",

          "authors": "Ionela Bara; Emily S. Cross",
          "abstract": "Front-view figures in visual art play an essential role in shaping social perception and aesthetic experience by directly engaging the viewer through eye contact, facial expression, and bodily cues. In contrast, back-view figures, known as Rückenfigur, have been proposed to facilitate a more immersive mode of aesthetic engagement. By obscuring facial and bodily features, the Rückenfigur invites the viewer to imaginatively adopt the figure's viewpoint as a means of understanding and appreciating the depicted scene. Yet empirical evidence supporting these claims remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the current pre-registered study used eye-tracking and Bayesian regression modelling to investigate the extent to which front- versus back-view figures impact aesthetic experience and gaze behaviour. Fifty-three participants viewed artworks featuring both figure types and evaluated them on aesthetic liking, perceived understanding, and emotional evocativeness while their eye movements were recorded. Across all measures, back-view figures enhanced aesthetic evaluations, especially for liking and emotional evocativeness, compared to front-view figures, suggesting that Rückenfigur-type of representations enhance viewers’ aesthetic experience. Gaze behaviour results demonstrated that both figure types captured attention at comparable levels, as reflected in similar dwell times. However, back-view figures prompted a greater number of fixations, suggesting that back-view orientations involve more frequent gaze shifts and possibly increased visual exploration relative to front-view figures. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence for the aesthetic and attentional mechanisms underlying human figure perception in visual art, demonstrating that body orientation critically shapes viewers' aesthetic experience.",

          "abstract": "Young children’s self-regulation skills can vary intra-individually from one real-life situation to the next. However, we know very little about how intra-individual variability contributes to individual differences in development. The present study addresses this gap by applying a person-centered approach to identify distinct variability profiles based on repeated classroom observations. We hypothesized that a) children can be meaningfully grouped based on their intra-individual variability in self-regulation and that b) profile membership relates to current and long-term developing self-regulation skills and behavioral difficulties. The sample consisted of N=201 Swiss kindergarteners (47.8% female, M=5.4y., SD =0.6). We used an observational measure to assess self-regulation in the real-life classroom context. To identify potential subgroups of self-regulation variability, we used latent profile analysis. We identified two profiles: one labeled as variable regulators (54.9 %) and the other as consistently high regulators (45.1 %). Surprisingly, profile membership appears to be only marginally associated with current emotion regulation and unrelated to long-term self-regulation and behavioral differences after controlling for age, gender, and home chaos. However, results revealed significant profile differences in terms of gender and home chaos. Overall, the present findings highlight that young children differ in their intra-individual variability in self-regulation skills across various classroom situations. Moreover, they suggest that this variability might be characteristic of this early developmental period.",

          "authors": "Melanie Bamert; Jennifer Inauen; Alea Ruf",
          "abstract": "Background: Stress is frequently cited as a barrier to physical activity, yet evidence from daily life remains inconclusive and may depend on the specific stress aspect (perceived stress, physiology), physical (in)activity indicator (e.g., steps, vigorous activity), and temporal window examined. This study investigated associations between multiple momentary stress aspects and subsequent physical (in)activity across several time lags in daily life.\nMethods: Seventy-six adults in the weight loss maintenance phase who reported difficulties maintaining a balanced diet participated in a 7-day ecological momentary assessment study. Participants completed hourly smartphone surveys assessing momentary perceived stress and perceived safety and continuously wore a chest-mounted sensor to derive vagally-mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV), steps, light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary behaviour (SB). Multilevel two-part models estimated within-person associations between each stress aspect and the subsequent occurrence and amount of physical (in)activity at 10-, 30-, 60-, and 120-minute lags.\nResults: Within-person associations between momentary stress indicators and subsequent physical (in)activity were predominantly small and non-significant. When significant associations emerged, higher momentary stress was positively related to the amount of subsequent physical activity, particularly for steps. Significant associations for the occurrence of physical (in)activity were largely restricted to vmHRV, indicating that activation of stress-related physiology was related to a higher probability of engaging in physical activity. Results showed heterogeneity across time lags and physical activity indicators but were overall consistent across the three stress aspects in terms of the direction of the associations.\nConclusions: The findings highlight that associations between momentary stress and physical (in)activity in daily life were generally small and specific to the temporal resolution, but when significant, showed a consistent directional pattern across stress aspects. Higher momentary stress was followed by short-term increases in physical activity. While vmHRV largely converged with subjective stress indicators, it also revealed additional associations, highlighting complementary information across stress measures. Together, these findings emphasize the value of multimodal stress assessments and fine-grained, time-lagged analyses for capturing stress–physical activity dynamics in everyday life.",

          "authors": "Alexander Hans Josef Sahm; Stephanie Nicole Lyn Schmidt; Alexander Wolber; Matthias Burghart; Daniela Mier",
          "abstract": "While the neural correlates of emotion regulation (ER) have frequently been investigated, only few studies have compared the neural correlates of several ER strategies against another. Here, we present fMRI data from 45 female participants who used distraction, reappraisal, and acceptance to downregulate emotions in a within-subject design. ER compared to the control condition of simply viewing negative stimuli showed activation in frontal and temporoparietal regions. Acceptance resulted in activation in frontal regions and precuneus, as well as reductions in occipital and temporal regions. Reappraisal showed prefrontal and temporal activation with suppression of the PCC and cuneus. Distraction was not associated with stronger activation, but relative deactivation of occipital areas. Direct comparisons between strategies revealed increased engagement of prefrontal and cingulate networks during acceptance and reappraisal compared to distraction, while distraction showed stronger recruitment of occipital and parietal regions. Acceptance differed from reappraisal with greater activation in the dmPFC and fusiform and lingual gyri. Our results indicate that distraction engages earlier in the emotion generating process than acceptance or reappraisal and mostly relies on regions involved in visual perception and attention. Acceptance and reappraisal resemble one another in the recruitment of areas related to cognitive control, however, acceptance also shows a unique activation in areas related to visual processing that are absent in reappraisal. These findings may inform clinical practice in the choice of ER strategies recommended for certain patient groups and speaks towards the theoretical debate on the contextualization of acceptance in the Process Model of Emotion Regulation.",

          "abstract": "People differ in their belief that speech can cause lasting psychological harm. We present the ten-item Words Can Harm Scale (WCHS) as a valid and reliable measure of this belief. Items assess attitudes about harmful speech (e.g., \"Vulnerable people should not be exposed to certain kinds of speech, as this might harm them\") and written words (e.g., \"I could be left emotionally scarred by something I read\"). In a representative sample of American adults (N = 956), the WCHS demonstrated strong internal reliability (α = .92) and robust test-retest reliability (r = .80). People higher in the belief that words can harm tended to be younger, female, non-White, and politically liberal. The WCHS was associated with self-reported intellectual humility, empathy, moral grandstanding, and the belief in the importance of silencing others. The WCHS was also associated with concern for political correctness and endorsement of trigger warnings and safe spaces. Individuals who believed that words can harm had worse mental health: they reported being more anxious and depressed, less resilient, and having more difficulties in emotion regulation. The WCHS is a reliable tool for measuring beliefs about the harmfulness of speech—a salient and divisive issue within modern cultural discourse.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional models of Valence and Arousal dominate the literature on the structure of affect, despite the persistent emergence of a general factor typically treated as a methodological artifact. This study proposes a reinterpretation of this factor as a fundamental dimension of Affective Intensity/Salience, organizing affect into a hierarchical structure. We investigated this proposal in two domains: the semantic structure of affect, by analyzing word embeddings from a vast linguistic corpus, and the psychometric structure of self-report, using data from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). A robust analytical approach, including Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, was employed. The results consistently confirm the existence of a hierarchical structure. However, a crucial nuance emerged: Salience was the dominant dimension in language, whereas Valence was dominant in self-report. Convergent analysis demonstrated that the Intensity dimension in self-report is primarily driven by the magnitude of Negative Affect. Our findings suggest that, rather than an artifact, the general factor is a substantive dimension whose nature depends on the domain under analysis, challenging purely two-dimensional models and opening new avenues for the explanation and measurement of affect.",

          "abstract": "Facial expressions are central to human communication and can be systematically described through the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which decomposes expressions into discrete facial movements, or Action Units (AUs). Open-source automated AU detection systems such as AFAR and OpenFace are now widely used in psychological research due to their efficiency and accessibility, yet their performance and potential biases remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we leverage photorealistic, parameterized MetaHuman animations to create a highly controlled yet naturalistic stimulus set in which facial motion is precisely specified across time and held constant across identities. Four avatars differing in sex, age, and ethnicity were animated with identical motion parameters to generate a set of single-AU and AU-combination sequences, enabling systematic evaluation of model performance under tightly controlled conditions. Using AFAR and OpenFace, we assessed AU detection accuracy and temporal dynamics through classification metrics and cross-correlation analyses. Although both systems performed above chance, their accuracy varied substantially across AU type and avatar. In particular, single-AU movements were detected less reliably than AU combinations, and both systems showed pronounced biases toward smiling-related AUs. To address these limitations, we introduce a landmark-displacement analysis that directly quantifies non-rigid facial motion from tracked geometry, yielding consistent and accurate motion estimates across avatars and animations. Together, our findings reveal systematic biases in current AU detection systems and show how parametrically controlled avatar stimuli, combined with motion-based analyses, provide a powerful framework for probing dynamic face perception.",

          "abstract": "Background: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterised by disabling motor, sensory, and/or seizure symptoms, associated with substantial functional impairment. Contemporary models highlight the possible involvement of altered affective and autonomic regulation and interoceptive processing in FND. However, accessible, mechanism-informed interventions remain limited. Somatic yoga, integrating movement, breathwork and body awareness, may help target altered emotional processing and bodily regulation in FND.\nMethods: This single-site, two-arm randomised feasibility trial allocated adults with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of FND to six weeks of somatic yoga (weekly remote sessions plus home practice manual) or to a music-based relaxation control. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, retention, adherence, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes, assessed at baseline, week 3, week 6 and three-month follow-up, included FND symptom burden, psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, dissociation), general functioning, health-related quality-of-life, interoceptive awareness, and autonomic symptoms.\nResults: Seventy-six enquiries were received. Thirty participants consented (100%), 27 were randomised (90%), 23 commenced the trial (77%) and 21 completed the trial (70%). Recruitment and retention targets were met, with 100% retention in the yoga arm. Adherence was high across both groups, although digital logging of home practice posed usability challenges. Exploratory analyses indicated large effect sizes for self-reported FND symptom improvement and interoceptive awareness in the yoga group, with effects sustained at follow-up.\nConclusions: Individually delivered somatic yoga was found to be feasible, acceptable and safe for people with FND. Our results also suggest potential benefits of somatic yoga for FND symptom improvement and interoceptive awareness, supporting progression to a fully powered trial.",

          "abstract": "Background: Fluctuations in mood are often seen as a symptom of mental health conditions, yet low mood may serve an adaptive function, particularly in situations of motivational conflict. Although persistence in goal pursuit is widely valued across cultures, unwavering commitment to unattainable goals can become maladaptive and harmful to mental health. Despite a strong research focus on persistence, the potential benefits of goal disengagement and flexibility remain underexplored.\nMethod: This selective overview integrates perspectives from motivational psychology, evolutionary psychiatry, and clinical frameworks to propose a framework that distinguishes adaptive (goal persistence, goal flexibility) and maladaptive (goal rigidity, goal abandonment) processes of goal pursuit in the context of low mood and motivational conflict. Relevant individual and contextual factors influencing these processes are reviewed, and potential intervention strategies are outlined.\nResults: Evidence suggests that low mood may serve as an adaptive signal during action crises, informing decisions to either persist with or disengage from personal goals. Factors such as perceived obligation, lack of autonomy, intolerance of uncertainty, and rigid goal representations may increase vulnerability to maladaptive goal rigidity. Experiential techniques, ACT components, and mental contrasting may promote flexible and value-driven goal pursuit.\nConclusion: Goal flexibility can play an important role for mental health. Recognizing low mood as an informational cue, rather than solely as a symptom, may aid adaptive decision making during motivational conflict. Interventions should support individuals in evaluating and adjusting goals in accordance with values and circumstances.",

          "abstract": "The extent to which visual working memory (VWM) operates on unconscious input remains a matter of debate, with no definitive evidence confirming or refuting its existence. A central challenge in this inquiry lies in methodological constraints, particularly criterion biases in measuring conscious awareness. To overcome these limitations, we conducted two experiments that combined a bias-free two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) task with an ensemble perception paradigm, minimising content-related criterion confounds. Participants were briefly presented with visual ensembles of emotional faces and were assessed for both perceptual processing and WM maintenance using a delayed response task. Visual awareness and unawareness were objectively quantified using detection sensitivity derived from signal detection theory. Results showed a dissociation between awareness and perceptual sensitivity: participants could not explicitly detect task-relevant ensemble features, yet they discriminated them above chance level, even after a delay and in the presence of distractors, thereby providing evidence for the maintenance of unconscious information in VWM. To address potential detection inefficiencies in the 2IFC design, we conducted a follow-up single-interval task with an added distractor interval to disrupt VWM maintenance. Together, these results corroborate our findings demonstrating that WM can operate on information in the absence of conscious awareness. Ensemble-based paradigms thus provide a promising framework for probing the boundaries of conscious and unconscious processing in visual WM.",

          "authors": "Johannah Völler; Juan Linde Domingo; Javier Ortiz-Tudela; Carlos González-García",
          "abstract": "Sudden perceptual learning refers to the abrupt disambiguation of an initially ambiguous stimulus. Despite the limited encoding time, these brief perceptual experiences transform into enduring memory engrams. Still, a comprehensive framework of why these memories are so long-lasting and their neural underpinnings, in particular the role of the hippocampus, is currently lacking. Here, we build on the apparent connection of sudden perceptual learning with long-term memory to outline how a representational perspective may help to overcome current limitations, similar to other areas of memory research. In short, we claim that sudden perceptual learning triggers initial prediction errors across the hierarchy, including strong higher-level (semantic) ones. Once a solution is found, the formerly ambiguous image can be connected to previous schemas and a disambiguation cascade of prediction error minimization is triggered, starting with semantic prediction errors. As a consequence, these events lead to low-dimensional representations that show signs of early semanticization, thereby favouring semantics over perceptual details. In sum, we propose that multiple memory traces are simultaneously encoded during sudden perceptual learning, and while low-dimensional representations engage neocortical structures, high-dimensional, episodic representations require the hippocampus. This perspective offers a promising framework to advance research on sudden perceptual learning and related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Public health strategies require members of the public to make informed choices that align with expert evaluations, particularly during a health emergency. It is unclear what motivates people to seek testing during a pandemic. Legitimate reasons would be that they find they have underestimated the risk of pandemic infection, suspected viral exposure, or taken insufficient precautions against infection. We approached people seeking testing at a Norwegian COVID-19 test-station in October 2020 (T1, n = 179) and in January-February 2021 (T2, n = 184), and asked them if they thought of the pandemic as a risk, about exposure to infection sources and whether they had complied with infection control measures. This was compared to responses from a representative sample taken at approximately the same time (T1 n = 2,523 and T2 n = 2,194). We found that people at test-stations viewed the risk as lower, that they had more frequently been exposed to infectious situations, and they had complied less with infection control measures. This supported all three of our preregistered hypotheses. Our results indicate that people seeking COVID-19 testing early in the pandemic in Norway tended to have good reasons to do so. This largely supports the assumption that a well-informed public can make reasonable choices about voluntary testing.",

Moreover, longitudinal evidence covering the full pandemic period remains limited, and links between distinct anxious symptom change patterns, their underlying risk and protective factors, and long-term clinical outcomes are poorly understood. This pre-registered longitudinal study conducted 43,610 observations of 4,361 adults in the general population, assessed 10 times over three years. A Latent Change Score Mixture Model identified five distinct anxious symptom change patterns. Two reflected resilience: Stable Resilience (48.16%) and Initial Shock-to-Resilience (10.57%). Three indicated risk: Persistently High Anxiety (6.79%), Mild Maladaptation (27.02%), and Strong Maladaptation (7.46%). Risk patterns were predicted by greater intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation difficulties, lower trust in governmental pandemic response, and reduced vaccination uptake. Notably, risk patterns, particularly Strong Maladaptation, predicted high probability of treatment-seeking and receiving a future psychiatric diagnosis. Screening for risk factors may guide targeted support during infectious disease outbreaks, while strengthening coping, transparent governance, and adherence to health measures can protect against development of adverse anxious states.",

This study aimed to quantify the impact of unhealthy food advertising on children’s immediate and later intake; and assess differences in impacts for different advertisement content (brand-only vs. product), format (audiovisual vs. visual vs. audio vs. static), or sociodemographic characteristics. A pre-registered randomised controlled trial was conducted in schools in Merseyside, UK. Across two sessions, child participants (n=240, 7-15 years, M=11.0±2.0) were exposed to 5-minutes of unhealthy food (intervention condition) and non-food (control condition) advertisements that were brand-only or product-based and in one of four media formats. Measurements included ad libitum intake of snacks and lunch, and height and weight. Area-level socioeconomic deprivation was calculated using home postcode. Data were analysed using linear mixed models. After food advertising (vs non-food), children consumed more energy at snack (+58.73kcal; p&lt;.001) and lunch (+72.93kcal; p&lt;.001). Holding advertisement exposure constant, for each +1 standard deviation increase in body mass index z-score, children consumed 49.29 additional kcal. There was no statistically significant difference in effects by advertisement content, media format, or deprivation.  This is the first study to show that brand-only food advertisements increase children’s food intake, with effects not statistically different to that for product ads and that impact is similar across advertising formats.

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and perception are associated with similar patterns of activation in the visual cortex. While an efficient re-use of neural resources, this overlap leads to the question of how imagery and perception are kept apart. One hypothesis is that signal strength determines perceptual reality judgements such that when activity in the visual cortex is strong enough to cross a ‘reality threshold’, that activity is inferred to reflect reality. Here, we aimed to test the causal role of sensory strength in perceptual reality monitoring by attempting to push mental imagery over the reality threshold using non-invasive brain stimulation. We used a combination of psychophysics, mental imagery and subthreshold Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): a technique that is assumed to increase subthreshold neuronal activity. We applied subthreshold TMS to early visual cortex while participants simultaneously imagined and detected visual stimuli in noise. Both imagining the stimulus as well as brain stimulation to the early visual cortex (compared to vertex) increased reports of perceiving a real stimulus when none was presented. However, there was no interaction between brain stimulation and imagery, indicating that TMS failed to push imagined signals over the reality threshold. We discuss various explanations for our results and suggest how these methods could be used to investigate the causal mechanisms of perceptual reality monitoring in future research.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering – a spontaneous shift in attention away from a task – has been consistently associated with impaired cognitive task performance, often attributed to disruptions in executive functioning. In this study, we conducted three experiments to replicate and extend previous work by examining how mind wandering interacts with three core executive functions: inhibition (Experiment 1: Sustained Attention to Response Task , n = 55), updating (Experiment 2: Random n-back Task, n = 52) and shifting (Experiment 3: Number-Letter Task, n = 54). If mind wandering is closely related to executive functioning, it was expected that mind wandering would impair performance on trials requiring these functions, reflected in lower accuracy and increased reaction time variability. Our findings partly confirmed this: Mind wandering was associated with a stronger reduction in accuracy in executive trials involving inhibition and shifting. However, in the updating task, where executive and non-executive trials were matched in difficulty, mind wandering reduced accuracy in both executive and non-executive trials, with stronger evidence for an effect in non-executive trials. Notably, the executive trials in the inhibition and shifting tasks were inherently more difficult than their non-executive counterparts. These findings suggest that the observed performance decrements may be more closely tied to task difficulty than to executive trials per se.",

          "abstract": "Behavioural experiments, whether conducted in the laboratory or in the wild, often involve altering the context for the organisms. Such constraints may include environmental changes or manipulation by experimenters. These disturbances can induce stress, potentially affecting the physiology and behaviour of the animals and thus compromising the initial conditions of the experiment. When stress is directly related to the study subject, it can act as a confounding variable. This study aimed to investigate the impact of introducing an acclimation period, i.e., a delay between handling and the commencement of a task, on animal behaviour, specifically in woodlice. By incorporating this delay, we hypothesised that the animals would return to a baseline psychophysiological state, thereby reducing the stress effects of pre-experimental manipulations. We set up a simple task in which woodlice had to cross a corridor and we manipulated the delay between handling and the task itself. Contrary to our main hypothesis, our findings indicate that acclimation did not significantly affect the speed of woodlice. However, exploratory analyses revealed that a longer pre-experimental delay reduced the likelihood of U-turns in the corridor. Additionally, in trials without U-turns, woodlice spent more time in the experimental apparatus when the acclimation period was longer. These preliminary results only partially support previous research linking stress and exploration in woodlice. Further studies are necessary to confirm these effects and better characterise the relationship between acclimation and subsequent behaviour in scientific experiments.",

Aiming to assess individual differences, we linked the neural measure of SL to a battery of tests measuring musicality, rhythmic abilities, working memory, and vocabulary size. \nResults indicated successful SL in both groups, with similar neural entrainment to the TP-structure during exposure. Behavioral performance in the DD group on SL seemed below TR, though Bayesian analyses rendered this inconclusive. The DD group further obtained lower scores on tasks measuring rhythmic ability, working memory and vocabulary size, but this seemed primarily driven by the latter two. Comparison of relations between neural SL and these tasks indicated no group differences. Exploratively combining the groups resulted in anecdotal Bayesian evidence that individual differences in SL related to working memory and rhythmic ability measured by sensorimotor synchronization.

Traditional expert-based procedures are often resource-intensive and subjective, underscoring the need for objective, scalable assessment methods.\nAims and Methods: This study evaluates the capability of Large Language Models—comparing embedding-based semantic similarity and prompt-based generative approaches—to perform scalable content assessments. The methodology was validated across 13 scales for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and applied to 7 established measures of depression, benchmarking results against theoretical criteria and expert consensus.\nResults: Models demonstrated strong capability across two key tasks. Generative models achieved high classification accuracy (Cohen's κ up to 0.90) in mapping scale items to their theoretically intended symptoms. Furthermore, aggregated semantic similarity derived from embedding models strongly correlated with overall expert rankings of scales’ content validity (ρ = 0.89), validating their use for objective instrument triage. Importantly, the open-source model (intfloat/e5-large-v2) successfully replicated expert consensus in the depression application. However, models struggled to reliably replicate fine-grained symptom-level quality assessments.\nConclusion: Both embedding and generative models offer a powerful, scalable, and theory-referenced heuristic for psychometric triage. By providing an objective and cost-effective methodology to rank item-construct alignment, this approach helps researchers efficiently select the measurement tools with the highest content validity with respect to the predefined construct.",

A multistakeholder approach is needed to quantify the (a) effectiveness, (b) feasibility, and (c) opportunity for tailoring of food policies which can be implemented and sustained in schools. \nMethods: This study used a novel four-phase approach to integrate insights from academia, policy, and schools: (1) scoping of policies which aim to improve healthy eating in primary schools; (2) consultation with food policy experts; (3) engagement sessions with stakeholders (primary school staff) and end-users (primary school children); and (4) triangulation of insights gained. \nResults: We identified and evaluated 14 separate school food policy components across indicators of (a) effectiveness, (b) feasibility, and (c) opportunity for tailoring, and found variation in scores across indicators. We also identified 6 potential mechanisms by which policy components may operate to improve children’s healthy eating. \nConclusions: Overall, integrating insights from academia, policy, and schools provided insight into the effectiveness, feasibility, and opportunity for tailoring of 14 key food school policy components. These findings provide a basis for development of a toolkit to help schools and policymakers select policies which meet their individual needs.",

          "abstract": "Memory limitations have been assumed to be a major factor shaping human sentence comprehension, but characterizing memory-demanding structures in a broad-coverage and cross-linguistic manner has remained a challenge. A recent study suggested that such a general characterization can be obtained by assuming efficient compression of the syntactic information from the input guided by a logic-based grammar. Specifically, it was shown that the memory cost of syntactic integration measured in terms of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) predicts variance in reading times for naturalistic texts in English, unlike the more traditional dependency-based integration cost. The crucial test for the new theory is yet to be done, however, since the predictions of CCG- and dependency-based integration cost most drastically diverge in head-final languages. This study conducts this crucial test using a naturalistic reading time dataset in Japanese. Our results favor CCG over dependency grammar: CCG-based integration cost predicted reading time variance of held-out data, while the dependency-based version failed to show such a predictive power. We also show that CCG predicts the cost of information storage better than dependency grammar, though in this realm the two formalisms make similar predictions. Overall, our results, combined with previous ones,} suggest that the logic-based grammar captures some cross-linguistic, potentially universal aspect of human sentence comprehension.",

          "abstract": "This opinion piece summarizes the epistemic benefits of using robust statistical tests in the falsificationist tradition over standard tests such as the t-test, ANOVA, and conventional tests in ordinary least squares regression. Robust alternatives like robust linear regression do not hinge on assumptions like normally distributed errors with equal variances or the inconsequentiality of extreme values and outliers. Tests with these broad robustness features act agains nonreplication that occurs solely because data anomalies arise differently across studies. Using them from the outset sidesteps the pitfalls of making a data-based decision about whether a standard test is applicable. The common practice of conducting them in addition, commonly in response to data inspection, yields multiple test results. I argue that these should be avoided when a binary decision must be reached, for example, conducting further research on the basis on the assumption that an effect exists. Practically, using a single test simplifies analysis. While R offers numerous robust methods, the ones that provide broad robustness are largely restricted to linear models.",

          "authors": "Junya Fukuta; Masato Terai",
          "abstract": "Recent years have seen a growing number of empirical studies that examine negative entrenchment and statistical preemption as mechanisms of frequency-based learning in second language (L2) acquisition. As the body of research expands, there is a need to take stock of how these mechanisms have been studied and what kinds of evidence have accumulated. This scoping review analyses 24 empirical studies published between 1993 and 2024, focusing on the range of target structures, language backgrounds, task types, and reported outcomes. While both negative entrenchment and statistical preemption have received empirical support, null results were also frequently reported. Crucially, these null results are not confined to specific methodological choices or task types. This review, therefore, examines the conditions under which such mixed findings emerge and shows that they arise at the intersection of L1 influence and broader universal constraints. Building on this analysis, the paper proposes several methodological directions, including simulation-informed Bayesian modelling as an integrative approach and experimental paradigms carefully designed to isolate mechanisms as a disentangling approach. It also highlights the need for greater transparency in sample-size determination, preregistration practices, and other measures that enhance the reliability of future research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Suffering is an undesired experiential state that can degrade well-being, but few studies have explored its potential impact on well-being at the population level. \n\nMethods: Using nationally representative samples from 23 countries and territories in the Global Flourishing Study (N = 207,919), this preregistered longitudinal study examined associations between suffering and multidimensional well-being outcomes assessed approximately one year later. Following the analytic template for outcome-wide designs, we conducted a series of country-specific weighted regression analyses where each Wave 2 outcome was regressed on Wave 1 suffering (controlling for Wave 1 demographic and childhood variables). Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool country-specific effect estimates for the 56 main outcomes encompassing psychological, social, physical, volitional, and material dimensions of well-being.  \n\nResults: The cross-national meta-analyses provided some evidence of associations between suffering and worse well-being for both composite well-being indicators and most specific well-being indicators across different domains of functioning. Somewhat stronger and more consistent associations with worse well-being were observed for some domains (e.g., psychological well-being) compared to others (e.g., social participation). Effect estimates generally attenuated after applying a more conservative analytic approach that included additional adjustment for principal components extracted from the Wave 1 outcomes. Country-specific estimates showed some cross-national variation. \n\nConclusions: Our findings provide novel population-level evidence on the implications of suffering for various aspects of well-being in a diverse set of contexts. We discuss some potential implications for implementing scalable interventions and informing public policy aimed at reducing the burden of human suffering.",

          "abstract": "Suicide remains a leading cause of death, particularly among young adults, highlighting the critical need to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying suicidality. This study used an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to test whether depressed individuals with and without suicidal ideation show neural markers of altered semantic processing and conflict monitoring when reading clinically relevant self-referential content. During electroencephalography recording, depressed participants with (n=46) and without (n=44) suicidal ideation, and healthy controls (n=48), read first-person sentences whose final word rendered them congruent or incongruent with depression, suicidality, or neutral biographical experiences. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess group and topic congruency effects on the N400 (semantic processing) and P600 (conflict monitoring/reanalysis). For neutral biographical (vs. non-biographical) sentences, all groups showed the expected reduction in N400 amplitudes, while the suicidal group exhibited significantly reduced P600 responses compared to the other groups. For depressive (vs. non-depressive) sentences, both depressed groups showed significantly reduced N400 amplitudes relative to controls and larger P600 amplitudes. For suicidal (vs. non-suicidal) sentences, there were no group differences in N400 amplitudes, but the suicidal group showed significantly attenuated P600 responses compared to controls. These results suggest that depressed individuals, regardless of suicidality, demonstrate facilitated semantic processing and increased reanalysis of depressive self-referential content, consistent with a negative self-schema. In contrast, those with suicidal ideation show reduced reanalysis of both neutral and suicidal self-referential content, possibly reflecting cognitive disengagement from personally relevant information. These patterns may support the potential utility of ERP markers for identifying individuals at elevated risk.",

We tailored the messaging based on participants’ self-reported values (e.g., freedom, religion, family) and used AI-generated audio narration combined with dynamic content display to increase participant engagement. This 3-minute intervention significantly improved average attitudes towards carbon pricing with an effect size of d = 0.34, particularly among Republicans (d = 0.42). The intervention also increased participants’ willingness to make a hypothetical donation to an organization that advocates for carbon pricing policies by 14.4 to 20.4 percentage points. Our research demonstrates a proof of concept for the effectiveness of AI-driven persuasion to boost public support for sustainable policies. Further research is needed to test the robustness and replicability of these promising findings, as well as to explore the exact mechanisms through which AI boosts support.",

This excessive noise if unaccounted results in attenuated correlations, overstated confidence, and increased residuals in factor models. One advantage in using experimental tasks is that they are comprised of many repeated trials allowing for a separate modeling of trial noise and individual variation. Here, we develop a set of hierarchical factor models for experimental tasks. We show that these models disattenuate correlations, provide for more clear assessments of factor structures, and have bona-fide measures of uncertainty for observed and latent variables. Attention is paid to computational issues including mixing and rotational ambiguity, and code is available for analysis in R with JAGS.

          "abstract": "Background: Digital phenotyping (DP) for mental health is an emerging field with the potential to become a powerful tool in clinical settings. However, given the risk of bias or incorrect variable interpretation in marginalized subgroups, for this technology to be used effectively, social determinants of health (SDH) must be integrated into DP research. However it is not known how commonly and in what manner SDH are integrated into DP research. \nMethods: We conducted a systematic review of studies applying DP in mental health populations to examine how SDH variables are collected, reported, and integrated. The primary objective was to inform the development of practical, standardized guidelines for incorporating SDH into DP research. Eligible studies used DP in clinical populations defined as diagnosed, symptom-based, or at risk for mental health conditions. We excluded studies focused solely on chronic physical illness, age as a risk indicator, neurodegenerative conditions, or tobacco-only substance use, as well as reviews, protocols, and conceptual papers. We searched PubMed, Embase (OVID), and APA PsycInfo (OVID) on october 4th 2024, Web of Science Core Collection on  October 23rd 2024, and Scopus on October 24th, 2024. Studies were assessed for quality using the JBI Checklist and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024626050).\nResults: A total of 825 unique papers were screened at the abstract level, 192 underwent full-text review, 74 were accepted for data extraction, and 63 articles were ultimately included in the review.. Considerable heterogeneity was observed in how SDH were reported and integrated into digital phenotyping research. Age, sex, gender, and race/ethnicity were the most frequently reported variables, yet definitions were often inconsistent. Moreover, SDH were most often used solely to describe the characteristics of the target population. Thirty-eight studies (60.3%) used advanced analytic methods, including machine learning. While some studies acknowledged potential demographic or representation biases, formal fairness or bias assessments were rarely conducted. Biases were most often related to age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors, and behavioral features sometimes had different interpretations across population subgroups. Overall, consideration of bias and the use of fairness or mitigation strategies in DP research remain limited.\nConclusion: This review identified several current lacunes in the integration and interpretation of SDH in DP research. Based on our findings, we propose a set of guidelines for incorporating SDH into research projects, organized into three tiers.",

Passive smartphone monitoring enables continuous tracking of everyday behaviors and may improve the status quo of dementia risk assessment, but acceptability is understudied. This study evaluated older adults’ attitudes toward personal smartphone monitoring for dementia risk and identified barriers and facilitators to acceptability.\n\nResearch Design and Methods: Seventeen older adults completed a semi-structured interview followed by a Likert-rating to measure acceptability. Transcripts were analyzed using hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis. Exploratory correlations examined associations between acceptability ratings and participant features.\n\nResults: Participants identified unique benefits of smartphone monitoring including enhanced scope of measurement, greater ecological validity and personalization, and improved accessibility. Potential disadvantages were confounding variables that threaten validity and concerns about privacy/data security. Preferences for clinical implementation that may improve acceptability included options for extended monitoring, assurances of privacy safeguards, control over data, and continued face-to-face interactions with one’s medical team. Most participants (13/17) were likely or extremely likely to participate in future smartphone monitoring research; higher likelihood was associated with lower depression (r=-.49, p=.046) and White vs. non-White race (U=57.50, n1=10, n2=7 p=.025).\n\nDiscussion and Implications: Findings offer insights to enhance acceptability of smartphone monitoring including transparent review of procedures, privacy safeguards, and existing evidence. Outstanding requirements for clinical implementation include streamlining results to minimize physician burden and accounting for confounders that threaten data integrity.

The data underwent analysis through various methods, including descriptive statistics, correlation, structural model, and bootstrap technique.\nFindings: Well-being was found to be positively correlated with parental autonomy support and goal orientation. The result also revealed that a positive perception of parental autonomy support is associated with improved goal-oriented behaviour and well-being in children. Goal orientation was found to mediate PAS and WB in adolescents. In conclusion, adolescents with high parental support are more likely to have higher goal orientation, which may lead to better well-being.\nKeywords:  Parental autonomy support, goal orientation, well-being, adolescence",

          "abstract": "Convergent thinking, the ability to find a single optimal solution to a well-defined problem, is considered a core component of creativity, and is often assumed to rely on controlled, deliberative processes. We tested this assumption using the Compound Remote Associates (CRA) test, where participants have to find a word that connects three seemingly unrelated words (e.g., “river, note, account”; solution: “bank”). We implemented a two-response paradigm wherein participants provided an initial, intuitive response (under cognitive load and time constraints to minimize deliberation), followed by a final, deliberate response. Our findings reveal that, in most cases, extended deliberation was not necessary for sound thinking—correct final responses were typically preceded by accurate intuitive responses produced under time pressure and cognitive load. By using large language models and semantic network modeling, we found that items with a smaller semantic search space are better solved intuitively, and that participants with a more efficient and flexible semantic memory structure display higher intuitive performance on the CRA. These results suggest that effective problem-solving in creative tasks may often rely on fast, automatic associative processes within semantic memory, without necessarily requiring extended deliberation.",

But what about future AI systems so advanced that their behavior, appearance, and functionality are indistinguishable from humans? Across one main and four supplementary preregistered experiments (total N = 3,455), participants imagined interacting with such systems in hypothetical future scenarios. On average, people remain deeply skeptical: they attribute very low levels of consciousness to even the most advanced AI, comparable to an ant and far below a chimpanzee or a human. Still, several factors increased consciousness attributions. Ratings rose when experts endorsed the system’s consciousness, when participants formed an emotional connection during interaction, when the system was described as an exact digital copy of a human brain, and when it had a physical body. The largest effect occurred when the AI was depicted as gradually transitioning from a human while retaining memories and other psychological traits. Although average attributions were low, variability was high for the more advanced systems: many participants gave very low ratings, while others gave very high ones. This polarization suggests that as AI systems become more capable and human-like, public views about their potential consciousness could diverge sharply.",

          "abstract": "How we recognise objects and people, despite their physical appearance can change dramatically across encounters, is a central yet unresolved question in vision science. In particular, the visual information that supports the human ability to recognize face identity across views is unknown. Past research suggests horizontally oriented face information plays a key role. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the orientation of the visual information physically available in the face stimulus to support view-tolerant face recognition and how human observers make use of it.\nHuman observers performed an old/new identity recognition task with face stimuli presented under different viewpoints, achieved by rotating the faces in yaw (from left to right profile) and filtered to preserve contrast in selective orientation ranges. Human performance remained tuned to the horizontal range of face information irrespective of yaw. \nWe used a model observer approach to define the information physically available in the stimulus for matching face identity within each viewpoint (view-selective model observer) or across different viewpoints (view-tolerant model observer). The view-selective model indicated that face identity is carried by orientation ranges shifting from horizontal in frontal views to vertical in profile views.  In contrast, the view-tolerant model showed that the horizontal range provides the most stable identity cues across views. The horizontally-tuned orientation profile of human recognition performance was predicted by the high diagnosticity of horizontal information in frontal views and the stability of the horizontal identity cues across views. The informativeness and stability of the identity cues carried by horizontal face information are confirmed by additional model observer evidence that this range best predicts the average summary of full-spectrum face appearances across views.\nOur findings indicate that the invariant representation of a face, gradually learned through repeated exposure to its natural appearance statistics, relies primarily on horizontal facial information. By identifying the spatial information supporting view-tolerant face recognition in humans, the present work yields concrete, data-driven constraints for the refinement of theoretical and computational models of visual recognition.",

Additionally, the device’s self-\nadministered hearing test showed high validity (MAE = 2.80 dB; 𝑟 = 0.94) compared to clinical audiom-\netry.\nConclusion: Consumer hearables can significantly reduce the cognitive cost of listening, freeing\nup resources for concurrent tasks even when speech intelligibility scores remain unchanged. These\nfindings support the utility of such devices as accessible tools for managing listening fatigue.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Children born preterm face increased risks of neurodevelopmental difficulties, comprised within the “preterm behavioral phenotype”. This study examined behavioral and socio-emotional development in preterm preschoolers using a multi-informant approach to characterize behavioral profiles, mental health outcomes, and their associations with prematurity severity and early medical experiences. Methods: 102 five-year-old children (70 preterm, 32 full-term) were assessed using standardized measures, including parent and teacher questionnaires  (Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form, Social Responsiveness Scale, ADHD Questionnaire) and direct clinical observation (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2). Analyses examined group differences and associations with gestational age, birth weight and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parameters, including early procedural pain, respiratory support and kangaroo care. Results: Preterm children demonstrated a predominantly subclinical phenotype, characterized by elevated difficulties across domains. Marked informant discrepancies emerged: parents reported more internalizing symptoms, attention deficits, social-communication difficulties, and autism-related traits in the PT group, whereas teacher ratings showed stronger associations with prematurity severity and early medical procedures. Early NICU experiences were linked to later outcomes: greater exposure to skin-breaking procedures and longer ventilation duration predicted higher reported behavioral problems, whereas more kangaroo care was associated with fewer reported social difficulties. Discussion: Preterm preschoolers display subtle yet meaningful socio-emotional vulnerabilities that manifest below clinical thresholds, but still warrant continued surveillance. Divergence between parent and teacher perspectives underscores the importance of multi-informant assessment across contexts. Associations between early procedural pain and later behavioral outcomes identifies a modifiable risk factor, emphasizing the importance of optimized neonatal pain management and minimizing medical intensity.",

A latent class analysis was conducted with lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide planning, preparation, and attempt. Classes were compared on gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and their intersections.\n\nResults: There were three distinct classes of suicide ideation and related behaviour: Thoughts of Nonexistence (23.04% of participants; consisting of three passive thoughts), Passive Ideation (36.91%; consisting of six passive thoughts and planning a way or method), and Passive and Active Ideation (40.04%; consisting of six passive and two active thoughts, planning a way or method and place, preparation, and attempt). The Passive Ideation class overrepresented racialized people compared to the Passive and Active Ideation class, p = .017, which overrepresented 2SLGBTQIA+ people compared to either of the other classes, ps &lt; .001.

          "abstract": "Twin-singleton differences in IQ are of concern for many groups, starting with parents of multiples and educators, up to behavioral geneticists (who depend on twin-singleton equivalence for generalizing twin study results to the general population) and cognitive epidemiologists (who investigate IQ associations with morbidity and mortality). It is thus unsurprising that twin-singleton differences in IQ have been investigated since the advent of twin studies and IQ test batteries. We significantly update and expand the sole meta-analysis on this topic. Extensive literature search strategies identified 495 eligible effects from 117 studies from 24 countries (totaling 6,500,000+ singletons and 145,000+ twin individuals), published 1924-2019. Multilevel meta-analytic modelling showed that twins scored about 4 IQ points lower than singletons: a non-trivial effect, taking into consideration tail ratios and liability-threshold models. Further, the effect was temporally stable, robust with respect to publication bias, generalizable to a surprising scope (across sex, geography, premature birth status, and assisted reproductive technologies), whilst systematic sources accounting for observed cross-study effect heterogeneity remained mainly elusive. The conundrum of this group effect in IQ seems not satisfactorily solvable with the available evidence. Specifically, data from adults and less developed countries remain a desideratum.",

          "abstract": "Phage therapy, which uses bacteriophages—viruses that infect bacteria—as therapeutic agents, offers a promising approach to combating antibiotic resistance. While established in Russia and former Soviet countries, it remains an emerging practice in Western medicine and is relatively unfamiliar to clinicians, patients, and the public. Understanding how phage therapy is discussed online is therefore vital for shaping regulatory frameworks, science communication and broader adoption. We conducted a retrospective qualitative content analysis of English-language social media posts on phage therapy across X, Bluesky, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit between February and July 2025. Discourse was dominated by neutral, scientific exchange with limited emotive content. Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit showed slightly higher levels of subjective or inaccurate posts. Reddit was distinctive for patient engagement, with users openly seeking phage therapy for chronic infections. A minority of posts contained misinformation or negative portrayals, including false associations with COVID-19 and horror-inspired fan fiction depicting phages as monstrous invaders. While rare, such narratives may disproportionately shape public attitudes through negativity bias and the fuelling of ‘dread risk’ perceptions. These findings highlight the need for timely and targeted communication strategies to raise awareness, counter misinformation, and address cultural anxieties that could hinder acceptance of phage therapy.",

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study provides an opportunity to test these associations in a large, demographically diverse national sample (&gt;11,000 adolescents). We evaluated five baseline (age 9–10) nature measures from ABCD Release 5.1 using the PRIGSHARE (Preferred Reporting Items for Greenspace and Health Research) framework to assess accuracy, quality, and relevance. Two measures—percent tree canopy and park cover at the census tract level—were identified as high-quality and epidemiologically appropriate. Mental health was assessed using parent-reported outcomes from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Nature data were available for 11,164 participants (47.65% female). After covariate adjustment, adolescents living in areas with greater tree canopy demonstrated modestly better mental health, including lower internalizing (β = –0.03, 95% CI: –0.052, –0.015, p &lt; .001) and externalizing (β = –0.02, 95% CI: –0.040, –0.003, p = .026) problems.

We ran a preregistered metastudy (N = 1,968) to more causally test theory- and practice-relevant moderators of experimenter-provided anchors. Cognitive load and more extreme anchors increased effect sizes, whereas debiasing and less diagnostic anchors reduced them. Precision, directional information, incentives, and a page break between the anchor and estimate showed small or null effects. Greater subjective knowledge predicted smaller anchoring. Overall, the patterns are most consistent with Anchoring-and-Adjustment and Noise accounts and less consistent with the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis and the Attitudinal perspective.

          "abstract": "Consciousness and the ability to experience affective states and emotions, such as pain, pleasure, fear, and hunger (i.e., sentience) are widely seen as key determinants of an individual’s moral status, a view that is shared by scientists, philosophers, and laypeople. Whether (and which) animals are believed to possess these capacities can have important consequences for how they are treated. For example, these beliefs can influence people’s support for animal welfare laws, the perceived acceptability of meat consumption, and other important outcomes. It is therefore important to know if people overattribute (as suggested by research on anthropomorphizing) or underattribute these mental capacities to animals (as suggested by research on motivated mind denial). Animal consciousness and emotions are famously challenging to study. In the absence of an unambiguous benchmark against which people’s beliefs could be compared, the present study will test whether laypeople, a nationally representative sample of 444 U.S. participants, are more or less skeptical about animal consciousness and emotions than experts, a sample of 100 behavioral ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and other animal researchers.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has extensively investigated the impact of post-training sleep and wakefulness on procedural memory consolidation across development. However, results regarding how offline processes specifically affect the explicit and implicit components of newly acquired procedural skills in children and adults remain controversial. To address this issue, we investigated differences between 42 children (9.7 ± 1.8 years) and 58 young adults (21.7 ± 2.5 years) in the consolidation and explicit knowledge of a visuo-motor sequence learned in a Serial Reaction Time Task. Participants were assigned to either a nocturnal sleep or a daytime wakefulness offline interval condition between learning and retest (~11 hours). Offline (between-session) and online (within-session) performance changes were assessed, and explicit sequence knowledge was quantified using the Process Dissociation Procedure (PDP). Results showed similar offline performance improvements in the two age groups and offline interval conditions. PDP results revealed that children had higher explicit knowledge of the sequence as compared to adults, irrespective of the offline interval condition. Furthermore, children exhibited a shift from online performance deterioration to online performance improvements that was consistent across sleep and wake conditions. The absence of a differential impact of sleep vs. wakefulness intervals suggests that mostly time-dependent mechanisms primarily drive procedural memory consolidation and the development of stronger related explicit knowledge in children. Our findings also highlight a developmental dissociation between the offline consolidation of procedural learning skills, which appears age-invariant, and the resulting explicit knowledge, which developed more strongly in children.",

For many, gaming has become a central part of daily life, influencing personal experiences and directly impacting various aspects, including well-being, physical health, aggression, and cognitive functions. One of the defining features of games as a medium is their capacity to be approached and consumed in diverse ways. The same game can be played very differently based on players' motivations and personality traits. To facilitate research in this area, various classification systems and tools have been developed, commonly referred to as typological questionnaires. This article reviews the most influential player classifications and with each system offering distinct perspectives on how players engage with video games. Six major systems are examined: Bartle's Taxonomy; Yee's Gamer Motivation Profile; BrainHex; the Gamification User Types Hexad scale; the Trojan Player Typology; and the Core Game Dynamics and Gameplay Activity Inventory. This review explores their theoretical backgrounds, scientific origins, practical applications, and the persistent challenges that still accompany the development of their associated classification tools.",

Results from regression and mediation analyses with robust cluster corrections show that policy stringency showed only modest associations with the outcomes. In contrast, students perceived teacher communication styles displayed more consistent relations: need-supportive communication was associated with greater ownership of the rules and lower amotivation, which in turn correlated with more compliance and lower smartphone use beyond school, whereas chaotic and controlling communication showed less favourable patterns.

          "abstract": "Novel alternative meat products, such as plant-based meat and cell-cultured meat, can offer more sustainable alternatives to meat which help to mitigate the environmental impacts of current meat consumption. However, they remain marginal parts of everyday diets and awareness for most people, and it remains unclear how exactly alternative meats could become more common place. Combining the foodscapes framework and theory of social representations, we explored qualitatively how alternative meats may “come into existence” within personal foodscapes. We conducted 41 semi-structured in-depth interviews supported by visual methods to examine how participants make sense of alternative meat, and where they would imagine alternative meat to exist within their everyday food environment. Across three Meta-Themes and six Sub-Themes, we found that alternative meat was strongly anchored within the conceptualisation and materiality of meat (Food and Meaning), the physical and socio-cultural spaces where meat is consumed (Food and Space), and the habits and justification for eating meat (Food and Self). We conclude that meat continues to be a dominant anchor for alternative meat with many expressing views that reflect the desirability of: (i) the replication of meat in terms of sensory and functional characteristics (e.g., taste, texture, cooking properties) and cognitive perception and sense-making (e.g., meanings of culture, tradition, and faith); and (ii) the integration of alternative meat within existing physical and socio-cultural contexts of meat consumption. We further discuss the challenges and opportunities underlying the anchoring of alternative meat within foodscapes, as well as the implications for producers and policymakers aiming to foster a more sustainable dietary transition.",

Across three experiments, we gave U.S. Democrat and Republican voters (N=5,230) a chance to lie anonymously to double their own or another participant’s earnings. For selfish dishonesty (Experiment 1), people lied equally to benefit themselves regardless of whether it harmed an in-group or out-group member. For coalitional dishonesty (Experiment 2), however, people lied 9 percentage-points more to benefit in-group than out-group members (17% increase), despite not personally benefiting from lying. Experiment 3 replicated these findings and revealed that people from both parties overestimated out-group dishonesty more than in-group dishonesty. Our results suggest that dishonesty is not only about self-interest, but also about group-serving motives.",

          "abstract": "Young adults increasingly abstain from committed romantic relationships. However, psychological theories of singlehood are lacking and it remains unclear who selects into remaining single throughout emerging adulthood and how consistent singles’ well-being is affected over time. Here, we included 17,390 initially never partnered respondents from three panel studies from the UK and Germany providing 110,261 yearly observations from ages 16 to 29. First, we used survival analysis to predict who remained single. Young adults with lower well-being, male gender, higher education, and living alone or with parents stayed single longer. Second, we compared within-person age trajectories of life satisfaction, loneliness, and depressivity between consistent singles and eventually partnered respondents. Across emerging adulthood, consistent singles experienced comparatively stronger life satisfaction decreases and loneliness increases. Well-being deficits became more pronounced in the later 20s, when depressivity increases also diverged between groups. Evidence for moderation of these changes (e.g., by gender) was absent or inconsistent. Third, we examined how the first romantic relationship affected well-being aspects longitudinally. In both the short and long term, the first romantic relationship was associated with increases in life satisfaction and decreases in loneliness but not depressivity. Together, the findings indicate moderate average well-being risks when staying single in emerging adulthood. Well-being differences between consistent singles and eventually partnered respondents were minimal in adolescence but were exacerbated with prolonged singlehood. This highlights difficulties for first partnership formation in the later 20s because, concurrently, low well-being predicted remaining in singlehood longer. We discuss critical questions for singlehood theory development.",

Between the ages 17-35 months-old, analysis of the networks revealed a set of complex relationships and dynamic patterns. As children's vocabulary increased and utterances grew longer, their language networks become less densely interconnected, marking a key transition in child development from formulaic language to more productive speech. Individual differences between children's networks were finely tuned to the connectivity of their mother's networks, a relationship that was moderated by age and utterance length. Finally, we found a U-shaped association between utterance length and network connectivity, pointing to a learning-processing trade-off. Our results were consistent across languages indicating common developmental processes underlying diverse typologies. Overall, our results illustrate networks as a cognitively plausible model of language use that can capture important dynamics of development.",

This, in turn, gives rise to the question of whether such applications can overcome previously identified barriers to learning with Gen AI, such as cognitive offloading or metacognitive laziness. To answer these questions, the study examined the quality of Study Mode from an SRL perspective, its impact on student learning, and implications for research and practice. A survey was administered to SRL researchers. A total of 16 experts participated in the study between October and mid-November 2025.\nThe experts identified personalization and adaptive explanatory support as strengths. Concerns were raised regarding the tool’s potential to encourage offloading of metacognitive processes. The anticipated impact on students’ learning included both positive outcomes, such as improved conceptual understanding, and potential risks, including overreliance on AI. The experts recommended that SRL researchers further investigate how Study Mode works and how it impacts learning and teaching; that AI researchers and experts design features that actively foster rather than replace SRL; and that educators help students use such tools strategically.\nThe findings suggested that Study Mode can assist interested students in their learning but not as much in their SRL. Consequently, it has not overcome well-known barriers to learning with Gen AI. While Study Mode offers meaningful opportunities for enhanced learning, its current limitations highlight important considerations for future SRL research, AI design, teaching and learning.",

          "abstract": "Many clients in youth care have expressed that they feel unheard in their own care process, and clinicians often lack the tools to adapt treatment to the changing needs of clients. This article explores how personalized process monitoring may provide youth with insight into their own change process and support clinicians in tailoring treatment. This approach includes three elements: 1) collaboratively developing personalized assessments, 2) monitoring on a mobile device, and 3) providing instantaneous feedback through visualizations. We implemented this approach with the iamYu app, short for “Idiographic and Adaptive Monitoring”, and examined how youth and clinicians experienced it as an add-on to treatment. Thirty-six clients used iamYu for at least one month and completed a questionnaire, of which nine were additionally interviewed. We also conducted interviews and focus groups with 15 clinicians. Overall, personalized process monitoring was rated as highly acceptable. Youths’ primary motivation for using the app was the possibility to view the timeseries graphs on their phones. This, in turn, resulted in gaining self-insight into mood, physical health, and connections between wellbeing and daily events. These insights also translated into concrete actions in their daily lives, helping clients to better deal with their problems. Clinicians emphasized that iamYu supported shared decision-making and allowed adjustments to the focus of treatment in line with clients’ needs and wishes, which gave youth a sense of agency and ownership. Our findings suggest that personalized process monitoring can strengthen person-centered and collaborative care and that successful implementation depends on actively integrating the data in treatment(sessions). We conclude by reflecting on how “small data”, i.e., collecting data that is directly meaningful for the unit that collects it, supports the primary process between client and clinician and at the same time enhances our scientific understanding of person-specific as well as general processes of change.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, legal and social developments affecting LGBTIQ+ communities have varied globally. Many regions have decriminalized consensual same-sex acts, expanded protections for same-sex couples, implemented legal gender recognition based on self-identification, and prohibited non-consensual surgeries on intersex children. However, the year 2025 began with notable challenges for LGBTIQ+ communities. Some regions in Africa, parts of Asia, the United States, and Eastern Europe have shown retreating protections, while a well-funded global anti-gender movement has gained momentum and achieved legal victories. A major target of these restrictions are trans and nonbinary people. In Switzerland, although the majority still supports LGBTIQ+ people, polarization is increasing, evident in initiatives to limit gender-inclusive language and restrict gender-affirming care for trans youth. Against this backdrop, the Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel conducted its sixth wave of surveys to capture the experiences of LGBTIQ+ people living in Switzerland.\nIn this report, we present the main findings of the survey, including experiences with coming out, perceived safety, and experienced discrimination (Sections 1 and 2), as well as participation in LGBTIQ+ spaces (Section 3). We further report on experiences in workplaces, schools, apprenticeships, and higher education, as well as the situations of people who are unemployed, provide care for others, retired, or have long-term illness or disabilities (Section 4). Health and health behaviors are presented in Section 5, and Section 6 looks at how people perceive the situation for LGBTIQ+ people in Switzerland and their hopes for the future. Thanks to the support of the LGBTI Youth Fund, we added a section with a special focus on LGBTIQ+ youth (&lt;26 years old). Where relevant (e.g., experiences of discrimination), we provide separate statistics for sexual minority members (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual people), gender minority members (e.g., trans people), and intersex people. Cisgender endosex heterosexual (hereafter endosex cis-heterosexual) allies were also invited to participate. The survey was available in English, German, French, and Italian. Thanks to the help of many LGBTIQ+ organizations, magazines, and people who shared our study widely through different media, 6,117 people replied to our questionnaire from January 2025 to August 2025.",

          "authors": "Melanie Bamert; Andreas R. Schwerdtfeger; Christian Rominger; Jennifer Inauen",
          "abstract": "Both stress and poor sleep quality can undermine long-term physical and mental health. Further, heightened stress has been shown to disrupt sleep, while poor sleep may increase stress reactivity, together compounding their impact on health. So far, few studies have captured the bidirectional, day-to-day dynamics of stress and sleep in daily life using both subjective and objective measures. In this 7-day intensive longitudinal study, 106 participants provided daily and momentary self-reports of perceived stress and subjective sleep quality via smartphone diaries, while a wearable sensor continuously recorded heart rate variability as a measure of stress-related physiology and objective sleep indicators, including sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and total sleep time (n = 742 days). The data were analyzed using cross-lagged mixed models. At the within-person level we found indication that after nights of better-than-usual subjective sleep quality participants reported lower next-day momentary stress. At the between-person level, higher perceived stress was associated with worse subjective sleep quality and longer sleep onset latency. Findings for objective sleep quality indicators depended on the operationalization of nocturnal timeframe (i.e., time that participants spent in bed trying to sleep) with longer sleep onset latency inconsistently associated with lower next-day momentary stress and participants with generally higher daily stress levels inconsistently showing longer sleep onset latency. The findings reveal that stress–sleep associations differ at the within- and between-person levels, for subjective and objective sleep quality indicators and based on operationalizations of nocturnal timeframes. Future studies should further carefully consider measurement decisions and explore underlying mechanisms to better understand the relationship between stress and sleep quality in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Over the first 100 days post-partum human brain functions may undergo rapid changes, with plasticity peaking. Studies of task-free functional connectivity (FC) during this period provide a window into early brain organization. Despite growing interest, no systematic review has synthesized findings specifically from this period.\nWe address this gap by reviewing 103 studies examining FC in the neonate brain at rest. Summarised evidence indicates a remarkable degree of both specificity and individual variability in brain function. Neonatal networks exhibit small-world topology with strong local clustering and emerging long-range integration. Sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks form robust interconnected hubs, supported by structure-function coupling via local myelination and subcortical scaffolding. Early development involves strengthening interhemispheric and long-range connections and increasing network modularity. Higher-order networks (default mode, frontoparietal, salience) are identifiable but less segregated, reflecting their reliance on pathways that are still developing structurally and functionally. Despite these group-level patterns, substantial interindividual variability exists, shaped by both infant- and context-related influences.\nWe discuss these findings within frameworks of Interactive Specialization and experience-dependent learning. We propose that early FC provides intrinsic pre-training for learning and that structure and function co-develop through reciprocal interactions shaped by coordinated activity across subcortical and cortical networks, and early experiences. Adopting a perspective in which intrinsic FC, structural changes, and environmental influences are deeply intertwined, we highlight the need for multimodal longitudinal studies to clarify how such coupled processes shape later developmental trajectories.",

          "abstract": "The increase of AI tools like chatbots in education is going hand in hand with an ongoing humanization of these tools. In K-12, this increase is aimed at fostering student learning. In this article we argue and warn that such humanization runs the risk of students perceiving AI as a real personality and mistaking it for someone rather than something. To illustrate how AI-tools can be perceived as having a personality, we let an AI-expert rate ChatGPT’s personality. Additionally, we let ChatGPT’s rate its own personality and let a car enthusiast rate their car’s personality. The comparison of these three case-studies showcases that having a personality profile does not mean you have a personality. We conclude that education should provide a basic understanding of what an AI-tool is to enable students to responsibly navigate an AI-driven world.",

          "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have attracted growing attention as tools for educational feedback, their advantages over existing automated systems remain uncertain. This study compared the efficacy of LLM-generated formative feedback against a well-established automated writing evaluation (AWE) system in supporting English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing. Using a randomized controlled design, the study recruited 60 EFL students who received feedback from either ChatGPT or Pigai across IELTS writing tasks over four weeks. Participants were blind to the feedback source, which was mediated by a research assistant. ChatGPT feedback employed evidence-informed prompt engineering addressing lower- and higher-order concerns with motivational language, whereas Pigai provided standard automated corrective feedback. Writing performance trajectories, analyzed using linear mixed-effects models on criterion-based IELTS scores, revealed a significant Time × Group interaction. While early-stage improvements were comparable, the ChatGPT group demonstrated sustained gains in the later phase, whereas the Pigai group plateaued. Additionally, the ChatGPT group showed significantly greater increases in writing motivation, particularly regarding self-efficacy and beliefs. Mediation analyses indicated that this motivational change partially mediated the association between feedback condition and late-phase writing improvement. No group differences were found in perceived feedback quality. These findings suggest that the advantages of LLM-based feedback over traditional AWE systems emerge temporally and are driven partially by motivational mechanisms. When implemented with pedagogically grounded prompt design, LLMs offer an effective and scalable approach to formative feedback in learning.",

          "abstract": "Microaggressions are a common phenomenon affecting minoritized individuals across a wide range of contexts. Their well-known cumulative detrimental effect on mental health raises questions not only in regard to etiological, but also health services research. Initial evidence suggests that microaggressions within psychotherapeutic contexts might harm both process and outcome variables within specific (e.g., racialized) samples. Still, it is unclear whether this is primarily a problem of specific patient groups or rather a generalizable pattern of structural oppression. The present work investigates parallels and differences in the experience and management of therapeutic microaggressions towards women, sexual, and gender minorities (N = 707). Across all three samples, a majority of participants reported microaggressions directed at them by their therapists. These experiences were associated with both a weaker working alliance and less perceived improvement from therapy. The effects were attenuated whenever microaggressions were subsequently addressed. Microaggressions should be understood as a structural phenomenon probably affecting most minoritized individuals, even within psychotherapies usually considered to be safer-spaces. To protect patients from their harmful effects, therapists should not only strive to minimize the occurrence of microaggressions, but also establish their collaborative management.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into mental health care, yet direct comparisons between human and AI therapists in extended, credible therapeutic interactions remain limited. This study examined a corpus of 233,691 words from 103 therapy sessions to test similarities and differences between human therapists (N=19) and AI chatbot therapists (N = 16). Simulated Cognitive Behavioural Therapy sessions with three AI generated client personas generated transcripts that were analysed using natural language processing methods to quantify prose length, sentiment and semantic similarity (Experiment 1). The transcripts were then blindly human rated by two samples with varied levels of experience with therapy (Experiments 2a and 2b). Relative to human-led sessions, AI therapists spoke more words, took fewer conversational turns, were more positive in their sentiment, and more closely matched the client’s sentiment and meaning. Skilled raters could reliably detect the AI and disliked the AI therapist, whereas unskilled raters could not reliably detect AI sessions and preferred AI to human-led sessions. Overall, these findings suggest that AI led sessions are quantifiably distinct from those led by humans, that users disliked AI-led sessions if they believed the therapist to be AI, but that only people with some experience of therapy could reliably distinguish AI from human-led sessions.",

This study evaluated the impact, safety, and acceptability of two types of health promotion content (lived experience videos versus educational factsheets), amongst international students studying in Australia.\nMethods: In this quantitative experimental study, international students aged 18-25 years (n = 267), were randomised to view either four co-designed lived experience videos, or textual factsheets, across the course of seven days. The General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ), Stigma of Suicide Scale (SOSS-SF), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were completed at baseline and follow-up. \nResults: Linear mixed effects models found a significant main effect of time on GHSQ scores (p &lt; .001), indicating overall increases in help-seeking intentions across both groups, but no group or interaction effects. There was also a significant main effect of time on PHQ-9 scores (p &lt; .001), with reductions in depressive symptoms across both groups, but no group or interaction effects. No significant effects were observed for SOSS-SF scores, suggesting no change in suicide-related public stigma. Though feedback data was positive for both conditions, videos were rated as more trustworthy, engaging, relevant, relatable, helpful, and easier to understand than the factsheets.\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that both psychoeducational factsheets, and lived experience-focussed videos, are safe and acceptable, and can increase help-seeking intentions and reduce distress amongst international students. Future work should examine whether these formats reduce suicide self-stigma specifically, and whether they improve help-seeking behaviours as well as intentions.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Speech perception continues to develop throughout school age and plays a fundamental role in language and reading development. Recent findings in English-speaking children suggest that speech categorization consistency—the stability of a listener’s percept across multiple encounters with a speech sound—predicts both language and reading abilities, with a particularly strong link between reading skills and vowel perception. One hypothesis is that this is due to complex grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs) in English vowels. The present study tested (1) whether the relationship between categorization consistency and language/reading abilities extends to typologically different languages and (2) whether the vowel-specific link observed in English is shaped by GPC complexity, using data from Korean, a language with relatively transparent GPC mappings.\n\nMethod: Forty-four 1st-grade Korean-speaking children completed a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task, in which they heard tokens from a speech continuum and rated the correspondence between the stimulus and each word on a continuous scale. Standardized assessments of language and word reading were also conducted. \n\nResults: Children with poorer language/reading abilities exhibited lower categorization consistency, which is consistent with the findings from English-speaking children. In contrast to prior findings, however, this relationship was not specific to vowel perception but was held across all contrast types tested. Categorization gradiency (slope of the categorization function) was not significantly associated with any outcome. \n\nConclusions: These findings extend prior work by demonstrating that categorization consistency predicts language and reading abilities, even in a language with transparent GPCs. Importantly, this association was observed across all phonemic contrasts, not just vowels—suggesting that the previously observed vowel-specific link in English may stem from the greater GPC complexity of English vowels. Together, while categorization consistency appears to be a critical predictor of linguistic outcome, the specific pattern may vary across languages depending on the structure of their GPCs.",

          "abstract": "Accelerated longitudinal designs (ALDs) offer an efficient means of studying large developmental periods by combining shorter longitudinal samples across overlapping cohorts. ALDs have been used to study processes that span large developmental epochs, such as cognitive development. However, traditional parametric approaches may impose structural assumptions that limit the accurate reconstruction of individual developmental trajectories. We investigate a nonparametric functional data analytic (FDA) approach for modeling latent trajectories in accelerated longitudinal data. This method allows for the recovery of smooth, continuous time trajectories that account for both shared and idiosyncratic patterns of change. We compare the FDA approach to the continuous time latent change score model with simulations that emulate nonlinear change processes often seen in developmental research. We apply both methods to two empirical datasets with individuals aged 5- to 22-years, where each person is assessed two or three times. Our results demonstrate that the FDA method captures the shape and timing of individual trajectories more accurately beyond the observed data. These findings suggest that FDA offers a robust and flexible alternative for modeling developmental change in ALDs.",

          "authors": "Alberto Barbieri",
          "abstract": "Personality disorders (PDs) are characterized by rigid and maladaptive patterns of self- and interpersonal functioning, leading to high clinical burden and limited treatment outcomes. Schema Therapy (ST), an integrative psychotherapy rooted in cognitive-behavioral principles, conceptualizes PDs in terms of Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS)—pervasive cognitive–affective structures formed through unmet emotional needs—and schema modes, dynamic states organizing emotion, belief, and behavior. Evidence indicates moderate efficacy of ST, mainly for borderline personality disorder, with limited research on other Cluster B and C PDs. Emerging evidence suggests that psilocybin, a serotonergic psychedelic, can induce enduring personality change, supporting its potential use in treating PDs. Within a predictive coding framework, the REBUS (“Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics”) and REBAS (“Revised Beliefs After Psychedelics”) models propose that psilocybin relaxes high-level priors, facilitating cognitive flexibility and revision of maladaptive self-beliefs. Conceptual parallels between EMS and high-level priors suggest that psychedelic-induced relaxation of entrenched beliefs may enhance responsiveness to ST’s experiential and cognitive interventions. Psilocybin-Assisted Schema Therapy (PAST) is proposed as a model in which psilocybin sessions are followed by integration combining psychedelic-induced cognitive flexibility with ST techniques, aimed at strengthening adaptive modes and reducing dysfunctional EMS and dysfunctional modes. PAST could be relevant in the future for enhancing outcomes and potentially reducing treatment duration in Cluster B and C PDs, pending empirical validation. Although current literature is insufficient to recommend psilocybin-assisted interventions for PDs, this theoretical article bridges computational neuroscience and clinical psychotherapy, outlining a framework for future studies on PAST feasibility, safety, and efficacy.",

          "abstract": "This mini-review examines how dual-process theory, which distinguishes fast, intuitive (System 1) and slow, reflective (System 2) processes, shapes decision-making in criminal and legal contexts. Specifically, offender behavior often relies on rapid, heuristic-driven responses, particularly under stress, time pressure, or emotionally charged situations. Moreover, individual traits such as self-control further influence the balance between intuition and deliberation. Similarly, judges and jurors are affected by cognitive strain, narrative-driven reasoning, and emotional cues, leading them to rely on intuition despite analytical experience. Consequently, these patterns contribute to systematic cognitive biases, including anchoring, confirmation, and availability effects, across investigative, prosecutorial, and adjudicative stages. By synthesizing evidence from offender studies, judicial and jury research, and analyses of wrongful convictions, this review demonstrates that intuitive dominance can override reflective reasoning, leading to real-world errors. Finally, the review highlights interventions such as structured evidence evaluation, cognitive bias training, and reflective decision-making strategies, which aim to mitigate errors and improve outcomes in the criminal justice system.\nKeywords: dual-process theory, system 1, system 2, cognitive bias, criminal decision-making, legal decision-making",

Yet such efforts may carry unintended consequences. AI-generated media often accompany informational content that can vary in veracity. However, labeling may confound perceptions of the media's authenticity and the content's veracity, reducing belief in true information. Moreover, since it isn’t feasible to label all AI-generated media, partial labeling may lead people to assume that the absence of a label implies authenticity and/or veracity. We test for these labeling and implied effects in two survey experiments (N = 11,044), where respondents evaluated political news posts. Labeling decreased perceptions of the authenticity of AI-generated images but also lowered belief in and willingness to share posts—even when the associated claims were true. Furthermore, exposure to partial labeling increased the perceived authenticity of unlabeled content. These results highlight the need for carefully designed labeling practices online.",

Perceptual category learning presents a unique testbed of this debate as categories exist within all sensory modalities, but there is mixed evidence about whether people form abstract representations that can be analogized across modalities. In the current study, we examine whether learners form such abstract representations of auditory and visual categories that share the same rule-based structure. Across three experiments, we examine whether learners spontaneously or explicitly form abstract representations across sensory modalities. Overall, we found no evidence of shared abstract representations even in the conditions that would theoretically most strongly encourage it – when information across modalities was conceptually aligned (rather than misaligned), when information across modalities was encountered within the same task (rather than separate tasks), and when participants were explicitly instructed to analogize across modalities (rather than doing so spontaneously). These results suggest that even when abstract representation across auditory and visual modalities is encouraged, the knowledge formed during perceptual category learning is modality specific. These results highlight the importance of considering the role of modality in category learning and cognition more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nOlder adults with multimorbidity and depressive symptoms are particularly vulnerable during the transition from (partial) inpatient to outpatient care, with a high risk of readmission and rehospitalization due to substantial barriers in accessing appropriate mental healthcare. The BRIDGE intervention addresses this critical transition through a structured, manualized, interdisciplinary treatment program aimed primarily at improving depressive symptoms.\nMethods:\nBRIDGE is a 12-week blended care intervention that combines two evidence-based therapeutic strategies—behavioral activation (BA) and physical exercise (PE)—to promote structured daily activity and improve mood and physical health. The program is delivered by an interprofessional team consisting of a nurse, psychologist, and exercise scientist at each study center, and includes both home visits and digital components via a tablet-based e-health platform. Core elements comprise BA exercises in line with behavioral change techniques, and a video-guided home-based PE program. The multicenter two-arm randomized controlled trial evaluates the efficacy, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of the BRIDGE intervention compared to treatment as usual. The post-discharge maintenance or improvement of the outcome of inpatient treatment for depressive symptoms is considered as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include reductions in recurrent hospital admissions, improvements in physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning as well as quality of life, and evidence of a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.\nDiscussion:\nBRIDGE offers a comprehensive, scalable intervention model that integrates behavioral and physical activation into the daily life of older patients with multimorbidity and depressive symptoms. By embedding hybrid delivery formats, structured interprofessional collaboration, and a focus on sustainable home-based routines, the intervention addresses the complex needs of older multimorbid adults during a critical care transition. Findings from this trial will inform future implementation in diverse healthcare settings and contribute to evidence-based service development in geriatric mental health.",

          "authors": "Yeonho Choi; Michael L DeKay",
          "abstract": "Xiang, Dorst, and Gershman (2025) recently challenged previous research and theory regarding the gambler’s fallacy. They concluded that when sequences of events are truly random, the fallacy is observed for binary predictions but not probability judgments and that binary predictions cannot be reconstructed from probability judgments, in contrast to most theoretical accounts. This “disconnection” implies that new theories may be needed. Based on reanalysis of Xiang et al.’s data using methods very similar to theirs, we argue that there is strong evidence for a gambler’s fallacy for probability judgments and that the gap between probability judgments and binary predictions was overstated. A version of Rabin and Vayanos’s (2010) model accounts for responses to both question types reasonably well, suggesting that such theories are not seriously threatened. Finally, we propose stratified random sampling of sequences as a more efficient method for presenting participants with representative sequences of events.",

          "abstract": "The stress generation model posits that depression and other psychopathology elevates risk that individuals create or select into stressful life events. Although decades of research support stress generation theory, life stress is inherently challenging to assess and model as an outcome variable, and prior studies follow inconsistent methodological standards. Towards a vision of elevated “next generation” research, we present expert consensus methodological guidelines for conducting stress generation research. A panel of researchers with diverse expertise delineates best practice, acceptable, and non-recommended methods across six areas: stressor operationalizations, assessment, longitudinal study design (including intensive longitudinal design), statistical analysis, openness/ transparency, and avoiding stigmatizing language. For example, the review covers modeling stressors as formative variables, statistically comparing effect sizes for predicting independent and dependent stress, and using life stress interviews versus questionnaires, among other methodological concerns pertinent to stress generation research. Following these guidelines will allow future investigators to construct a research base with greater rigor, transparency, and reproducibility, providing a firmer foundation to improve understanding of stress generation.",

          "abstract": "The rapid integration of artificial intelligence into mental health practice has generated ethical\nconcerns, yet individual practitioners lack clear guidance on responsible AI use. This manuscript\nproposes a clinical framework grounding ethical AI interaction in established therapeutic\nboundary principles—concepts mental health professionals already possess through training and\npractice. Drawing from clinical training (therapeutic boundaries, informed consent, scope of\npractice), law enforcement principles (documentation, threat assessment), disability justice\nperspectives (accommodation vs. replacement), and cross-domain skill transfer, six core\nprinciples emerge: (1) clear role definition, (2) context provision without therapy, (3)\nprofessional boundaries, (4) informed consent and data security (including HIPAA compliance\nfor clinical practice), (5) decision-making authority, and (6) dependency monitoring. This praxis-\nbased framework addresses the literature gap regarding individual practitioner guidance and\ndisability perspectives in AI ethics. The framework demonstrates that existing professional ethics\ncodes already provide AI guidance through transferable skills, requiring no entirely new\nframeworks but rather application of boundary management expertise to technological tools. A\nself-assessment tool enables practitioners to evaluate their AI interactions systematically.

          "abstract": "Aims: Many children and young people with social work involvement (CYPwSW) experience a higher prevalence of mental health difficulties with an increased likelihood of referral to mental health services than their peers. Yet little is known about their likelihood of accessing mental health support following referral. This observational study aims to address this gap, examining how social work status is associated with service access. \n\nMethods: Data were extracted from young people’s first referral to mental health services in South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust between 2007 to 2023 and included social work and sociodemographic characteristics. Multilevel logistic regression modelling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and to estimate the associations between social work status (no involvement; other current social work involvement without a formal recorded intervention; past social work involvement; child protection plan; being looked after) and service access. \n\nResults: A total of N=71,740 referrals were extracted. Children with current or past social work involvement had significantly higher adjusted odds of not accessing mental health services compared to their peers. The highest adjusted odds were observed among children with other current social work involvement (OR=2.65 [95% CI=2.43, 2.88]) and on child protection plans (OR=2.03, [95% CI=1.88, 2.20]). Past social work involvement (OR=1.14 [95% CI=1.07, 1.23]) and being looked after (OR=1.13 [95% CI=1.04, 1.22]) were also associated with higher adjusted odds, though to a lesser extent.\n\nConclusions: Findings from this study suggest that children with current and past social work involvement experience disparities in accessing mental health services. The underlying reasons for this are yet to be confirmed, but overall, mental health inequities in social work experienced populations may be amplified at the point of access to mental health support.",

          "authors": "Christine Lee",
          "abstract": "This mini-review examines how dual-process theory, which distinguishes fast, intuitive (System 1) and slow, reflective (System 2) processes, shapes decision-making in criminal and legal contexts. Specifically, offender behavior often relies on rapid, heuristic-driven responses, particularly under stress, time pressure, or emotionally charged situations. Moreover, individual traits such as self-control further influence the balance between intuition and deliberation. Similarly, judges and jurors are affected by cognitive strain, narrative-driven reasoning, and emotional cues, leading them to rely on intuition despite analytical experience. Consequently, these patterns contribute to systematic cognitive biases, including anchoring, confirmation, and availability effects, across investigative, prosecutorial, and adjudicative stages. By synthesizing evidence from offender studies, judicial and jury research, and analyses of wrongful convictions, this review demonstrates that intuitive dominance can override reflective reasoning, leading to real-world errors. Finally, the review highlights interventions such as structured evidence evaluation, cognitive bias training, and reflective decision-making strategies, which aim to mitigate errors and improve outcomes in the criminal justice system.\nKeywords: dual-process theory, system 1, system 2, cognitive bias, criminal decision-making, legal decision-making",

          "abstract": "The cognitive model of schizophrenia posits that people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) experience a range of cognitive deficits that lead to the development of dysfunctional attitudes, which then impact long-term functioning. Negative expectancy appraisals represent one relevant, yet understudied, type of dysfunctional attitude that may explain the relationship between cognitive impairment and functioning in SSD. The current study examined whether negative expectancy appraisals mediate the relationship between cognitive ability and both role and social functioning. Participants with SSD (n=41) and non-clinical controls (n=42) completed a neurocognitive assessment battery, a questionnaire examining negative expectancy appraisals, and clinician-administered measures of role and social functioning. Mediation analyses indicated that greater levels of cognitive ability were associated with better role and social functioning, in part through lower levels of negative expectancy. The indirect effect accounted for 33% of the variance in predicting role functioning and 43% of the variance in predicting social functioning. Importantly, these results were not simply driven by group status, suggesting that both clinical and nonclinical participants exhibited a similar pattern of associations among cognitive ability, negative expectancies, and functioning. Thus, general conceptualizations of the relationship between cognitive ability and dysfunctional attitudes, as well as associated interventions, might be usefully applied toward people with SSD who exhibit cognitive and real-world functional deficits. Negative expectancy appraisals could offer another treatment target to improve the everyday experiences of individuals with SSD.",

Alpha-band oscillatory activity may be functionally important for adaptive listening, but whether these oscillations can be causally and selectively modulated in the ageing brain is unknown. Here, for the first time, we combine individualised alpha-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (alpha-TMS) with electrophysiological and behavioural measures to test state-dependent entrainment of auditory and parietal alpha oscillators during listening. Younger and older adults completed an irrelevant speech paradigm, during which they received alpha-TMS to task-relevant brain regions. Data show that individualised alpha-TMS preferentially entrains alpha oscillations in auditory cortex in older, but not younger, listeners. In contrast, alpha entrainment in parietal cortex relates to hearing sensitivity and listening performance. These findings provide the first evidence for individualised, state-dependent entrainment of auditory alpha oscillations during listening, and demonstrate age- and sensory-related effects on the modulation of neural rhythms for perception.",

One unexplored question is whether thought content differs with differing levels of thought control. We had participants in an online study perform a mind-wandering task, report the content of their thoughts in their own words and categorize their thoughts based on content, where their thoughts were directed (externally or internally) and whether their thoughts were under their control. We computed sentence similarity of thought content through pre-trained sentence similarity models and found within-subject task-unrelated thought content was less similar than within other thought categories. We also found within-subject internally generated spontaneous thoughts were less similar than internally generated controlled thoughts, even when analyses were restricted to task-unrelated thoughts. Validation of sentence embeddings found thought content naturally clusters based on thought category. We finally found the number of task-unrelated internal spontaneous trials, but not controlled trials, correlated with mind-wandering survey measures. Overall, we find evidence for a meaningful distinction between controlled internal attention and spontaneous mind-wandering based on thought content.",

          "abstract": "Before they even talk, infants become sensitive to the speech sounds of their native language and recognize the auditory form of an increasing number of words. Traditionally, these early perceptual changes are attributed to an emerging knowledge of linguistic categories such as phonemes or words. However, there is growing skepticism surrounding this interpretation due to limited evidence of category knowledge in infants. Previous modeling work has shown that a distributional learning algorithm could reproduce perceptual changes in infants’ early phonetic learning without acquiring phonetic categories. Taking this inquiry further, we propose that linguistic categories may not be needed for early word learning. We introduce STELA, a predictive coding algorithm designed to extract statistical patterns from continuous raw speech data. Our findings demonstrate that STELA can reproduce some developmental patterns of phonetic and word form learning without relying on linguistic categories such as phonemes or words nor requiring explicit word segmentation. Through an analysis of the learned representations, we show evidence that linguistic categories may emerge as an end product of learning rather than being prerequisites during early language acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly embedded in decision-making tasks, including systematic reviewing workflows such as title and abstract screening. Yet humans as final arbiters remain susceptible to influence from peripheral cues, leaving these hybrid workflows vulnerable to new forms of bias. This paper examined how two authority cues influence screening judgements: AI appraisals and journal prestige. Using preregistered experiments, we investigated how these cues shape inclusion decisions in a realistic abstract-screening task. We employed a 3 × 3 mixed design. Participants were randomly assigned to receive AI recommendations, AI disapprovals, or no AI input. Across trials, each participant evaluated abstracts that appeared with all three journal cues: prestigious labels, non-prestigious labels, and no journal information. Across Western graduate students, Asian bachelor’s-degree holders, and Western professionals (total N = 977), AI appraisals functioned as a strong and consistent authority cue, systematically biasing screening decisions. Journal prestige produced limited influence, emerging primarily when irrelevant abstracts were paired with prestigious journals, which increased incorrect inclusion. These findings demonstrate that AI-generated cues can introduce powerful new authority biases in human-AI collaborative screening. Implications for designing and governing (AI-aided) reviewing systems to ensure accurate, unbiased decision making are discussed.",

Across four experiments using a minimal referential communication paradigm, we find that speakers with the explicit goal of signaling social affiliation (1) choose more concise utterances, (2) preferentially select group-specific referents and descriptions, and (3) resist the otherwise strong tendency to be understood by everyone in the audience. Standard models of referential communication that focus on the trade-off between informativity and efficiency cannot explain these patterns; we argue instead for a model where speakers trade off the referential utility of being understood against the social utility of being identified as an in-group member.",

More frequent use of rumination, non-acceptance, and suppression relative to other strategies was associated with more internalizing symptoms, more negative emotions, and fewer positive emotions. Greater within-strategy variability was associated with more negative emotions and more externalizing symptoms. Specifically, greater variability in attention and suppression were associated with more negative emotions, while greater variability in rumination, distraction, and suppression were associated with externalizing symptoms.

          "abstract": "This review employs a comparative integrative methodology to redefine digital burnout. It views the condition not as a behavioural issue, but as a structural failure of attention caused by hyper-connectivity. The study synthesises Kaplan’s Attention Restoration Theory (ART) with Indian metaphysical concepts of the Trigunas (Three Modes of Nature) and Chitta (Mind-stuff). A novel taxonomy maps executive depletion to the loss of Tejas (mental fire) and Prana (vital energy). The paper proposes a three-phase model of cognitive collapse. Phase I begins with Rajasic hyper-arousal. Here, algorithmic rewards trigger dopamine loops, mimicking mental agitation of Vikshepa. Phase II marks a critical transition point. Rapid context switching drains cognitive resources, destroying Sattvic quality of clarity. Phase III terminates in Tamasic inertia. This state represents a defensive neurological shutdown. Behaviourally, this manifests as social indifference. The brain deactivates empathy to conserve scarce metabolic energy. Consequently, the review argues that abstinence-based digital detox is insufficient. It often fails to address internal mental fluctuations. Instead, recovery requires Sensory Gating (Pratyahara) to actively filter inputs. The study proposes a restorative protocol combining passive nature exposure with active meditation (Dhyana). This restores cognitive vitality, offering a robust framework for understanding the erosion of civic duty in the digital age.",

Latent class growth analyses revealed three trajectories: High-achieving, Average-achieving, and Struggling. Track placement and school prestige predicted trajectory membership, with work-bound tracking and lowered prestige increasing the likelihood of following Average-achieving and Struggling trajectories. Achievement trajectories mediated the link between tracking and Baccalaureate results. Work-bound tracks coupled with lower achievement trajectories were associated with decreased Baccalaureate performance. These findings suggest that not securing a place in prestigious schools or university-bound tracks may create barriers later for adolescents aspiring to pursue higher education.",

Participants experienced strong temporal contiguity (the offset of a cue coincides with the onset an outcome) or weak temporal contiguity (there is a temporal gap between the offset of a cue and the onset of an outcome) in a continuous predictive learning task. Initial training involved a double negative discrimination, in which there was one reinforced cue (aqua-color rectangle) and two non-reinforced cues (one greener and one bluer than the reinforced cue), and participants had to make a response whenever they predicted the outcome. After training, in the generalization test phase, outcome expectancy in presence of several stimuli along the full green-blue dimension was tested. Outcome expectancy was assessed with discrete ratings in Experiment 1 (n=252) and a behavioral dependent measure (button presses, similar to the training phase) in Experiment 2 (n=250). Regardless the type of measure, when participants experienced weak cue-outcome temporal contiguity showed a broader generalization response, although differences were more prominent in the green side of the color dimension. Furthermore, no significant differences emerged between two groups experiencing strong temporal contiguity but differing in cue duration (controlling stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA), suggesting that cue-outcome temporal contiguity plays a more critical role than cue duration in shaping generalization. Overall, this result advances our understanding of the role of temporal contiguity at a basic level, while opening the possibility to study it as a critical factor in more applied settings.",

          "abstract": "Orientation in time is a central aspect of human cognition. Because orientation in time is intimately related to autobiographical episodic memory, most amnesic patients suffer from temporal disorientation. Patients with severe anterograde amnesia have been described as \"stuck in time\"; their mental time travel abilities are altered, and they seem to live in the present. Here, we look at the very special situation of complete temporal disorientation, to the point where the patient seems to have no sense of the passage of time. A famous case illustrating this phenomenon was that of Clive Wearing who repeatedly wrote “I am now awake” in his diary, showing his recurrent belief that he had just awakened from an unconscious state. This unique cognitive phenomenon has not been specifically studied. We report cases involving three patients who described similar experiences. All three patients suffer from autoimmune encephalitis and show massive bilateral hippocampal inflammation causing severe anterograde amnesia. We propose to call this phenomenon “Stream of Consciousness Impairment”, a reference to William James’s theory according to which, normally, there is an uninterrupted flow of consciousness. This condition could be added to the spectrum of neurological disorders that contribute to the study of consciousness in humans.",

          "authors": "Chris Robert Harrison Brown",
          "abstract": "Evidence suggests that impulsivity is characterised by impairments in attentional control, which is required to regulate negative emotions such as stress. Given that elevated stress levels can impair attentional control even further, it was predicted that trait impulsivity and stress would interact. Whereby high stress levels would amplify the impairment in attentional control in high impulsive individuals, who are less able to regulate this stress. To test this, the levels of attentional capture and unintentional mind-wandering were assessed at different levels of stress and impulsivity. Unexpectedly, however, across 3 Studies (N = 108; 290; 157) there was no evidence supporting this amplification hypothesis. The findings revealed that stress and impulsivity were related to attenuated processing of target-matching external distractors, consistent with inattention (Study 1 &amp; 3); and though they did significantly interact in Study 1, this was more reflective of the trait-impulsivity obscuring the additional influence of high stress on attention. Further, stress and impulsivity also independently predicted elevated unintentional mind-wandering without interacting, both when self-reported (Study 2) and assessed during the attentional capture task (Study 3). The unexpected lack of interaction across multiple measures is discussed, and implications of the independent effects for existing models considered.",

          "abstract": "Although prior research has identified population-level trends in facial emotion recognition (FER) in middle childhood, it is unclear whether all children follow a similar developmental trajectory. To address this gap, we used a person-oriented approach to identify qualitatively distinct FER profiles based on accuracy and bias. The sample (N = 3,717, 51% girls, baseline Mage = 8.20, SD = 0.86) came from a Finnish socio-emotional learning intervention study, with data collected across three waves (2013–2015). We applied latent profile analysis and random intercept latent transition analysis to examine FER profiles and their stability across early school years. Moreover, we assessed whether parenting and children’s social-emotional adjustment were associated with FER profile membership and transitions. We found five FER profiles: Balanced Accuracy (14–26%), Sadness Bias (34–38%), Positively Biased (34–38%), Anger Bias (3–4%), and Low Accuracy (2–7%). While the three largest profiles showed moderate stability, children in the Anger Bias and Low Accuracy profiles were more likely to transition to other profiles. Compared to the Positively Biased profile, children in the Anger Bias profile experienced lower parental warmth, fewer peer problems, and showed less prosocial behavior. These findings suggest substantial heterogeneity in children’s FER development and link emotion-specific patterns to children’s social functioning. Understanding that children may follow distinct developmental trajectories could help design targeted interventions to support children’s social skills.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of the present review is to consider and integrate research that has examined the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH) in the contextual regulation of both Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors. To do so, we selectively review research that has examined the role of the VH in the extinction and renewal of Pavlovian fear conditioning, along with research exploring how the VH contributes to the learning and performance of appetitive instrumental responding. We emphasize that “contexts” can function in several ways to control behavior. Our review suggests that, across both paradigms, the VH contributes to at least two forms of contextual regulation. In the first, the VH appears to contribute to the contextual retrieval of both Pavlovian and instrumental learning. In the second, the VH regulates the impact of associations between the context and the unconditioned stimulus or reinforcing outcome on either Pavlovian or instrumental performance. Evidence across paradigms further indicates that these context effects depend on interactions between the VH and medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting a shared hippocampal-prefrontal circuit that supports contextual control. We also consider how these functions relate to broader hippocampal organization, drawing on evidence that while the dorsal hippocampus preferentially encodes discrete spatial information, the VH may be especially important for integrating salient contextual information across experience, particularly under conditions of ambiguity. Together, the evidence suggests that the VH plays a common and essential role in enabling contextual information to guide both Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors.",

Robust alternatives like robust linear regression do not hinge on assumptions like normally distributed errors with equal variances or the inconsequentiality of extreme values and outliers. Tests with these broad robustness features act agains nonreplication that occurs solely because data anomalies arise differently across studies. Using them from the outset sidesteps the pitfalls of making a data-based decision about whether a standard test is applicable. The common practice of conducting them in addition, commonly in response to data inspection, yields multiple test results. I argue that these should be avoided when a binary decision must be reached, for example, conducting further research on the basis on the assumption that an effect exists. Practically, using a single test simplifies analysis. While R offers numerous robust methods, the ones that provide broad robustness are largely restricted to linear models.",

          "abstract": "Background and Objective. The network approach to psychopathology views mental disorders as dynamic interactions between symptoms, challenging traditional latent-cause models. We applied this approach to individuals with PTSD, using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data to build personalized contemporaneous and directed symptom networks. Our primary aim was to assess whether these network-derived formulations aligned with clinician-generated cognitive formulations. We also tested whether cognitive variables predicted affective variables over time, consistent with the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model of PTSD. \nMethod. Five participants completed 14-21 days of EMA (response rate=90.2+5.48%), yielding 348 observations total. Items were tailored to each patient’s lived experience and mapped to Ehlers and Clark components. Written formulations from patients and clinicians were compared to EMA-based networks generated by three network algorithms.\nResults. Network-derived formulations shared some features with patient and clinician-derived formulations but often diverged in complexity and specific predictions. Data-driven networks had good precision (0.64-0.86) but low sensitivity (0.31-0.35), showing better agreement with patient self-formulations than with clinician models. Evidence for lead-lag effects between cognitive and affective variables was limited. Trauma memory emerged as the most central component, with its association to sense of current threat and matching triggers being the most prominent. \nConclusion. Network analysis may refine clinical hypotheses but has limitations in replicating comprehensive formulations. Instead, we recommend its use for clinical hypothesis testing of specific predictions. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to test its clinical utility and contribution to treatment outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Identifying shared and distinct profiles, whether in symptom combinations, personality traits, or cognitive abilities, is essential for understanding psychological phenomena, yet doing so requires navigating interrelated theoretical, conceptual, and technical complexities. First, psychological phenomena typically exist along continuous spectra rather than discrete categories, complicating the characterisation of inherently heterogeneous constructs. Second, studying individual differences requires balancing population-level generalisation with person-level interpretability, which is critical for applied science. Third, psychological data often contain missing values, non-linear relationships, and high-dimensional patterns that violate standard statistical assumptions. Commonly used approaches for profile detection fail to address these complexities simultaneously, typically producing oversimplified or difficult-to-interpret results that obscure person-centred patterns. In contrast, Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) offer a powerful, visual, and intuitive solution that addresses these challenges. Despite growing interest, SOMs remain underutilised in psychology, potentially due to a lack of accessible tutorials and clear guidelines tailored to the field. This tutorial introduces SOMs to psychologists without technical backgrounds, emphasising practical implementation. We provide evidence-based guidance for key methodological decisions, accompanied by annotated R code. Using a dataset of depressive symptoms as an illustrative case, we present a complete workflow covering data preprocessing, map initialisation, parameter optimisation, and interpretation. We further discuss advanced SOM extensions relevant to psychological research and highlight key limitations of the method. By providing clear guidance, this tutorial facilitates the adoption of SOMs, advancing nuanced, person-centred analyses that preserve the complexity of psychological phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Evaluating and, if necessary, revising factor-analytic latent measurement models is a challenging task. By now, researchers can select from a toolbox of traditional and novel methods to evaluate global and local model fit. However, this toolbox lacks a method to evaluate model fit at an intermediate level facilitating a thoughtful revision process. In this study, we fill this gap with a machine learning (ML) approach to model fit evaluation. Specifically, we introduce an ML pipeline to classify the type and severity of misspecifications in multi-factorial measurement models. To build this pipeline, we trained three ML models that predict a) if the measurement model is correctly specified or if a latent factor, cross-loadings, factor correlations, or residual correlations have been neglected, b) if any, how many cross-loadings have been neglected, and c) if any, how many residual correlations have been neglected. All three ML models performed well overall, with performance drops mainly resulting from misclassifications by ± 1 cross-loading and ± 1–2 residual correlations, respectively. Consequently, the feedback of the ML pipeline must not be implemented in an exact manner. Instead, it points the user to the most likely source of misfit and indicates if the measurement model is not, mildly, moderately, or severely misspecified. This information provides helpful guidance in deciding if and how to revise the measurement model, the measurement instrument, or its underlying theory. We provide an open-access R implementation of the ML pipeline, discuss how to use it within a multi-method approach, and make recommendations on how to use its feedback for the next revision steps.",

We concluded a successful replication of all three studies, with support for their findings showing that: 1) people who are more willing to be organ donors are more likely to hold views that others should as well, and to think that enrollment should be the default, and that in turn: 2) people make inferences from policymaker’s set defaults (Study 2: organ donations; Study 3: retirement plans) regarding the policymakers’ own preferences regarding enrollment, and their views regarding whether others should enroll. In our extension we added a control condition with no defaults, finding that 1) people still make inferences about choice architects’ attitudes, even when defaults were not set, and 2) that setting defaults to not act (not enroll) is perceived as closer to no defaults than setting defaults to act (to enroll).

          "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, the ability to adapt behavior based on feedback is a crucial skill. Although this process is assumed to decline with age, initial evidence suggests that emotional information processing may help buffer against these age-related impairments. We therefore conducted a probabilistic learning task with emotional faces in two varying emotional intensities (weak vs. strong) to investigate whether healthy younger and older adults would benefit from strong emotional feedback during learning and whether these processes are reflected in feedback-related event related potentials (ERPs). N = 26 younger adults (mean age = 22.6, SD = 2.67 years) and n = 23 older adults (mean age = 71.9, SD = 3.60 years) took part in our study. Behavioral results showed that both age groups showed improved learning over time, but older adults particularly benefited from strong emotional feedback. ERPs revealed that the detection of unexpected events, reflected in the peak-to-peak FRN, was generally enhanced in older as compared to younger adults, possibly due to a generally enhanced motivational significance of socio-emotional stimuli. However, we could not find an effect of feedback condition for neither group. Moreover, working memory updating, reflected in the P3b, was modulated by emotional intensity in older adults, showing increased updating after strong emotional negative feedback, whereas younger adults did not use strong emotional, but rather negative feedback to update their working memory.",

Yet a unified computational account explaining how these processes jointly shape eye movements and comprehension has remained elusive. Here we show that human reading behavior emerges from a resource-rational control mechanism in which readers allocate fixations to maximize expected gains in understanding while minimizing effort and time. We develop a hierarchical control model that formalizes reading as sequential information sampling under limited visual and memory resources. Implemented as a multi-level partially observable Markov decision process trained with deep reinforcement learning, the model links high-level comprehension with low-level eye-movement control within a single optimization framework. Across independent datasets and a new experiment involving time pressure, the model reproduces canonical behavioral patterns—including effects of word length, frequency, predictability, skipping, regressions, and coherence—while capturing adaptive changes in gaze and comprehension. These findings demonstrate that many canonical properties of reading arise from boundedly optimal information gathering and support a computationally unified account in which memory, perception, and control interact to guide intelligent behavior.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience faces a measurement problem: core features of the human mind cannot be directly observed in the brain. For example, intentions are efficacious in behavior generation yet cannot be reduced to the sub-personal quantities of neural activity without losing their purpose-driven, normative character. This instrumental limitation is fundamental yet remains insufficiently recognized. To bring this issue to the forefront and reorient the field toward a solution, this brief commentary argues that theories of the mind-brain relation must meet the “Participation Criterion”: they must specify what measurable difference the presence of mental efficacy produces compared to its absence. When the Participation Criterion is accepted alongside the measurement problem, a feasible solution arises: the dynamical relevance of unobservable mental efficacy may manifest indirectly as increased unpredictability of observable brain activity, quantifiable via information-theoretic entropy. The concept of “irruption” is introduced to specifically formalize this efficacy-derived part of unexplained variability, thereby reframing context-dependent “noise” in the brain as a key signature of the intentional mind at work. The theoretical proposal offers new avenues for research in cognitive science and clinical interventions.",

No significant associations were found between school satisfaction and demographic variables such as age, gender, or socioeconomic status.

Nearly half (48%) met the threshold for likely general personality disorder (PD), measured by impairments in levels of personality functioning, and 43% met the threshold for likely antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) via ASPD-specific personality functioning.  Compared to those without likely general PD, participants with likely general PD endorsed more polysubstance use. Conversely, ASPD-specific personality functioning was linked to higher rates of methamphetamine, alcohol, and sedative use disorders, and polysubstance use. Elevated early maladaptive schemas (e.g., 53% endorsing insufficient self-control) and antisocial attitudes were endorsed across the sample. Over half (59%) reported a prior arrest, with 23% reporting ten or more arrests. Findings highlight the relationship between personality functioning and SUD, as well as the high prevalence of psychological and behavioural complexities endorsed by youth accessing residential SUD treatment. Conclusions: Implications include the need for routine personality screening, potential benefit of schema-focused treatment, and interventions targeting antisocial cognition and behaviour alongside SUD treatment for this population. Embedding such interventions may improve engagement, reduce relapse and offending, and provide a developmentally informed pathway to improve outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Two studies test an alternative to the traditional perspective of Inhibition of Return (IOR), the notion that the reorientation of attention to a previously attended location is inhibited. The proposed Attention-Related Inhibition (ARI) Model links this effect with inhibition that is necessary for executive attention. Study 1 demonstrated that ARI provides a benefit only when responses require discrimination, but not when simple detection is involved. In Study 2, the benefit for ARI emerged more quickly with predictive cues than with nonpredictive cues. Together, these findings provide preliminary support for the ARI model, demonstrating that 1) inhibition reflects the presence, not the absence of attention, and that 2) the benefits of ARI are related to slow, purposeful processing, and not rapid, automatic reactions.",

          "abstract": "Operational definitions have long been a core approach to measuring and relating observed data to theoretical constructs in psychological science. However, many contemporary modeling approaches violate basic assumptions of operational definitions and operationalism more generally -- foregoing assumptions about objectivity, repeatability, independence, and fixed elicitation procedures. Counterintuitively, these departures imbue model-based definitions of constructs with superior measurement properties, such as improved reliability and validity, when compared to their operational counterparts. Instead of relying on operational definitions of constructs, we instead suggest that psychology can adapt relational definitions, representing constructs as latent variables in a multilevel generative model of behavior, self-report, or neuroimaging data. These model-based metrics can better reflect measurement error at multiple levels, account for the interactions between measurement devices (tasks, scales) and measurement objects (participants, processes), provide a holistic account of latent constructs and how they manifest across different measurements, facilitate convergence or discrimination tests among different tasks seeking to measure the same construct, and improve scientific communication by clarifying core psychological concepts. Relational definitions of important constructs should naturally emerge as we apply models more regularly, and these definitions and models will improve as we discover mathematical approaches that are suited to describing psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Oral nicotine pouches are rapidly proliferating in the market. While pouches may be a harm reduction option, these products may appeal to adolescents and may elicit greater nicotine exposure. Behavioral economics provides a framework for studying the reinforcing value of these products; however, there are no validated measures for assessing demand for nicotine pouches.\nAims and Methods: This study evaluated behavioral economic purchase tasks for nicotine pouches. Crowdsourced data were collected from 228 adult pouch consumers (40% women; age, M(SD)=31.1(11.9); past-month pouch use, M(SD)= 15.4(8.1) days; Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence-Smokeless Tobacco Version, M(SD)=4.7(2.4). Participants completed two hypothetical purchase tasks with the products available as individual pouches (free—$5/pouch) or tins containing 20 pouches each (free—$100/tin). \nResults: Task responding was prototypical with a similar percentage of nonsystematic data across versions. Participants consumed approximately 35 tins or 73 pouches when products were free (intensity), spent a total of $206 on tins or $43 on pouches (Omax), and had a breakpoint of $4/pouch or $56/tin. Observed and derived metrics exhibited expected within-task intercorrelations. Demand for tins was significantly correlated with dependence (rs =.29-46, ps&lt;.005), while correlations for pouches were less consistent. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study provides initial validation of two versions of nicotine pouch purchase tasks. Data preliminarily indicate that a tins version may be more sensitive to dependence severity. In contrast, the pouch version may be important for studies of state-based influences on demand.",

The present study tests the capacity of cognitive models to assess latent motives in real-time by evaluating different deep neural networks trained to infer a human player's intent during a continuous control task. These networks were trained by (a) directly using observable information or (b) selecting important features by estimating the parameters of a generative model of movement behavior inspired by approach-avoidance theory. Comparisons of classifier accuracy suggest that latent model parameters predict a participant's intent at a level exceeding human performance. Furthermore, classifier performance was best when model-based inferences were combined with summary statistics about behavior, yielding faster and more stable network training compared to networks that had no manual feature extraction. Equipping AI with cognitive models is a promising avenue for developing explainable, accurate, and trustworthy systems.",

Evidence on the sources of and remedies for this trust deficit is scarce and rarely tailored to political science. Using a representative survey of the Czech public (N = 1,530) and a parallel survey of Czech political scientists (N = 113), we examine the levels and sources of trust in the discipline from the perspectives of both the public and experts. Overall, trust is moderate and distrust is strongest among older, lower-income, and anti-Western respondents. Trust, however, is only weakly associated with ideology and perceptions of bias. In an embedded experiment, we show that open-science practices and methodological rigor significantly increase the perceived trustworthiness of political science research. Our findings underscore the need to build perceptions of competence, rigor, and transparency, and suggest that ideological bias may be a less central driver of distrust.",

          "abstract": "Stigmatised groups tend to suffer worse mental health. One problem faced by members of stigmatised groups is self-stigma, the internalisation of negative stereotypes. Research has shown that increased empowerment and a positive group identity can reduce self-stigma and its consequences. Research on the mental health consequences of collective action, or activism, suggests that participation in activism can improve wellbeing by providing empowerment and social identification. No review to date has looked specifically at the wellbeing effects of activism for stigmatised groups. A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted which sought to identify the consequences of participation in activism for the mental health of individuals facing stigma on the basis of race, sexuality, gender, and health status. The literature search identified 36 articles: 24 quantitative, 10 qualitative, and one using mixed methods. A convergent integrated approach was utilised and eight synthesised themes were generated covering direct associations, buffering and exacerbating effects, positive and negative mechanisms, and moderating factors. The most commonly reported beneficial effects of activism were enhanced empowerment, wellbeing, and buffering against the impact of discrimination. The most commonly reported detrimental effects of activism were burnout and increased depression. A number of promising directions for future research are identified.",

          "abstract": "Assent is an individual’s agreement to participate in educational and clinical interventions. Some practitioners have argued opportunities for assent (and dissent) should be presented and reinforced with all individuals across all contexts, irrespective of circumstance or benefit. Yet as verbal behavior, assent is constrained by contingencies of reinforcement and the individual’s ability to appraise benefits and risks of a treatment decision, or capacity. Some opportunities for assent may be necessary and beneficial for the individual, whereas others may conflict with their learning goals, the preferences of their caregivers, and the ethical obligations of professionals who support them. We are concerned a newly proposed approach, “assent-based ABA,” departs from a humanistic, behavior-analytic account of assent, diminishing therapeutic learning opportunities. In this paper, we examine assent in ABA programming, addressing issues of capacity, assent and dissent, autonomy and the best interest standard, voluntariness versus coercion, and social validity. We outline our concerns with “assent-based ABA” and conclude with practical considerations for assent in ABA programming.",

This article reviews key models of empathy, focusing on three core components and their neural bases. One central aspect is shared neural representations, i.e., similar brain activation during one’s own emotional experiences and while empathizing. In BPD, this is marked by hyperactivation of the amygdala and insula, indicating heightened affective resonance. Second, cognitive regulation mechanisms are central but impaired in BPD. The third component, self-other distinction, which is supported by the temporo-parietal junction, also shows altered activity patterns in BPD. Research in this field is hindered by conceptual and methodological inconsistencies and by the heterogeneity of BPD, underscoring the need for clearer theoretical frameworks and stronger interdisciplinary integration with clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "The ‘attraction effect’ or ‘asymmetric dominance effect’ is a widely studied phenomenon in decision-making, challenging the principle of regularity in rational choice theory. It posits that the introduction of a third option, similar but inferior to one of the available options in a binary choice set, increases the choice share of the dominating option. While the standard attraction effect is pervasive, recent studies have found inconsistent results. Some researchers attribute these inconsistencies to boundary conditions that constrain the effect, suggesting that studies failing to meet these criteria unsurprisingly report inconsistent effects. This paper aims to clarify the presence, strength, and direction of the attraction effect through two approaches: first, by analyzing contemporary metrics for measuring context effects and demonstrating their susceptibility to false positives and negatives; and second, by examining the boundary condition of strong prior trade-off—a biased preference for one choice in the baseline set—and its impact on metric vulnerability.",

The reported action set for a given user is moderately stable over time. Users reported easily repeatable actions most frequently, such as walking or turning off lights, which tend to have modest impacts on greenhouse gas emissions. We found no strong evidence linking the frequency of reported actions to the users' annual self-reported carbon footprints, except in the food domain, or psychological factors such as climate concern. Although apps facilitate the large-scale monitoring of climate actions, challenges remain in evaluating their effectiveness in behavioural change studies.

          "abstract": "Structural brain plasticity has traditionally been viewed as a gradual process developing over days to weeks of training or experience. Recent neuroimaging evidence, however, demonstrates that measurable micro- and macrostructural changes can occur within hours of behavioral or physiological manipulation, a phenomenon referred to as rapid structural plasticity. This systematic review synthesizes evidence for such short-interval (&lt;2 h) structural alterations across magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities in humans. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria, assessing diffusion-weighted imaging (DW-MRI) and T1-weighted MRI measures including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness (CT). Interventions included motor and spatial learning, perceptual and language training, stress, exercise, and pharmacological challenges. Across paradigms, DW-MRI studies consistently reported rapid decreases in mean diffusivity within task-relevant regions such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, and primary motor cortex. Similarly, studies using T1W-MRI revealed short-term increases in CT or gray matter volume (GMV), typically within one hour. However, the duration of tasks and timing of post-learning imaging varied across studies, complicating direct comparisons. Research combining perfusion-sensitive measures, including arterial spin labeling (ASL) and functional MRI (fMRI), further indicated that some apparent GMV changes may reflect transient shifts in cerebral blood flow or extracellular fluid. Together, these findings suggest that rapid, region-specific structural modulations can occur within hours of experience. Future research combining multimodal MRI, dense temporal sampling, and physiological control measures will be essential to disentangle genuine structural plasticity from transient hemodynamic, fluid or metabolic effects, thereby refining the temporal and mechanistic characterization of rapid brain plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Many scientific theories predict not just whether an effect exists, but also how multiple parameters relate—for example, that one mean exceeds another or that several effects follow a specific order. Such expectations can be formulated as directional hypotheses with equality and order constraints. Yet, researchers often test these indirectly through post-hoc analyses of individual parameters, which (1) provide only indirect evidence for the theory, (2) require multiplicity corrections that lower power, and (3) can lead to selective emphasis on statistically significant results. The goal of the current tutorial paper is two-fold. First, it introduces the BFpack module in JASP for testing directional hypotheses in a direct manner using Bayes factors. BFpack offers default Bayesian procedures for common designs—$t$ tests, (M)AN(C)OVA, regression, and multi-group correlations—without the need for manual prior specification. By evaluating theory-based hypotheses jointly, the method avoids multiplicity, increases power, and discourages selective reporting.\nThrough three worked examples, we demonstrate how BFpack simplifies directional hypothesis testing in practice and helps researchers move beyond traditional post-hoc testing toward theory-driven inference.",

          "abstract": "A central question in cognition is how representations are integrated across different modalities, such as language and vision. One prominent hypothesis posits the existence of an abstract, pre-linguistic “language of vision” that organises meaning compositionally, enabling cross-modal integration. This hypothesis predicts that the language of vision operates universally, independent of linguistic surface features such as word order. We conducted eye-tracking experiments where participants described visual scenes in English, Portuguese, and Japanese. By analysing spoken descriptions alongside eye-movement sequences divided into the planning and articulation of utterances, we demonstrate that semantic similarity between sentences strongly predicts the similarity of associated scan patterns in all three languages, even across scenes and for sentences in different languages. In contrast, the effect of syntactic similarity was secondary and transient: it was restricted to within-language and within-scene comparisons, and temporally confined to the early planning phase of the utterance. Our findings support interactive accounts in which a universal language of vision provides stable semantic scaffolding for cross-modal coordination, while syntax acts as a local constraint, primarily active during the linearization of the message",

We concentrate on fine-grained differences in the marking of three focus types (broad, narrow, and corrective). Thus, we examine effects of prosodic strengthening between pitch-accented words with varying degrees of prominence, rather than comparing focused/accented to unfocused/unaccented words. The results indicate that even within this subtle range of prominence degrees, speakers adjust parameters of the labial and lingual subsystems when articulating /ɑ/. Bayesian regression provides strong evidence for differences across focus types, most consistent between broad and corrective focus, while narrow focus generally falls in between the two conditions (and tends toward corrective focus). Directly comparing corrective to broad focus, we find an increase in magnitudes of displacement and higher peak velocities in the vertical (high-low) and horizontal (front-back) movement dimensions of the tongue body, as well as the lip aperture. In addition, the vertical dimension of the tongue and the lip aperture show longer movement durations. Only the lip aperture has longer time-to-peak-velocity intervals. We interpret the findings through the lens of the gestural model of Articulatory Phonology by explaining movement differences as arising from changes in the dynamical parameters of the gestures.",

The present study investigates whether social attunement (SA) plays a role in higher alcohol use in adolescence as well as a lower alcohol use when aging. \nMethods: This online study included an international sample of 683 alcohol users (16 – 81yrs). Participants completed a SA Questionnaire, an Implicit SA task (ISAT), and measures of alcohol use. The ISAT measured SA as the change in willingness to drink in response to peer feedback between two blocks of images representing social alcohol, social non-alcohol, and social non-drinking settings. Linear regressions were conducted to assess the association between SA and alcohol use, and the role of age and gender in these associations. \nResults: Unlike expected, interactions between age and SA did not predict alcohol use across social situations regardless of feedback condition. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses using the total SA score per social condition showed significant interactions between age and SA in predicting alcohol use in social situations involving non-alcoholic or no drinks. In social non-alcohol drinking settings, SA was positively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became negative in older individuals. Contrastingly, in the social non-drinking condition, SA was negatively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became positive in older individuals.\nDiscussion: Depending on age and social setting, SA can both be a risk- or protective factor for alcohol use.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic features of child directed speech (CDS) in caregiver-child conversational interactions are known to capture young children’s attention to language input and facilitate language learning. Emerging evidence suggests that caregivers’ use of CDS-like features when reading to their child, known as caregiver oral reading prosody, plays an important role in supporting preschoolers’ storybook comprehension. Do associations between caregiver oral reading prosody and preschoolers’ language extend beyond real-time listening comprehension to broader language skills? Forty-one caregivers read a children’s book to their child (ages: 4–5 years) as they normally would at home. The caregivers’ oral reading prosody (i.e., intonation and timing features) was examined in relation to children’s receptive vocabulary and core language skills. Moderated mediation models then investigated possible impacts of caregiver reading skills and shared reading time on these associations. Caregiver intonation range positively related to child vocabulary and caregiver inappropriate (i.e., ungrammatical) pausing negatively related to child core language skills. Mediation models revealed that caregiver reading skills indirectly related to child language through oral reading prosody measures. Notably, the indirect effect linking caregiver reading skills to child vocabulary via caregiver intonation range was moderated by shared reading time, with the strongest effects among dyads reporting less shared reading engagement. Findings illuminate caregiver oral reading prosody as one factor linking caregiver reading skills to child language, with particular relevance among families of caregivers with reading difficulties and for those with limited shared reading opportunities.",

Trait PC has previously been shown to predict some experimental measures of changes in experience when demand characteristics are not controlled. Here, we investigated the reach of PC as a demand effect by contrasting relationships between Phenomenological Control Scale scores (PCS; a test of direct imaginative suggestion) and effects presumed to either be sensitive to beliefs (visually evoked auditory response or vEAR; tingling in the scalp or ASMR) or insensitive to beliefs (the Müller Lyer illusion; the vertical-horizontal illusion). PC accounted for much of the effect for the posited belief-sensitive effects but not for the classic visual illusions (Study 1). This pattern of results remained after controlling for context effects (Study 2) and measurement differences across procedures (Study 3). Finally, we present the first causal evidence that two established psychological effects which are predicted by PC (vEAR and ASMR) can be modulated by participants high in PC in accordance with demand characteristics delivered by direct suggestion (Study 4). PC may account for the effects of psychological experiments when an effect is sensitive to belief, but not where it is not. This presents a previously unrecognised threat to validity in psychology experiments analogous to that of placebo effects in medicine.",

          "abstract": "Recovery from work is associated with better work performance and employee well-being. Thus, it is important to investigate whether and how recovery training affects the multiple distinct recovery experiences (i.e., psychological detachment, relaxation, control, and mastery). However, typical variable-centered approaches cannot detect training effects on the co-occurrence of multiple recovery experiences. By contrast, person-centered approaches, which focus on how individuals encounter different combinations (i.e., profiles) of recovery experiences, show promise for evaluating recovery training. We used data from a randomized controlled trial (N = 393) to examine the impact of training designed to enhance recovery in everyday life by investigating (a) how the number and shapes of profiles changed, (b) whether individuals transitioned between profiles of recovery experiences, and (c) whether these transitions were associated with changes in well-being-related outcomes (i.e., sleep quality and perceived stress). Recovery profiles changed in structure from pre- to post-training, and most participants, particularly those who received training, transitioned to a profile with improved recovery experiences. These adaptive transition paths were partly associated with enhanced sleep quality and reduced stress. Overall, the person-centered approach revealed nuanced training effects on recovery experiences, underscoring its promising role in comprehensive training evaluation.",

          "authors": "Georgina Mohan; Anna Hughes; Megan Klabunde",
          "abstract": "Research suggests that interoception – the ability to sense internal bodily signals – plays a role in anxiety, though the specific interoceptive processes involved are unclear. Some studies suggest anxiety is linked to improved detection of bodily signals (interoceptive accuracy), while others highlight impairments in higher-order thinking about these signals (interoceptive metacognition). Here, we employed the newly developed Heart Rate Discrimination task to address how anxiety symptoms relate to interoceptive accuracy and metacognition. Participants judged whether feedback tones were faster or slower than their heart rate, with a Bayesian psychophysical staircase calculating two metrics of interoceptive accuracy: heart rate estimation and uncertainty. Using a signal detection approach, trial-by-trial confidence ratings allowed us to quantify metacognitive bias (overall confidence) and metacognitive efficiency (the accuracy-confidence relationship). We predicted that individuals with higher anxiety symptoms would demonstrate greater accuracy in their heart rate estimations (H1) yet reduced metacognitive insight (H2). Using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), we distinguished between state and trait anxiety symptoms in relation to interoceptive processing. Results revealed no significant differences in interoceptive accuracy across anxiety levels, but distinct metacognitive patterns in relation to bodily processing. Higher state anxiety was associated with greater interoceptive metacognitive efficiency, while higher trait anxiety was linked to lower confidence in these interoceptive judgements. These findings advance our understanding of cognitive models of state-trait anxiety and suggest that targeted diagnostic tools and interventions could be developed based on these distinct interoceptive metacognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "Learning how actions change the environment is crucial for goal-directed actions and skill acquisition. Here we applied a process dissociation approach to investigate the contribution of explicit and implicit memory to the learning of action-effect relations across four experiments. Participants produced object images by pressing one of two keys, with each action-effect episode experienced three times. Learning was either incidental (Experiments 1-2) or intentional (Experiments 2-4) and occurred under full (Experiments 1-4) or divided (Experiments 3-4) attention. In a test phase, participants were re-presented the effect images and asked to either reproduce or alternate the action that had produced them. Results obtained through cognitive modeling revealed that action-effect relations are primarily represented in explicit memory, with minimal contributions of implicit memory. Intentional learning enhanced memory compared to incidental learning, while divided attention during encoding reduced it, with these factors mainly affecting explicit memory. These findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying skill acquisition and provide insights into the representational nature of action-effect relations.",

          "abstract": "Learning can shape attention in complex and sometimes counterintuitive ways. Here we report a novel form of implicit learning in visual attention that challenges current models of experience-driven attentional control. Across seven experiments, we demonstrate that mere imbalance in visual stimulation across space - independent of task relevance, awareness and even out of the focus of attention - can induce lasting and selective enhancements in target processing. These effects can be paradoxical and stimulus specific: stimuli initially processed as distractors improve subsequent target processing at implicitly learned locations. This happens without changing attentional capture by distractors presented at the same locations. The phenomenon occurs even under passive viewing conditions and is driven solely by the unequal frequency of visual stimulation across space. Crucially, the effect is distinct from typical selection history modulations of attention, generally affecting both targets and distractors in a consistent manner, which is assumed to reflect changes at the level of priority maps of space. These results suggest that the visual system is able to learn spatial contingencies through diverse mechanisms. They show that attentional systems can encode regularities independently of attentional allocation or task relevance and exploit them in a stimulus-selective manner through a previously undocumented implicit learning mechanism. This has implications for models of selective attention, perceptual learning, habituation and statistical learning.",

          "abstract": "How are motor activities linked to their perceptual outcomes? We here test the idea that the storage and retrieval of action-effect linkages is subject to constraints of associative memory. Specifically, we argue that mutual interference between such linkages should favor the storage and retrieval of unique (one-to-one) action-effect linkages as compared to overlapping (one-to-many) action-effect linkages (uniqueness effect). Moreover, we assume that increasing the number of repetitions of action-effect episodes facilitates learning and is modulated by this uniqueness effect. In three experiments, participants first produced certain visual effects through motor activities, and were later asked to retrieve the activity that had produced a certain probed visual effect before. For the most part, retrieval performance increased with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages and with increasing number of action-effect repetitions, while repetition had a slightly larger influence with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages. We discuss these results against the backdrop of associative and episodic retrieval accounts of learning.",

To address this issue, this study examines how people make sense of their evening social media use across different life stages. Using a one-week diary combined with semi-structured interviews (N = 56; ages 14–87), data were analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Evening social media use emerged as a distinct practice during the transition between day and night, with outcomes shaped less by duration or timing than by users’ situational appraisals and emotional goals. Ambivalence was common: Routines could soothe and connect—yet also evoke obligation, time loss, or guilt—often reflecting cultural norms surrounding healthy use. Patterns varied across life stages, though age itself did not determine experience.

In this study, participants provided a definition of rape before and after categorising sexual violence vignettes as either rape or not rape. In our sample (N = 312), ~3% defined rape accurately, with the most common definition of rape including most forms of genital stimulation and penetration.

          "abstract": "Background: Altered neural reward prediction error (RPE)-encoding during learning from drug reinforcers compared to non-drug rewards is at the core of learning theories of addiction. They predict higher RPE-related fronto-striatal activation when responding for alcohol-related compared to natural rewards, particularly in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, research in AUD has largely relied on paradigms that used monetary reinforcers or did not include a learning component. \nMethods: We developed an instrumental learning task (ILT) where correct choices were reinforced by alcohol or juice taste in separate blocks. Twenty-eight individuals with predominantly mild to moderate AUD and 28 healthy control participants (HC) performed the ILT during functional magnetic resonance imaging. \nResults: Alcohol taste was perceived as less pleasant and elicited less craving than juice taste across groups, and this was driven by HC. Both groups, but particularly individuals with AUD, successfully learned to respond for both reinforcer types, and individuals with AUD, but not HC, became faster over time in alcohol blocks. However, we found no differences in fronto-striatal RPE-encoding between groups and reinforcer types in the expected direction, but instead an opposite effect in superior parietal cortex.\nConclusions: While we demonstrate that instrumental learning from alcohol taste elicits RPE-correlated fronto-striatal activation in AUD and HC, our findings do not support stronger fronto-striatal RPE-encoding when learning from alcohol-related compared to natural reinforcers in individuals with AUD than HC. Future learning research in addiction should take further steps to increase ecological validity by considering the context-dependence of drug-related reinforcers’ rewarding properties.",

Results of the tested dynamic structural equation models revealed a considerable amount of bi-directional interplay in which momentary increases in narcissism were related to subsequent increases in how participants perceived situations. Furthermore, using the dynamic latent class analysis we explored how these situations are perceived during specific narcissism modes. We distinguished four types of narcissism modes: (1) non-narcissistic, (2) agentic, (3) neurotic, (4) antagonistic, and demonstrate how they differ in terms of situation perception. All narcissism modes were characterized of seeing situation as more deceptive when compared to non-narcissistic mode. We also found specific patterns of perceiving situations for each mode. These results, on the one hand support claims on the default nature of agentic, and on the other, neurotic narcissism and highlight the reactive nature of antagonistic narcissism.",

          "abstract": "Language disorders, whether following stroke, neurodegenerative disease or altered neurodevelopment, markedly impair communication and quality of life. Despite advances in behavioural and neuromodulation therapies, treatment outcomes remain modest. Attempts to modulate local excitability in single brain regions have yielded limited benefits, in part because focal stimulation induces widespread network level changes that challenge models based on local, sequential processing within specialised cortical areas.\nWe argue for a shift in neuromodulation for language, from interventions that target isolated regions to approaches that modulate distributed neural networks. To support this shift, we introduce the Interacting Language Network (ILN), a theoretical framework that integrates evidence for local functional specialisation with evidence for distributed processing. The ILN extends existing models by formalising how dynamic interaction between sensorimotor and heteromodal language circuits enables flexible communication. The ILN is grounded in evolutionary, neurobiological and clinical work showing that complex language abilities depend on the disproportionate expansion of association cortices and white matter pathways in humans, which enable long range communication between specialised regions. Converging findings from neurotypical and clinical populations, including stroke, neurodegeneration and developmental disorders, demonstrate that although specific regions make distinct contributions to language, their function depends critically on dynamic interactions, particularly between frontal and temporo-parietal areas. \nBy integrating these strands of evidence, the ILN bridges the divide between localised and distributed processing accounts and provides a translational scaffold for network-based neuromodulation. It delineates current knowledge about the architecture and interaction principles of the language network and identifies gaps that impede progress. We outline concrete avenues to advance network-based neuromodulation for language disorders. Ultimately, interventions that target interacting language networks have the potential to deliver more effective and personalised treatments for individuals with language impairment.",

In four experiments with a moving window paradigm, young adults read sentences in three masked conditions, where all letters except for three letters to the left and 12, 14, or 16 letters to the right of the fixation point were replaced with a mask, and a control condition. In Experiment 1, which explored word length span, all letters outside the window, including spaces, were replaced with Xs. In Experiments 2 and 3, which explored letter feature span, letters were replaced with Xs, but the spaces were preserved. In Experiment 4, which explored letter identity span, we substituted letters outside the window with visually similar ones. Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted on an LED monitor, while Experiments 3 and 4 were conducted on a CRT monitor. Our results showed that parafoveal letter replacement and spacing affected saccade targeting and slowed down reading rate, which was highest in word length span and lowest in letter identity span.

Drawing on the responses obtained through direct interviews with 45 experienced practitioners, we utilized thematic analysis to identify a distinctive pattern of existential attitudes shaped by long-term contemplative practice. The most common view (40%) was that consciousness persists beyond physical death, an inference often grounded in direct meditative experiences of awareness as a non-physical and enduring presence. A significant proportion (28.9%) viewed death as a natural and inevitable process to be accepted without fear or attachment, reflecting the psychological mechanism of decentering cultivated through mindfulness practices. Compared to general population data, AMs were significantly less likely to endorse materialist views of consciousness cessation (6.7% vs. 23%), suggesting that advanced contemplative training may shift existential beliefs in measurable ways. The findings suggest a nuanced and non-dogmatic approach to mortality among AMs, characterized by an openness to mystery and equanimity. This study offers novel insights into how sustained contemplative practice may fundamentally alter one's relationship with death, with implications for psychology, spiritual care, and consciousness studies.",

For easier learning, recognition, and recall, Icono links related words to one another. In English, for example, “eye”, “sight”, “vision”, and “perspective” look unrelated. In Icono, they all share an eye icon. As another example, “bitterness” combines the words for “taste” (a tongue sticking out of a mouth) and “poison” (a flask featuring a skull); “however” (which introduces a contrasting statement) combines “language” (a speech blurb) and “contrast” (a half-light, half-dark sun). I have previously argued that hieroglyphs evolved into letters to accommodate writers at the expense of readers. Yet, people typically read much more than they write, and—using modern technology—today’s icons can be written faster than their alphabetic equivalents can be spelled.

Our aim was to better understand the differential relationship between ‘low body focused’ and ‘high body focused’ meditation techniques with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), mystical experiences and interoception. To achieve this, we employed the Heart Rate Discrimination task (two-alternative forced choice task requiring comparing of perceived heartrate to a subsequent series of auditory beeps), and psychometric survey of PLEs, mystical experiences and interoception in a counterbalanced within-subject intervention study. 26 participants were assigned to practice a meditation with high or low body focus for two weeks at home using audio guidance. We did not find any significant differences between the low vs high body focused technique intervention for task-based or questionnaire measures for interoception, PLEs or mystical experiences. Further analysis suggested that on the group level, participants’ trial-wise responses were only influenced by the auditory external cue and not their heart rate.  This suggests that heart rate perception at rest is very difficult for participants, even after undergoing a body-focused meditation training. In conclusion, a short-term high vs low body-focused meditation did not differentially affect markers of interoception, psychotic-like or mystical experiences.",

Only a few studies have differentiated between the body parts and the amount of physical activity associated with a word (i.e., actionality) when investigating action language in PD. Additionally, an engaging lifestyle contributing to higher Cognitive Reserve (CR) may mitigate cognitive decline in PD, but its impact on action language impairments is unclear. This study aimed to investigate upper-limb action-word finding abilities in individuals with and without PD, considering word actionality and the impact of CR. Forty native-British speakers with idiopathic PD and forty matched older adults without PD participated. Action-word finding was assessed via picture-naming and verbal fluency tasks. Upper-limb motor ability was assessed through a keyboard-tapping task. CR was measured through years of education, occupational attainment, and questionnaires concerning the frequency of engagement in cognitive, leisure, and physical activities. Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that in both groups, participants with better motor ability named pictures faster. Multiple linear regression revealed a similar relationship between motor ability and the number of generated words on the verbal fluency task. Thus, across both groups, motor ability predicted faster naming and greater fluency, suggesting shared neuronal motor–language circuitry. No reliable PD-specific deficit for upper-limb action words was observed under medication and current task demands. CR showed minimal influence, with only a weak effect on picture naming accuracy. The relationship between motor and action word-finding abilities is discussed.",

          "abstract": "Before they even talk, infants become sensitive to the speech sounds of their native language and recognize the auditory form of an increasing number of words. Traditionally, these early perceptual changes are attributed to an emerging knowledge of linguistic categories such as phonemes or words. However, there is growing skepticism surrounding this interpretation due to limited evidence of category knowledge in infants. Previous modeling work has shown that a distributional learning algorithm could reproduce perceptual changes in infants’ early phonetic learning without acquiring phonetic categories. Taking this inquiry further, we propose that linguistic categories may not be needed for early word learning. We introduce STELA, a predictive coding algorithm designed to extract statistical patterns from continuous raw speech data. Our findings demonstrate that STELA can reproduce some developmental patterns of phonetic and word form learning without relying on linguistic categories such as phonemes or words nor requiring explicit word segmentation. Through an analysis of the learned representations, we show evidence that linguistic categories may emerge as an end product of learning rather than being prerequisites during early language acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Identifying shared and distinct profiles, whether in symptom combinations, personality traits, or cognitive abilities, is essential for understanding psychological phenomena, yet doing so requires navigating interrelated theoretical, conceptual, and technical complexities. First, psychological phenomena typically exist along continuous spectra rather than discrete categories, complicating the characterisation of inherently heterogeneous constructs. Second, studying individual differences requires balancing population-level generalisation with person-level interpretability, which is critical for applied science. Third, psychological data often contain missing values, non-linear relationships, and high-dimensional patterns that violate standard statistical assumptions. Commonly used approaches for profile detection fail to address these complexities simultaneously, typically producing oversimplified or difficult-to-interpret results that obscure person-centred patterns. In contrast, Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) offer a powerful, visual, and intuitive solution that addresses these challenges. Despite growing interest, SOMs remain underutilised in psychology, potentially due to a lack of accessible tutorials and clear guidelines tailored to the field. This tutorial introduces SOMs to psychologists without technical backgrounds, emphasising practical implementation. We provide evidence-based guidance for key methodological decisions, accompanied by annotated R code. Using a dataset of depressive symptoms as an illustrative case, we present a complete workflow covering data preprocessing, map initialisation, parameter optimisation, and interpretation. We further discuss advanced SOM extensions relevant to psychological research and highlight key limitations of the method. By providing clear guidance, this tutorial facilitates the adoption of SOMs, advancing nuanced, person-centred analyses that preserve the complexity of psychological phenomena.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "The impacts of poverty and material scarcity on human decision making appear paradoxical. One set of findings associates poverty with risk aversion, whilst another set associates it with risk taking. We present an idealized general model, the ‘desperation threshold model’ (DTM), that explains how both these accounts can be correct. The DTM assumes a utility function with two features: a threshold or ‘cliff’, a point where utility declines steeply with a small loss of resources because basic needs can no longer be met; and a ‘rock bottom’, a point where utility is not made any worse by further loss of resources because basic needs are not being met anyway. Just above the threshold, people’s main concern is not falling below, and they are predicted to avoid risk. Below the threshold, they have little left to lose, their most important concern is jumping above, and they are predicted to take risks that would otherwise be avoided. Versions of the DTM have been proposed under various names across biology, anthropology, economics and psychology. We review a broad range of relevant empirical evidence from a variety of societal contexts. Though the model primarily concerns individual decision making, it connects to a range of population-scale and societal issues such as: the consequences of economic inequality; the deterrence of crime; and the optimal design and behavioural consequences of the welfare state. We discuss a number of interpretative issues and offer an agenda for future DTM research that bridges disciplines.",

While most prior research hasexamined choices between lotteries described numerically, real-world decisions are often com-municated through natural language, and people do not necessarily react to verbal descriptionsin the same way they do to numeric ones.This work introducesTextualChoices-1K, a corpus of 1,000 one-shot binary choice tasksdescribed in natural language. The dataset enables two complementary lines of analysis. First,a behavioral investigation shows that some well-documented regularities, such as risk aversion ingains and risk seeking in losses, are preserved under verbal framing, whereas other phenomena,including loss aversion and reflection effects with rare events, appear weaker or inconsistent.Sentiment analysis further reveals that linguistic framing strongly predicts choice: participantssystematically preferred positively worded options, and differences in sentiment scores explainedsubstantial variance in behavior.Second, we evaluate multiple computational approaches, including fine-tuning large languagemodels (LLMs), leveraging embedding vectors, and integrating behavioral theories of choiceunder risk. Results indicate that fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, outperform both hy-brid approaches and behavioral-theory-based models when applied to verbal tasks, challengingmethods developed for numerical settings. However, we also find that hybrid models combiningmachine learning and behavioral theory remain superior in predicting choice between numericlotteries.Together, these findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs as modelsof human choice. Whereas theory-based models remain essential for structured numeric tasks,data-driven language models excel in naturalistic verbal settings. The thesis concludes with im-plications for cognitive modeling, the role of language in shaping decision-making, and directionsfor hybrid approaches that integrate theory and modern AI",

This study examined diversity in terminology preferences, in part through clustering, in a United States sample of 3181 non-autistic parents and 2098 autistic people (including 451 autistic parents of autistic children). The study also examined a particularly wide range of language issues: participants rated terms for autism, subgroups within autism, autistic people, autism likelihood, and autistic characteristics. Terminology ratings differed between non-autistic parents, autistic parents, and autistic non-parents, but these differences were generally modest. Clusters revealed greater variability. Almost half of both autistic and non-autistic participants were grouped in the Open Cluster, characterised by liking or neutrality towards most terms. Others, especially among autistic participants, were grouped in the Identity-First Cluster, characterised by support for identity-first language, strong opposition to terms for autism subgroups, and rejection of many pathologising terms. Still others, including many non-autistic but also many autistic participants, were in the Person-First Cluster, characterised by support for person-first language, yet still some skepticism towards autism subgroup terms. These results suggest that there is presently no consensus regarding autism terminology preferences in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Romantic partners’ emotions are interdependent, yet it remains unclear whether their emotion regulation behaviours also influence each other over time. This study investigated bidirectional associations between intrinsic emotion regulation (regulating one’s own emotions) and extrinsic emotion regulation (regulating a partner’s emotions) in 387 heterosexual couples assessed across seven waves over two years from August 2021 to August 2023 (1,699 observations). At each wave, both partners reported their use of six pairs of intrinsic-extrinsic strategies: expressive suppression, humor, reappraisal, distraction, direct action, and sharing. Couples showed limited temporal influence on each other (within-dyad effects), but robust trait level associations of intrinsic and extrinsic regulation (between-dyad effects). Individuals tended to use similar strategies to regulate their own and their partner’s emotions. Partner effects varied by strategy: Men who used more humor to regulate their emotions received less humor from women whereas men who used more distraction to regulate their emotions received more distraction from women. Direct action and sharing showed bidirectional partner effects. Men’s use of direct action to regulate their emotions predicted (and was predicted by) less direct action received from women. Men’s use of sharing to regulate their own emotions predicted (and was predicted by) more sharing received from women. Overall, our findings support that emotion regulation in romantic relationships is inherently interpersonal, with interdependence operating primarily through stable trait-level patterns rather than temporal influences. Generalizability is limited by the relatively homogeneous sample (predominantly Caucasian, English-speaking, and highly educated).",

In this study, we propose a model for simultaneously estimating the relationships between RT and item discrimination at the person, item, and person-by-item (residual) levels and illustrate our approach through an item-level meta-analysis of 40 empirical datasets comprising 1.84 million item responses. We find no evidence of average differences in item discrimination between items of different time intensity or persons of different average RT, while residual RT strongly and negatively predicts item discrimination (pooled coef. = -.27% per 1% difference in RT, SE = .04, \\tau = .17). While heterogeneity is high, we find little evidence of moderation by overall dataset characteristics. Flexible generalized additive models show that the relationship between residual RT and item discrimination is generally curvilinear, with discrimination maximized just below average RT and minimized at the extremes. Our results suggest that RT data can provide insights into the measurement properties of educational and psychological assessments, but that the relationships between RT and item discrimination are highly variable.",

Using a novel dual-task paradigm designed to jointly capture motor automaticity and habit formation, and three generalization datasets, we found a counterintuitive inverse relationship: individuals with greater motor automaticity showed reduced habit expression. Additionally, we provide a window into habit consolidation, showing that motor automaticity during habitual errors is preserved after extensive training but disrupted after limited training. Our findings dissociate execution from selection automaticity, challenging prevailing assumptions in neurocognitive accounts of learning. They revise our understanding of how practice shapes behavior, with critical implications for distinguishing adaptive skill from maladaptive rigidity in healthy and clinical populations.",

In a three-wave longitudinal study, 469 diverse undergraduates at a Minority Serving Institution repeatedly forecasted how pleasant they expected aggression to feel, perpetrated an aggressive act, and then reported how pleasant it felt. Longitudinal growth in both forecasted and felt aggressive pleasure over time was positively correlated with corresponding growth in aggressive behavior. Further, the better that aggression felt on one wave, the more aggressive participants were on the next. Suggesting that these effects contribute to broader patterns of aggressive tendencies, dispositionally-aggressive participants forecasted and felt more aggressive pleasure over time. Forecasts of aggressive pleasure were broadly inaccurate, though this inaccuracy had few implications for aggression. These results highlight the complex ways that forecasted and felt positive affect reinforce aggression over time.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing interest in psychological tasks that closely correspond to specific neural computations for studying brain-behavior associations across development and in disease. The psychometric properties of such tasks, particularly their reliability, are critical when designing correlational research in longitudinal, clinical, or other studies. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) is a widely used paradigm for assessing the ability to discriminate between similar memory representations. Given its reliance on hippocampal pattern separation, the MST has been increasingly employed as an index of hippocampal function in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Here, we evaluate the reliability of the Lure Discrimination Index–the most common performance metric of the MST–to determine its suitability for these research contexts. First, in a sample of 96 younger (20–31 years) and 109 older (66–83 years) participants, we estimate the consistency reliability of the MST using permutation-based methods. Our findings indicate that while consistency reliability estimates range from moderate to high, they are contingent on sample heterogeneity, and the resulting effect size attenuation is dependent on the study context. Second, using a subsample of 49 participants (13 younger and 36 older adults) who completed the MST twice with a one-year interval, we calculated the absolute agreement reliability with intraclass correlations. We found low to moderate stability of individual scores over time and tentative evidence for the presence of practice effects in the younger sample. We discuss the implications for correlational research and studies where score stability is important. Further, we provide tools to inform future research design.",

Responsible evaluation practices were generally not implemented, including safety protocols for risk detection (18%) and potentially harmful content (16%); real-world implementation was rarely addressed (7%). Across the two highest-quality controlled clinical studies, effect sizes ranged from d = .44 to .90 in symptom reduction.\n\nThis gap between widespread public adoption and the limited evidence base stresses the need for robust methodological standards, including rigorous clinical trials, a focus on safety and implementation, and standardized, clinically meaningful benchmarks.

          "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA) - the experience of controlling one’s actions and, through them, events in the external world - is a cornerstone of cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy, underpinning autonomy and responsibility. Yet research on SoA has overwhelmingly focused on Outcome-level Agency (control over external effects) and, to a lesser extent, Action-level Agency (control over bodily movements). A third and more foundational dimension - Decision-level Agency, defined as the experience of initiating one’s own decisions or intentions irrespective of overt action - has remained largely neglected. This omission leaves current accounts of agency and autonomy theoretically incomplete. Drawing on philosophical analysis and converging neuroscientific evidence, this paper argues that deciding and intending constitute mental actions in their own right, as the brain actively selects, commits to, revises, or withholds intentions. I propose a three-level framework - Decision, Action, and Outcome - that explicitly incorporates Decision-level Agency as a distinct yet hierarchically integrated component of SoA. This reconceptualization is not only theoretically necessary but ethically urgent in the era of generative artificial intelligence, where external systems increasingly shape human autonomy upstream at the level of decision formation rather than action execution. By outlining testable predictions and experimental paradigms, this work establishes Decision-level Agency as a measurable dimension of human volition and provides a framework for understanding and safeguarding autonomy in AI-mediated environments.",

While this work has yielded important insights, there is clear evidence from empirically validated psychotherapeutic interventions to suggest that these lower-level cognitive processes are often intact. Here, we argue that etiological and maintaining factors for internalizing disorders may be more appropriately situated in higher level cognitive processes such as goal-selection. We further suggest that future research should incorporate behavioral tasks and models that allow for participant-defined goals to reveal higher-level mechanistic targets.

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and informs computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about motor output combination: whether learning processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope still depends on the covariance structure of the learning processes, which is not constrained by additivity. For this reason, there is no regression slope benchmark for diagnosing additivity. Moreover, the regression slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by shared-error models where implicit and explicit systems are driven by the same error signals, which adhere to the additivity assumption. Regression slopes only tell us whether learning processes covary, not whether they violate additivity.",

          "abstract": "Structural descriptions of qualitative aspects of conscious experience (qualia) offer a rigorous empirical approach to study consciousness. An important outcome of this approach is that structural descriptions of qualia are formalized as mathematical objects. Mathematical structures describing qualia can be mapped to mathematical structures derived from brain activity and its underlying neuronal connectivity. That is, rather than merely identifying the co-occurrence of specific neuronal activity patterns with specific qualia — correlates of consciousness — we can aim to derive general mathematical mappings that map between qualia and neuronal mechanisms. Such mathematical mappings between neuronal mechanisms and qualia seem consistent with other laws of nature, such as how E=mc² maps mass to energy. Here, we survey key literature that led up to, or follows this structural approach, to assess the current state of the field. We first explicate the historic arc from psychophysics and the neuroscience of consciousness toward structural approaches to qualia. We then critically examine classical attempts of formalizing qualia structure, such as the textbook model of musical chroma (Shepard's pitch helix) and visual color space. We then explore what is known about the structure of their neuronal correlates. We then extend this analysis to visual similarity spaces, including face space and more general image spaces. Finally, we consider ongoing efforts, suggesting that exact experimental comparisons between qualia, analyzed with rigorous mathematics result in an “enriched psychophysics” that expands single-valued measures to much richer scientific exploration.",

However, despite women’s invaluable and essential contribution to the farming sector, studies examining how the unique farming lifestyle shapes women's experiences remain limited. This study, therefore, explores the role of women in the UK farming community. It examined how farming influences women’s roles and its positive and negative effects on their well-being and social connections. \nSemi-structured interviews were conducted between January and March 2023 with 30 women from the UK farming community, including farmers, wives, and daughters (Mage = 41.23 years, SD = 12.9). Data were analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis.\nAn overarching theme, “The Farm Comes First,” was supported by three subordinate themes: “Navigating Traditional Family Dynamics,” “Balancing On- and Off-Farm Commitments,” and “Understanding Connections: People, Place &amp; Purpose.” Participants encountered multiple challenges, including restricted autonomy and role incongruence. However, findings also indicated that a deep sense of belonging was experienced through family, work, community, and farmland. \nWe explored how belonging is a dynamic and subjective experience that provides both connection and frustration, depending on individual circumstances. For many, belonging fostered a sense of identity, competence, and contribution; for others, disconnection created tension. Interventions should prioritise strengthening sources of belonging while addressing forms of exclusion. Future research should explore differences in connectedness among women in various farming roles. This paper contributes to psychological and agricultural literature by proposing a conceptual model of belonging among women in farming that reflects the complexity of their experiences.",

We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "authors": "Juan José Pérez-Díaz; Darias Holgado; Tristan Bekinschtein; Daniel Sanabria",
          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel idiographic approach to mapping the lived experience of endurance athletes by integrating narrative self-reports with Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), a novel method for capturing the temporal dynamics of subjective experience. Two competitive cyclists were followed over eleven consecutive days, providing daily audio narratives and reconstructing their experiences across physiological, cognitive, emotional, and social contextual dimensions. The combined analyses revealed rich interindividual variability in attentional focus, emotional tone, and narrative style, despite comparable training levels and routines. TET trajectories exhibited clear temporal structures linked to session type and context, with competition days marked by peaks in effort, motivation, and flow. Coherence analyses demonstrated strong alignment between narrative descriptions and TET profiles, confirming that subjective dimensions manifest consistently across verbal and graphical modalities. Data driven regression analyses indicated weak correspondence between subjective dynamics, power output and heart rate, suggesting that lived experience might not simply parallel physiological and performance indicators. This methodological synthesis shows that integrating temporal and narrative data provides a multidimensional representation of endurance sport experience, revealing patterns and meanings that conventional metrics obscure. Rather than serving as a predictive tool, TET emerges as a complementary framework for enhancing athlete self-awareness, contextualizing performance fluctuations, and enriching coach athlete communication.",

          "authors": "Sabrina Hansmann-Roth",
          "abstract": "Gloss perception depends on several surface properties, but most studies measure these effects only one or two at a time. Here, we test whether a three-dimensional version of Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement (3D-MLCM) can be used to capture the combined influence of multiple cues on gloss. Observers judged which of two surfaces looked glossier while specular reflectance, albedo, and bumpiness were varied together. The additive model showed clear and reliable contributions of both albedo and bumpiness in addition to specular reflectance, and model comparisons confirmed that these cues significantly affected gloss judgments. The full model further revealed that these effects change with gloss level: bumpiness strongly influenced perceived gloss at low specular reflectance but had little effect at high gloss levels. These results show that 3D-MLCM provides stable, interpretable measurements and is a practical method for studying complex interactions between visual features that influence visual appearance.",

          "abstract": "Simulation studies are commonly used to improve understanding of psychometric models. For many common models, an essential feature of the simulation is the relative (to variation in person parameters) variation in item difficulties. A common practice has been to generate both item difficulty parameters and person parameters directly from a standard normal distribution or to otherwise stipulate distributions for both parameters at the outset of the simulation. This approach implicitly assumes that these distributions can adequately represent empirical data—an assumption that warrants careful examination. In this paper, leveraging 73 datasets from the Item Response Warehouse (Domingue et al., 2023), we examine the variability of item difficulty distributions in real-world datasets and investigate how this variation influences estimation and simulation. We identify key distributional characteristics (e.g., variance and skewness) and propose a new method for simulating realistic item difficulties based on empirical data. This method enhances the realism and applicability of simulation results, making them more reflective of real-world measurement conditions and improving the robustness of psychometric model evaluation",

          "abstract": "The Speed-Accuracy Trade-off (SAT) is one of the most well-established examples of the adaptability of human decision-making, where faster decisions can come at the expense of accuracy. The threshold-based account, which says that individuals gather less evidence when responding quickly, is widely accepted. Here we propose a fundamentally different mechanism: evidence accumulation becomes more self-excitatory when speed is emphasized. A comprehensive switchboard analysis revealed that self-excitation was the only feature consistently supported across six datasets, whereas adjustments to thresholds, drift rates, or non-decision time received little or no support. We demonstrate that this model better captures key behavioral patterns than the traditional evidence-threshold model. We also present new experimental data which shows that, consistent with a self-excitation model, early evidence is weighted more than late evidence, and that this is especially true when fast responses are encouraged. Overall, our results suggest an exciting new explanation for a long- standing behavioural phenomenon",

Study 1 examined the psychometric properties of the pool, revealing that the CRRQ comprises five factors, each focused on a distinct crying context (relationship discomfort, relationship comfort, other-oriented concern, emotion regulation, and manipulation). The results also supported the reliability and validity of the scale. Study 2 provided additional evidence for the 5-dimensional structure of the CRRQ and its good psychometric properties.

          "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Functional difficulties are hallmark signs of incident cognitive decline and progression to dementia, but are challenging to measure in clinic. Passive smartphone monitoring enables continuous tracking of everyday behaviors and may improve the status quo of dementia risk assessment, but acceptability is understudied. This study evaluated older adults’ attitudes toward personal smartphone monitoring for dementia risk and identified barriers and facilitators to acceptability.\n\nResearch Design and Methods: Seventeen older adults completed a semi-structured interview followed by a Likert-rating to measure acceptability. Transcripts were analyzed using hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis. Exploratory correlations examined associations between acceptability ratings and participant features.\n\nResults: Participants identified unique benefits of smartphone monitoring including enhanced scope of measurement, greater ecological validity and personalization, and improved accessibility. Potential disadvantages were confounding variables that threaten validity and concerns about privacy/data security. Preferences for clinical implementation that may improve acceptability included options for extended monitoring, assurances of privacy safeguards, control over data, and continued face-to-face interactions with one’s medical team. Most participants (13/17) were likely or extremely likely to participate in future smartphone monitoring research; higher likelihood was associated with lower depression (r=-.49, p=.046) and White vs. non-White race (U=57.50, n1=10, n2=7 p=.025).\n\nDiscussion and Implications: Findings offer insights to enhance acceptability of smartphone monitoring including transparent review of procedures, privacy safeguards, and existing evidence. Outstanding requirements for clinical implementation include streamlining results to minimize physician burden and accounting for confounders that threaten data integrity. Our small, research-savvy cohort necessitates follow-up in other settings.",

          "abstract": "The co-activation of two incompatible responses leads to the experience of cognitive conflict, which is thought to be aversive and hence, generally avoided.

In contrast, here, across two experiments (N = 100 each), participants freely chose the level of cognitive conflict they wanted to engage in the Simon and Stroop tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) with no external reward. In both experiments, we found that participants chose to freely engage in high levels of cognitive conflict, evaluated it as effortful yet enjoyable, and reported feeling surprised and enthusiastic after experiencing high cognitive conflict. Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive conflict is valued and functions as an intrinsic reward, despite the effort associated with it. These results broaden the neuroeconomic approach to cognitive control theories by integrating a hedonic perspective on the subjective experience of cognitive conflict.",

          "abstract": "Peer exclusion is linked to adverse outcomes, including reduced mood and unmet psychological needs. While the 2D Cyberball paradigm is widely used to simulate peer exclusion, its limited ecological validity has raised concerns. Therefore, this study compared the 2D Cyberball paradigm with a newly developed 3D Virtual Reality (VR) paradigm simulating peer exclusion in a classroom conversation.\nSeventy-six children (aged 8–12) and seventy-four adolescents (aged 13–16) participated in a counterbalanced within-subject design. Participants experienced both paradigms in two separate sessions. Mood and psychological needs were assessed before and after each paradigm. Moderator variables included paradigm features, social support, and previous rejection experiences. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted.\nBoth paradigms led to a decrease in positive mood and psychological needs and an increase in negative mood. However, stronger negative effects emerged after the 2D Cyberball paradigm. The 3D VR paradigm was perceived as more realistic and immersive, and its effects remained consistent across levels of the moderator variables, indicating robustness in responses. Adolescents showed stronger emotional and motivational reactions than children in the 3D VR condition, but not in the 2D Cyberball condition, suggesting greater developmental sensitivity of the immersive simulation.\nOverall, results confirm that the 3D VR paradigm effectively simulates peer exclusion while offering higher ecological validity than the 2D version. Although the 2D Cyberball paradigm elicited more intense negative effects, the 3D VR paradigm better captured naturalistic and age-related differences in peer exclusion experiences, thereby providing a more developmentally appropriate and ecologically valid research tool.",

          "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reading difficulty (RD) frequently co-occur, yet it is unclear whether their co-occurrence and cognitive profiles remain stable across the lifespan. This review examined whether the rates and cognitive manifestations of ADHD+RD change from childhood to adulthood. Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PubMed were searched. Studies were included if they reported the proportion of children or adults with ADHD+RD, or assessed cognitive performance in at least one of the following domains: attention, cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibition, general memory, planning, problem-solving, processing speed, or vocabulary. Random-effects proportional meta-analyses synthesised co-occurrence rates across child and adult studies, which were compared using a z-test. Random-effects meta-analyses of standardised mean differences synthesised pooled effect estimates across cognitive domains for children and adults, which were compared using an independent samples t-test. This review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (number: CRD42023463062). Of the 3,981 records identified, 153 studies were eligible: 98 examined prevalence, and 69 examined cognition. Pooled ADHD+RD prevalence was 0.23 (95% CI [0.20, 0.27]) in children, and 0.23 (95% CI [0.12, 0.40]) in adults. Pooled cognitive performance was -1.11 (SE = 0.09, 95% CI [-1.28, -0.95]) for children, and -0.70 (SE = 0.11, 95% CI [-0.91, -0.49]) for adults, with no significant child-adult differences across domains. Heterogeneity remained high across all syntheses (I2 &gt; 75%). The findings indicate comparable ADHD+RD co-occurrence rates and cognitive performance across development, have implications for the assessment, diagnosis and support of ADHD+RD, and highlight several methodological considerations for future research.",

However, current understandings of the public concept of science are too limited to yield definitive predictions about which scientists, and which scientific work, are perceived as more sciency than others. Here, we analyse patterns of linguistic associations in over 100 billion words to characterise the semantics of the public concept of science. These analyses show that sources, occupations, institutions, and social outcomes vary systematically in the strength of their association with science, and that this variation reliably predicts the extent to which they are associated with trust. These results shed light on the public concept of science, confirm sciency exemplars of science are more trusted, and help understand why the public trust science in general but also reject scientists and their work.",

We observed increases in nocturnal HR and decreases in HRV over time independent of microstressor exposure or concurrent mental health changes. Within-person increases in daily stress predicted higher following-morning negative affect, 28.5% of which was explained by rumination, a modifiable target for intervention.

          "abstract": "There is a long-standing debate about the role of visual mental images in reasoning. Knauff and Johnson-Laird's (2002) Visual Imagery Impedance Hypothesis (VIIH) suggests visual imagery can hinder abstract reasoning, as evidenced by slower responses to visual compared to spatial and control problems. Aphantasia — reduced or absent visual imagery— offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. In an online version of the reasoning paradigm used in VIIH studies, aphantasic and typical imagers completed three problem types (visual, spatial, control), while reaction times and accuracy scores were measured. In addition, a second classification, based on the Object-Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ), was employed to differentiate participants according to their cognitive style and explore possible performance differences between the visualiser, spatialiser and verbaliser clusters. Our study replicated the findings of Knauff and Johnson-Laird (2002), demonstrating robust evidence of a slowdown for visual problems in comparison to spatial and control ones in typical imagers. This effect was inconclusive in aphantasics, along with the difference between the groups. More in-depth analyses distinguishing “complete aphantasia” and hypophantasia suggested that the latter group was more affected by visual problems. Finally, our OSIVQ classification-based analyses revealed a meaningful slowdown in reasoning for the visualiser cluster, pointing to a possible influence of cognitive style on performance. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of considering the influence of mental images and cognitive styles in theories of reasoning.",

Researchers who employ deception sometimes administer post-experiment suspicion probes and exclude participants from analysis if their responses indicate that they were not successfully deceived. However, several studies have found that their suspicious participants behave as if they were deceived as intended. One explanation is that participants infer that they were deceived upon being presented with a suspicion probe, which biases them to overreport being suspicious. We tested whether post-experiment beliefs about deception can indeed induce such biases by manipulating whether we admitted to using deception before administering suspicion probes. Admitting to deception did not increase the amount of suspicion reported (Experiment 1), nor did the content of participants’ suspicions reflect the content of our admission (Experiment 2). Results suggest that it is unlikely that suspicion probes ‘tip off’ participants in a way that causes them to overreport suspicion.",

While much progress has been made using traditional laboratory-based methods of stress induction, we suggest that there is great potential in applying virtual reality (VR) since it enables a diverse range of stressors to be consistently delivered in the form of rich and immersive experiences. \n\nTo validate these VR stressors, however, we must assess their psychophysiological impact and compare them to established lab-based paradigms. In the current study, we recorded the subjective responses to two virtual reality stressors (“Spiders” and “Horror”). Using a repeated measures design, levels of VR-induced stress were compared to a speeded arithmetic task with negative evaluative feedback (a modified version of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST)) in healthy participants. For a subset of participants, basic physiological data (mean heart rate (HR) and respiratory frequency) are available.  \n\nBoth MIST and VR produced significant increases in subjective ratings of stress, desire for avoidance, negative affect, and perceived threat, as well as in respiratory frequency. Sizes of effect were comparable across the stressors, apart from negative affect and perceived threat, which were greater for the MIST. \n\nOverall, VR allows effective stress induction in healthy participants. Moreover, it was associated with a number of advantages, including convenience, and a lack of need for participant deception. These findings support the use of VR for inducing and exploring patterns of stress responses in humans.",

In both tasks, participants heard continuous auditory streams containing trisyllabic or three-tone “words”. Learning was measured via reaction time acceleration to predictable items and by neural responses to structured versus random streams within language regions identified via an independent story-listening task. Children showed faster learning than adults only in the linguistic learning task. fMRI revealed earlier and stronger learning-induced plasticity in children’s language network than adults. Greater neural sensitivity was further associated with faster linguistic learning in children, but not in adults.

          "abstract": "Social gaze is a fundamental cue regulating approach and avoidance in social interactions, yet it remains unclear how repeated gaze exchanges give rise to enduring social preferences and closeness. Here, we propose a computational learning account in which gaze-contingent feedback generates prediction errors that update latent social values, thereby shaping social closeness over time. According to this account, direct and averted gaze function as socially rewarding or non-rewarding outcomes whose impact depends on individual reward calibration. We tested this account using a gaze-interaction paradigm in which participants repeatedly chose between two interaction partners that predominantly (70%) responded with direct or averted gaze and rated their perceived social closeness toward each partner. Consistent with the model, participants increasingly preferred and felt closer to the partner who more frequently returned direct gaze. Computational modeling revealed that gaze direction elicited prediction errors that updated the latent value of the interaction partner. Crucially, these learning signals were calibrated by individual differences in the subjective reward value of direct gaze. Initial attractiveness and valence of the interaction partner predicted this calibration, indicating that pre-existing impressions shape how gaze feedback is valued. In turn, reward calibration was reflected in participants’ post-interaction social evaluations, demonstrating how learning experiences contributed to impression formation. Together, these findings provide a computational account of how minimal gaze interactions can give rise to social preference and closeness through reinforcement learning mechanisms. More broadly, they suggest that eye contact functions as a powerful but individually calibrated social signal that dynamically shapes social affiliation.",

Three items showed significant signs of racial bias: A1 (overall language level), A5 (offers information), and D5 (compulsions and rituals). On these items, Black/African American and Asian children were usually more likely to be rated as showing autistic behaviors than White children with similar autism levels. The impact of racial bias on the item score was small, and impact on the overall test score was even smaller: on a scale of 0-48 points, the effect of racial bias was estimated at 0.23 total points for Black/African American children, and 0.16 points for Asian children. Furthermore, none of the items showing significant bias contribute to the autism classification algorithm. This analysis suggests a small but detectable amount of bias in several specific ADOS items, but not in items central to informing an autism diagnosis. Thus, bias appears statistically, but not clinically, significant. This contributes to examinations of racial bias in the ADOS as the first analysis of Asian children, and the first in-depth look at all items in the most commonly used version among school-aged children.",

          "authors": "Dario Stolze; Felix Wilhelm Siebert; Sonja Haustein",
          "abstract": "Residential relocations can affect well-being and travel behaviour in ambiguous ways. This study conceptualises moving voluntariness as an explanatory variable leading to favourable outcomes for voluntary movers and less favourable outcomes for involuntary movers. Specifically, we expect that voluntary movers will change or maintain travel behaviour in line with previous attitudes due to higher control and that involuntary movers will adapt more strongly to their new built environment due to lower control levels. We test this using longitudinal panel survey data of individuals expecting (n=1,234) and later realising a move (n=411). Using a novel, subjective voluntariness measure, we find that voluntary movers show improved well-being (i.e. mental health, life satisfaction, residential satisfaction, place attachment), while involuntary movers show similar but non-significant changes. Neither group shows changed travel attitude-behaviour consistencies, suggesting that subjective voluntariness does not directly translate into distinct travel behaviour change pathways. However, involuntary movers showed consistently weaker car orientations and lower mobility needs fulfilment, hinting at stable differences in travel characteristics of mover groups. Despite similar demographics, involuntary movers report lower perceived control, earlier moving stages, and higher future-location uncertainty. Our suggested subjective measure provides different well-being and travel insights than previous objective approaches. We suggest conceptual and methodological refinements, e.g. in terms of dimensionality, time-variability, reliability, and possible relations to personality/trait variables.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are popular tools for explaining speeded decisions because their parameters capture different aspects of the decision process. While researchers increasingly use Bayesian methods for estimating EAM parameters, computational costs and the necessity of tractable model likelihoods still pose obstacles for traditional methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Neural posterior estimation (NPE) addresses these obstacles by training a neural network to approximate the joint posterior distribution from simulated data, which only requires a generative model and amortizes computational costs at inference time. However, the quality of the approximation can suffer when the test data at inference time differs from the training data. Both test and training data stem from data-generating contexts and, for EAMs, these are influenced by the experimental design. Using the Racing Diffusion Model as a test case, we investigated how well NPE can generalize across changes in two types of experimental design contexts: number of trials and data-generating prior contexts that affect the error rate. Using MCMC as a reference, we showed in two simulation studies that NPE generalized well across changes in trial numbers but less well across error rates. We applied NPE to empirical datasets from reasoning tasks and found that the patterns observed in our simulation studies held. We discuss challenges and future directions to assess and improve the generalization for neural estimators for EAMs.",

          "authors": "Ummul Haseena Muskan; Deepa Marina Raquinha",
          "abstract": "Play has always been a natural part of childhood, not only as a source of joy, but also as a powerful way through which children learn, express themselves, and build relationships. However, in today’s screen-driven world, non-digital play is slowly being pushed aside, even though its role in children’s cognitive, emotional, social, and physical development is well established (Ginsburg, 2007). This scoping review was undertaken to understand what existing research tells us about the effectiveness of non-digital play-based learning environments among children.\nFollowing the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, this review mapped peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2024. A total of 17 studies involving children aged 2 to 12 years were included. The reviewed literature covered a wide range of non-digital play forms such as pretend play, board games, outdoor and physical play, traditional games, and free play, implemented across school and community settings. Overall, the findings suggest that non-digital play-based learning environments are associated with positive outcomes in executive functioning, emotional regulation, creativity, social interaction, self-regulation, and motor development (Rao &amp; Gibson, 2021; Bai et al., 2022; Colliver et al., 2022; Jaggy et al., 2023).\nThe effectiveness of these play-based environments was commonly assessed using pre- and post-intervention measures, observational tools, and qualitative inputs from teachers and caregivers, reflecting both measurable developmental changes and lived classroom experiences. Taken together, the evidence supports the view that non-digital play is not separate from learning, but deeply embedded within it, aligning with classic developmental theories that emphasise learning through interaction, imagination, and social engagement (Piaget; Vygotsky; Erikson). This review highlights the continuing relevance of non-digital play in contemporary childhoods and points to the need for more longitudinal and culturally diverse research to better understand its long-term impact on children’s development.\nKeywords: non-digital play, play-based learning, child development, pretend play, scoping review",

          "abstract": "There is growing concern that smartphones and social media (S/SM) disrupt adolescent sleep, wellbeing and cognition, yet causal evidence from robust interventions is limited. To assess the acceptability of a total 21-day S/SM detox we conducted a preregistered (https://osf.io/79zd2) pilot randomised control trial with eighty-two adolescents aged 13-18 years from UK schools. Participants were randomly assigned to a total S/SM ban (N=26), total S/SM ban with access to a basic “brick” phone (N=26) or a business-as-usual control (N=30). Pre-and post-intervention measures of sleep, wellbeing, and cognition were collected using surveys, wearables, and cognitive tasks.  Retention was high, with 13% attrition across groups. At 21-days, both ban conditions showed tentative improvements in sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and working memory relative to the controls, however these changes were not maintained at a two-month follow-up. Open-ended responses indicated mixed or negative experiences for 50% of participants, including boredom, functional reliance on smartphones, and fear of missing out, although 83% endorsed the need for government action. Digital detoxes appear feasible for generating causal evidence however, complete abstinence can pose challenges. Fully powered trials should ascertain whether more targeted interventions (e.g., limiting bed-time use) are as effective.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Managing mood, cognition, and fatigue are top unmet needs reported by stroke survivors, which impact quality of life. There is currently no standardised UK care pathway to support post-stroke psychological outcomes. The Enhanced Reviews for Psychological Changes (ENRICH) programme, an intervention co-designed with stroke survivors, carers, and healthcare professionals, aims to fill this gap. Here, we describe the protocol for evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of ENRICH. \n\nMethods and Analysis: ENRICH reviews comprise cognition, mood, and fatigue assessment, personalised psychoeducation and tools to communicate results and discuss self-management strategies, delivered at 1, 3, and 6-months post-stroke. N=140 participants (N=80 stroke patients, N=45 carers, N=15 Health care professionals) will be recruited to a single arm multicentre feasibility study.\nStroke patients and carers will complete questionnaires of quality of life, mood, and healthcare resource use at 6- and 9-months post-stroke, and an optional interview on experiences of ENRICH. Process evaluation will include fidelity assessment via audio recordings. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for study outcomes. Key qualitative acceptability outcomes are sought on intervention delivery by clinicians, patients and carers. Key intervention delivery feasibility outcomes are training clinicians, competency and fidelity delivering ENRICH, and review completion rates. Study feasibility outcomes will include site and participant recruitment and retention rates and completion of candidate primary outcomes measures on quality of life. \n\nEthics and Dissemination: The ENRICH study was approved by a UK Research Ethics Committee (reference: 24/LO/0341). Consent procedures include a waiver of consent to the intervention itself due ENRICH’s service-level design and written informed consent/consultee advice for participants providing research data. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and lay summaries for study participants and healthcare professionals. Results will inform whether ENRICH is acceptable to delivering clinicians and receiving stroke patients and carers, and provide key insights to inform a future randomised trial to determine effectiveness. \nTrial Registration: ISRCTN16018388 (Protocol version 1.3)",

          "authors": "Samuel Finnerty",
          "abstract": "Policy responses to the climate crisis have lagged behind the scientific consensus on its seriousness, prompting a growing number of scientists to engage in activism, including civil disobedience. This shift challenges traditional norms of neutrality and objectivity, raising questions about how scientists reconcile their professional identity with activism and sustain engagement. Drawing on two years of immersive ethnography (participant observation and autoethnography) with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion (S4XR) in the UK, this study traces the lived processes through which scientists enter activism, manage identity tensions, and decide how far to go. Findings show that identity-aligned spaces legitimise first steps and foster belonging. Scientists strategically draw on professional expertise and scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, peer-reviewed papers) to legitimise action and unify scientist-activists; at the same time, these symbols present challenges, as not all scientists identify with them, and they may invite audience expectations about universal expertise. Over time, activism reshapes professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act and producing a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Sustained commitment depends on collective efficacy, peer affirmation, and care practices that enable self-determined roles and buffer burnout. Escalation is non-linear: risk thresholds often rise with experience, yet professional, personal, and ethical considerations continue to influence decisions. Structured around a process-oriented framework, the analysis identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories, from initial hesitation to sustained participation, offering insights for social psychological models of collective action and for strategies to engage scientists in effective, sustained climate action.",

          "abstract": "Do we learn better from a broad range of variable examples, or a narrow set of consistent ones? While higher-variability training is often assumed to generate more robust category learning, it remains unclear how different types of variability affect task performance, and whether variability affects all tasks equally. We examined how different forms of variability influence learning by manipulating pitch variation (but equating average pitch) across shorter and longer timescales when participants learned to identify new voices. To examine task-specific differences, we tested performance on a voice identification in noise task and a speech intelligibility task. The nature of variability during training produced distinct outcomes for subsequent voice recognition in noise: exposure to fine-grained, moment-to-moment pitch variability during learning affected performance more than exposure to broader, between-sentence pitch variability. In contrast, neither form of variability affected speech intelligibility: participants showed a comparable benefit to speech intelligibility when listening to trained voices compared to novel voices, regardless of their previous exposure to pitch variation within trained voices. These findings demonstrate that variability is not uniformly beneficial, but instead interacts with the type of variability and the task. These results challenge current theories of perception and learning, which either propose that variability is stripped away during learning or treat variability as a single construct. Instead, our results demonstrate that at least some types of variability are maintained during learning—but not all types of variability are treated equally, and different types are utilised in distinct ways for different tasks.",

          "abstract": "In controversial ethical issues professional obligations may conflict with personal values. Actors may assume roles that do not correspond with their personal values.  We examined actors in the theater play \"Gott\" by Ferdinand von Schirach dealing with assisted suicide. We investigated how actors perceive the arguments, identify with their roles, and deal with role conflicts. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the complete cast of a production of “Gott” in Switzerland and used qualitative content analysis to answer our research questions. Articulating arguments positively influenced actors' perceived attitudes toward assisted suicide, aiding in the formation of their own stance, and shifting their perceptions of affected individuals. In contrast, one actress whose role did not produce arguments had difficulties forming her attitude. Being unable to form an attitude can lead to moral distress. Identification with the roles was highly individual, but most actors identified with their roles. Unlike prior work that assumed negative effects of complete role identification on actors, we demonstrated that experienced actors can maintain psychological boundaries while engaging deeply with complex moral narratives.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety is widely recognized as a barrier to mathematical learning; however, its causal relationship with performance remains a topic of debate. The present study examined whether math anxiety predicts poor arithmetic fluency or vice versa by applying both a traditional Cross-Lagged Panel Model (CLPM) and a Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) to longitudinal data from 866 students in grades 4–6 across six measurement points. The CLPM revealed a reciprocal relationship between math anxiety and arithmetic fluency, suggesting that the two influence each other over time. In contrast, the RI-CLPM indicated a unidirectional effect, where math anxiety predicted subsequent declines in arithmetic fluency, supporting the debilitating hypothesis. Although both models fit the data, the RI-CLPM demonstrated superior fit indices. When stable between-person differences are accounted for, the model reveals that within-person increases in math anxiety predict subsequent declines in arithmetic fluency, supporting the debilitating hypothesis. These findings highlight the importance of model selection in developmental research and underscore the role of math anxiety as a critical target for early interventions aimed at improving mathematical outcomes.",

Motivational aging theories, however, suggest that socio-emotional feedback can reduce these deficits, though it is unclear whether this effect depends on the social, emotional or communicative information in feedback. Participants from two age groups, n= 24 older adults (M = 72.37 years; SD=3.37) and n = 22 younger adults (M = 22.63 years; SD=1.78), therefore completed a probabilistic learning task in which stimulus–response associations had to be learned via unfamiliar social (hand gestures) or non-social (abstract shapes) feedback. To capture neural correlates of feedback processing, two ERP components were investigated; the feedback-related negativity (FRN), associated with the detection of unexpected events, and the P3b component, linked to working memory updating. Results revealed that younger and older adults learned more effectively from social than non-social feedback, with older adults benefitting most. The FRN was enhanced after social feedback in older adults, but after non-social feedback in younger adults. The P3b was more pronounced for social feedback, primarily driven by larger valence-related differences. In contrast, non-social feedback elicited increased frontal activation, indicating higher processing effort irrespective of participants’ age. These findings reveal a processing advantage for social feedback that appears biologically rooted rather than primarily explained by motivational aging theories, which may require additional facets such as emotional or communicative information.",

          "abstract": "Understanding habit formation in humans remains a fundamental challenge, partly due to the constraints of laboratory-based studies. Thus, this study investigated whether prolonged, real-world engagement with a novel smartphone-based task could induce habitual behavior. Across five pilot experiments (n=27-43; total N = 177), participants were randomly assigned to either a short (ST) or extended training (ET) condition using a gamified button-press task delivered via a custom web application. Habit formation was assessed through three complementary tests targeting hallmark features of habitual behavior: automaticity, inflexibility, and insensitivity to outcome devaluation. While the ET group showed improved performance on dual-task measures (suggestive of increased automaticity), neither the devaluation nor the inflexibility tests yielded conclusive evidence of habit induction across experiments. Bayesian analysis supported the absence of robust group differences in insensitivity to outcome devaluation. Our findings highlight the difficulty of inducing measurable habits in humans, even under prolonged and ecologically valid training. Crucially, they also call into question the utility of outcome devaluation as a definitive measure of habit, regardless of training duration or setting. We argue that this widely used paradigm may miss important aspects of stimulus–response learning and suggest the need for alternative or refined tools to capture the complexity of human habit formation. Our null results, provide methodological insights for future research and suggest that smartphone-based paradigms, while scalable and flexible, require further refinement to elicit and detect true habitual behavior.

          "abstract": "Identifying shared and distinct profiles, whether in symptom combinations, personality traits, or cognitive abilities, is essential for understanding psychological phenomena, yet doing so requires navigating interrelated theoretical, conceptual, and technical complexities. First, psychological phenomena typically exist along continuous spectra rather than discrete categories, complicating the characterisation of inherently heterogeneous constructs. Second, studying individual differences requires balancing population-level generalisation with person-level interpretability, which is critical for applied science. Third, psychological data often contain missing values, non-linear relationships, and high-dimensional patterns that violate standard statistical assumptions. Commonly used approaches for profile detection fail to address these complexities simultaneously, typically producing oversimplified or difficult-to-interpret results that obscure person-centred patterns. In contrast, Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) offer a powerful, visual, and intuitive solution that addresses these challenges. Despite growing interest, SOMs remain underutilised in psychology, potentially due to a lack of accessible tutorials and clear guidelines tailored to the field. This tutorial introduces SOMs to psychologists without technical backgrounds, emphasising practical implementation. We provide evidence-based guidance for key methodological decisions, accompanied by annotated R code. Using a dataset of depressive symptoms as an illustrative case, we present a complete workflow covering data preprocessing, map initialisation, parameter optimisation, and interpretation. We further discuss advanced SOM extensions relevant to psychological research and highlight key limitations of the method. By providing clear guidance, this tutorial facilitates the adoption of SOMs, advancing nuanced, person-centred analyses that preserve the complexity of psychological phenomena.",

While many intervention strategies have been tested in recent years, the field remains characterized by fragmented findings and context-specific results. Responding to the critical need for cumulative evidence in public relations scholarship, this study employs a meta-analytic approach to systematically assess the overall effectiveness of interventions intended to counter potential misinformation. Across 13 studies (N = 5,650), public relations responses yielded a small to medium-sized negative effect on belief in misinformation (d = −0.24), a medium-sized positive effect on belief in the organization’s corrective communication (d = 0.44), and a small positive effect on pro-organization attitudes and intentions (d = 0.19). Among the specific strategies examined, prebunking emerged as a particularly promising approach. The findings suggest that while current public relations interventions are preferable to inaction, they are often insufficient for fully addressing the growing threat of false claims. By integrating disparate experimental data, this study offers robust quantitative evidence to guide future public relations theory building and evidence-based practice.",

This paper introduces a novel approach to understand why these behaviors occur, reconciling these observed \"irrationalities\" with a simple rational objective. Here we propose that the human nervous system, faced with limited cognitive capacity (a finite representational precision for the representation of reward value), optimally selects a task-appropriate utility function to either maximize long-run average earnings or to minimize errors. We argue that the utility functions we have measured are tools, sculpted by knowledge of the choice environment's probabilistic structure and the decision-maker's precision level, for optimally achieving a rational objective. Our results show that almost every experimentally observed utility function can be described as a near-optimal tool for achieving a maximization of objective earnings (a goal abandoned since Bernoulli) or for minimizing errors. We quantify the specific gains that result from adding cognitive capacity and find that these gains are quite small as long as the utility function is correctly adjusted to cognitive capacity. Our research provides a novel framework that offers a testable and foundational explanation for why human and animal decision-makers evolved the puzzling range of utility functions and risk attitudes that have been widely observed.",

Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

          "abstract": "Intrinsic work motivation is important for workers’ performance and well-being across all ages. Ongoing demographic change makes it particular important to study the work motivation of ageing workers, not the least because it may affect their later retirement decisions. The changing world of work, cohort differences in personality and health, as well as changing labor and pension policies may lead to historical differences in intrinsic work motivation, However, such effects have seldom been studied. In the present study, we examined historical differences in workers aged between 50 and 52 in either 2011 or 2022/23, based on two samples of the population-based German lidA survey. We found that those interviewed in 2022/23 showed slightly lower intrinsic work motivation (d = 0.11) than their earlier counterparts. Analyses also showed that opportunities for development and social support showed a stronger association with work motivation in the later-born sample, compared to the earlier cohort. Our results suggest that historical changes may affect work attitudes and that job demands and resources are possible targets to address workers’ work motivation.",

          "abstract": "Regulatory flexibility, defined as the ability to use strategies in accordance with contextual demands, is thought to be central to psychological health. In the current research, we test the boundaries of this claim by examining: (1) how broadly does regulatory flexibility relate to different facets of psychological health?, and (2) is more flexibility always better? Across six samples, participants (N = 2,939) reported their ability to use strategies flexibly when managing impulses (e.g., temptations) and completed indicators of ill-being and well-being. Findings indicated that people who are more flexible report not only less anxiety and depression but also more positive functioning, including more life satisfaction, meaning, thriving, and positive mental health. There was some goal-to-goal variation, but the same pattern held when controlling for goal-specific covariates and replicated in both meta-analytic and mega-analytic approaches. Interestingly, there was a significant quadratic association between flexibility and well-being but not ill-being. This suggested diminishing returns, such that being more flexible was beneficial for well-being, but only to a certain point. Overall, these findings suggest that having the ability to use strategies flexibly has no apparent downside.",

This registered replication report describes the result of eight direct replications (total N = 1502) of a representative stereotype-threat study by Johns et al. (2005), who found that threatened women (but not men) underperform when they are confronted with a mathematics test that is presented to measure gender differences, and that this effect can be alleviated by altering test instructions. A multilevel analysis showed no significant interaction effect between stereotype-threat condition and gender, and only an observed gender gap on the mathematics test, with women performing worse than men (d = -0.37; 95%CI[-0.49; -0.25]). The stereotype-threat effect among women was virtually null and not significant (N = 822, d = -0.006; 95% CI[-0.15; 0.14]), and considerably smaller than the original study (N = 45, d = -0.82; 95 %CI[-1.45; -0.18]). Secondary analyses yielded a main effect of gender composition and a random effect of lab, but neither variable affected the interaction between stereotype threat and gender.

          "abstract": "As generative AI drafts emails, summarizes medical results, and shapes social feeds, psychological science faces two questions: What does AI do to human behavior, judgment, and wellbeing? What does it reveal about the theories we use to explain them? This article examines emerging findings on trust and the dehumanization of AI users, literacy-dependent fear and awe, and large-scale persuasion, advice, and delegation. Across these domains, familiar mechanisms—source credibility, mind perception, ownership, control—operate in new environments where content generation is effortless, interaction is seamless, and influence scales invisibly. AI is less a synthetic mind than a stress test on three clusters of human functioning: epistemic (how people handle evidence and uncertainty), social-evaluative (how they perceive and judge others), and motivational (how they pursue goals and maintain identity). When current theories fail to predict behavior around AI—when people simultaneously overtrust hidden AI advice and distrust visible AI users—those failures reveal where core constructs remain underspecified. This framing clarifies what changes in the age of AI (scale, speed, opacity), what does not (the underlying psychological processes), and where theory must be sharpened to accommodate minds operating in AI-saturated environments.",

The MoCA was included for comparative purposes. Impairment was defined as failing any OCS-AU cognitive domain, scoring below 26 on the MoCA, or failing at least two domains on the neuropsychological test battery.\nResults: To detect impairment within individual cognitive domains, most OCS-AU scores had low sensitivity, ranging from 0.12 (Executive) to 0.92 (Spatial Attention). Specificity was higher, ranging from 0.80 (Spatial Attention) to 0.96 (Praxis). Regarding the detection of multi-domain cognitive impairments, MoCA scores showed high sensitivity (0.81) but low specificity (0.42), compared with OCS-AU lower sensitivity (0.70) but higher specificity (0.58).\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the OCS-AU has strong domain-level specificity, but may miss some individuals with mild to moderate memory and executive impairments, while the MoCA appears more sensitive to domain-general impairment, but may misclassify individuals without post-stroke cognitive impairment. Thus, the OCS-AU and MoCA could be utilised for different purposes, to leverage their strengths when addressing specific clinical needs.",

Behavioural Activation (BA), an intervention that encourages engagement in positively reinforcing activities, shows promise. Here, we conduct a process evaluation of two group-based BA interventions for adults with ABI. \nMethods: Adults (≥18 years) recruited from local ABI services, charities, and self-referral via social media were randomised to receive either “Traditional” BA (scheduling and engaging in positively reinforcing activities combined with cognitive management strategies) or “Experiential” BA (participating in reinforcing activities within-session but without explicit attempts to plan between-session activities). Interventions were delivered once weekly over 8 weeks. A semi-structured interview at 1-month follow-up focused on participants’ perspectives of intervention benefits and processes associated with mood and activity levels. Data were collected in-person and, due to COVID-19, remotely. \nResults: N=49 participants completed interviews (Traditional BA n=25, Experiential BA n=24). A positive therapeutic milieu, a sense of group cohesion and being able to share common ABI-related experiences were felt to foster psychological safety, reduce social isolation and underlie mood/activity improvements by participants in both groups. Processes more strongly linked to Traditional BA included developing their skillset in coping with low mood, avoidance and cognitive barriers to activity engagement, aligning scheduled activities to values, and challenging negative thinking patterns. Conversely, processes more strongly linked to Experiential BA were increased in-session enjoyment, participating in activities in sessions enhancing present-mindedness, and having choice and control into selecting within-session activities. \nConclusions: Positive group processes may enhance outcomes associated with group-based BA delivered to adults with ABI. Specific methods of delivering group-based BA may have differing underlying mechanisms that should be captured and maximised in BA intervention delivery in ABI, including value-based activity scheduling and promoting autonomy in session content. \nTrial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03874650.

          "abstract": "The production effect refers to the finding that words read aloud are remembered better than words read silently. Historically, this phenomenon has been explained with reference to distinctive features encoded at study (e.g., auditory and motor elements) being retrieved at test to discriminate between studied and unstudied items, with emphasis placed on features stemming from the act of production itself. Across two experiments, we demonstrate that even anticipation of reading a word aloud is sufficient to improve its memory over silent items. Using a recent variant of the production paradigm involving pupillometry, participants were instructed to withhold their response until a “Go” signal appeared. On “catch” trials this signal never occurred. Despite having not produced the word on a catch trial, participants nonetheless demonstrated both a behavioral (Experiments 1 and 2) and a pupillary (Experiment 2) production effect, although both were of lesser magnitude than on trials requiring actual production. For “Go” trials, the behavioral production effect was evident for both recollection and familiarity; for “catch” trials, the effect was evident only for recollection. These results support recent claims that motivational or attentional factors play a role in the emergence of the production effect, connecting this effect to a broader framework of action-oriented memory enhancement.",

However, whether the JSE is better explained by non-social mechanisms remains an open question. The present meta-analytic review sought to provide an overview of the JSE literature and to evaluate its suitability as a measure of self-other integration. Our meta-analysis of 274 JSEs from 80 studies (7042 participants across 186 samples) revealed a significant overall effect of gD = .60. Analysis of 52 canonical JSEs (reflecting the seminal study) revealed a larger JSE of gD =.72. Finally, moderation by study characteristics suggested that JSEs at least partly reflect social representations of one’s co-actor.

Prior laboratory work suggests that this design feature may influence game experience, facilitate immersion, increase arousal, and promote riskier decision making, but whether this generalizes to realistic gambling products remains unclear. In this pre-registered study, we used a realistic slot machine simulator, deployed online, to evaluate effects of win-accompanying sensory feedback (SF) on gambling experience and behavior. Method: Participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk and stratified as online active gamblers (AG) or non-gamblers (NG). Participants were randomly assigned to complete 200 spins on an online slot machine that featured either enhanced or diminished SF. Results: Enhanced SF reduced time to initiate spins (i.e. faster speed of play) but did not affect bet size or self-reported experience. Relative to NG, AG reported greater game immersion and positive affect during the game, and these variables were also predicted across all participants by greater problem gambling severity, and monetary gains in the gambling session. In addition, self-reported immersion and affect were predicted by ADHD and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Faster gambling under SF may incur greater losses over time, raising concerns about harm potential. By contrast, game experience was influenced by monetary outcomes and personal characteristics rather than SF. Overall, these findings support the notion that both product and personal characteristics confer risk of harm.",

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and informs computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about motor output combination: whether learning processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope still depends on the covariance structure of the learning processes, which is not constrained by additivity. For this reason, there is no regression slope benchmark for diagnosing additivity. Moreover, the regression slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by shared-error models where implicit and explicit systems are driven by the same error signals, which adhere to the additivity assumption. Regression slopes only tell us whether learning processes covary, not whether they violate additivity.",

Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality—the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies reveal that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings further show that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

While the detrimental effects of visual-manual NDRAs on drivers’ visual attention during PAD is well-established, the impact of cognitively demanding NDRAs that take drivers’ mind off but allow their eyes to remain on the roadway is poorly understood. It is also unclear how the effects of cognitive load vary across automation levels. A driving simulator study was conducted to examine drivers’ visual attention under cognitive load, induced by a 2-back task, during both manual driving and PAD. An urban section of road, with a range of vehicles and other road users as potential hazards, was used to study drivers’ allocation of attention. Results indicated that, during PAD, drivers adopted a broader visual search strategy, directing more attention to the peripheral driving environment. However, drivers’ visual search was more restricted under cognitive load, with attention concentrated on the road ahead, accompanied by fewer and shorter glances to the periphery, regardless of driving mode. These findings add knowledge on how cognitively demanding NDRAs affects drivers’ visual attention, under different driving automation levels, and highlight the need for targeted countermeasures to ensure drivers safely monitor PAD and the driving environment.",

In the current research, we test the boundaries of this claim by examining: (1) how broadly does regulatory flexibility relate to different facets of psychological health?, and (2) is more flexibility always better? Across six samples, participants (N = 2,939) reported their ability to use strategies flexibly when managing impulses (e.g., temptations) and completed indicators of ill-being and well-being. Findings indicated that people who are more flexible report not only less anxiety and depression but also more positive functioning, including more life satisfaction, meaning, thriving, and positive mental health. There was some goal-to-goal variation, but the same pattern held when controlling for goal-specific covariates and replicated in both meta-analytic and mega-analytic approaches. Interestingly, there was a significant quadratic association between flexibility and well-being but not ill-being. This suggested diminishing returns, such that being more flexible was beneficial for well-being, but only to a certain point.

In Experiment 1, the interim learning tasks of overt retrieval and cue-only JOLs (based on the painting without the artist name) improved future inductive learning compared to restudy, whereas cue–target JOLs did not (painting and artist name shown). Cue-only JOLs also produced response-time patterns consistent with retrieval-based processing, and self-reported retrieval use predicted their forward benefit. Experiment 2 replicated the beneficial forward effect of cue-only JOLs over restudy with different materials and found that providing item-by-item feedback did not change the effect.

          "authors": "Satoshi Usami",
          "abstract": "Psychological researchers have shown an interest in disaggregating within-person variability from between-person differences. Especially for inferring reciprocal relations among variables at the within-person level, applications of the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) with stable trait factors has increased rapidly. This paper provides a tutorial, simulation, and illustrative example of another recent approach proposed by Usami (2023).  This approach consists of a two-step procedure: within-person variability scores (WPVS) for each person, which are disaggregated from the stable traits of that person, are predicted using structural equation modeling, and causal parameters are then estimated via a potential outcome approach, such as by using structural nested mean models (SNMMs). This method assumes a data-generating process similar to that in RI-CLPM, and has several advantages: (i) the flexible inclusion of curvilinear and interaction effects for WPVS as latent variables in treatment and outcome models, (ii) more accurate estimates of causal parameters for reciprocal relations can be obtained under certain conditions owing to them being doubly robust, even if unobserved time-varying confounders and model misspecifications exist, (iii) no models for (the distributions of) observed time-varying confounders are needed for estimation, and (iv) the risk of obtaining improper solutions is reduced. After explaining the data-generating process and the analysis procedure using the R package DTRreg for SNMMs, estimation performances are compared with RI-CLPM through large-scale simulations. We show that the proposed approach works well in many conditions if longitudinal data with T≧4 are available, and that the accuracy increases as T becomes larger. An analytic example using data regarding sleep habits and mental health statuses from the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) study is also provided.",

Cumulative Link Mixed Models revealed systematic divergence across raters: AI systems, particularly the Pro version, consistently overestimated accent strength, assigning severe ratings to samples humans judged as moderate.

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and shapes computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about output combination: whether processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between the learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope depends on the correlation and variance ratio between processes. Neither condition is constrained by additivity, and therefore there is no benchmark. The empirical slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by competitive models where implicit and explicit systems share error signals, which are built on the additivity assumption. Thus, regression slopes only tell us that learning processes covary, not that they violate additivity.",

          "abstract": "Negative affect has been shown, in both humans and non-human animals, to bias decision-making under ambiguity away from so-called ‘optimistic’ responses that can yield higher rewards but also risk greater losses. The judgement bias task, a cognitive task that uses ambiguous stimuli to measure such decisions as indicators of affective state, has successfully been translated from humans to animals and back again. However, questions remain regarding how exactly affect influences ‘optimistic’ or ‘pessimistic’ decisions, and the extent to which dispositional pessimism also influences these decisions. To further understand links between affect and decision-making, we carried out a judgement bias task in humans and measured self-reported affect and dispositional pessimism. In a pre-registered online experiment, participants completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, and pessimism, and undertook a judgement bias task. Our results mirrored previous findings showing that self-reported negative affect is associated with negatively-biased decision-making under ambiguity; individuals who reported higher anxiety and depression made a significantly lower proportion of ‘optimistic’ responses to ambiguous stimuli in the judgement bias task. However, we found no evidence that self-reported dispositional pessimism is associated with ‘pessimistic’ responses in the task. Drift-diffusion modelling revealed that the more negative (less ‘optimistic’) judgement bias associated with self-reported anxiety and depression, can be explained by a bias generated during the decision-making process, represented by a lower drift rate. But due to high comorbidity, we were unable to determine whether negative judgement bias is driven primarily by anxiety or depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Transition from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) represents a vulnerable period for transitional age youth (TAY), with high risk of disengagement and unmet mental health needs. Evidence on effective transition models remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify how many TAY achieved the CAMHS-AMHS transition, assess implementation of transition protocols, identify systemic barriers, and synthesize service improvements. Methods: Studies published between January 2013 and November 2025 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane. Results: Forty-four studies using quantitative or mixed methods were included in the systematic review, and twenty-three provided data for meta-analysis, which encompassed a total of 12,466 youth (mean = 542 ± 1.65). The random-effects model estimated that 33% of youth transitioned to AMHS (95% CI: 24-44). Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

          "abstract": "Social relationships are central to well-being because they fulfill social affiliation needs. To explain how social needs are regulated, theories describe daily-life processes among social desire, social contact, and affect. Still, these processes remain empirically underexplored because of their complexity. In this study, we estimated multivariate associations of social desire and affect with social contact across different modalities (in-person, digital), time scales (hourly, daily), and levels of analysis (between-person, contemporaneous, temporally lagged). Participants from two age-heterogeneous samples answered experience sampling questions and contributed data through unobtrusive smartphone sensing, with roughly hourly assessments across 2 days (N = 303) and daily assessments across 14 days (N = 377). Multi-level vector autoregressive network models revealed associations between social contact, social desire, and affect across levels of analysis. Results were highly specific to the examined time scale. When measured at an hourly timescale, people desired more social contact than usual when they engaged in more in-person contact, and higher social desire predicted more future social contact in both experience sampling and smartphone sensing. In contrast, at a daily timescale, social desire did not predict future contact. Bidirectional linkages of affect and social contact were also much denser hourly (vs. daily). Compared with in-person contact, calls and communication app usage generally showed distinct associations with affect. We discuss theoretical implications for the dynamic regulation of social needs, especially regarding homeostatic temporal processes and the role of positive affect in predicting social contact. Finally, we delineate future directions of multi-method research into daily-life social dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Even as concepts like emotion and emotion regulation are emphasized as central to psychological health and functioning, the affective field remains rife with debates on how to conceptualize emotion and related constructs like affect or mood. In this paper, I identify two key features that pervade and characterize affective frameworks despite diversity in theories and disparate usage of terms: (a) the theoretical assumption of innate valence, i.e., an innate and universal neurophysiological capacity to distinguish good from bad that underlies hedonic tone and (b) a conceptual approach that involves grouping sets of multimodal responses into unitary emotion states, often believed to be hereditary patterns with aims corresponding to the situation or its appraisal. I interrogate the assumption of valence as an innate process and expose the pitfalls of grouping seemingly correlated responses into higher level emotion constructs. I suggest that affective concepts can obscure critical and more meaningful treatment targets in clinical settings. This can lead to neglect of physical health and poor treatment efficacy, overinterpretation of physiological changes, misdirection in decision making, and issues of social control and justice, with ultimately adverse social and clinical implications.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts. However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. This may be because researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our results suggest that findings from past studies should be interpreted with caution as they did not distinguish excellencism from perfectionistic standards.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

Building upon the work of Abraham Maslow, this article rejects the pyramid of needs as an ideologically rooted, sanitized, and stripped-down version of Maslow’s nascent Eupsychian Theory. Instead, the article proposes an Indigenous-rooted Circle of Seven Essential needs as the core of a sophisticated and integrative theory of human development, human potential, and human flourishing, a theory that Maslow was in the process of developing before his untimely death and that, given his known interest in Indigenous communities, more in line with the direction of Maslow’s early thinking.",

Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality—the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies reveal that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings further show that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

          "authors": "Nick Simonsen; Christopher R Madan",
          "abstract": "Making an informed decision often depends on observing sequential outcomes, which may be temporally spaced across a sequence of immediate decisions or decisions made over weeks or months. Making decisions based on multiple observed sequential outcomes is the cornerstone of optimal stopping theory. Here, we review and describe four optimal stopping problems: The Secretary Problem, The Burglar Problem, The Devil’s Task, and the Game of Pigs. We outline their respective optimal policies and draw comparisons between these problems. Simulations of the standard Secretary Problem highlight the generalizability of its optimal policy across several different set sizes and show that with larger set sizes, the optimal policy stabilizes. Conversely, simulating the Burglar Problem illustrates how the outcome of pseudo-optimal policies can be directly tied to assumptions of the choice environment. A brief discussion of the usefulness of optimal stopping policies in the real world is also outlined. Using sequential decision tasks with optimal policies may provide a better understanding of how people make decisions, deviate from optimality, and help inform how to make people more accurately engage in optimality.",

          "abstract": "Language learning appears to become more effortful and less efficient across the lifespan, but what explains this change remains unresolved. This study addressed this question by directly examining the learning processes. In two experiments, children and adults completed a linguistic (Syllable) implicit learning task and a nonlinguistic (Tone) control task. In both tasks, participants heard continuous auditory streams containing trisyllabic or three-tone “words”. Learning was measured via reaction time acceleration to predictable items and by neural responses to structured versus random streams within language regions identified via an independent story-listening task. Children showed faster learning than adults only in the linguistic learning task. fMRI revealed earlier and stronger learning-induced plasticity in children’s language network than adults. Greater neural sensitivity was further associated with faster linguistic learning in children, but not in adults. These findings suggest that children’s developing language network is especially well suited to efficiently acquire new linguistic inputs.",

          "abstract": "Visual content (e.g., graphs) can serve as potent misinformation. Across two experiments (total N = 478), we examined how misleading graphs affect belief in false claims, and whether these impacts can be reduced by an inoculation—a pre-emptive intervention that explained misleading data-visualisation techniques. Participants received the inoculation or no intervention, then rated their belief in accurate and misleading headlines, half of which were accompanied by a supporting graph. Graphs consistently boosted belief in misleading headlines but had inconsistent effects on accurate headlines. An inoculation focusing on multiple misleading visualisation techniques was ineffective at reducing the impact of misleading graphs, instead inducing general scepticism. A single-technique inoculation focusing on dual axes reduced the influence of misleading graphs using that technique; this benefit did not, however, transfer to graphs using cherry-picking. Findings demonstrate that graphs can boost false beliefs and suggest that a specific technique-focused inoculation can reduce this impact.",

          "abstract": "This chapter demonstrates how computational social science (CSS) tools are extending and expanding research on aging. The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research.",

          "abstract": "Rising political violence and affective polarization pose a pressing threat to democratic stability, challenging classic theories of state formation that emphasize the state’s monopoly on legitimate force. Reducing citizen support for violence against politicians is therefore crucial to safeguard democratic institutions. To examine how this can be addressed, we use two pre-registered survey experiments in France and Belgium that manipulate politician characteristics (gender, age, and party) and violence’s severity. We find that extreme violent attitudes remain rare, although support for verbal abuse online is substantial. Importantly, our results reveal that such attitudes are  largely unrelated to affective polarization. We then show that simple interventions (humanizing politicians through perspective-taking or stressing the importance of ideological pluralism for democracy) reduce support for political violence. These findings suggest that protecting institutions requires addressing underlying societal predispositions by promoting empathy and reinforcing norms of political tolerance.",

          "authors": "Clay Williams",
          "abstract": "This study extends the precarious sexuality framework to examine how observers categorize bisexual individuals who engage in exclusively same-sex or different-sex sexual behaviors. While prior research demonstrates that men's heterosexuality is easily reclassified when engaging in same-sex behavior, less is known about how bisexual identities are perceived when behavioral patterns appear monosexual. Furthermore, this study examines whether mediated contact with bisexual characters moderates categorization effects, whereas interpersonal contact has proven inconsistent. Through a 2 (character gender: male, female) x 2 (sexual behavior: same-sex, different-sex) factorial experimental design, participants read narratives about target characters’ identifying as bisexual but engaging in unidirectional sexual behaviors. Participants rated their confidence in the characters’ future sexual identity. Results show that bisexuality operates as a precarious identity within the LGB community itself, subject to reclassification tendencies to recategorize sexual identities into the binary. Notably, mediated exposure to bisexual characters moderated these categorization effects, though primarily for same-sex behaviors, suggesting that contemporary media representation may cultivate associations between bisexuality and gay-adjacent identities rather than genuinely disrupting binary thinking. These findings illuminate how status hierarchies operate within sexual minority communities and reveal both the potential and limitations of visibility-based media representation in challenging the categorization of non-monosexual identities.",

          "authors": "Tabea Lüders",
          "abstract": "As original method of communication sciences, quantitative and qualitative content analyses are widespread not only in numbers, but also their thematical scopes. Accordingly, this methodological approach receives high popularity within the science of science communication community when it comes to investigating media coverage on scientific or technological topics. Yet, scholars criticise that there are only marginal accumulations of knowledge about this kind of coverage which they trace back to loose or missing links to theory of many empirical examinations in this area. By focussing on the concept of (public) discourse whose terminology is nearly equally widespread within the field as potential theoretical framework, this study investigated a sample of 379 scientific studies using content or discourse analytical approaches. Asking whether and how they are embedded within broader discourse theories and on what coverage they are concretely focussed on as well as examining the interconnectedness of the research area through common references and journals, the systematic review showed that content analytical studies on technoscientific media discourses are not only thematically scattered with analysed coverage ranging from environmental crises to novel technologies and health advice, but also highly heterogeneous in terms of publishing journals and shared references. This might be related to a mostly implicit and therefore vague inclusion of (some kind of) discourse concept by uncritically using the term synonymous to media coverage in many of the reviewed publications. In summary, this study critically exemplifies what happens when the links between theory and empirical research are questionable in large parts of a research area but also establishes the concept of technoscientific media discourse as promising starting point to meet this problem.",

          "abstract": "Methodological innovations are needed to examine behavioral patterns of engagement with digital platforms which would contribute to understanding how increasing social media use—particularly among adolescents—may relate to mental health. Emerging work suggests that patterns of variability may significantly capture behavioral signatures linked to health above and beyond the average time spent online. Importantly,  although passive tracking now enables detailed measurement of digital media use, including variability, most research has focused on mean-level metrics such as screen time. Thus, we hereby review the literature measuring digital media use variability (DMUV) using objective data by  (1) proposing a new theoretical framework, (2) mapping existing dimensions, and (3) summarizing links with behavioral and health outcomes. Our DMUV model includes five dimensions: dispersion, routineness, fragmentation, inertia, and unpredictability. Studies have linked these dimensions to behavioral outcomes such as overuse, habitual use, intentional use, and task delay, as well as to mental health outcomes including depression and schizophrenia. We discuss current evidence, its limitations and future directions, underscoring the need for theory-driven approaches to conceptualize and test DMUV as a construct of interest in the complex relationship between digital media and health.",

          "abstract": "Modern human uniqueness has been defined by a reliance on social learning and hierarchical cooperation networks that result in cumulative cultural evolution. There is archaeological evidence that such social organization emerged through innovations that facilitated exploitation of resources that naturally occur in dense and predictable patches, leading to social regionalization and potentially territorial behavior. However, another way humans can access high-density patches is through transformation of the environment via niche construction. Here, we use an agent-based model to investigate how low-cost niche construction behaviors - those that can be applied without intensifying into dependence on food production - can transform resource distributions over time. We then examine the resulting impact of this on human mobility and social organization. In all scenarios where the cost of disturbance is low, we see positive selection for disturbance behaviors, leading to creation of a locally heterogeneous resource landscape. This results in increased carrying capacity, higher population densities, reduced mobility, and smaller social networks - all factors implicated in the eventual transition to food production. We demonstrate that foragers using even low-cost niche constructing behaviors can produce legacy landscapes with resource distributions that support more local social interactions even without socially imposed boundaries or territory defense of dense and predictable resources.",

          "authors": "Jacqueline Kroh; Monja Schmitt; Lena Nusser",
          "abstract": "Social belonging, defined as temporally stable \"frequent, affectively pleasant interactions with a few other people\" (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995, p. 497), is a fundamental human need and a crucial determinant of well-being. Despite its importance, gaps persist in our understanding of how social belonging to peers develops during adolescence and the extent of which social inequalities matter during this crucial life stage. This study addresses these gaps by investigating the development of social belonging to peers between the ages of 12 and 16, utilizing data from the kindergarten cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study. We employ fixed- and random-effects regression models to examine how students’ sense of social belonging changes as they grow older and how these developmental patterns differ by individual characteristics, i.e., gender, cultural and socioeconomic background, and academic achievement. Our findings reveal a slight decrease in social belonging between the ages of 12 and 16. Females report higher social belonging, although their decline over time is more pronounced than that of males. Students with a non-European cultural background do not show significantly higher belonging and differential growth trajectories compared to German native students. Adolescents from higher socioeconomic backgrounds start with slightly lower belonging at age 12 but experience a gentler decline than their less advantaged peers. No differences emerge by academic achievement levels. We conclude that social inequalities in perceived levels of social belonging with peers persist throughout the earlier life stages, with some developing before adolescence.",

          "authors": "Jungmin Han",
          "abstract": "What domestic political benefits do leaders derive from successful peace initiatives with a foreign adversary? Existing research emphasizes how adversary cooperation softens enemy images and increases public support for reconciliation, but pays less attention to how such concessions operate as political assets domestically. This paper examines how partisan polarization conditions the domestic political returns to adversary cooperation for incumbent leaders. I argue that polarization intensifies partisan interpretations of diplomatic outcomes by converting foreign concessions into signals of incumbent party's competence. When a leader secures reciprocal cooperation, ruling-party supporters are likely to interpret the outcome as a partisan achievement, increasing their support for rapprochement. Cross-partisans may also shift toward support as the incumbent’s diplomatic success undermines confidence in their own party’s competence. I test these expectations using an original survey experiment centered on U.S.–DPRK rapprochement during the first Trump administration. The results indicate that polarization priming amplifies Republican support for reconciliation by strengthening perceptions of partisan competence, while Democrats exhibit a modest increase in support, accompanied by declining confidence in their party’s competence. Overall, the findings demonstrate that domestic political conflict fundamentally shapes whether and how foreign signals are translated into domestic political assets or liabilities within partisan competition.",

          "authors": "Denis Machanda; Jenjira Yahirun; Stephen Demuth; Fatemeh Hassanzadeh; Adrienne Bostelman",
          "abstract": "Research has consistently shown a mental health advantage for immigrant youth compared to U.S.-born youth, despite often facing disadvantages associated with lower socioeconomic status. This mental health advantage, termed the “immigrant paradox,” appears to attenuate with acculturation. However, little research has explored whether gender moderates this relationship during adolescence. Using Wave I data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), the current study tests if the association between immigrant generation and depression differs by gender. Building on this framework, the study estimates a series of age and parental education adjusted, survey weighted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models including family cohesion as a protective mechanism and perceived discrimination as a risk mechanism. Across models the pattern is clear: there is a gendered immigrant paradox: immigrant-origin girls have significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms than do native-born girls and gender differences among immigrant youth are negligible. Generational contrasts show that the advantage is largest among first-generation adolescents and dissipates across generations. Accounting for cohesion and discrimination partly, but not fully, attenuates the immigrant female advantage suggesting that cultural, social and gendered processes are fundamental to understanding the well-being and assimilation of adolescents in the United States.\n\nKey Words: Immigrant paradox, gender, adolescent mental health, assimilation",

          "abstract": "Objective: The study examines changes across cohorts in terms of the timing and frequency of the full spectrum of reproductive events and explores whether these reproductive trajectories reflect broader trends towards the destandardisation of family formation. Furthermore, the study assesses the quality and limitations of Czech health registry data by comparing them with official vital statistics.\nBackground: Analysing fertility alone is insufficient with respect to understanding individual reproductive trajectories since reproductive experiences are interconnected across the lifespan and may be influenced by other reproductive events that affect both the tempo and the quantum – especially within the context of fertility postponement.\nMethod: This study employs individual data obtained from the Czech National Health Information System (NHIS) that enable the holistic analysis of reproductive trajectories including live births, induced abortions, in vitro fertilisation, miscarriages and stillbirths across selected cohorts of women (1976–1991).\nResults: The younger cohorts experienced delayed and less frequent reproductive events. However, the lower incidence of adverse events partly reflected fewer conceptions due to the postponement of reproduction to older ages. The most common combination of event types involved live births with induced abortions or miscarriages. Reproductive trajectories were found to diversify with age but exhibited limited variation across the cohorts, and an early live birth remained linked to higher completed fertility. The NHIS data were largely in line with the vital statistics, with the moderate underestimation of live births and the under-reporting of early miscarriages and induced abortions.\nConclusion: The findings highlight the potential and limitations of health registry data in terms of capturing the full spectrum of reproductive events. Forming a deeper understanding of women’s reproductive trajectories and experiences, enabled via the use of linked health register data, is essential in terms of developing policies on reproductive health and rights in the context of declining fertility levels and the postponement of childbearing to later ages.",

          "abstract": "The choice between marriage or cohabitation is shown to be associated with many demographic and socioeconomic factors, as well as personal relationship assessments and mental health. However, the role of individual differences linked to genetic factors has attracted less attention. This study uses genetically informed data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) to investigate whether polygenic scores related to educational attainment, fertility, personality traits, and mental health are associated with union type at first birth, as well as the subsequent transition to marriage. Our results indicate that genetic factors influence parental union type choices through educational attainment, reproductive outcomes, and positive and negative emotionality. For union type at first birth, polygenic scores for educational attainment and postponement of reproductive activity have the strongest associations. For the subsequent transition to marriage, associations with polygenic scores for subjective wellbeing and educational attainment are most salient. However, there is also some indication that polygenic scores for negative emotionality are negatively associated with marriage among men. These findings give insights into potential selection processes and the chain of intermediate phenotypes through which genetic factors influence couples’ choice of union type.",

          "abstract": "Gender revolution theory posits that, in contexts with high female labor participation, couples sharing domestic work equally will (desire to) have more children. However, empirical findings at the micro level have been mixed. We propose three reasons why prior research has been inconclusive: (1) a tendency to treat gender attitudes or practices as a single continuum, rather than multidimensionally; (2) insufficient attention to partner’s shared attitudes; and (3) empirical approaches that conflate timing and quantum. We propose a refined approach that considers how shared gender egalitarian attitudes toward work divisions, female careers, and child-welfare are differentially related to the quantum versus timing of fertility. Using cure models and data from Germany, we show that couples’ shared gender egalitarian attitudes regarding domestic work, career support, and child welfare have distinct relationships with the occurrence and timing of first births. We find no evidence of higher probability of first births among couples who shared egalitarian attitudes regarding domestic work, career support, child welfare, or all three domains. However, egalitarian couples regarding domestic work and career support have later first births. Our results underscore the importance of (1) differentiated measurements of gender attitudes, and (2) considering quantum and timing as affected separately.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing research on the youth crime decline, there has been limited analysis of how these trends have influenced offending in cohorts born after the mid-1990s. This study aimed to examine changes in offending trajectories among Australian adolescents with a proven offence aged 10 to 16 years across 12 consecutive birth cohorts (1995 to 2006), in Queensland, Australia. Findings indicate that the number of adolescents with a proven offence decreased by 44% from the oldest to the youngest cohort. However, within recent birth cohorts of justice-involved adolescents, there have been significant increases in high frequency and violent offending. Additionally, despite declines in offending participation, First Nations adolescents have become more over-represented in the youth justice system, due to steeper declines in offending participation for non-First Nations adolescents. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify offending trajectories across the birth cohorts. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that recent cohorts of justice-involved adolescents were significantly more likely to display moderate or chronic offending trajectories, compared to low-level offending. Findings suggest that while criminogenic risk has reduced across the majority of adolescents in recent birth cohorts, for a subset of adolescents it has also increased.

This study systematically examines the use of GAs in leading environmental health journals and develops a practical guideline to support GA design for researchers without a design background. We systematically screened articles from three high-impact environmental health journals and identified 23 exemplar GAs for in-depth analysis. These GAs were evaluated using five content criteria (inclusion of title, background, methods, results and conclusion) and four visual design criteria (visual signs, grid systems, typography and color). Most of the GAs we reviewed showed substantial room for improvement in both content and visual clarity. Many did not serve a clear communicative purpose and suffered from issues such as unclear or missing titles, ambiguous background information and weak or absent conclusions. Visual problems—particularly related to typography and hierarchy—were also widespread. In contrast, the 23 exemplar GAs demonstrated how concise content, clear structure and coherent visual design can improve readability and better support knowledge translation. Based on these findings, we developed a simplified guideline focusing on two domains: (1) content clarity, by ensuring sufficient information from background to conclusion; and (2) visual clarity, by improving visual signs, grid integration, typography and color use. The resulting evidence-informed guideline can help researchers independently create clearer and more impactful GAs, ultimately strengthening knowledge translation and the broader impact of environmental health research.",

          "abstract": "While the Montgomery Bus Boycott is widely celebrated, its economic impact on Montgomery has been understudied. This paper provides one of the first quantitative analyses of the fiscal consequences of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Using archival data from the City of Montgomery and ARIMA based time series forecasting, the study estimates counterfactual revenue and expenditure paths to reexamine the boycott with two goals: (1) determining whether the boycott affected the city’s public finances, and (2) forecasting the probability that city revenues would have fallen below expenditures had existing trends continued. Results reveal that although the city-maintained surpluses throughout the forecasted period, the gap between revenues and expenditures narrowed steadily signaling growing fiscal strain. This economic pressure stemmed largely from the city's “get tough” response, which increased spending on police, fire, and public services. These findings reframe the boycott not only as a moral and legal turning point, but also as a form of economic resistance with measurable budgetary impact. The study contributes a new lens for understanding how grassroots movements can reshape public finance and municipal governance, suggesting that protest can be used as an economic tool to effect political change.",

          "abstract": "Candidates for political office frequently face online incivility and abuse. Research consistently finds that incivility and abuse can hinder the full political participation for women, and especially racialized women. However, there are competing theories and contradictory findings about precisely how gender and race shape online incivility. Much research focuses on how gender and race affect the volume of uncivil messages. This chapter extends that work to highlight other crucial dimensions of online incivility. We propose a framework to encompass all relevant characteristics of online incivility, which include: (1) frequency of incivility, (2) qualitative forms, (3) targeting and distribution, and (4) interaction with offline discrimination and threats. This emerged from an analysis of 969,308 tweets from the 2019 Canadian election and in-depth interviews with 31 candidates and campaign staff. We show that while candidates’ gender and race do not necessarily predict the volume of online incivility, women and racialized candidates do face more misogynist and racialized incivility. We also find some misogynist and racist content is directed at prominent male and/or white candidates’ accounts in apparent efforts to disseminate these discourses more broadly. Finally, given the realities of online abuse in Canada, this chapter suggests how to better support candidates and politicians.",

          "authors": "Martin Lakomý; Tianqi Zhou; Merril Silverstein",
          "abstract": "We investigated whether grandparents who hold stronger individualistic values, relative to collectivistic values, provide less instrumental and emotional support to their grandchildren and whether this association has changed over the last 30 years. While the significance of individual values in family dynamics is widely acknowledged, the connection between values and grandparenting remains underexplored. Based on Beck’s individualization theory, we expect an inverse relationship between grandparents’ supportive behavior and individualistic (vs. collectivistic) values, reflecting a preference for achieving individual over collective goals. We expect this relationship to strengthen over time with the growth of personal autonomy in how the grandparent role is enacted. We used data from seven waves of the Longitudinal Study of Generations between 1991 and 2021 to examine 3465 observations deriving from 1309 grandparents whose youngest grandchild was 16 years of age or younger. Multilevel random-intercept models estimated associations over 30 years. Findings revealed that stronger individualistic values were associated with providing less instrumental support to grandchildren, while associations with emotional support were not evident. Tests of interactions demonstrated that the negative association between individualistic values and instrumental support became stronger over historical time. Findings demonstrate that grandparental support has increased over time and that its instrumental aspect is connected to collectivistic values. We conclude that behavioral aspects of grandparenting are connected to individualistic/collectivistic values on the continuum between self-interest and altruism, and that contemporary grandparents have greater discretion in how they perform the grandparent role in accordance with their personal preferences.",

It sheds light on the big picture, deep patterns, historical trends, and causal dynamics, while paying attention to important details. It shows, among other findings, that the core element of Vietnamese statecraft has changed as the global configuration of power was transformed. More specifically, the key to success for anyone who ruled Vietnam changed from the ability to leverage the frontier of an empire (1st millennium BCE to the 15th century) to the skill in navigating the politics between great powers (16th century to the present).",

          "abstract": "In recent years, an increasing number of rebel groups have organized elections amid ongoing armed conflicts. Existing research has largely emphasized internal drivers of this phenomenon, such as governance capacity and organizational strength. This paper shifts the focus to international dynamics, showing that foreign sponsorship—particularly from democracies—plays a critical role in shaping rebel electoral behavior. We argue that support from democratic states increases the likelihood that rebel groups hold elections by amplifying their legitimacy gains while mitigating the costs of electoral competition. Our analysis of cross-sectional time-series data, combined with a case study, demonstrates that democratic sponsorship significantly increases the likelihood of rebel elections compared to both rebels without foreign support and those backed by autocratic states. These findings highlight the role of foreign sponsorship in fostering electoral institutions in wartime and contribute to broader debates on external influence in rebel governance.",

          "authors": "Derek Tharp",
          "abstract": "Nearly one-fourth of Americans claim Social Security at age 62, while only one-in-ten wait until age 70—a pattern that has long puzzled economists who argue delay is financially optimal. This paper develops a series of dynamic programming models to examine whether early claiming reflects mistakes or rational responses to preferences overlooked in standard analyses. Three behavioral factors are incorporated: a claim-retire linkage (a preference to claim benefits at retirement rather than managing a separate \"bridge\" period); front-loaded consumption preferences (a desire to spend more in the early, active years of retirement); and source-dependent utility (greater comfort spending from regular income like Social Security than drawing down a retirement portfolio). Using Epstein–Zin recursive utility with stochastic investment returns, medical expenditure shocks, mortality risk, policy risk, and bequest motives, results show that incorporating these empirically documented factors substantially lowers optimal claiming ages. Under the full behavioral specification, claiming at 62 is optimal for households with up to $800,000 in initial wealth—a wealth level that encompasses the vast majority of Americans approaching retirement. Results are qualitatively robust to alternative assumptions about mortality, bequest strength, tax treatment, and spousal or survivor benefits. These findings suggest that widespread early claiming may reflect genuine preferences rather than financial mistakes, though individual circumstances—including wealth, employment status, tax situation, and personal preferences—may provide incentives toward delay. Rather than uniformly prescribing delay, advisors should assess clients' goals, circumstances, and preferences and tailor recommendations accordingly.",

          "abstract": "Inequality measures based on household surveys may be biased because they fail to capture the upper tail of the income distribution properly. The \"missing rich\" problem stems from sampling errors, item and unit nonresponse, underreporting of income, and data preprocessing techniques like top coding. This paper reviews salient approaches to address the underrepresentation of the rich in household surveys. Approaches are classified based on information sources and method. In terms of information sources, the distinction is between within-survey data and survey data combined with external sources (e.g., tax records). In terms of methods, we identify three categories: replacing, reweighting, and combined reweighting and replacing. We show that income inequality levels and trends are sensitive to the correction approach.

          "abstract": "Amid escalating ethical concerns over the viral spread of deepfakes, existing literature suggests that their sensory richness and enhanced realism evoke complex, sometimes contradictory, audience reactions. This study examines the persuasive potential of deepfakes by comparing audience responses to identical resurrection narratives presented in deepfake video format versus text format. Participants (N = 813, Mage = 37.28, SDage = 12.46) were exposed to either a deepfake video or a text-based narrative featuring a historical scientist (Albert Einstein or Marie Curie) recounting their life story and then completed scales measuring variables related to narrative persuasion. Contrary to prevailing assumptions of audiovisual superiority, the results revealed that text narratives elicited significantly greater transportation than deepfake videos. Structural equation modeling showed that this effect extended to downstream persuasion outcomes, including perceived realism, message credibility and evaluation, character identification, enjoyment, and sharing intention. Significant indirect effects of modality emerged across all persuasion variables. Multigroup analysis demonstrated partial scalar invariance, with Einstein eliciting stronger identification and enjoyment than Curie. These findings suggest that deepfake resurrection narratives engage distinct psychological mechanisms that may disrupt the persuasive advantages typically attributed to visual imagery and to deepfakes in particular.",

          "abstract": "Producing useful evidence syntheses requires clearly formulated research questions linked to an understanding of their optimal scope. When policymakers (or other end users) commission or steer the production of systematic reviews to support policy development, these parameters are rarely specified sufficiently for production to proceed. Instead, these details are typically developed via a collaborative dialogic process involving evidence producers and users to ensure the proposed synthesis will meet users’ needs. This process is informed by scoping and (more-or-less formally) mapping the existing evidence base, which can take many weeks or months, slowed by applying mostly manual processes to identify and characterise the evidence. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have opened up new and possibly transformative opportunities for far more rapid, iterative, and responsive mapping of relevant evidence to support such early-stage evidence-to-policy dialogues and processes. In this article, we outline and characterise this approach, termed dialogic rapidly expedited evidence maps (DREEMs). We also present two illustrative case studies drawn from first-hand experiences within a programme of evidence reviews production to inform policy in England.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies have abundantly documented the effect of parents’ educational attainment on their children’s academic outcomes, but research on the impact of parents’ educational mating pattern remains limited. In this study, we investigate whether women have an educational advantage when raised in hypogamous (the mother is more educated than the father) rather than hypergamous families (the father is the more educated parent), whether men experience a similar advantage when raised in hypergamous rather than hypogamous families, and whether these advantages vary with the prevalence of hypogamous families relative to hypergamous ones. We use data from four waves of the European Union Statistics and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey, yielding a sample of 50,746 individuals residing in 28 European countries and born between 1956 and 1995. Our results show that women benefit from being raised in hypogamous families, a positive effect on their educational attainment that did not diminish as hypogamy became more prevalent relative to hypergamy. Men from hypergamous families experience a similar advantage, but this effect waned as hypergamy declined relative to hypogamy. Beyond contributing to research on the influence of parental mating pattern on children’s outcomes, our findings have relevant implications for research on the gender gap in education.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores how cross-border mobility is governed at the legal and institutional \nmargins of West African states. These borderlands lie at the intersection of overlapping regulatory \nregimes and normative orders, including national migration law, ECOWAS free movement protocols, \nand local mobility norms. Departing from conventional approaches that focus on formal state \ninstitutions and migration policy, the paper adopts the lens of legal borderlands to examine how \nmobility is shaped by plural, informal, and often contradictory governance practices in legal spaces \nlocated at the edge of state authority. West African borderlands have been described as lawless areas \nor legal grey zones where movement is structured primarily through social networks. Yet these \nborderlands are far from legal voids. Rather, they are legally saturated environments where \ngovernance is enacted through the everyday practices of immigration officers, traders, brokers, \nsmugglers, and travellers. Law and regulations are, in these contexts, not simply imposed from above, \nbut negotiated, adapted, and contested through local interactions that both reinforce and undermine \nformal governance frameworks. Based on ethnographic research, including interviews, focus groups, \nobservations, and informal interactions, conducted between October 2024 and October 2025 in Accra, \nthe capital of Ghana, and in the border towns of Elubo (Ghana-Côte d’Ivoire) and Aflao (Ghana?Togo), the paper unpacks the complexity of legality and illegality in cross-border mobility \ngovernance in West African borderlands. By advancing the concept of legal borderlands, the paper \nunpacks situated practices of everyday migration governance and shows how cross-border mobility \nin West African borderlands is co-produced through everyday interactions in legally plural and \ninstitutionally fragmented spaces at the margins of the state.",

Building on referendum instrumentalization studies as well as cognate literatures, an analytical framework identifies five potential strategic factors that might explain why parties participate in referendum campaigns and formulates corresponding hypotheses regarding their effect. The framework is applied to 33 recent Swiss referendums, using social media and newspaper advertisements as a proxy for party participation. Binomial logistic regression reveals that public attention for a referendum, its issue’s salience to a party, and (to a lesser extent) a party’s initiator status significantly favor the likelihood of campaign participation, suggesting that Swiss parties primarily leverage referendum campaigns for policy-seeking and image-building strategies. This study therefore contributes to understanding of the interplay between referendums and party strategies in contemporary political contexts, and allows for the expansion of instrumentalization perspectives to include non-initiating parties.",

Drawing from media and communication theory, it situates vaccine hesitancy within broader crises of trust, populist politics, and mediatized risk communication. The chapter argues that while mainstream media can enhance public understanding and counter misinformation, they are equally capable of amplifying fear and politicization. Using qualitative data from news texts, journalist interviews, and audience focus groups, the discussion shows how news values, moralization, and political rivalry transformed a scientific issue into a public scandal.

First, as motivation, we show that homeowners in already-dense areas largely support dense development in their neighborhoods, contrary to prevailing theoretical predictions, and that their distinctive aesthetic tastes likely contribute. Second, our evidence suggests that many voters oppose development due to sociotropic aesthetic concerns: for example, most voters think dense development doesn't aesthetically ``fit'' in less-dense areas, even other than their own; likewise, people in dense areas are more supportive of dense development on their own block than in low-density neighborhoods. Finally, descriptively and with experiments, we show that aesthetic concerns are widespread, not pretextual, and causally affect support for development. Our findings offer a new lens for understanding housing policy preferences and suggest novel solutions for addressing America's housing shortage.",

          "authors": "Hongyang Liu",
          "abstract": "In everyday conversations, classrooms, workplaces, and online platforms, people often respond to accurate corrections with interpersonal coldness, distrust, or even punishment of the corrector. This review synthesizes dispersed evidence and theory to propose the Correctness Aversion Effect (CAE): a person-directed backlash that emerges when (a) a corrective message is relatively correct and hard to dismiss (high epistemic constraint), (b) that correctness is appraised as threatening to self, face, status, autonomy, or identity, and (c) negative responses are directed at the corrector rather than merely the message content. Moving beyond the correction literature’s dominant focus on belief updating and misinformation reduction, CAE highlights a layered outcome signature in which person evaluation and sanctioning can deteriorate even when epistemic accuracy improves or remains unchanged. We clarify CAE’s construct boundaries relative to shooting-the-messenger effects, backfire/correction resistance, psychological reactance, face-threatening acts, and the intergroup sensitivity effect, and we integrate these lines into a convergent process model: correction episodes (e.g., public exposure, status asymmetry, blunt tone, identity-laden domains) evoke multidimensional threat appraisals that recruit coordinated affective pathways (shame/embarrassment and envy escalating into defensive anger and resentment) and cognitive coping (motive derogation, moralization, source delegitimization, and “pulling-down” reframes), producing interpersonal avoidance, exclusion, and punitive intentions. Social comparison is specified as a key moderator (e.g., comparison orientation, rank concern) that amplifies rank-relevant encoding of being corrected. Finally, we provide an operational blueprint for future research—manipulations, mediator batteries, and layered dependent measures—designed to render CAE falsifiable and to support cumulative multi-study programs and intervention testing.",

          "authors": "Benedict King",
          "abstract": "Bayesian phylogenetics has become a standard tool in historical linguistics, and for the most part implements models borrowed from evolutionary biology. Not enough work has been done to validate the analysis set-up that has become standardised in phylolinguistics, which consists of binary data with ascertainment bias,  data partitions with correlated site number and rate, the binary covarion substitution model, and the uncorrelated lognormal branch rate model. Here I perform a set of simulation-based calibration studies to test a typical phylolinguistic analysis in the software BEAST2. Although the analysis can correctly recover the parameters of the substitution model, complications arise due to the combination of ascertainment bias and partitions of unequal length and rate. Reweighting the partition-specific rates by the number of sites, as is the default behaviour, leads to poorly calibrated posteriors. An alternative approach, where each meaning is assumed to come from an alignment of equal length, behaves correctly in simulations and is found to fit better to empirical data. I also assess the adequacy of the covarion substitution model through posterior predictive simulations. The covarion is found to fall short of approximating the true process of lexical evolution, likely due to the prevalence of semantic shift and the non-independence of cognate substitutions in real data. This work highlights the importance of thorough testing of models and their implementation in phylolinguistics, as well as the need for further research on improving models of lexical evolution.",

This paper introduces a neurodiversity-native theory of management that redefines cognitive variance not as a challenge to be accommodated, but as a core system property to be architected for. We argue that \"inclusion\" frameworks, while well-intentioned, function as retrofits to inherently exclusionary systems and fail to unlock the full potential of heterogeneous cognition. Drawing on interdisciplinary research across cognitive science, organizational theory, and critical disability studies, we propose a paradigm shift: Neuromanagement by Default (NbD). This model replaces compliance-driven accommodation with participatory design principles, modular work systems, and leadership practices grounded in cognitive pluralism. We synthesize emerging evidence that shows how reimagining work environments to center neurodivergence fosters innovation, resilience, and collective intelligence. Rather than assimilating difference into dominant norms, NbD designs for difference from the outset. The paper concludes with a call to reengineer the epistemology of management itself, treating neurodiversity not as a demographic feature, but as the infrastructure of organizational adaptability in a complex world.",

          "abstract": "This pilot study addresses the current lack of systematic, large-scale evidence on Open Science Practices (OSPs) adoption in criminology and legal psychology. A scalable, machine-learning-based text classification pipeline is introduced to map the prevalence of Open Access (OA), Open Data (OD), Open Materials (OM), and Preregistration (PR). The analysis is based on publication metadata and a year-stratified sample of full texts from the top 100 journals in Criminology &amp; Penology, Law, and Psychology (2013-2023). After identifying articles containing statistical inference (SI) via a high-performing classifier, the author utilized GPT-assisted coding and supervised learning to train specific classifiers for OD, OM, and PR. OA was classified using publicly available metadata. Among 1,763 SI articles with usable full text, design-based estimates reveal a significant disparity in OSP adoption. OA is relatively common (40.9%, 95% CI: 38.8-43.1) and has steadily increased from approximately 20% in 2013 to 50% in 2023. By sharp contrast, trends for OD, OM, and PR cannot be reliably quantified. Extreme class imbalance and the minimal number of positive cases indicate a very low underlying true prevalence for these practices in the assessed field. Methodologically, the study confirms that GPT-assisted coding supports accurate SI detection, but robust prevalence estimation for extremely low-frequency OSPs remains challenging for downstream classifiers. Overall, this project establishes a transparent and reproducible pipeline and provides critical baseline estimates for future, larger-scale assessments of research transparency in crime-related fields.",

However, systematic data to study longitudinal dynamics of issue-based affective polarization, in addition to partisan divides, remains scarce, especially in the context of multi-party systems. To address this, we introduce the Berlin Polarization Monitor, a 15-wave panel survey running from 2025 to 2027 on partisan and issue-based polarization, emotions, political behavior, personality traits, and well-being in Germany. It covers a wide range of issue-related polarization, including asylum policy, climate change, cordon sanitaire, as well as multiple dimensions of economic and social policy. Feeling thermometers for partisan- and issue-based groups are complemented by precise measures of discrete emotions. This enables the validation of thermometer scores, as well as the study of the emotional foundations of political conflicts and a wide range of related outcomes, including collective action, trust, and coping strategies. Its longitudinal design allows examining within-person changes in polarization and the effects of politically salient events such as elections and crises. The study period includes the 2025 federal election and several regional elections. Overall, the Berlin Polarization Monitor provides a innovative research infrastructure borne out of interdisciplinary collaboration, with particular relevance for political science, psychology, and sociology.",

          "authors": "Camilo Cristancho",
          "abstract": "The protest paradigm has been a central concept in research on media and social movements, documenting systematic patterns of protest marginalization through emphasis on violence, disruption, and official authority. Yet existing studies vary in how they operationalize the paradigm, raising a critical empirical question: do measures designed to capture media attention, the selection and salience of textual elements, converge with measures designed to capture framing, the interpretive structures that construct meaning? This study disentangles these dimensions by comparing two computational approaches: (1) document-level frame identification using a generative large language model (LLM), producing both content and framing scores, and (2) a sentence-level classifier to identify the same categories and aggregated via article structure and attention metrics into a weighted composite measure at the document level. Using news wire data from Latin America and Southern Europe (2000–2025), we examine nine protest-paradigm categories. Results reveal strong convergence for lexically concrete, recurrent frames (e.g., Violence, Law and Order, Decay of Morals) and weak or inconsistent alignment for interpretive or context-dependent frames (e.g., Troublemakers, Nuisance, Righteous Struggle). These findings highlight systematic methodological differences: LLMs capture implicit, cross-sentence framing, while sentence-level classifiers can validate only structurally explicit frames. The study underscores the importance of transparent aggregation procedures and human validation, and demonstrates that conclusions about protest coverage, media bias, and framing are contingent on the operationalization employed. By clarifying the boundary between attention and framing, this research contributes both to computational media analysis and to the conceptual refinement of the protest paradigm.",

          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage-point higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed theirs in early 2023. We assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension claiming using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. Those who had the opportunity to benefit from the extraordinary index adjustment were approximately 8 percentage points more likely to claim the partial old-age pension in the first month of eligibility, with a relative effect as high as 79%. The effect arises because individuals advance their pension claims in response to the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

Existing research focuses on how contemporary political context moderates the effects of repression; I emphasize factors that predated the repressive regime. I argue that prior socio-economic development shapes the legacies of political violence. In more developed areas, repression is harder to justify and more likely to provoke enduring backlash. Where development was limited, however, the promise of modernization may temper resentment. I explore two mechanisms – temporal comparisons and the role of education – and test the argument using novel census, archival, and survey data from Moldova. Combining historical records with contemporary public opinion surveys, I show that the relationship between Soviet-era repression and attitudes toward Moldova’s communist successor party varies systematically with prior development. These findings contribute to research on political violence by highlighting the importance of preexisting conditions in shaping long-term public responses to repression.",

          "abstract": "As the global economy transitions toward decarbonization, the aluminium sector has become a focal point for strategic resource management. While policies such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aim to reduce emissions, they have inadvertently widened the price arbitrage between primary metal, scrap, and semi-finished goods, creating new incentives for market optimization. This study presents a unified, unsupervised machine learning framework to detect and classify emerging trade anomalies within UN Comtrade data (2020–2024). Moving beyond traditional rule-based monitoring, we apply a four-layer analytical pipeline utilizing Forensic Statistics, Isolation Forests, Network Science, and Deep Autoencoders. Contrary to the hypothesis that Sustainability Arbitrage would be the primary driver, empirical results reveal a contradictory and more severe phenomenon of Hardware Masking. Illicit actors exploit bi-directional tariff incentives by misclassifying scrap as high-count heterogeneous goods to justify extreme unit-price outliers of &gt;$160/kg, a 1,900% markup indicative of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) rather than commercial arbitrage. Topologically, risk is not concentrated in major exporters but in high-centrality Shadow Hubs that function as pivotal nodes for illicit rerouting. These actors execute a strategy of Void-Shoring, systematically suppressing destination data to Unspecified Code to fracture mirror statistics and sever forensic trails. Validated by SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), the results confirm that price deviation is the dominant predictor of anomalies, necessitating a paradigm shift in customs enforcement from physical volume checks to dynamic, algorithmic valuation auditing.",

          "abstract": "Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) use population data from 35 countries where rural areas were flooded by dam and reservoir construction. They compare historical population counts prior to flooding with estimates from global gridded population datasets and report that gridded population data underestimate people in these areas by more than 50%. Based on this, they claim that gridded population data systematically undercount rural populations around the world and suggest that rural census data are also flawed. \nWe appreciate the authors’ interest in gridded population data accuracy but believe they misunderstood how these datasets are constructed and try to validate them by their performance in representing historical population changes around very local and rare flooding events, that are not representative for the quality of global, gridded population data measuring contemporary rural population distributions.\nGlobal, gridded population data rely on models that redistribute census-based population counts using geospatial data on water bodies and built-up areas, and other factors related to population presence and density. These models assume water bodies to be static over time and do not measure buildings that existed in the past but have since been dismantled, demolished, destroyed, or flooded. They are not designed to capture rare events like villages flooded by newly built water reservoirs. This is a known limitation, not a flaw, that has been clearly described by gridded population data producers. \nLáng-Ritter et al. (2025) measure effects of these limitations and exaggerate the scale of the problem. The total number of people displaced by dam construction in the analyzed data is small - less than 0.05% of the world’s population - yet they use relative error metrics that grossly inflate their results. They also avoid assessing if gridded population data overestimate post-flooding population in areas where the data on water bodies are out of date, which would invalidate their claim of “systematic underrepresentation”. Moreover, they confuse “missing data” with “misplaced data” - in many cases, the population is still represented in the gridded population data, just in slightly different locations. We estimate that population displacement due to reservoir construction causes such slight misplacements in global gridded population datasets affecting less than 2% of the global rural population, significantly lower than the claim by Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) of over 50% missing rural population globally. \nIn this response, members of the POPGRID data collaborative explain why the conclusions by Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) are incorrect and not supported by the data or methods used. Moreover, we call for awareness of the limitations and fitness for use of global gridded population data.",

          "abstract": "Communities around the world rely on networks of resource sharing to buffer households against hardship. Yet, under such informal insurance schemes, some needy families can be systematically left out. By modeling sharing and reputational spread on a network, we show how generosity can be sustained when reputational benefits spread across a community’s communication network, but also how network density and position shape who receives transfers---well-connected households become priority receivers due to their ability to spread givers' reputation more effectively. Our analysis, combining mathematical modeling with food sharing data from an Inuit community, reveals that communication network sparsity incentivizes broader sharing, but also more selectivity. The correlation of communication network structure and resource endowment is critical for stabilizing needs-based transfers. If need status does not perfectly (negatively) correlate with social influence, marginal households in need may still be excluded from sharing. By linking individual incentives to community-wide patterns, our framework clarifies when indirect reciprocity can stabilize outcomes that show the signatures of need-based transfers.",

We then use representative survey experiment data from 1,967 UK residents to examine how susceptible the electorate is to such ecofascist ideas and whether exposure to climate change threat makes them more susceptible. Findings indicate that approximately one-fifth of the UK population is susceptible to an ecofascist ideology rooted in Volk, Kampf and Lebensraum. A sense of climate despair and anomie stemming from climate change threats, combined with predispositions toward social dominance and authoritarianism, and a conflicted relationship with nature, increases susceptibility to ecofascism significantly. We conclude by emphasising that this susceptibility could be exploited by right-wing actors in the future and the necessity to develop progressive responses to climate change threat.",

Determining whether such connections were singular events or sustained episodes is therefore critical to illuminate the scale of early seafaring. Here, we model how patterns of sea-level change impacted land connectivity between Sicily and Malta and predict potential population sizes through time from the Last Glacial Maximum to evaluate whether Mesolithic hunter-gatherers could have persisted on Malta, or if sustained connections would have been required. To achieve this, we use reconstructions of sea-level change and modern bathymetric models to evaluate changes in land size areas and connectivity. We calculate Net Primary Productivity values for a high-resolution palaeoclimate dataset, which we translate to population density by comparisons to ethnographic datasets. Finally, we calculate changes in estimated population sizes through time for Malta and Sicily, as well as minimum distances of sea voyages. Our results show that following disconnection from Sicily, Malta would have been unsuitable to support a viable, persistent forager population, including for the minimum 1000-year timespan of the Maltese Mesolithic record. As a result, only repeated, long-distance sea voyaging can explain the longevity of Mesolithic occupations of Malta, opening up the possibility that other south-central Mediterranean islands were reached and explaining the presence of European hunter-gatherer ancestry in North Africa.",

          "abstract": "Advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the creation of ‘digital replicas’, have resulted in a significant increase in personal, ethical and legal concerns, leading to challenges in regulation and in public receptivity. This paper, arising from an interdisciplinary team, is the first to explore the legal challenges posed by digital replicas set within the broad context of sociological and linguistic perspectives. Owing to the prevalence of AI digital voice replicas in the creative industries, we use qualitative focus group data to focus on the legal implications and potential impact of AI digital voice replicas within this domain. To do this, we draw on the views of researchers, creatives and IP practitioners. Our focus group findings illustrated a range of responses to AI and voice cloning including skepticism, uncertainty, and a sense of inevitability. We find that the loss of what many refer to as the ‘authentic voice’ through cloning evokes an emotional response. The voice means a lot to people. As AI evolves, we posit that authenticity as a concept itself may need reconceptualising. Against this backdrop, we highlight the urgent need to address the legal vulnerability of the “un-fixed” voice, (a voice not permanently captured in traditional recordings), and the inadequacy of current United Kingdom (UK) Intellectual Property (IP) frameworks to protect it, we find that those lacking such status remain largely unprotected, highlighting a significant regulatory lacuna. This shortfall calls for a more robust protection of a ‘personality right’ in UK law.",

          "abstract": "Humans are uniquely capable of reaching consensus within large, hierarchically structured societies. Yet the pathways by which consensus emerges, especially under constraints imposed by social organization, remain poorly understood. We use agent-based modeling to explore how marriage structure, social group nesting, and decision-making norms can shape a group’s ability to reach consensus. In our model, simulated agents are embedded in multilevel social networks and possess noisy information. Decisions are spread via three different cascades using one of several interaction norms. We find that family formation via marriages, especially when clustered within kin units, impedes consensus by slowing the rate of information diffusion and elevating informational entropy. In contrast, increasing the size of nested subgroups in a multilevel network reduces category overlap and promotes consensus. Finally, decision-making norms that bypass early-stage clustering through the formation of coalitions or representative bodies lead to faster group decisions. These results offer insights into how consensus dynamics are shaped by social structure and provide a theoretical bridge between research on network topology, collective intelligence, and human social evolution.",

To answer this long-standing question, we develop a theoretical model of polities as territorial social networks that are functionally integrated by institutions.

We test the model's predictions using data from \"Seshat: Global Databank\" which describe hundreds of polities worldwide from across the Holocene. We find that intensity, territory, and complexity scale with population size as predicted.

Yet commonly used survey- and interview-based methods often fail to capture the fast, unconscious, and socially and contextually constructed nature of emotional experience. Drawing on the Theory of Constructed Emotion and Emotion as Feedback Theory, this study examines how guests respond emotionally to hotel messages that ask them to change their behaviour. We conducted a two-stage mixed methods study that combined digital lab measures (eye tracking, facial expression analysis, and galvanic skin response) with projective interviews. Seventy UK participants viewed three pairs of hotel messages encouraging water conservation, energy saving and recycling, and food-waste reduction, each varying in clarity and tone. Physiological data showed that participants attended closely to all messages but displayed little variation in emotional intensity, while projective interviews revealed how they reflected on and interpreted these emotional responses. Clear and empowering messages evoked warmth, pride, and trust, which strengthened behavioural intention. Constructed emotional resonance, rather than arousal intensity, drove pro-environmental intention.",

          "abstract": "The impact of social media influence on social learning, health behaviour, and population health is a new, rapidly developing field of research. Previous research focused specifically on online social influencers suggests they may be able to affect group-level diffusion of health-protective behaviours such that they modify epidemic outcomes. The impacts of social influence on behaviour and epidemics depend on whether the disease has a low enough basic reproduction number ($R_0$) that social dynamics have time to diffuse. However, formal models have yet to test the intuitive hypothesis that online social influence is sufficient to generate tangible, real-world effects on epidemics. We develop an agent-based model that incorporates social influencers into an epidemic scenario to test hypotheses about how the presence of competing influence messages affects the diffusion of health-protective behaviours throughout a population, and thereby alters the course and outcome of infectious disease epidemics. We find social influencers had a persistent, independent effect on peak infection intensity and total infection burden of the epidemic, with the greatest effects in highly homophilous scenarios. The presence of health-protective influence effectively flattened the epidemic curve despite equal presence of anti-protective influence.",

          "abstract": "Child neglect has historically been framed as a problem originating in the family. Recent efforts attempt to reframe neglect as a consequence of ecologically layered disadvantages or “overload.” However, it is unclear if this ecological focus is reflected in the research base backing neglect interventions. In this study we systematically reviewed articles describing interventions labeled as evidence-based and as targeting neglect, finding that few (11%; n = 5) addressed neglect as a distinct maltreatment type. Among these five articles, we documented the populations targeted by the interventions, along with the theoretical frameworks used. By identifying which participants researchers engaged and which contributing factors measured, we shed light on the underlying, often unnamed, theoretical models that currently inform evidence-based interventions. We highlight a stark divide between the recent framing of neglect as an outcome of ecological disadvantages and an evidence base for neglect interventions focused primarily on parental failures.\n\nKeywords: Evidence-based treatment, intervention research, content analysis, systematic review, neglect, ecological models",

Using data from a nonrepresentative sample of 248 Czech respondents aged 18-84, confirmatory and exploratory analyses, correlations and reliability testing were conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of both scales. The SAChA replicated the unidimensional structure and demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity. In contrast, the AVCS differed from the original three-factor model, showing a primarily single-factor solution, suggesting cultural variation in how attitudes toward childfreeness are conceptualized. Both scales correlated positively with hostile and benevolent sexism and negatively with interpersonal warmth toward childfree adults, supporting their convergent and discriminant validity. Gender, religiosity, marital status, higher age and income were associated with more negative attitudes. These results offer the first validated Czech-language instruments for studying attitudes toward childfreeness.",

But a key assumption for hypothesis testing via significance is not met: the data are not taken from a random sample.  When we consider the size of the effects revealed by their analysis (which consists of the latest techniques for analyzing panel data), a different and arguably more compelling interpretation is that adoption of right-to-work laws did lead to an increase in the rate of occupational fatalities, an increase even greater than was suggested in earlier research.",

          "abstract": "Models of democratic responsiveness imply that consistent US foreign policy is furthered by bipartisan agreement on core US strategy. A broad literature indicates, however, that politics does not stop ‘at water’s edge’, suggesting relevant differences between more ‘dovish’ Democrat-leaning and more ‘hawkish’ Republican-leaning voters. I revisit this question for the case of US support strategies aiding Ukraine against the Russian invasion in 2022. In particular, I investigate the extent of partisan differences in both overall agreement and the hard trade-offs between competing normative, strategic, and economic considerations connected to supporting Ukraine. Do Democrat and Republican-leaning voters deal with these trade-offs differently? I bring conjoint and vignette survey experimental evidence from 2,334 US citizens to this question. I show that absolute levels of support for Ukraine are lower among Republicans. However, irrespective of partisanship, citizens resolve the fundamental trade-offs involved in Ukraine policy similarly. Strategies that sustain Ukraine’s territorial integrity and political sovereignty, rather than concessions to Russia, are substantively more likely to be chosen, irrespective of partisanship, even if less strongly so among (moderate) US Republicans. Both Democrat and Republican voters show similarly high concern for the human costs of war, domestic economic costs, and escalation risk – with economic costs resonating more among Republicans. These results imply that for a case where both normative and strategic motivations for intervention loom large, public support is not structured as expected from ‘partisan types’. Tentatively, this indicates that differences in partisan preferences are no constraint for persisting US support to Ukraine.",

Using linked parent–child panel data from the BHPS and UKHLS (1995–2022), the study examines how class background and parental electoral participation during the formative years influence turnout from ages 18 to 40. Class-origin differences are largest at the start of adulthood but weaken, whereas exposure to parental voting has a stronger and more persistent influence on participation. The intergenerational transmission of participation is highly heterogeneous: differences by class origin persist only among those exposed to voting parents, while parental disengagement overrides between-class differences. Parental influence also varies by class contexts, remaining strongest among individuals from middle-class backgrounds. Class structures political socialization, but parents transmit, reinforce, or weaken class-linked norms, shaping the reproduction of inequality across generations.",

This article takes a different perspective, applying ideas from an ecological approach to culture to social media informational dynamics. It argues that success online depends both on the intrinsic appeal of content to receivers and on how well content serves producers’ strategic goals within the constraints and affordances of specific platforms. These goals include reputation management, coalition building and identity management, and coordination or participation in shared activities. Transmission is often a by-product of these motivations, and replication fidelity plays a limited role compared with transformations that adapt content to local incentives. Finally, the article suggests that platforms and communities can be understood as distinct ecological niches, each characterised by different audience structures, affordances, metrics, and algorithmic pressures. This perspective offers novel insight to persistent debates on social media dynamics, such as misinformation, radicalisation and polarisation, and the reasons behind online success.",

          "abstract": "Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has increasingly used a “hybrid” strategy, supporting its conventional battlefield operations with irregular activities against Kyiv’s European supporters. At their forefront are low-cost and easily replaced “disposable agents” that provide Russia with considerable operational reach as well as plausible deniability. Using a new dataset of 127 disposable agents, this study combines descriptive and inferential statistics with social network analysis to exploratively examine their demographics, roles, deployment patterns, and organisational structure. Findings indicate that disposable agents are predominantly male, mid-thirties, drawn disproportionately from Ukrainian, Russian, Moldovan, and Bulgarian populations, and quite frequently re-used. Networks appear structurally hierarchical and compartmentalised, and seem designed with plausible deniability in mind. However, inconsistent operational security by GRU and FSB officers may have limited Russia’s ability to claim ignorance. The findings provide empirical insight into a covert and significant facet of Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy, informing both policy responses to an ongoing threat and further scholarship.",

As a result, our knowledge of regional variation in male fertility remains limited. The current study addresses this research gap by examining how the timing and chances of parenthood vary regionally for women and men in four countries in Northern and Western Europe. We hypothesise that men may be subject to less regional variation in their first births than women, and that gender differences in first births may be less pronounced in urban centres, such as the capital regions, and especially among groups with higher levels of education. The study is based on data collected from female and male cohorts born between 1963 and 1970 in Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The results broadly support our hypotheses: men show modestly smaller differences in the timing and chances of first parenthood between capital and other regions than women, and consequently smaller gender differences in first parenthood exist in capital regions in all countries except the Netherlands. Moreover, highly educated women and men living in the capital regions have the most similar timing and chances of entering parenthood.",

The links between these organizations are facilitated by donor-advised funds, which form the “hubs” in the interconnected funding network. I explain the political implications of this finding using two “activist” nonprofits: the Black Lives Matter Global Foundation (BLMGN) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP).

          "abstract": "Contemporary philosophy and science lack a unified ontological framework capable of coherently explaining the relationship between consciousness, probability, and experienced reality. Existing models tend to privilege either material processes or subjective experience, resulting in persistent conceptual gaps around perception, indeterminacy, and the role of the observer.\nCurrent approaches - ranging from physicalism and idealism to information-based theories -struggle to integrate experiential reality with deeper structural mechanisms without collapsing into reductionism or metaphysical speculation. In particular, no widely accepted framework systematically distinguishes between foundational reality, the structural domain of possibility, and the rendered domain of experience.\nThis paper proposes the Three-Circle Ontology, a meta-ontological model that organizes reality into three expression layers: Circle 1 (Source) as the nondual ontological ground, Circle 2 (Possibility-Code) as the structural field of latent configurations, and Circle 3 (Projection) as the domain of perceptual experience. Rather than treating consciousness, probability, and physical reality as competing primitives, the model positions them as functionally distinct but ontologically continuous layers of expression.\nThe framework does not present an empirical theory, predictive model, or spiritual doctrine. Its scope is explicitly conceptual and structural, intended to clarify foundational assumptions underlying existing scientific and philosophical models.\nThe primary contribution of this work is a coherent meta-ontological architecture that enables interdisciplinary dialogue while preserving strict boundary conditions and logical consistency.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, digital platforms have provided new transnational political opportunities for advocacy by creating a tenuous connection between unaffiliated ordinary dissidents to some of the most powerful global actors. While academically understudied, call for help horizontal campaigns on social media initiated by ordinary dissidents in repressive conditions hoping for external support are increasingly becoming popular worldwide. Influenced by social movement studies and transnational advocacy literature, this study conceptualizes such campaigns as digital boomerangs and provides an analytical framework for analyzing them. Further, with a novel computational analysis of all Iranian hashtag activism campaigns for global attention and news articles regarding Iran sourced from all over the world, I demonstrate that receiving international attention for such campaigns is rare but possible. Without the help of organizations or offline protests, underprivileged dissidents can share their domestic concerns on a global scale with large scale digital campaigns.",

          "abstract": "The scale and scope of disadvantage in remote indigenous communities means that ethical dilemmas are day-to-day\nrealities for practitioners. Persistent hardship, disadvantage and discrimination - amid omnipresent policy initiatives\naimed at combating them - exacerbate these dilemmas and are a perennial source of workplace tension. Frequently\nthese tensions escalate to the point of unworkability among those tasked with collaborating in the interests of the\ncommunity. Under the guise of accountability or advocacy of justice, and backed by the (perceived) power of the\nstate, conflict among practitioners often leads to factionalism, standoffs and can escalate to bullying, harassment,\nviolence and lawsuits.

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "Against a backdrop of increasingly frequent external shocks and deepening cross-sectoral coupling, traditional national risk assessments centred on ‘industry/sector’ units often struggle to explain why seemingly localised disturbances rapidly evolve into systemic instability. This paper proposes an integrated ‘Dependency Network–Knowledge Graph (DN-KG)’ framework tailored for intelligence research and academic discourse. This framework abstracts Cambodia's macroeconomic, financial, real estate, fuel and power supply, border security, climate agriculture, tourism services, and governance regulatory systems into node sets. It integrates cross-system constraints and operationalises the DN-KG framework to: DN-KG)‘ framework for intelligence research and academic discourse. This framework abstracts Cambodia's macroeconomic, financial, real estate, fuel and power supply, border security, climate-agriculture, tourism services, and governance-regulation sectors into node sets, while cross-system constraints and transmission relationships are abstracted into edge sets. ’High-betweenness dependency edges\" serve as the core indicator for identifying systemic vulnerabilities. Building upon verifiable OSINT data, this paper constructs a reproducible node-edge inventory and cascade mechanism model. This enables evidence-anchored causal chain interpretation and scenario simulation for short-term trigger points (fuel channels and supply chains), medium-term structural vulnerabilities (US export concentration—employment—household debt—financial asset quality), and risk amplifiers (property correction—collateral — non-performing exposures—credit supply contraction). Research indicates that Cambodia's most critical vulnerability lies not in the weakness of any single sector, but in the cascading structure formed by the combined effects of ‘disruptability × cross-sector spillover × recovery difficulty’ along a few high-degree dependency edges. Therefore, resilience-building priorities should shift from ‘sectoral blood transfusions’ to ‘alternative pathways for critical dependency edges, inventory buffers, and institutional stabilisers’. Furthermore, strictly refraining from providing operational coordination or violence optimisation recommendations, this paper proposes a ‘compliant, auditable, reversible, humanitarian exception’ economic action portfolio for Thailand to adopt in the context of conflict spillover. This aims to reduce regional systemic risk and create conditions for de-escalation negotiations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Communication partners are crucial for adults with severe learning disabilities, as they recognise, interpret, and respond to non-verbal cues while sharing responsibility for creating a meaningful two-way communication process. Evidence-based strategies such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) can enhance interactions; however, their implementation in social care settings is inconsistent, constrained by workforce, organisational, and systemic barriers. This study–which forms part of the Improving Communication with Adults with Learning Disabilities (ICALD) programme–aimed to identify stakeholder-perceived barriers and facilitators to good communication support and to co-develop a Theory of Change (ToC) to guide implementation improvements in social care settings.\n\nMethods: Forty-eight stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, including adults with learning disabilities, participated in a total of 15 ToC workshops, one focus group, two interviews, and four supported conversations. Template Analysis based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to identify core themes, barriers, and facilitators across CFIR domains. These key findings informed the iterative, collaborative development of the ToC map.\n\nResults: Implementation barriers and facilitators identified across the CFIR domains indicated individual-, organisational-, and system-level factors influencing communication support. Key barriers included limited access to specialist professionals, inconsistent training, fragmented information-sharing systems, and variable staff knowledge of communication needs. Facilitators included strong leadership commitment, collaborative working with speech and language therapists and family carers, and peer mentoring. Supported conversations highlighted the importance of staff responsiveness to non-verbal cues. The resulting ToC map outlines short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes through three core pathways: 1) collaborative development of resources and training, 2) improved information sharing and recording, and 3) ongoing skills development, coaching, and supervision.\n\nConclusions: Improving the implementation of good communication support for adults with severe learning disabilities is likely to depend on organisational commitment, leadership engagement, and structured workforce development supported by specialist input. The ToC developed provides a theoretically grounded framework for translating known facilitators into practical, context-specific strategies. It highlights the necessity of capacity-building within teams and organisational alignment with the communication rights of adults with severe learning disabilities to achieve sustainable, consistent and effective practice change.",

To ensure that evidence-based scales are used for this purpose, comprehensive and transparent reporting of measurement properties is a first essential step. This study aimed to evaluate the reporting quality of studies that applied Rasch analysis on scales designed to measure well-being or QoL in older persons. Articles employing Rasch analysis were identified through a previous broader systematic review of psychometric studies. The findings demonstrate notable deficiencies in the reporting of measurement properties, indicating substantial room for improvement. While detailed reporting alone cannot guarantee that scales possess satisfactory measurement quality, it constitutes a necessary prerequisite for drawing evidence-based conclusions about their measurement quality. Improved reporting practices are essential not only for enhancing the interpretability and replicability of individual studies but also for enabling informed decisions in clinical and policy contexts regarding the use of well-being and QoL scales for older populations.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that frontline workers often discriminate based on race or ethnicity. However, citizens can also display discriminatory behavior—for instance, by requesting service only from workers of the same ethnic or religious background. This discrimination exercised by citizens towards frontline employees remains underexplored. Drawing on studies of citizen–state interactions, discrimination, and political ideology, we investigate when the public finds such requests acceptable. Using a vignette survey experiment with 2,067 Danish citizens, we find that language-based requests are seen as more acceptable than those based on religion. Political ideology significantly shapes these views: right-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from the ethnic majority, while left-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from an ethnic minority. While these single-country findings may not generalize beyond one-to-one interactions characterized by high intimacy, they shed light on how ideology influences public attitudes toward ethnically motivated service preferences and highlight the need to further examine citizen-driven discrimination in public service settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: The structure of causes of death has changed in low-mortality countries, with recent trends showing increasing cause diversity. However, most research overlooks that several conditions often contribute to the process leading to death.\nObjective: This paper develops a framework for studying cause-of-death diversity that accounts for multiple causes of death (MCoD).\nMethods: We introduce novel MCoD life tables to estimate cause diversity based on age-standardized metrics. Two dimensions of diversity are assessed: the average number of causes contributing to death and how diverse are these causes. For the latter dimension, two indexes derived from the Gini-Simpson index are proposed, each based on a different perception of the role of the contributing causes in the process leading to death. All metrics are decomposable and applied to data from Denmark, France, Spain and the U.S.\nResults: The results show increased cause diversity, both in terms of the average number of causes and how evenly deaths are distributed across groups of causes. MCoD yields higher diversity than the underlying causes of death (UCD), confirming that relying solely on UCD downplays the complexity of the mortality process. However, the increase over time in diversity is more modest\nwhen using MCoD compared to UCD. The main driver of increasing cause diversity is the decline in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system.\nContribution: This study offers a novel framework for analyzing cause diversity using MCoD. The proposed metrics are intuitive, life-table-based, and provide valuable insights into the growing complexity of the mortality process across countries.",

          "abstract": "On July 18, 2025, the United States enacted the GENIUS Act, the first federal statute to create a comprehensive regime for payment in stablecoins. This article argues that GENIUS operationalizes state power in digital monetary space and measurably strengthens U.S. financial sovereignty. It analyzes the Act’s core levers, a licensing monopoly over issuance and a three-year perimeter on exchange offerings; aligned categories of permitted issuers; reserves confined to cash, short-tenor Treasuries, AML (Anti Money Laundering) and sanctions obligations. The article links these mechanisms to four sovereignty channels: (i) increased structural demand for U.S. public debt, (ii) consolidation of rule-of-law control over on-chain dollars, (iii) extraterritorial standard-setting through reciprocity regimes, and (iv) policy signaling that legitimizes compliant dollar tokens. However, the Act’s limits are jurisdictional arbitrage, privacy and civil-liberties trade-offs, and dependence on macro credibility. The contribution reframes “monetary sovereignty” as concrete design features and proposes near-term indicators, reserves composition disclosures, treasury rulemaking on AML/sanctions and privacy, and reciprocity determinations for foreign regimes. GENIUS does not settle digital-dollar design, but it materially expands U.S. capacity to anchor private token markets in public money.",

It assesses whether gold or the dollar provides a more stable reserve asset by analyzing U.S. debt dynamics, BRICS gold accumulation, and recent digital monetary innovations. The study shows that the persistent rise of U.S. public debt, now exceeding $37 trillion, undermines confidence in the dollar’s sustainability despite its continuing dominance as the global reserve currency. In response, BRICS countries increasingly diversify reserves through gold holdings, a practice that functions not only as financial hedging but also as a political act of sovereignty against U.S. monetary coercion and sanctions. However, the absence of a coherent BRICS monetary strategy limits the bloc’s ability to offer a structured alternative to dollar hegemony. At the same time, the United States seeks to reinforce its monetary dominance through regulatory innovation, notably the GENIUS Act, which anchors stablecoins to the dollar. China, by contrast, promotes its digital renminbi (e-CNY) to gradually reduce reliance on dollar-based infrastructures. Together, these dynamics suggest a contested multipolar order where gold regains importance as a political and monetary anchor.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the theoretical tension between Goffman’s frontstage self-presentation and McAdams’s narrative identity theory, this study investigated if politicians’ public social media personas are strategic performances or reflect an internalized identity predicting backstage political behavior. We examined this authenticity paradox via U.S. legislators’ dissent voting, linking the language in 3.26 million tweets from 680 U.S. House Representatives (115th–118th Congresses) to 1.32 million roll-call votes. We used different natural language processing and network analysis techniques to measure narrative (agency, communion) and social identities (partisan interaction, structural holes) with fixed-effects panel models to observe that frontstage narratives predict backstage actions. Both agency and communion on Twitter were significantly associated with more dissent voting. Social identity, particularly higher inter-party interaction and spanning inter-party structural holes (lower Burt’s constraint), also positively predicted dissent. Mediation analysis confirmed social identity factors as key mechanisms linking narrative identity to dissent behavior. These findings suggest politicians’ self-narratives are public narratives that help to internalize an identity, shaping a self-concept that drives identity-congruent political action.",

Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of 402 U.S. K-12 teachers, we employed hierarchical regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect pathways. Regression analyses indicated that AI self-efficacy, instructional self-efficacy, engagement self-efficacy, workload, and anxiety all significantly predicted teacher wellbeing. The SEM revealed an indirect pathway in which AI pedagogy efficacy strengthened teachers’ self-efficacy, which in turn reduced perceived workload, lowered anxiety, and ultimately improved teacher mental wellbeing. Findings highlight the importance of building teachers’ AI competence. As AI becomes embedded in K-12 instructional practice, supporting teachers’ confidence in using these tools may serve as a valuable lever for improving teacher wellbeing.",

Using existing literature, the study shows how contested identities, cultural stereotypes, and social stigma marginalize this set of people across family, community, and societal levels. While people are generally innocent at birth, society still has a way of marginalizing people based on the circumstances of birth. Using Nussbaum’s ten capabilities, this study understands that people born of genocidal rape in Rwanda have diminished capabilities as compared to the majority of society. Such impaired capabilities reinforce social exclusion, which further plunges the victims into a cycle of cultural, political, social, economic, and psychological marginalization. The paper submits that the social exclusion of people born of genocidal rape constitutes social injustice and advocates for the dismantling of cultural barriers to enable the full participation of such individuals in the Rwandan society.",

While previous studies have examined the digital divide in internet use and smart technologies, few have explored how these inequalities manifest in everyday interactions with digital public transport platforms. To this end, we investigated user experiences of public transport applications in Birmingham, whose digital inclusion is disproportionate to its status as a major urban and economic hub in the UK, by analysing 4,275 user reviews on public transport services collected from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store between 2016 and 2025. Using a mixed natural language processing (NLP) approach combining topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we identified key themes and emotional tones in user feedback. Results revealed three dominant topics: App Performance, Usability, and Service Satisfaction, each corresponding to the access, ability, and motivation dimensions of the digital divide. Sentiment analysis showed generally negative evaluations, particularly around technical access barriers and satisfaction issues. By integrating user-generated data with digital divide theory, these results provide novel empirical evidence of how inequalities in digital engagement persist within digital twin planning and smart city transport systems, and highlight the importance of inclusive digital design for equitable and sustainable mobility access.",

          "abstract": "This research positions unions as critical agents for achieving labour-centred social sustainability in tourism work. Amidst evolving Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) regulations, social sustainability has gained academic attention. While there is a growing recognition that labour conditions within tourism require improvements to sustain the industry and support the workforce within it, labour-centred social sustainability and the role of unions have received limited consideration to date, despite their important role in protecting decent work and workers’ rights. Based on semi-structured interviews with global union leaders and affiliates, and underpinned by Institutional Theory, this paper proposes a framework that shows how unions shift from a traditional union paradigm towards social-sustainability-oriented unionism. During this process, labour unions engage and intervene at various levels in tourism, mobilising normative claims, shaping regulatory structures and reframing cognitive-cultural understandings. This research argues that unions should be equal and strategic partners of tourism stakeholders to implement robust labour-centred social sustainability practices and policies to achieve improved tourism labour conditions, improved business outcomes and wider social sustainability. As ESG regulations come into force and severe labour shortages continue, the paper offers timely insight and guidance on how to improve mandatory social sustainability efforts and attract and retain talent.",

          "authors": "Justyna Ratkowska-Pasikowska",
          "abstract": "This article examines writing—specifically the researcher diary—as a method of embodied and affective knowing within a qualitative study of initiatory experiences in sensitive research contexts. Drawing on autoethnography, affect theory, and the hermeneutics of experience, I argue that writing functions not merely as a tool of documentation but as a pre-analytic epistemic practice through which meaning emerges in the relational space between researcher and participants. The article is grounded in a qualitative project exploring initiation as a biographical, educational, and existential process among three groups: individuals working in thanatopedagogy, people involved in sex work and embodied sexual practices, and adults seeking or experiencing spiritual initiation. Within this study, the researcher diary played a central role in capturing embodied reactions, affective tensions, silences, and somatic traces that precede formal interpretation. The analysis demonstrates that embodied epistemology—understood as knowledge arising through the body, emotion, and relational presence—is crucial in research involving death, sexuality, spirituality, and biographical thresholds. The findings reveal recurring narrative structures of initiation, including symbolic crossings, processes of transformation, and micro-initiations understood as subtle internal shifts. At the same time, the diary documents the researcher’s own transformation, showing that fieldwork becomes a shared initiatory space in which knowledge is co-created. Conceptualizing writing as an epistemic micro-ritual, the article shows that writing is not the final stage of research but an ongoing mode of inquiry that intertwines analysis with reflexivity, vulnerability, and ethical relationality. The study contributes to reflexive qualitative methodology by demonstrating how embodied writing practices support the production of situated, affective, and relational knowledge in sensitive research contexts.\n\nKeywords: embodied knowing, autoethnography, researcher’s journal, initiation, affective epistemology, sensitive research",

          "abstract": "Social groups are arenas for both cohesion and conflict. Whereas prevailing theories focus on how these processes unfold at the boundaries between groups, the authors focus on the tensions that emerge within groups and that give rise to uncivil discourse. They develop a novel theoretical account of its network-structural antecedents. In polarized online groups, they hypothesize that the greater the structural similarity between two individuals, the less likely they will be to direct uncivil language toward one another. They further argue that this relationship will be moderated by the degree of group polarization. Using a node embedding algorithm (i.e., node2vec) to derive an omnibus measure of interpersonal structural similarity, they find support for the theory using a dataset that encompasses more than 25 million comments made by over 1.7 million users in six polarized communities on Reddit. They discuss implications for research on intergroup animosity, group polarization, the measurement of structural similarity, and the interplay of structure and culture.",

          "authors": "Charlotte Waltz; Nicholas Smeele; Anja Schreijer; Pearl A. Dykstra",
          "abstract": "Pandemic preparedness requires navigating trade-offs between health, economic, and social impacts; choices that often involve moral tensions. This study investigates how the Dutch public evaluates such trade-offs in the context of a potential outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) administered to a representative sample of 1,045 respondents from the LISS panel, we examined preferences across six policy outcomes: mortality, lasting physical and mental injuries, postponed healthcare, social restrictions, and one-off tax payments. A latent class logit model identified four distinct preference profiles, revealing substantial heterogeneity in moral and economic reasoning. Two classes exhibited taboo trade-off aversion (TTOA) when values such as life or human dignity were traded against monetary costs. Respondents displaying TTOA emphasized solidarity and governmental responsibility, while cost-sensitive groups prioritized economic efficiency. These findings highlight that public acceptance of pandemic policies depends not only on effectiveness and cost but also on perceived moral legitimacy. Accounting for TTOA in economic evaluation can improve the ethical considerations and societal acceptability of future pandemic preparedness strategies.",

          "authors": "Mila Desi Anasanti",
          "abstract": "Indonesia, the world’s largest palm-oil producer, has undergone extensive forest conversion over the past two decades through forest-release policies and plantation licensing, particularly in Sumatra and Kalimantan. These land-use changes have degraded watershed buffering capacity and increased the frequency and severity of hydrological disasters for downstream communities. Yet such transformations are routinely obscured by political narratives that present palm oil as a green, pro-poor, and sovereign commodity, while dismissing concerns over deforestation as biased or misleading. Recent presidential claims that “palm oil is just trees that absorb CO₂” exemplify an emerging post-truth environmental discourse that equates plantations with forests and weakens climate commitments.\n\nThis article develops a political-ecology analysis of Indonesia’s palm-oil–disaster nexus by bringing together three conceptual lenses: (1) the political ecology of commodity frontiers and forest governance; (2) post-truth environmental politics and the strategic denial of ecological harm; and (3) disaster populism and crisis-time “governance by spectacle.” Drawing on validated secondary evidence on deforestation, licensing decisions, watershed degradation, and major flood events, complemented by NGO investigations, media reporting, and selected policy documents, the article employs a within-case interpretive design combining process tracing and discourse analysis.\n\nWe show how state–business coalitions facilitating forest conversion are legitimised through post-truth narratives, and how subsequent flood disasters become stages for personalised, mediatised food-aid spectacles that reinforce elite legitimacy while diverting attention from structural drivers of vulnerability. These findings suggest that Indonesia’s climate and disaster governance is increasingly organised around symbolic relief and denial rather than risk reduction and justice. Policy implications include re-evaluating forest-release permits in high-risk watersheds, clarifying legal definitions of “forest” versus “plantation,” improving data transparency, and de-personalising disaster relief within rights-based frameworks.",

          "authors": "Sanjida Siddique Swarna",
          "abstract": "The two most notable Asian giants of the century are China and India. China's rapid ascent in South Asian nations in recent years has alarmed India’s dominance. Bangladesh is a sought-after partner for China due to its strategic location in the Bay of Bengal. Previously, India seemed to have a significant amount of control over Bangladesh. However, India's long-standing concerns about its power over Bangladesh have gradually been eroded by China's growing influence in the political, military, economic, and infrastructure spheres. The paper demonstrates the degree to which China has already surpassed India in Bangladesh's key industries. It also determines if China's increasing influence in Bangladesh is weakening India’s image in South Asia by examining regional ramifications, repercussions for Bangladesh's foreign policy, and India-Bangladesh relations.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Irina Alekseevna Polyakova",
          "abstract": "This article explores the role of amber in Russian culture during the reign of Anna Ioannovna (1730–1740), as well as the empress’s engagement in this process. Amber is presented as a material used in decorative art, an object of scientific research, and a potential collectible. An analysis of early to mid-18th century documents and publications suggests that Anna Ioannovna shared the interest in amber typical of many European aristocrats of that time; she also made some efforts to promote the development of the natural science amber collection at the Saint Petersburg Kunstkamera and of research into amber at the Academy of Sciences. The importance of archival documents for reconstructing the cultural and historical context of the formation of collections, identifying the sources and conditions of this process in the first decades of the 18th century in Russia, is justified. Special attention is paid to amber artworks that are typologically comparable with those now stored in Russian museum collections. The activities of scientists in the formation and scientific description of amber collections are shown using the example of a project submitted for consideration to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences by A. P. Volynsky, and the first popular science article on amber written by G. V. Richman. A document from the collection of the Russian State Historical Archive, titled “On the theft of amber items from the house of Anna Ioannovna”, which contains information on popular types of amber objects included in everyday life of Russian society, is introduced into scholarly discourse.",

          "abstract": "The paper examines the situation of growing attention to the practices of confession, which took place at the turn of the 10th–11th centuries and which lasted until the end of the 12th century. The purpose of the article is to identify the features of the statements by representatives of the Middle Byzantine canonical thought and discover methods (concepts, categories, hierarchical systems) by which they integrated the phenomenon of secret confession into a complex system of relationships in Byzantine society, and to evaluate their compatibility with the discourse of the time. The article consists of two parts which trace the situation during the 11th and 12th centuries, respectively. Each of these is further divided into two sections: in the first one the positions of the main authors of the period are described, while in the second they are analyzed and provided with historical contextualization. Part One compares historical narratives concerning the development of the institution of confession developed by three authors: St. Symeon the New Theologian, Patriarch John IV the Oxite of Antioch, and ex-chartophylax Nicephorus. It turns out that all three see the situation in a similar way, although they differ in their evaluation of it. The juxtaposition of these stories and their historical context allows us to conclude that the interests of the state and church authorities coincided on the issue of regulating confessional practices. This part serves as context for the subsequent assessment of the views of 12th-century authors. Part Two of the article describes and examines the phenomenon of a significant increase of the occurrence of the concept of “power” (ἐξουσία) in texts containing reflections on confession. The positions of key 12th-century church canonists are analyzed: Alexius Aristinus, John Zonaras, Theodore Balsamon, and Anonymous, the author of an unpublished commentary on Nomocanon contained in the Codex Sinaiticus 1117. Their ideas about how the “power to bind and loose” arises, exists, and is transmitted in the Church are reconstructed. The correlation of these ideas with the discussions of the 11th century allows us to assert that although Balsamon’s model was the most detailed, it also turned out to be the least organic to the views of its time, which predetermined its fate. In conclusion, a connection is made with the subsequent late Byzantine period, in which the ideas of the previous time were partly adopted and partly abandoned.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Nikolay Konstantinovich Antonov",
          "abstract": "The article continues the study of the principles of constructing the image of a priest in late Antiquity using the example of the “Apology” by St. Gregory the Theologian. It is demonstrated that the literary image of a priest is constructed by using images of other bearers of authority and is thought of as one of them: Gregory uses the topoi and vocabulary of political literature. The key image is that of the Platonic philosopher-ruler, as well as vocabulary from the monarchical rather than democratic tradition. The origin and tradition of using the formula “the art of arts and the science of sciences” (τέχνη τεχνῶν καὶ ἐπιστήμη ἐπιστημῶν), by which the author defines the priesthood, is studied. It is shown that in this way Gregory puts the priest in the place of the philosopher of the Platonic tradition. This is confirmed by an analysis of allusions to Plato’s Gorgias, which contains images of two universal power roles: the rhetorician and the philosopher. The comparison of caring for the soul with medicine, which originates in this dialogue, is further developed by Gregory, who incorporates into it provisions of the Christian gospel and describes principles of spiritual counseling that have no precedent in earlier writings. In addition, the author combines the functions of a rhetorician and a priest in the described image, thus making him a comprehensive leader of the church space, conceptualized by analogy with the polis. In conclusion, a comparison is made with the image of Pythagoras as described by Iamblichus, who, like the priest, combines a political dimension (rule of a community) with a soteriological perspective through varied types of influence on the soul: through public speech, individual communication, example, and a cult. The comparison allows us to see that the priest and the local Church are thought of by Gregory not as a separate new political space with its own power structure, but as its metaphorical projection, universal in defining identity, but not denying the existing political institutions.",

          "authors": "vano gomurashvili",
          "abstract": "Education policy in transitional democracies is particularly vulnerable to politicization due to weak institutional safeguards, polarized political environments, and unstable policy continuity. This study examines the politicization of education reform in Georgia, analyzing how recently announced policy changes reflect broader patterns of political control rather than evidence-based educational development. Using qualitative policy analysis, the research focuses on government-announced reform proposals, official statements, and public discourse to assess how political priorities and ideological narratives are embedded in the reform agenda.\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the reform is shaped by centralized agenda-setting, ambiguous political concepts such as “university identity,” and governance mechanisms that increase state control over academic institutions. Proposed structural changes, including the reduction of schooling and degree durations, are shown to undermine Georgia’s alignment with the Bologna Process and restrict international academic mobility. Drawing comparative insights from the Russian precedent, the study highlights the risks of academic isolation and ideological capture associated with politically driven education reforms.\n\nThe findings suggest that the reform does not enhance educational quality or institutional autonomy but instead advances the politicization and centralization of the education system. By weakening academic freedom, marginalizing professional expertise, and distancing Georgia from European education standards, the reform poses significant risks to democratic development and European integration. The study concludes that safeguarding education policy from political interference is essential for democratic resilience in transitional democracies.",

My proposed criteria of membership, durability, and territoriality (Moffett 2025a,b) were intended to get our discussions going. The conversations proved invaluable even if no single view of a “society” satisfied everyone, as might have been anticipated from the subject’s breadth and our diverse backgrounds.

          "authors": "Pier Luigi Sacco",
          "abstract": "The study of cognitive biases has dominated behavioral economics and cognitive psychology for nearly half a century, proposing a view of human cognition as systematically flawed. This chapter presents a fundamental reconceptualization of cognitive biases through the lens of ecological rationality and developmental plasticity. Building on Oeberst and Imhoff's (2023) insight that many biases reflect belief-consistent information processing, we argue that these phenomena may be better understood as instances of adaptive mismatch—situations where cognitive strategies that were adaptive in their original environmental context produce suboptimal results when applied in novel environments. Rather than viewing these mismatches as products of fixed, evolutionarily-designed modules, we propose that they emerge from the flexible reassembly of basic cognitive capabilities through cultural learning processes, as suggested by the cognitive gadgets approach. This framework integrates several theoretical perspectives: the reconceptualization of decision-making as continuous environmental navigation rather than discrete choice; understanding cognitive strategies as ecologically rational adaptations to environmental structure; viewing mismatches as informative signals within a vector field of potential adaptations; and analyzing heuristics through the lens of predictive processing. We provide concrete examples from empirical research that demonstrate how seemingly irrational behaviors can be understood as adaptive responses to specific environmental structures. Our synthesis offers a theoretical integration across multiple research traditions while suggesting new approaches to research methodology and policy intervention. This ecological perspective not only provides a more nuanced account of why cognitive \"biases\" persist but also suggests more effective approaches to education, decision support, and public policy that work with, rather than against, the ecological design of human cognition.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "The newly introduced ‘sealing of public security violation records’ system under the revised Public Security Administration Punishment Law has sparked intense debate due to its implications for public safety expectations concerning highly sensitive activities such as drug-related offences, occupational access boundaries, and data governance risks. This paper refrains from making factual determinations regarding online allegations against any specific individuals or institutions. Instead, it adopts a ‘systemic security governance’ methodology to explore how the legislature can achieve risk containment, factual clarification, and institutional consolidation within the rule of law framework when significant societal doubts arise (including ‘indications of potential external undue influence during the legislative proposal stage’) and supporting regulations have yet to form a rigid closed-loop system. This paper proposes: guided by the normative benchmarks of scientific, democratic, and lawful legislation emphasised in Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, and framed by the risk management principles of coordinating people's security, political security, and institutional security as required by the overall national security outlook, the NPCSC should lawfully arrange for the temporary suspension of Article 136's key application provisions within a specified timeframe. concurrently initiating investigations into specific issues or specialised reviews. This would establish an auditable governance chain of ‘first contain risks, then investigate thoroughly, finally consolidate,’ thereby minimising systemic spillover costs to public safety, data security, and public trust without undermining institutional objectives.",

Empleando una muestra representativa de la población adulta en línea (N = 2005), este artículo se enfoca en seis plataformas: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X —ex-Twitter—, TikTok y WhatsApp. El análisis descriptivo e inferencial, basado en la prueba estadística de chi-cuadrado de Rao-Scott, reveló diferencias significativas según el género en la mayoría de las plataformas examinadas, con los usuarios hombres prefiriendo YouTube y X para consumir noticias, y las mujeres inclinándose hacia TikTok e Instagram. El estudio también halló diferencias según la edad. Facebook y YouTube emergieron como las plataformas dominantes para acceder a noticias, particularmente entre los grupos de mayor edad, mientras que TikTok mostró una tendencia predominante entre los jóvenes de 18 a 29 años.
