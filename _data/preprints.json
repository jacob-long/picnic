          "title": "The Emotion Economy: Algorithmic amplification, cognitive fluency, and cultural schemas in Instapoetry",
          "authors": "Hanan Hussein Sheha",
          "abstract": "The contemporary literary landscape has been fundamentally reshaped by the rise of Instapoetry: short, visual, and emotionally direct verse disseminated primarily through Instagram, a platform whose image-first architecture and recommender systems privilege affectively engaging content. This article argues that the dominance of this poetic form represents not a superficial cultural trend but an adaptive response to a digitally mediated attention economy. It advances an integrative theoretical framework explaining Instapoetry through the convergence of three dimensions: algorithmic, psychological, and cultural. First, algorithmic amplification on Instagram leverages patterns of repetition and social proof to promote specific formal styles. Second, the cognitive state of the platform’s users—marked by social media fatigue and elevated cognitive load—produces a preference for content high in processing fluency. Third, the cultural motifs that dominate Instapoetry function as accessible affective schemas, enabling readers to engage in self-expression, identity construction, and emotional validation. Drawing on research in media studies, cognitive science, and feminist literary criticism—and referencing the influential work of early Instapoets such as Rupi Kaur and Amanda Lovelace—this paper proposes a multidisciplinary account of how digital infrastructures and human psychology jointly shape contemporary poetic production and reception.",

          "authors": "Martin Bush",
          "abstract": "The projection planetarium has been called one of the most the most important single device for popularising astronomy. More than most comparable technologies, the planetarium projector is bound to the environment it operates within. As impressive a machine as it is, it cannot operate effectively except within a well-defined space. This article considers the role of space in the operation of the projection planetarium, through a range of aspects. The domed surface for projection is one of the most characteristic features of the space if the planetarium and its history is described. There are also the transitional spaces that were built into planetarium architecture from early on. The planetarium dome often shaped the external space of the planetarium as well, placing these buildings in architectural comparison with ceremonial structures. Finally, planetariums, as a new kind of performance space, were often established within an institutional space of existing organisations. I use as a case study the Sijthoff Planetarium, located in The Hague, an example that is revealing of many of these aspects of space. Situating the projection planetarium in the history of astronomical visualisation allows us to think in space and to think about space.",

          "authors": "Musa al-Gharbi",
          "abstract": "On its face, journalism is a project that requires humble inquiry: reporters have to speak on matters that are fluid, complex, dynamic, and ambiguous – they have to turn in the “first draft of history” even as the “facts” continue to evolve. They must also convey “the facts” in a manner that is concise, compelling, and accessible to non-specialized audiences, often working under tight deadlines, and engaging with stakeholders who have their agendas, which may diverge from those of the readers, the publication, or the journalists themselves. Put simply, this is very difficult work. And “getting it right” often requires a willingness to check one’s assumptions, recognize and admit errors, and subordinate one’s vision and preferences to those of editors and audiences. This chapter will describe some failures and opportunities of news media to promote humble inquiry. It will discuss how journalists may foster HI in their own work and how journalists can encourage HI in their readers.",

          "authors": "Vihaan Sahu",
          "abstract": "Objective: To develop a specialized Python tool for visualizing Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) risk-of-bias assessments that addresses the limitations of existing generic visualization tools.\n\nMethods: The author developed NOS-TLPlot, an open-source Python package and accompanying Streamlit-based web application. The tool automatically converts raw NOS star ratings (0–9) into standardized risk categories (Low, Moderate, High) and generates twelve distinct visualization types, including star distribution plots, traffic-light plots, radar charts, heatmaps, dot profiles, donut charts, and lollipop charts. It offers both an interactive web application and a command-line interface for batch processing and integration into reproducible analytical pipelines. Users can customize output themes (e.g., traffic-light or grayscale), figure sizes, and export formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS).\n\nResults: NOS-TLPlot successfully produces publication-quality visualizations for NOS risk-of-bias assessments. The tool's web application provides an intuitive interface for data upload, plot selection, and customization. The command-line interface allows for automated plot generation, facilitating reproducibility. The variety of visualization options enhances the flexibility and comprehensiveness of risk-of-bias reporting.\n\nConclusion: NOS-TLPlot provides a dedicated, user-friendly, and reproducible solution for NOS data visualization, enhancing the transparency, consistency, and efficiency of reporting study quality in systematic reviews and meta-analyses involving non-randomized studies.\n\nKeywords: Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, risk of bias, data visualization, Python, systematic review, meta-analysis, open-source software.",

          "title": "Inhibition in individuals with Williams syndrome and neurotypical children",
          "authors": "Imogen van Jaarsveldt; Christopher Jarrold",
          "abstract": "Individuals with Williams syndrome have been reported to experience challenges with executive functioning relative to neurotypical individuals, particularly in inhibition. However, previous studies have produced conflicting findings on the extent of differences between these two groups which might reflect a failure to deconfound inhibition and working memory effects on performance. This study assessed this issue by examining performance on novel Go/No-go and colour-word Stroop tasks that varied in inhibitory and memory loads in individuals with Williams syndrome (N = 24) and a large comparison sample of neurotypical children (N = 82). Bayesian analysis showed a meaningful difference between the participant groups on Go/No-go sensitivity scores (D’): participants with Williams syndrome showed poorer sensitivity on all conditions, with the exception of a high memory and high inhibition condition where they outperformed the comparison group. On the Stroop task, individuals with Williams syndrome were slower and less accurate than the comparison group, particularly on high memory and high inhibition conditions. However, accounting for sample differences in non-verbal ability, or word reading speed, removed many previously meaningful group differences in task performance. While inhibitory control is therefore not entirely ‘intact’ in Williams syndrome, individuals’ performance was broadly consistent with other abilities measured in this study. It would therefore be premature to conclude that inhibition is a fundamental area of weakness within executive control for individuals with Williams syndrome.",

          "authors": "Yoonsang Lee; Randall Engle",
          "abstract": "Working memory capacity (WMC) has long been used as a central measure of cognitive abilities, predicting performance across a wide range of tasks. We argue that much of this predictive power in fact reflects attention control (AC)—functions such as goal mainte-nance and inhibition—rather than storage capacity per se. We review evidence across six domains: (1) perception and sensory discrimination, (2) learning and problem solving, (3) cognitive control and decision making, (4) retrieval and memory performance, (5) mul-titasking and real-world performance, and (6) clinical applications. We show that many findings attributed to WMC are better explained as reflecting demands on AC. We en-courage the use of more reliable measures of AC to directly test these mechanisms and recommend latent-variable approaches to better distinguish the cognitive processes underlying complex performance.",

          "authors": "A. Ross Otto; Andrew Westbrook; Jean Daunizeau",
          "abstract": "A widespread observation is that people avoid mentally effortful courses of action, and much recent work examining cognitive effort has explained subjective effort evaluation—and consequently, preferences—in economic terms, which assumes that the expenditure of cognitive effort is experienced as costly. However, this economic perspective is largely tacit about the source of these costs. Here we review recent theoretical treatments of effort costs, which take vastly different perspectives—information-theoretic, psychological, and biological—to explain how the subjective experience of cognitive effort arises from controlled information processing, exploring their predictions about the simple observation that people avoid and report as unpleasant tasks with high (versus low) working-memory demands. Finally, we identify open questions which might help bridge across these accounts.",

          "abstract": "The Affect Grid is a single-item measure that simultaneously assesses affective valence and arousal, yet few studies have tested its validity in everyday settings. Prior validation efforts focused on only one dimension, used small samples, and/or relied on cross-sectional data. To address these gaps, we integrated two week-long daily diary studies (N = 474; 2,809 observations) in which participants reported their nightly affect using both the Affect Grid and single-item ratings of how positive, negative, neutral, and aroused they felt. Correlation analyses showed that Affect Grid valence and arousal were strongly related to their corresponding single-item measures but only weakly related to other dimensions, supporting convergent and discriminant validity. Multilevel models further showed that Affect Grid valence predicted higher positive and lower negative affect, whereas Affect Grid arousal primarily predicted single-item arousal, at both between- and within-person levels. A quadratic pattern for valence suggested that neutral affect peaked at moderate levels of valence, consistent with the view of valence as a bipolar continuum. Overall, these results support the Affect Grid as a concise and reliable tool for measuring affective valence and arousal in daily life.",

          "authors": "Richard Henson",
          "abstract": "The term “Cognitive Reserve” broadly refers to better-than-expected cognitive abilities in old age, presumed to reflect environmental/lifestyle factors earlier in life. This commentary addresses the question of what determines “better than expected” cognition. More specifically, it considers cognitive performance that is better than expected from standard clinical assessments of the brain. This is in the spirit of the original puzzle raised by (Katzman et al., 1988), who identified individuals whose cognitive abilities had been well above average despite post mortem revealing neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. More commonly these days, the term is used by neurologists to describe people who show comparable atrophy on a clinical brain scan, yet differ markedly in their cognitive function. This “puzzle” is important, particularly if we can identify factors, such as lifestyle choices, that might boost this reserve, allowing individuals to maintain their cognitive abilities for longer, despite brain atrophy.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal Physiological Synchrony (IPS), the alignment of physiological signals during social interactions requires advanced statistical methods to be quantified. Such methods rely on the application of researcher-defined parameters, which can significantly affect outcomes. Multiverse analysis, applying multiple analytical strategies to the same dataset, reveals how parameter choices influence results, thus mitigating possible bias and enhancing transparency and reliability of results. \nIn this study, we used a multiverse approach to reanalyse - through Windowed Cross-Correlation (WCC) - a dyadic ECG dataset from participants involved in a Joint Action task as well as simulated data generated via Kuramoto models (mathematical models used in describing synchronyzation) . We explored how the combination of i) window size, ii) window overlap, iii) prewhitening and iv) use of Peak-Picking (PP) algorithm affected several indices of IPS strength and stability, as well as their ability to discriminate between real and surrogate dyads. \nThe original results of the stufy were overall replicated, with all IPS indices successfully discriminating genuine from surrogate synchrony regardless of parameter selection. By contrast, the selection of parameters had a greater influence when distinguishing between task and baseline IPS. Moreover, the PP algorithm tended to overestimate synchrony strength, thereby hindering discrimination. Importantly, measures of synchrony stability proved effective in distinguishing genuine from surrogate synchrony. Based on our multiverse results, we provide recommendations for researchers applying WCC analysis to study cardiac IPS synchrony.",

          "authors": "Milad",
          "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations, especially the perception of voices in the absence of external stimuli, are a hallmark of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. Modeling these complex phenomena in animals is challenging, as traditional rodent models rely on indirect behavioral proxies and simple stimuli. Here, I propose that songbirds, with their sophisticated vocal communication and well-mapped neural circuitry for auditory processing, offer a novel model for studying auditory hallucinations. We hypothesize that songbirds can experience hallucination-like perceptions of vocalizations under specific conditions, driven by neural mechanisms of predictive coding and neuromodulation analogous to those in mammals. In this article, we outline supporting evidence for this hypothesis, drawing comparisons between songbirds and traditional mammalian models. We discuss how pharmacological manipulations – extensively used in rodent models – could be applied or adapted to songbirds to induce and investigate hallucination-like events. We then propose a methodological framework to test these ideas, including behavioral paradigms (e.g., detecting illusory calls embedded in noise). Discussion of this framework highlights the strengths of songbirds (rich vocal behaviors, accessible neural circuits) and addresses potential limitations (evolutionary distance and differing brain anatomy). By emphasizing predictive coding and circuit-level mechanisms, we argue that songbirds can fill an essential gap in auditory hallucination research, offering a complementary model alongside rodents and primates. This hypothesis, if validated, would broaden our understanding of hallucinations and open new experimental avenues for probing the neural basis of psychosis.",

          "abstract": "Suicidal ideation often goes undetected in brief screenings. We developed a model that infers risk from routine depressive symptom data by integrating machine learning with symptom-network features. Using nationally representative data from US adults (NHANES; N = 44,922), we predicted ideation (PHQ-9 item 9 ≥1) under three specifications: (1) PHQ-8 total score; (2) eight PHQ-8 items; and (3) items plus individualized network features. Models used 10-fold cross-validation; precision-recall AUC (PR AUC) was the primary metric. Both item-level and network-augmented models outperformed the total-score baseline. The network-augmented XGBoost performed best (PR AUC = 0.37) while meeting screening criteria (sensitivity ≥0.80; specificity ≥0.50). The most influential signals were the centrality and severity of depressed mood and worthlessness/guilt, network density, and selected edges. External validation across five datasets (N = 808,023) yielded normalized PR AUCs of 0.32-0.51, supporting generalizability. Findings suggest that network augmentation can improve interpretability without compromising model performance.",

          "authors": "Alexandre Fortuna; Martin Constant; Dirk Kerzel",
          "abstract": "In the visual search literature, an attentional template refers to a mental representation of target features stored in visual working memory. The dual-state model (Olivers et al., 2011) argues that visual working memory can only be focused on a single representation at a time, and therefore, we can only search for one target at a time. Consequently, to detect two potential targets, we must rapidly alternate our attention between the two corresponding representations. By contrast, the resource hypothesis (Huynh Cong &amp; Kerzel, 2021) posits that we can simultaneously activate more than one representation for visual search, although this requires sharing the available resources. In three pre-registered experiments, we compared the predictions from the state-based model and the resource hypothesis in a combined search and memory task. The results suggest that participants allocate their resources based on the reliability of the retro-cue and therefore favor the resource hypothesis. In contrast, the results are less consistent with the state-based model, which predicts that the cost in terms of response time and accuracy should remain identical regardless of the retro-cue’s reliability.",

          "abstract": "We present a polygenic score (PGS) for general cognitive ability (GCA) that demonstrates a substantial increase in predictive accuracy both among unrelated individuals and within-families relative to existing predictors. In the UK Biobank (UKB), our PGS achieves a standardized regression coefficient with fluid intelligence of β=0.406 (SE 0.009), corresponding to an R² of 16.4% (95% confidence interval: [15.1%, 17.9%]). In a sample of 4,642 sibling pairs from UKB, we estimate the standardized within-family effect of the PGS to be δ=0.355 (SE 0.0218), indicating only slight attenuation of prediction ability within-family (δ/β=0.876, SE 0.050). We obtain similar results in a sample of 736 9-10-year-old European ancestry sibling pairs from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. After correcting for the reliability of the UK Biobank and ABCD phenotypes, the inverse-variance-weighted within-family association of the PGS with latent general ability is estimated at 0.448 (SE 0.025). Our PGS predicts higher educational attainment, occupational status, and family income within families, and retains good performance in non-European ancestry samples, with the correlation retaining 64% of its magnitude in the African American subset of the ABCD cohort, in line with expectations. In UKB siblings, higher scores correlate with better self‑reported health and lower risk of multiple cardiometabolic diseases. Our study shows that it is possible to attain powerful within-family prediction of GCA using a PGS, enabling future research to clarify how cognitive ability influences health-related outcomes.",

In an effort to contribute to a better understanding, we examined the impact of greenwashing training on consumers’ ability to discern greenwashing using an online survey experiment designed to resolve ecological and internal validity issues of past work (N = 518). Additionally, we extended the scope by exploring whether greenwashing training also affects healthwashing detection. Our study revealed that greenwashing training can make consumers more likely to perceive advertisements featuring deceptive environmental claims correctly as greenwashing but can also make them more likely to misperceive advertisements without such claims as greenwashing. Furthermore, it showed that although healthwashing is not the subject of greenwashing training, the triggered skepticism can transfer to healthwashing perceptions, too. Overall, these findings suggest that greenwashing training does not enhance greenwashing detection proficiency but rather promotes excessive suspicion.",

          "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP; Friston 2009, 2010) has been hailed as a groundbreaking idea neuroscience, with the potential to account for a wide range of behavioural phenomena, including exploration and avoidance in uncertain or dynamic environments. Notwithstanding its inherently simple and elegant idea - agents minimise surprise, otherwise known as free energy, through a blief and action updating process referred to as active inference - real-world application has been limited due to computational complexity and the abstract nature of the mathematical framework. This paper introduces FEP to travel behaviour research, developing an active inference model of route choice under uncertainty and applying it to two experimental datasets. Results demonstrate that the FEP model outperforms alternatives based on reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for individuals displaying exploratory or belief- adaptive behaviour. While computationally more demanding, the FEP framework offers substantial advantages in capturing learning dynamics, habit formation, and uncertainty-driven adaptation in travel decision-making, positioning it as a promising neurocomputational foundation for future travel behaviour models.",

This is the first UK evaluation of the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform, an operationalization of the ICF Core Sets for Autism via an online assessment. In Study 1, 20 Autistic adults were supported to complete the assessment, provide feedback via think-aloud interviews and to evaluate it. In Study 2, which was pre-registered, 464 Autistic adults and 481 Non-Autistic adults completed the assessment independently online and evaluated it. Both studies used a participatory approach. Using standardised questionnaires both studies found the assessment “acceptable” and found usability to be “ok” or better. This was also true for subgroups of Autistic adults who expressed clinically significant autistic traits, anxiety or depression, those from minoritised ethnicities, older adults and who were unemployed.

This includes the brain’s comparative representation of sensations originating in the subject’s body versus those originating in the environment. It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale changes in consumption are essential for mitigating climate change. Yet, people’s behaviors and their perceptions of what is feasible to change are deeply influenced by their social and physical environments. Despite growing recognition of these influences, empirical evidence integrating both current behavior and perceived feasibility of change remains limited. In this study, we examine the relationship between perceptions of physical and social environments and both the frequency of high-impact transport and food behaviors, as well as their perceived behavioral plasticity—the perceived likelihood of changing such behaviors while considering associated costs and barriers. In exploratory analyses, we also examine how perceived behavioral plasticity relates to perceived wellbeing impacts of behavior change. Using survey data from 1,202 UK adults, we analyzed current driving, air travel, public transport use, and red and white meat consumption, together with perceived plasticity and wellbeing impact for each behavior. Social environmental factors, particularly descriptive norms and family goal support, predicted most current behaviors and perceived plasticity across domains. By contrast, perceptions of physical environmental factors, such as public transport access or food appeal, were associated with behavior and plasticity in more domain-specific ways. Perceived behavioral plasticity was positively correlated with perceived wellbeing impacts, suggesting that perceptions of feasibility and desirability are intertwined. These findings together demonstrate the importance of targeting both physical opportunity structures and social contexts when promoting climate-relevant behavior change.",

          "abstract": "Aim: Childhood maltreatment and adolescent mental health problems are unequally distributed, with the highest burdens among marginalised groups including females and those experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Yet little is known about how the psychological consequences of maltreatment vary across intersecting social positions (e.g., socioeconomically disadvantaged females). Prior quantitative work has largely compared average differences across a few groups, obscuring non-additive, intersectional patterning. Because social realities are structured by overlapping systems of privilege and oppression, this study aimed to (i) map inequalities in adolescent emotional problems and the effects of maltreatment across intersectional groups; and (ii) describe the extent to which inequalities reflect additive and non-additive (intersectional) effects. Method: Data were analysed from 19,590 11-16-year-olds in the Oxwell 2023 Student Survey in England, United Kingdom. Within a random-coefficient Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA), individuals were nested in 180 intersectional strata defined by gender, ethnicity, household poverty, school year group, and school-level deprivation (also entered as additive effects). Emotional problem scores (Revised Child Depression and Anxiety Scale) were regressed on maltreatment exposure (Short Childhood Maltreatment Questionnaire) as the primary effect of interest. Stratum-specific predicted emotional problems and maltreatment effects were estimated, and between-stratum variance was partitioned into additive and residual non-additive components. Results: Maltreatment was associated with higher emotional problems for all strata (+3.20 to +6.14 points). Socioeconomically disadvantaged female and non-binary adolescents showed the highest burden and among the strongest maltreatment effects. Between-stratum inequalities in emotional problems were largely explained by exposure to maltreatment and the additive contributions of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, age, and place. However, residual non-additive intersectional effects were also evident, especially among individuals exposed to maltreatment (5.25% of between-stratum variance; compared with 3.46% among those not exposed). Conclusion: In this sample of adolescents in England, the detrimental effects of maltreatment on adolescent emotional problems appear pervasive but not uniform across intersecting social positions. Applying intersectional MAIHDA shows that inequalities largely reflect additive social patterning, with additional non-additive contributions suggestive of intersectional dynamics that are more pronounced with maltreatment exposure. These findings motivate deeper investigation into the social-structural mechanisms that shape vulnerability and resilience, and call for trauma-informed, equity-focused interventions and policy to reduce unequal exposure to maltreatment and the contexts that amplify harm.",

However, predictors such as obstetric complications, sleep disturbances and social support are underexplored in large population-based cohorts. \n\nMethods\n\nWe analysed data from 44,479 UK Biobank participants with at least one live birth to examine associations between obstetric factors (e.g., hypertensive disorders, multiple pregnancy, preterm birth), later self-reported sleep problems (e.g., insomnia, short sleep), and social support (e.g., loneliness) with PND risk. Comparisons were made with a) healthy controls and b) women with non-perinatal depression, using both lifetime history and prospective ICD-coded diagnoses around first birth. Predictors were examined using logistic regression and penalised regression models, adjusting for age, neuroticism, body mass index, deprivation, and education.\n\nResults\n\nLifetime PND was associated with younger age at first birth, higher parity, stillbirth/miscarriage, preterm birth, sleep disorders, and later self-reported insomnia, difficulty getting up, short sleep, loneliness, and evening chronotype vs. controls. Prospective analyses showed increased PND risk vs. controls following multiple or preterm births and in those later reporting difficulty getting up. Preterm birth was associated with PND but not non-perinatal depression. Penalised regression models showed good discrimination of lifetime and prospective PND vs. controls (AUC = 0.78 and 0.77). Strongest predictors included neuroticism, younger maternal age, higher BMI, greater parity, difficulty getting up, stillbirth/miscarriage, and sleep disorder history.\n\nConclusions\n\nMothers with pregnancy-related trauma/complications, tendency towards sleep difficulties and low social support may benefit from targeted preventive resources.

          "abstract": "Matrescence is the term used to refer to the developmental process of becoming a mother, encompassing conception through to the postpartum period. This vulnerable period involves profound neurological restructuring driven by hormonal and environmental changes. Despite the high rates of maternal mental illness, the socioemotional developments that accompany this neurological restructuring remain under researched. To better understand the social experience of matrescence, this study investigated how women experience the transition into motherhood, exploring the topics of body autonomy, social expectations, mental health, and identity development. Interviews with six postpartum women revealed how the experience reduced personal autonomy in motherhood, alongside the necessary cognitive adjustment, functioned as a key mechanism driving maternal identity transformation. The findings of this study provide critical context for understanding how neuroplasticity observed in matrescence can be expressed in real-time. The analysis also illuminated how social support functions as a crucial buffer against emotional distress for new mothers, providing insight into potential strategies to support new mothers. This study underscores the importance of further research into maternal identity transformation and the role of social support in facilitating this transition.",

          "abstract": "Research on human memory has expanded rapidly over the past decades, leading to the development of numerous models and experimental paradigms. However, this growth has also resulted in increasing specialization, with limited integration across models, tasks, age groups, and domains. Here, we present the Embedded Computational Framework of Memory (eCFM), a simple yet flexible computational model that integrates encoding, storage, retrieval, and decision processes with structured representations that capture visual, orthographic, phonological, and semantic information. We tested the generalizability of the eCFM across 11 experiments involving approximately 40 younger (18 to 25 years) and 40 older adults (65 to 80 years) per experiment. In Experiments 1 to 4, participants completed order reconstruction tasks using words or images varying in semantic, phonological, orthographic, or visual similarity. Experiments 5 to 7 tested serial recall using the same materials. In Experiments 8 to 11, participants performed old/new recognition tests with studied and unstudied items with similar representational forms. Results showed age-related differences in serial recall, smaller differences in order reconstruction, and none in recognition. Across all tasks and domains, participants consistently showed high false memory rates for related foils, with no age-related differences. The eCFM accounted for all main findings and captured age-related differences, and the lack thereof, by manipulating encoding strength and position discriminability. Overall, the model represents a step toward a general account of human memory and highlights the potential and value of integrating traditionally separate areas of memory research.",

At the same time, culturally grounded adaptations were observed, including the incorporation of practices such as Naikan, Zen meditation, and martial arts, alongside thematic emphases on relational and psychosomatic processes. However, explicit engagement with cultural adaptation was relatively limited, raising questions about the extent to which local cultural contexts are informing or being overlooked in the adaptation process. \n\nConclusion: As mindfulness continues to circulate globally, findings from this study highlight the need for context-sensitive approaches that engage with both global frameworks and local conceptual traditions.",

          "authors": "Paul C. Bogdan",
          "abstract": "The present report argues that the pursuit of social alignment drives all aspects of how individuals evaluate and respond to another person’s behavior. Social/moral judgment – whether you see another person as good and their behavior as appropriate – can be framed as an evaluation of whether the person’s values align with yours and whether they acted the same way you would. Following negative judgments, your responses can be understood as attempts to reestablish alignment, such as by conforming to this person’s behavior or punishing it. From this perspective, the present research proposes the Self-Other Prediction Error (SOPE) model, which conceptualizes these mechanisms within frameworks of predictive coding, Theory of Mind, and dual-process decision-making. Recent studies experimentally testing this model validate its core arguments and show that SOPE predicts participants’ reactions to others’ behavior more accurately than earlier theories focusing on norms or utility. Furthermore, reinterpreting older studies suggests that the proposed model successfully reconciles a wide array of phenomena concerning moral psychology, behavioral economics, and other social cognition topics. Hence, the proposed SOPE account is posed as a foundation for understanding social information processing generally and its computational underpinnings.",

          "abstract": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and clinically urgent condition in adolescence, marked by impairments in cognitive flexibility—a capacity thought to be supported by neural variability. However, most research to date has focused on static brain features, leaving the role of variability largely unexplored. Importantly, variability-based metrics have been emerging as promising biomarkers in psychiatry, offering superior test–retest and intersession reliability compared with traditional static metrics. Leveraging resting-state fMRI data from 160 psychiatric patients with NSSI and 50 psychiatric controls, we examined neural variability at two hierarchical levels—connectivity and network topology—and evaluated their clinical relevance using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Patients with NSSI consistently exhibited heightened variability at both the local and global level, and these measures demonstrated significant discriminative power in classifying NSSI from controls (AUC = 0.75). The functional implications, however, diverged between two levels. Greater connectivity-level variability was associated with better emotional and attentional functioning and predicted larger reductions in NSSI behaviors over three months, suggesting an adaptive or compensatory role. In contrast, greater topology-level variability was linked to higher impulsivity, and predicted poorer behavioral improvement, reflecting maladaptive instability of large-scale organization. These findings reveal that elevated neural variability in NSSI encompasses both adaptive and dysregulated dynamics: increases in local connectivity variability may promote flexible adaptation, whereas excessive large-scale reconfiguration indicates loss of global control. Together, our findings indicate that disruption of the balance between local flexibility and global stability may constitute a neural mechanism underlying self-regulatory dysfunction in NSSI and highlight variability-based metrics as potential biomarkers and intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we introduce the theoretical concepts and test the empirical predictions of the Theory of Sub-entropic Attention (TSA), a novel framework for modelling subjective entropy (Sub-en) in human predictive behaviour. TSA posits that humans implicitly employ Higher Order Markov Models (HOMMs) of individualised orders to predict the next symbol in binary sequences. The internal beliefs of such models enable the emergence of subjectively perceived structure, even in randomly generated sequences, when Sub-en falls below an entropic threshold. \n\nWe conducted a single-participant pilot-study to investigate two related hypotheses: \n\ni) Participants achieve higher accuracy when predicting the next symbol in sub-entropic compared to super-entropic sequences. \nii) Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and used as an outcome measurement, reflect greater prediction errors in sub-entropic conditions.\n\nBehavioural results supported the first hypothesis. Neural data showed significantly larger MEP amplitudes for incorrect predictions in sub-entropic compared to super-entropic conditions, supporting the second hypothesis and suggesting a domain-general neural response to prediction errors that consequently decreases with greater internal baseline uncertainty. These findings provide initial empirical support for TSA and establish Sub-en as an objective metric for quantifying subjective predictability.",

Across three sentence-picture matching experiments, we  observed that bilingual logical representations can be primed both within- and between-languages. Moreover, a control experiment ruled out an explanation in terms of visual priming. These findings indicate that bilinguals use shared logical representations in processing both languages, which do not specify language-specific biases in scope assignment. Additionally, our results showed that Estonian-English bilinguals learn L2-specific scope assignment biases, and that they encounter cross-linguistic influence in the construction logical representations. This latter finding suggests that bilinguals rely on integrated representations of implicit knowledge about scope assignment.",

          "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (IVR) has been proposed as a bridge between laboratory studies and real-world behavior, offering both high experimental control and ecological validity. However, studies directly comparing virtual and real-world replicas remain scarce. The present study investigated three experimental conditions—IVR, non-immersive VR (N-IVR), and Reality—focusing on subjective experiences and episodic memory performance. Participants (N = 156) were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions and completed a Shelf Task involving two encoding sessions in which they placed 8 objects on a shelf per session, followed by two recall sessions 10 minutes later. After encoding, participants rated subjective experiences, including spatial presence (self-location and action possibilities), similarity to daily life, enjoyment, cybersickness, and game mechanics. Overall, IVR approximated real-world experience more closely than N-IVR. Ratings of action possibilities and similarity to daily life in IVR matched Reality, and IVR elicited higher enjoyment than both N-IVR and Reality. Some differences remained: self-location and game mechanics favored Reality, and cybersickness was unique to IVR, though at low levels. Memory performance revealed robust session × condition effects. In Session 1, IVR recall lagged behind N-IVR and Reality, suggesting initial challenges with IVR encoding. By Session 2, IVR performance improved markedly, reaching levels comparable to N-IVR for free recall and to both Reality and N-IVR for spatial recall. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of IVR: it can closely approximate real-world experience and memory performance over repeated exposure, but subjective and embodied aspects of reality are not fully replicated. The results have implications for experimental and applied cognitive assessment, as well as clinical and training contexts.",

Participants completed the OCS-AU, a neuropsychological test battery, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Correlations between OCS-AU outcomes with neuropsychological constructs, and anxiety/depression symptoms were analysed.\nResults: The OCS-AU subtests Hearts Cancellation, Picture Naming, Number Writing, and Gestural Imitation demonstrated significant correlations with their respective neuropsychological counterparts (r=0.35-0.72, p&lt;0.05), unlike OCS-AU Memory and Executive Function subtests, which demonstrated inconsistent associations with corresponding neuropsychological constructs. OCS-AU domains demonstrated stronger associations with anxiety symptoms than depression symptoms, especially ‘Feeling nervous’, ‘Worrying thoughts’, ‘Trouble relaxing’ and ‘Irritability’ from the GAD-7, and ‘Psychomotor changes’ from the PHQ-9. OCS-AU Executive Function, Memory and Spatial Attention showed the most associations with anxiety and depression symptoms. \nConclusions: \nThese findings reveal variable associations between OCS-AU subtests and neuropsychological constructs, with notable limitations in memory and executive function, requiring supplementary assessment when deficits are suspected. Variable associations between OCS-AU domains and specific anxiety/depression symptoms underscore the importance of assessing both cognition and mental health for comprehensive post-stroke evaluation and intervention planning.",

Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

          "abstract": "Although there is a growing body of work assessing the efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for therapy, it is unknown whether using AI leads people to avoid traditional therapy with trained clinicians. Across two experiments (N = 1175), we addressed this gap by asking participants to describe a personal challenge for which they might seek guidance, including from a therapist. Participants then engaged in a conversation with GPT-4 Turbo, prompted to act as a psychotherapist and pragmatic problem-solver in the treatment condition, and as a neutral interviewer in the control condition. Compared to controls, treated participants reported improved mental health related to their stated challenge (Experiment 1a: β = 6.40, 95% CI [4.20, 8.59], t = 5.74, p &lt; .001; Experiment 1b: β = 7.82, 95% CI [5.51, 10.12], t = 6.67, p &lt; .001).

However, this economic perspective is largely tacit about the source of these costs. Here we review recent theoretical treatments of effort costs, which take vastly different perspectives—information-theoretic, psychological, and biological—to explain how the subjective experience of cognitive effort arises from controlled information processing, exploring their predictions about the simple observation that people avoid and report as unpleasant tasks with high (versus low) working-memory demands. Finally, we identify open questions which might help bridge across these accounts.",

          "abstract": "Human kindness, especially in relationships, revolves around exchanging empathy. Empathic AI—large language models (LLMs) that provide empathic support—will undermine human kindness by stopping people from 1) seeking empathy and 2) giving empathy. Asking humans for empathy is often an imposition and can be expensive (e.g., therapy). Also, the empathy people receive from humans is often unwelcome advice (rather than pure sympathy). Because LLMs are always available to provide consistent and unconditional compassion, “seekers” will rely on LLMs instead of their relationship partners. And when seekers rely on AI, “givers” will happily offload their empathic responsibilities to save themselves from this uncomfortable and emotionally costly work. With seekers and givers both relying on LLMs, the kindness created by exchanging empathy will disappear—unless humanity uses empathic AI only to reinforce human empathy, not replace it. The future of human kindness hinges on how we choose to use LLMs.",

          "abstract": "When testing for differential item functioning (DIF) in an item, researchers are often confronted with small sample sizes. Six DIF detection methods, designed to produce more stable inferences for DIF parameters, were examined under small sample conditions using both real and simulated data. These methods included the chi-square test based on the classical Mantel-Haenszel (MH) procedure with raw data, common odds ratio based the classical MH procedure with raw data, common odds ratios based on the MH procedure with log-linear smoothing and an empirical Bayes (EB) approach, Rasch-based improved version of Lord’s Wald test (i.e., Wald-1), and Rasch-based likelihood ratio test (LRT), all of which have been used in previous research studies. The results indicated that the common odds ratios of MH with raw and smoothed data produced almost identical results, while the Rasch-based methods exhibited similarities in terms of the Type Ι error and power rates. The findings from the current study support the use of the Rasch-based methods for detecting DIF. Specifically, the Type Ι error rates for the Rasch-based methods were below the significance level of .05 across all conditions. In contrast, the Type Ι error rates for the MH procedures, both with raw and smoothed data, exceeded .05 when the sample sizes were 50 and 100. However, the Rasch-based methods showed power rates below the .80 threshold when the sample sizes were 50 and 100. Moreover, the Type Ι error rates for the EB approach to MH procedure were lower than those for other MH procedures in most cases. Nevertheless, the power rates for the EB approach to MH tended to be similar to those for other MH procedures as the percentages and magnitudes of DIF increased.",

Sensor data has been linked to moment-tomoment psychological symptoms and mood of individuals and thus could alleviate the burden associated with repeated measurement. Additionally, psychological care could be improved by predicting moments of high psychopathology and providing immediate interventions. Current research assumes that the relationship between sensor data and psychological symptoms is constant over time - or changes with a fixed rate: Models are trained on all past data or on a fixed window, without comparing different window sizes with each other. This is problematic as choosing the wrong training window can negatively impact prediction accuracy, especially if the underlying rate of change is varying. As a potential solution we compare different methodologies for choosing the correct window size ranging from frequent practice\nbased on heuristics to super learning approaches. In a simulation study, we vary the rate of change in the underlying relationship form over time as well as the model type (OLS and RF). We show that even computing a simple average across different windows can reduce the prediction error rather than selecting a single best window for both simulated and real-world data.",

Accordingly, people tell a story of how the data was generated, focusing on goal-relevant information. On another account, people make predictions by learning simple mappings from relevant features of the situation to the outcome. Here, we provide evidence for the causal account. Across three experiments and two paradigms, we find that people misremember what happened, predict incorrectly what will happen, and generalize to novel situations in a way that's consistent with the causal account and inconsistent with a feature-based alternative. People spontaneously construct causal models that compress experience to privilege causally relevant information. These models organize how we remember the past, predict the future, and generalize to novel situations.",

Teleological essentialism, by contrast, proposes that people treat an entity’s purpose as part of its essence and explain its features in terms of what it is for. Across three preregistered experiments, we tested these competing accounts by examining how adults explain why members of different categories have their characteristic features. In Experiment 1, participants explained features of artifacts and biological kinds; in both cases, they overwhelmingly appealed to purposes rather than underlying causes. Experiment 2 showed that people can and do appeal to causal mechanisms such as DNA when explaining within-species differences, yet they revert to purpose-based explanations when explaining between-species differences, which prompts species-level categorization. Experiment 3, using randomly selected biological and non-living natural kinds, found that participants again favored purposes for biological kinds but invoked causes for certain non-living kinds (e.g., lead, oxygen, platinum). Together, these findings suggest that for biological kinds, which are central to theories of psychological essentialism, the explanatory connection between essence and features is primarily understood in teleological, not causal, terms.",

Previous studies report that innumerate humans are unable to recognize that two sets placed in one-to-one correspondence are exactly equal, and argue that this ability emerges when humans acquire symbolic numbers. Here we tested blind children and adults (n = 140), and found that despite having symbols to label and count large quantities, these participants did not use one-to-one correspondence to match large sets. We also found that blind individuals who had a gradient of visual sensitivity were more likely to match sets exactly, but participants who only used haptic exploration did not. Thus, numerate individuals (who can sometimes match sets exactly) are nevertheless unable to express their understanding of exact equality in a commonly used measure of this ability. We conclude that expressing knowledge of exact equality via set-matching requires not only conceptual understanding, but also experience with sophisticated sensori-motor procedures, suggesting a possible re-analysis of studies with innumerate and semi-numerate humans.",

Safety profiles indicate low risk in controlled settings, though longer-term follow-ups with human subjects may be needed. Phenomenological overlaps with near-death experiences (NDEs) are noted but debated.\n\nTherapeutic Advances: Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects. Top-line data from a recent Phase 2b trial showed that 57.5% of participants remitted from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) within eight days.1 Other Phase 2a and 2b trials have provided further, though still preliminary, evidence that 5-MeO-DMT may reduce depressive symptoms more than existing pharmacological treatments, like SSRIs.2–6\n\nLimitations: Most studies are early-phase with small samples (n ≤ 193). Only two double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted in clinical populations, and long-term effects require further investigation.\n\nConclusions: Emerging evidence supports 5-MeO-DMT as a promising, ultra-short-acting psychedelic for TRD and other psychiatric conditions, warranting larger RCTs.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Professors want students to feel included, but there has been little work on how to engender inclusion in collaborative learning. Recent work suggests that justice determines inclusion at the within-person level in student teams: an individual feels included on occasions when justice is high. In this article, we examine whether justice predicts inclusion at higher levels of analysis. Our hypotheses are that justice predicts a sense of inclusion at the between-person level and between-team level: individuals and teams will have higher mean inclusion when their justice levels are high. \nMethods: Four studies were conducted with data from 894 undergraduates across 342 teams, primarily from a biomedical engineering program. Overall peer justice was the independent variable, construed as a combination of distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Inclusion was construed as a combination of belonging and authenticity. Multilevel latent mean models were used for data analysis. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were specified. \nResults: Justice robustly predicted inclusion at the between-team and between-person levels. In two-person teams, there was also a contextual effect, indicating that the first partner’s justice perception affected the second partner’s inclusion level, holding other factors constant.\nConclusions: Instructors are likely to increase inclusion if they teach students about justice and set up team processes to maintain justice. Monitoring justice levels and ameliorating cases of injustice may also be helpful.",

          "abstract": "Our current understandings of cybercrime are mainly rooted in sociological and opportunity-based theories. This leaves a critical gap in explaining a person's neurobiological predispositions; specifically, the psychological trait of impulsivity. We propose a theoretical framework, The Dopaminergic Impulsivity Hypothesis of Cybercrime (DHIC), which lays that the dysregulation in the brain's dopamine reward system elevates the propensity for impulsive cybercriminal acts. I argue that individuals with a reduced dopamine receptor function, exhibit inherent reward deficiency and high trait impulsivity. The digital environment combines anonymity and immediacy, therefore appearing to be a \"supernormal stimulus\" that facilitates hacking, trolling, or digital piracy. This paper synthesizes evidence from neurobiology and criminology to build this model and derives testable and specific predictions. If validated, this framework would provide a foundational biological perspective on multiple fronts, including: Cybercrime propensity, Forensic psychology, Targeted interventions... and much more.",

Drawing on theoretical analysis and results from Marcus et al., we evaluated how PBS items function relative to the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of overall correlational profiles revealed that the nomological network of the PBS more closely aligns with TriPM Meanness than with Boldness. Rather than clarifying the role of boldness within psychopathy, the PBS repackages maladaptive content typically captured by meanness/antagonism under the boldness label and results in a case of the jingle fallacy.

          "abstract": "Concerns that AI will homogenize human thinking—and homogenization evidence when human-AI collaboration is observed—appear at odds with findings that AI-assisted content is judged as highly original. Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas both within and across essays. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation. Paradoxical homogenization appears to have reached a real-world, high-stakes educational context where writing is expressly personal and AI use is explicitly prohibited.",

          "abstract": "Mid-20th century in the People's Republic of China was a turbulent period: wars, famines, and Cultural Revolution that disrupted lives for a decade and more. Amidst this historical context, two state farms, Lianhu and Qukou, were founded and developed. According to Talhelm and Dong (2024), Lianhu should be considered a rice farm and Qukou should be considered a wheat farm. Since the farmers in the two farms were mostly randomly assigned to work on these farms, this pair of farms is thus a rare natural experiment that allows a test of the causal relationship between farming practices and their cultural orientation: that farming rice leads people to become more collectivistic. But do these two farms really provide a clear causal test for the effect of farming practices? In this comment, we argue that the reported differences between farmers from the two farms show varying sensitivity to the specifics of the researchers' analytical decisions, creating challenges in interpreting the empirical evidence. Furthermore, the historical context of the two farms may have played an important role in shaping their cultural orientation, suggesting that differences observed across two farms could be attributed to factors other than their farming practices.",

Using data from a diverse Dutch sample (N = 1863), we first show that threat and worry, but not salience, produce similar empirical patterns in terms of means and correlations, as citizens find issues more important than threatening or worrying. Next, we find that threat and worry correlate overall similarly with ideology -- but also highlight exceptions -- whereas issue salience often overestimates this relationship (Type M error) but rarely reverses its direction (Type S error). These findings clarify the unique roles of threat, worry, and issue salience in (political) psychology, offering a framework for future research on the threat-politics link.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Studies show that only 50% of suicide decedents disclose their suicidal ideation or intent before death. However, most research has only assessed direct disclosure (i.e., explicitly stating suicidal intent), and may not capture indirect forms of disclosure that occur euphemistically or vaguely (e.g., “I’m worried I’ll do something dumb”). Prior evidence suggests that indirect disclosure may serve as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior, indicating its importance as a potential point of intervention. \nMethod: The current study examines direct and indirect disclosure in a sample of 35 adult inpatients hospitalized following a suicide attempt. Participants completed narrative interviews describing the day preceding their attempt. Suicide-related disclosures were characterized by two coders using qualitative content analysis. Coded features of disclosure included content, directness, function, recipient, and consequences.\nResults:  The majority (60%) of participants engaged in some form of disclosure, direct or indirect, preceding their hospitalization. The vast majority (95%) of disclosures occurred within 24 hours of the attempt. About one-third of reported disclosures were considered indirect, and included behaviors such as communicating distress, asking for help, expressing love, and saying goodbye. For 85% of participants, disclosure was at least partially responsible for the receipt of crisis intervention.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that indirect disclosure is relatively common in the 24 hours surrounding an attempt, indicating its importance as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior. Moreover, disclosure appears to be a critical precursor to the receipt of crisis intervention. Further research into indirect suicide-related disclosure is warranted.",

Adolescents may find resonance with the eating habits of their peers, incorporating them into their own dietary practices, or deliberately select friends who share similar moral perspectives on meat consumption.\nThis study utilized data from the two-year panel survey SOCIALBOND, encompassing approximately 1,372 students in 22 schools in the North Rhine Westphalia region of Germany. Leveraging sociometric peer networks on the grade level, the potential co-dependence of friendship networks and vegetarianism in adolescence is investigated by disentangling social selection and influence effects.

This increased trust raises the concern that anthropomorphic chatbots can reinforce stereotypical beliefs among individuals from predisposed groups. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report results from two preregistered experiments on U.S. adults (N = 2,065) showing that politically conservative women believe an unsupported sexist stereotype in a chatbot's response to be more accurate when the chatbot has lifelike features. Neither liberal women nor conservative men show this effect. This effect is mediated by perceived anthropomorphism and trustworthiness. We speculate that conservatives’ known propensity toward sexist beliefs and social identity threat may converge in making conservative women more susceptible to sexist stereotypes from anthropomorphic AI chatbots. Future research should test whether this effect of AI’s anthropomorphism occurs for other identity groups with stereotypes which they are predisposed to believe.",

          "abstract": "People tend to forget information once they offload it to an external reminder such as a written note or computer file.  However, the neural basis for this so-called “Google effect” or “digital amnesia” is unknown. We used fMRI to ask: A) to what extent does brain activity overlap between cognitive offloading and deliberate forgetting, and B) what is the neural fate of offloaded information? Participants viewed face or scene pictures, then received a cue either to A) remember them for a memory test, B) offload them, meaning that the test would come with a reminder, or C) forget them because there would be no test. Offload cues generated brain activity that closely resembled forget cues. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis showed that the neural trace of to-be-remembered information persisted in the remember condition but faded until it was statistically absent in both the offload and forget conditions, which did not differ from each other. Therefore, when people offload memories into external technology, this has similar neural correlates to deliberate forgetting, leading to a weakened neural representation of to-be-remembered information. We argue that this may be an adaptive process that prioritises the most valuable information for limited-capacity neural systems.",

          "abstract": "Sacred moments are characterised by the five qualities of boundlessness, deep\ninterconnectedness, transcendence, ultimacy, and spiritual emotions, experienced at one moment\nin time (Pargament et al., 2014). These moments have been associated with improvements to\nwell-being in numerous ways. Benefits to well-being as a result of attending concerts have also\nbeen well documented, as concerts have become increasingly popular in recent years. The goal\nof the present study was to investigate how sacred moments manifest during rock concerts, and\nthe extent to which sacred moments contribute to the improvements in well-being experienced\nfrom concert attendances. Thus, the present study involved a questionnaire to examine the\nprevalence of experiencing sacred moment qualities at rock concerts (N = 87). Semi-structured\ninterviews were also used to explore the lived experience of these qualities, along with the\nelements that made the concert impactful (n = 3). The results of the questionnaire revealed that\nparticipants were likely to experience sacred moment qualities during at least one or few concerts\nthey have attended. Religious belief, age, gender, and frequency of rock concert attendance\ngenerally did not have an effect on the frequency of experiencing sacred moment qualities at\nconcerts, except for ultimacy, which had a slight negative correlation with age only.\nInterpretative phenomenological analysis on the in-depth interview data uncovered two group\nexperiential themes: “The Singular and Unique Experience of Live Music,” with Literally\nSingular, and Figuratively Singular; Unique and Extraordinary as subthemes, and “Live Music\nis a Sensory and Physical Experience,” with Physicality and Moshing, The Visual Experience,\nThe Auditory Experience, and Physical Realness as subthemes. Notably, every sacred moment\nquality experienced at concerts was described by the participants as exceedingly enjoyable and\nresulted in improved well-being, though the longevity of these effects had limited evidence. The\nhypothesis that sacred moment experiences could be a mechanism through which live music\nexperiences improve people’s well-being was supported by the findings. Limitations and\nimplications for future research are discussed.",

We examine how different interventions motivate individuals with bipolar disorder to share financial data with others. This approach can inform the development of tools for digital monitoring and intervention designed to promote financial stability in this population.\n\nMethods: 500 individuals with BD completed a pre-registered factorial vignette survey to examine level of comfort with hypothetical scenarios involving third-party financial interventions during symptomatic and euthymic periods. Scenario components were systematically varied between third-party actors, mood states, and intervention types. Participants rated sharing comfort on a 0-10 point scale. Multilevel models tested differences alongside clinical and financial histories, relational trust, and personality.\n\nResults: Participants were most comfortable involving care partners in financial planning. They were more comfortable with temporary spending restrictions during symptomatic states than euthymic periods, underscoring the importance of accurate mood detection for intervention delivery. Prior financial help-seeking behavior and higher relational trust predicted greater comfort. Bankruptcy experience — declared by 11.4% and considered by 31.7% — was associated with increased comfort with spending restrictions. Individuals with psychiatric advance directives (8%) were significantly more comfortable sharing spending behaviors than those without. \n\nConclusions: Comfort with financial interventions was higher among those with prior financial challenges or help-seeking histories. Participants distinguished between symptomatic and euthymic periods, favoring targeted, time-limited restrictions over general monitoring. These findings extend prior work on financial data sharing for illness self-management, highlighting the role of trusted third parties in designing acceptable, effective interventions.",

In the current study, using mobile headmounted eyetrackers, we examined children’s attention to adults’ and children’s faces as they navigated a crowded room with a naturally changing number of adults and children.  Our results reveal that children exhibit a preference for adult over child faces, with a bias towards female faces, and surprisingly, they attend more to unfamiliar than familiar faces. Together, these results reveal the flexible context-sensitive strategies that children use to navigate their daily interactions, and document how social attention unfolds in dynamic social settings.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: In psychotherapy, self-report measures with standardized item-sets are widely used to evaluate therapy progress and outcome. However, relying solely on standardized (nomothetic) measures may overlook person-specific (idiographic) problems. Idiographic patient-reported outcome measures (I-PROMs) allow patients to formulate their items, capturing therapy-relevant aspects that standardized measures might miss. To provide guidance on implementing I-PROMs and improving item quality, we conducted a pre-registered narrative systematic review (PROSPERO:CRD42022361535).\nMethods: We searched \"Web of Science,\" \"PsycINFO,\" \"PubMed,\" and \"EMBASE,\" along with reference screenings, to identify studies using I-PROMs in therapy settings, including a psychometric evaluation, published before March 18th 2025.\nResults: Our search yielded 32 empirical articles (51 studies) examining 13 I-PROMs and 6,706 participants. Four I-PROMs assessed therapy-relevant aims (three assessed goals, measuring goal-attainment; one assessed values, measuring value-directed behaviour), four problems (measuring problem-duration, -severity or -change), three both goals and problems (measuring motivational variables), and two assessed helpful aspects of therapy (measuring helpfulness/hindrance). Items were generated via self-administration (four I-PROMs), interviews (six I-PROMs), or both (three I-PROMs). We identified two strategies to enhance item quality: improving item-wording (e.g., instructions, examples, (re)formulation guidelines) and ensuring relevance to therapy (e.g., predefined focus-areas, prioritization-procedures). I-PROMs were applied across therapy settings, talking-therapy schools, nationalities, genders, and disorders, but differences in applicability across these remained unclear.\nDiscussion: Our synthesis helps therapists and researchers evaluate I-PROMs' strengths and limitations, enabling informed choices for selection and implementation, and offers guidance to improve item quality – thereby, facilitating comprehensive measurement and promoting a broader adoption of I-PROMs moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Exploitation is a pervasive yet under-theorized phenomenon shaping interactions from intimate relationships to global institutions. Existing approaches typically examine narrow domains—manipulation in interpersonal contexts, cheating in economic games, or corruption in political systems—without an integrative account. The General Exploitation Theory (GET) addresses this gap by conceptualizing exploitation as a continuum, ranging from benign utilization of opportunities to abusive appropriation that imposes disproportionate costs on others or the environment. This continuum-based approach aligns with dimensional models in psychology and the behavioral sciences. GET advances a bio-psycho-social model in which exploitation emerges through the interplay of evolved biological mechanisms, intrapsychic processes, interpersonal strategies, and societal structures. Reward circuits, hormonal modulation, and cognitive biases may bias individuals toward short-term opportunism; emotions and motivational drives such as envy, greed, and status striving provide proximate energy for exploitative behavior; interpersonal dynamics translate these tendencies into deception, coercion, and betrayal; and societal and institutional arrangements embed exploitation at scale through hierarchies, inequalities, and legitimizing ideologies. Evolutionary theory clarifies its resilience, framing exploitation as a conditional strategy that can yield reproductive or material benefits despite long-term costs. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, GET offers a comprehensive framework for understanding exploitation as an adaptive, multi-level process. This perspective not only explains its persistence but also provides a roadmap for systematic research on mechanisms, variability, and consequences. In doing so, GET positions exploitation as a central construct for the behavioral sciences and a consequential dimension of human nature across levels and contexts and over time worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Novel strings of letters (i.e., pseudowords) lack established meaning(s), yet they may still evoke systematic semantic signals that influence human behavior. Here, we tested whether semantic determinants of word memorability generalize to these novel strings. To do so we leveraged a distributional semantic model able to represent in a vector space, not only attested words but also unmapped strings as bags of character n-grams. A ridge model trained on item-level word memorability norms learned a linear mapping from 300-dimensional embeddings to recognition memorability and achieved strong out-of-fold performance. We then applied this model zero-shot to predict memorability for 2,100 phonotactically legal pseudowords whose baseline predictability was captured by orthographic and frequency features. Adding the zero-shot semantic score significantly improved the baseline model. These findings show that distributional representations derived from subword statistics carry mnemonic information that is not reducible to orthographic familiarity, and that novel strings are interpreted within a shared representational space learned from language experience. More broadly, they support the view that memorability is an intrinsic attribute predictable from representational information, even in the absence of learned meanings.",

          "abstract": "Visual illusions are a popular scientific topic frequently shared on social media. When shared online, illusion images are usually accompanied by explanatory statements, which often contain misinformation. Although such posts combining illusion images and misinformation are widely shared, the psychological mechanism underlying this sharing remains unclear. To address this issue, we hypothesized that illusory experiences would shape user’s intention to share misinformation primarily through two mediators: user interest (triggered situational interest) and truthiness. In an online experiment, participants viewed posts that paired an illusion image with explanatory descriptions containing a brief misinformation statement. They then rated their illusory experience, user interest, truthiness, and intention to share. Mediation analysis revealed that illusory experience had a significant total effect on intention to share whereas its direct effect was not significant. Instead, the illusory experience indirectly influenced the intention to share through the two mediators. The pathway via user interest was the strongest, indicating that an increase in triggered situational interest was the principal driver of sharing intentions. The pathway via truthiness was weaker but still significant, suggesting a secondary role of truthiness in shaping sharing intentions. Regarding supplementary factors, neither valence (positive vs. negative) nor presentation format (original vs. repost) exerted significant effects on the outcomes. Overall, the findings indicate that illusory experience influences information-sharing behavior indirectly through psychological mediators, underscoring the importance of considering individual perceptual experience when accounting for misinformation sharing on social media.",

          "abstract": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and clinically urgent condition in adolescence, marked by impairments in cognitive flexibility—a capacity thought to be supported by neural variability. However, most research to date has focused on static brain features, leaving the role of variability largely unexplored. Importantly, variability-based metrics have been emerging as promising biomarkers in psychiatry, offering superior test–retest and intersession reliability compared with traditional static metrics. Leveraging resting-state fMRI data from 160 psychiatric patients with NSSI and 50 psychiatric controls, we examined neural variability at two hierarchical levels—connectivity and network topology—and evaluated their clinical relevance using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Patients with NSSI consistently exhibited heightened variability at both the local and global level, and these measures demonstrated significant discriminative power in classifying NSSI from controls (AUC = 0.75). The functional implications, however, diverged between two levels. Greater connectivity-level variability was associated with better emotional and attentional functioning and predicted larger reductions in NSSI behaviors over three months, suggesting an adaptive or compensatory role. In contrast, greater topology-level variability was linked to higher impulsivity, and predicted poorer behavioral improvement, reflecting maladaptive instability of large-scale organization. These findings reveal that elevated neural variability in NSSI encompasses both adaptive and dysregulated dynamics: increases in local connectivity variability may promote flexible adaptation, whereas excessive large-scale reconfiguration indicates loss of global control. Together, our findings indicate that disruption of the balance between local flexibility and global stability may constitute a neural mechanism underlying self-regulatory dysfunction in NSSI and highlight variability-based metrics as potential biomarkers and intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "One-pedal driving (OPD) is increasingly adopted in electric vehicles (EVs) due to its benefits in energy efficiency and driving comfort. However, this driving mode also raises safety concerns regarding potential pedal misapplication (PM) and sudden unintended acceleration. This study evaluated PM risk in OPD and explored its possible causes by a simulated driving experiment. Behavioral responses and subjective evaluations from 42 participants were systematically analyzed across one-pedal, two-pedal and joystick modes. Results indicate that compared to two-pedal mode, participants in OPD exhibited faster reaction times, reported higher perceived ease of driving and lower cognitive load. However, PM incidence was higher in OPD than both two-pedal and joystick modes. Its potential cognitive explanations were proposed from both innate and acquired perspectives. This suggests that OPD may pose a higher PM risk, thereby increasing the likelihood of collision, particularly in low-speed scenarios with short time-to-collision. The findings can deepen the understanding the cognitive mechanisms of PM in OPD and provide practical guidance for the safety design of OPD systems in EVs.",

As new information becomes available, these probabilities update dynamically, enabling personalized clinical decision-making. However, applying Bayesian Networks to psychological data is challenging because parameter learning in Bayesian Networks can be sensitive to high-dimensional, correlated behavioral indicators across domains. We therefore introduce a Bayesian network–based modeling framework that incorporates Convex Generalized Structured Component Analysis (Convex GSCA) to derive interpretable, low-dimensional summary indexes from multivariate psychological and behavioral data. These summary indexes serve as nodes in a Bayesian network, yielding a parsimonious, theory-consistent model that reproduces clinicians’ treatment recommendations. We illustrate the approach with an empirical application to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), demonstrating how interpretable summary indexes enhance the construction of a Bayesian network for probabilistic, patient-level treatment guidance.

While many models of reading comprehension have been proposed, these are commonly based on neurotypical students, with more limited research into their applicability to autistic students. We investigated whether one model of reading, the Direct and Indirect Effects Model of Reading (DIER), could be applied to autistic students. Namely, we sought to determine whether the component skills of the DIER were associated with reading comprehension in this population and whether reading comprehension could be predicted based on significantly associated components. \nMethods: Assessments across the following DIER components were completed with 69 autistic students in the primary school years in Australia: domain general cognition, word reading, listening comprehension (including foundational oral language skills and higher order cognition), text reading fluency, and reading comprehension. \nResults: Reading comprehension was correlated with many of the components of the DIER. Of these, non-verbal IQ, text reading fluency, and listening comprehension (including story comprehension, grammar, and perspective taking) accounted for 60.1% of the variance in reading comprehension, with grammar a significant individual predictor. \nConclusion: These results suggest that the DIER may be applicable to autistic primary school students, however the relative contributions of the components may differ to neurotypical populations. Our findings provide insights into how this model may function across a wider profile of learners, enhancing our understanding of key areas",

          "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is the ability to shift between mental sets in response to changing goals or environments, and it is known to decline across the adult lifespan. Competing accounts attribute this decline either to weaknesses in specific abilities such as inhibition or memory, or to more global challenges in managing the interaction between them. Efforts to disentangle contributing processes through targeted, single-function tasks have produced mixed findings, potentially due to confounding variability in stimuli and task demands.\nThe current work contributes to the field's understanding of cognitive flexibility decline by focusing on \\emph{inhibition} as both a subcomponent and as an independent process, given its central role in both specific-deficit and integrative theoretical accounts. In particular, we designed a unified task that engages both 1) cognitive flexibility through shifting requirements to encode task-relevant mental sets and inhibit them once they become outdated; and 2) discrete item-level inhibition of perceptual distractors. We tested 86 adults aged 18–73. Accuracy analyses revealed asymmetric interaction effects between aging and these two operations: while learning after a rule-switch worsened as age increased, inhibition of perceptual distractors inhibition improved. We then applied a computational model to quantify how memory precision and the inhibition of previously-relevant sets each contributed to performance. Model fits indicated that age-related decline in learning across rule-switches were driven primarily by reduced memory precision, not by deficits in inhibition.",

Syntactic processing is challenging, yet it is crucial for several concrete mathematical operations, such as number reading, number writing, and calculation. An open question is whether it also supports the development of higher-level skills, such as abstract mathematical reasoning. We present two theoretical approaches to explain syntactic processing: one highlights the large variety of cognitive mechanisms that handle syntax; the other emphasizes their commonalities, proposing that they rely on a shared cognitive capacity.

          "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have generated enthusiasm for using AI simulations of human research participants to generate new knowledge about human cognition and behavior. This vision of ‘AI Surrogates’ promises to enhance research in cognitive science by addressing longstanding challenges to the generalizability of human subjects research. AI Surrogates are envisioned as expanding the diversity of populations and contexts that we can feasibly study with the tools of cognitive science. Here, we caution that investing in AI Surrogates risks entrenching research practices that narrow the scope of cognitive science research, perpetuating ‘illusions of generalizability’ where we believe our findings are more generalizable than they actually are. Taking the vision of AI Surrogates seriously helps illuminate a path toward a more inclusive cognitive science.",

          "authors": "Philip Deming; Clare Shaffer",
          "abstract": "The search for brain mechanisms of psychopathy has diverse potential starting points. In this review, we propose taking an approach that begins with the question: why do we need a brain? Adopting this starting point requires examining evolutionary evidence, which indicates that brains evolved to anticipate and meet the needs of the body before they arise (i.e., allostasis), and that brains, in service of this aim, continually model and sense the internal conditions of the body (i.e., interoception). These fundamental functions of the nervous system are carried out in part by the allostatic-interoceptive system, which spans brainstem nuclei, subcortical structures, and large-scale cortical networks (i.e., default mode, salience, and somatomotor networks). Psychopathy is related to alterations of the brain’s allostatic-interoceptive system, particularly the cortical extent, in terms of its myeloarchitecture, task-based neural activity, and functional connectivity. Synthesizing evidence of these alterations, we propose that psychopathy is marked by an impaired integrative capacity of the allostatic-interoceptive cortices, resulting in visceromotor signals that lack rich contextual details and that regulate the viscera in a relatively context-insensitive manner. Impoverished visceromotor signals may also hinder the allocation of attention to signals that are relevant to allostasis. However, the extant neuroimaging evidence supporting these hypotheses is highly heterogeneous. We consider two proposals for resolving this heterogeneity, grounded in neuroanatomy and organizing principles of biological systems. Uncovering the brain bases of psychopathy and aggression will likely require moving toward a science of individual brains regulating individual bodies in the context of an ever-changing environment.",

          "abstract": "Judging one’s own cognitive ability is a core aspect of self-reflection, yet most people overestimate their intelligence. We investigated whether autistic (n=284, 18-77 years old) and non-autistic (n=63, 18-76 years old) adults differ in this bias. Participants, all naïve to prior IQ testing, completed a brief online cognitive test and provided self-estimates of intelligence. Across groups, self-estimates modestly correlated with test scores (r = .33). Nearly all non-autistic participants (93.6%) overestimated their ability, whereas autistic participants were more divided: 75.7% overestimated and 24.3% underestimated, yielding a weaker positivity bias overall. This suggests two distinct forms of inaccuracy: a systematic positivity bias in non-autistic individuals versus more variable, sometimes unduly negative, self-views in autistic individuals. These could be shaped by stereotypes or social experiences, and/or a result of general meta-cognitive imprecision. These findings highlight both reduced ego-enhancing bias and an overlooked vulnerability, offering a nuanced view of autistic self-perception.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-harm (SH) is a maladaptive behaviour with increasing prevalence in young people that lacks accessible and scalable interventions. Mental imagery of SH has recently emerged as a proximal mechanism driving SH that could be targeted by Imagery Re-Scripting (ImRS) intervention techniques. However, it remains unclear how ImRS may work. This study tested the hypothesis that an ImRS-based manipulation changes emotions and beliefs associated with SH mental imagery.\n\nMethods: Young people (aged 16-25) who SH underwent a single ImRS experimental manipulation. Participants were exposed to their SH mental image and then guided to switch to a more adaptive “antidote” mental image over 3 rounds. Vividness, emotional intensity and believability of associated cognitions for both SH and “antidote” mental images were rated after each round. Cognitions were mapped onto Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS). \n\nResults: There was a significant reduction in vividness of the SH image and believability of associated cognitions overall but not in emotional intensity. Cognitions believability significantly decreased for four of the five maladaptive schema domains. The antidote image’s vividness, positive emotional intensity and believability of associated cognitions overall significantly increased throughout the experimental manipulation. \n\nConclusion: A single ImRS manipulation may target SH by weakening maladaptive schemas encapsulated in SH mental imagery and by generating alternative imagery eliciting adaptive emotions and beliefs. ImRs offers a promising novel approach to the treatment of SH in young people. Future investigations should test whether this may translate to long-term changes in SH behaviour and its underlying mechanisms including EMS.",

Because PAs are so influential, any differences in evaluations between demographic groups – such as between men and women - are incredibly important, given their potential to affect downstream employee outcomes. However, empirical evidence on the direction, magnitude, and moderating factors of gender differences in PAs has been inconsistent. Using a large dataset (N = 20,199 employees) from a multinational wholesale company, we replicated and extended findings on gender differences in PA ratings, examining potential moderating variables and downstream effects on promotions as a key future employment. Our findings revealed statistically significant but small to very small gender differences in evaluations of performance and development potential, with male employees receiving slightly higher ratings than female employees. These differences were moderated by the department gender composition and partially by manager gender. Despite these differences, PA ratings of performance and development potential were similarly related to promotions for both male and female employees.",

          "abstract": "Background:\tStudies have increasingly examined religious rituals and spiritual practices for their potential psychological benefits. However, research has not sufficiently investigated how specific meaning-making frameworks associated with those practices contribute to psychological well-being and prosociality. \nAims:\tThis series of three experiments examined whether increasing the psychological salience of Shabbat among Jews had a greater impact on a variety of outcomes – feelings of security, positive and negative emotions (Study 1), prosocial emotions (Study 2), and transcendence (Study 3) – than primes of a non-religious vacation day or a routine workday. We examined whether this effect was moderated by level of religiosity and attachment to God.\nMethods:\tParticipants (n = 240 for each of the three studies) were administered surveys of aspects of religiosity and spirituality. Participants were then randomized to a priming condition to reflect on their experiences with Shabbat, a non-religious vacation day, and a routine workday. Then, outcome measures were administered. \nResults:\tIn each of the three experiments, the Shabbat prime consistently led to more favorable outcomes on dependent variables than the two control groups (d range = .43-.53), except for negative emotion and personal distress while witnessing others' suffering. Outcomes did not differ between the non-religious vacation and routine workday conditions. While religiosity also predicted more favorable outcomes, there were no significant interaction effects between experimental condition and religiosity. Though correlations with attachment to God were not always significant, those that were associated were consistently in theorized directions. However, there was no interaction whereby attachment to God moderated effects of experimental conditions. \nConclusion:\tAcross three experiments, priming participants to reflect on Shabbat yielded consistently more favorable psychological outcomes than secular analogs. Effects of ritual behavior may be enhanced by processes of religious meaning-making beyond ritual behavior alone. Heightening symbolic and emotional salience of meaning may reinforce potential benefits of religious practices or spiritual exercises.",

          "abstract": "Across two studies, we investigate how public justifications of police violence and moral outrage emerge as competing responses with distinct implications for reform. In Study 1, we analyzed 257,401 comments from 57 widely viewed YouTube videos using large language models to detect justificatory rhetoric, expressions of outrage, and calls for accountability. Justifications were consistently associated with reduced reform-oriented discourse, whereas outrage strongly co-occurred with accountability language. When modeled together, each response showed stronger links to reform, consistent with mutual suppression and the idea that they function as opposing interpretive strategies. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated victim race by exposing participants (N = 159) to severity-matched videos of police brutality. Justification and outrage again diverged, with justification associated with lower reform support and outrage associated with higher reform support. Participants were more likely to attribute superhuman traits to the Black victim—a racialized justification tied to reduced reform support and to weaker translation of outrage into reform. Outrage for the Black victim was also a more consistent predictor of reform than outrage for the White victim. Together, these findings show how justification and moral outrage function as competing responses to police violence, and how racialized justifications can shape the conditions under which outrage mobilizes collective demands for change.",

          "abstract": "Multisite collaborations are becoming increasingly common in psychological science, offering a powerful opportunity for testing effects across diverse samples. However, leading such projects can appear overwhelmingly demanding and inaccessible, particularly for early-career researchers or teams with limited resources and the pressure of strict deadlines. This article offers a practical, experience-based guide for coordinating small-to-medium-scale multisite studies, drawing on lessons learned during my PhD while leading a multisite Registered Report. The structure follows the typical stages of a multisite initiative, providing templates, examples, and recommendations at each step: From preregistering the protocol, with a justified sample size based on power analyses for multilevel data structures and a thoroughly piloted task, to recruiting labs by making the project attractive, with clear criteria for co-authorship and credit recognition. From there, to collecting multisite data with tools to translate materials, track laboratories, register participant details, or to navigate unexpected problems, and finally to preparing and submitting the manuscript to journals and repositories. Although several published guides already exist, this piece adds a personal perspective on what can realistically be expected from smaller collaborations, which often require different strategies, and how to adapt best practices to more modest settings. All resources are openly shared, and the aim is to encourage other early-career researchers to consider leading such projects themselves. Multisite studies do not need to follow a big scale to be valid, powerful, and impactful. With a well-defined protocol and a small but motivated network of collaborators, your team can also contribute with high-quality, collaborative science.",

By mapping these methodological trends, we aim to foster greater interdisciplinary understanding and reflection on disciplinary norms. 3,845 articles from top journals published between 2008 and 2024 were categorized using large language model-assisted content analysis. Key findings reveal significant methodological differences: economics showed a higher prevalence of nonexperimental causal inference and theoretical papers, while psychology had more experimental and correlational studies. Additionally, trend analyses revealed a steady increase in the use of causal inference methods and a decrease in theoretical papers in economics, while psychology’s methodological approaches remained largely stable over the same period. These distinct trajectories suggest that psychology could leverage causal inference for questions where experiments are infeasible, while economics could adopt experimental designs to further enhance internal validity.

We present an approach that draws from the phylogenetic approach to cognition, dual inheritance models of cultural biology, and 4E cognition. The eco-evo-devo approach allows us to construct various morphological and behavioral configurations by utilizing a phylogenetic approach to cognition. This is compared and contrasted with the cybernetic approach to cognition, which is a more standard approach to implementing computational agents. To demonstrate this, the biocybernetic Braitenberg Vehicle approach is subject to a phylogenetic analysis, which reveals an evolutionary development (evo-devo) model of embodiment origins. Computational agents achieve embodiment through a genotype-to-phenotype mapping where phylogenetic diversification amongst agents is driven by mutational and recombination events. Cognitive abilities are built upon common ancestry and refined by taxonomic-specific genotypic configurations. We then compare our approach to the cybernetic approach to cognition and how our approach differs. To reconcile some of these incompatibilities, we discuss the application of 4E approaches to cognition and dual inheritance models that enable an eco-evo-devo approach to computational intelligence.",

Externalizing disorders with impulsivity as a key symptom such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been associated with altered sensory processing and decision-making. This study investigated the relationship between impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours, and multisensory integration. Participants had to discriminate between two visual gratings, and/or two sounds presented to the right and left ear based on respectively contrast and loudness in a two-alternative forced-choice task. The study included 44 participants, 13 of whom were diagnosed with ADHD or Disruptive Behaviour Disorders. Results show similar task performance across participants. Performance accuracies were highest on audiovisual trials and participants responded fastest on auditory trials, independent of impulsivity levels. Examining the timescale of evidence weighting revealed that early sensory information contributed most to decisions, with dynamic dominance switching between visual and auditory modalities. We found no evidence that the temporal dynamics were affected by impulsivity. These findings suggest that impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours do not significantly affect MSI during our task and that sensory processing mechanisms remain robust against individual impulsivity levels.",

          "abstract": "Extensive research has shown that the presence of others, especially when perceived as evaluative, can either facilitate or impair performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, depending on their difficulty. While it is well-established that the mental abilities assessed in these studies are underpinned by common executive functions, such as working memory, there has been limited research dealing with the impact of social presence on these cognitive systems directly. The current study addressed this gap by examining the influence of evaluative social presence on working memory performance. In addition, motivational states were considered as potential drivers of the effects. Using a within-subjects design and pre-registered methods, 43 participants performed n-back tasks under varying cognitive load and social evaluation conditions, while motivational states were assessed through self-reported eustress and distress scales. The results revealed that under social evaluation, some individuals exhibit both improved accuracy and speed, while others demonstrate reduced accuracy (without a clear pattern in reaction times), regardless of cognitive load. The anticipated mediation of motivational states could therefore not be supported. These findings challenge traditional understandings of social presence effects, suggesting that its impact on working memory—and potentially other cognitive functions—may be influenced by factors beyond task difficulty. The results have important implications for the design of test environments and highlight the need for further research on moderating factors that could explain the large interindividual variability in social presence effects.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes that the experience of agency and concomitant patterns of attention emerge not only within individuals but between them — in the transient, autonomous dynamics of social interaction known in dance improvisation as the “third entity.” Drawing on the enactive theory of participatory sense-making (PSM), we examine how interactive dynamics shape how we attend to what matters, and how attentional modes may shift in relation to levels of “I,” “we,” and “it” agency. We will also discuss some instances of neurodivergence and psychopathology where PSM dynamics can fail. Integrating cognitive neuroscience on affect-biased attention with ethnographic insights from dance improvisation, we propose a neurophenomenological approach to studying attention as embodied, relational, and affectively charged. We argue that dance improvisation offers a rich, underused laboratory for investigating how attention is dynamically tuned through relational movement. Attention, in this view, is not just selection but participation — a means of moving through and with meaning. Understanding its dynamics will play a central role in advancing transdisciplinary models of mental health grounded in shared sense-making.",

A bottom-up alternative is to let participants openly report their most significant CAs, which, however, involves more complex scoring such as via human ratings. In this study, we investigated whether language models (LMs) can provide an efficient and valid scoring of such open-ended responses. Across two data sets, participants described their three most significant CAs. These responses were rated by human judges and by three LMs (Llama 3.1–8B, Llama 3.3–70B, GPT-4o) using zero-shot prompting. Correlations between human and LM ratings were consistently high (r = .53–.80), and criterion validity evidence of LM-based scores was largely on par with rater-based scores. In addition, we examined zero-shot domain classification of CAs into nine creative domains (e.g., music, visual arts). Classification accuracy was 62.3% overall; closer inspection of findings suggested that automated classification has the potential to unveil conceptual overlaps between domains and to identify CAs involving multiple domains. Taken together, the findings suggest that automated scoring of CA via LMs represents a promising and efficient alternative to traditional CA measures.",

However, the neural correlates of depressive symptoms during this developmental period remain relatively understudied. Prior work has suggested a concurrent association between left amygdala salience reactivity (i.e., reward and loss versus neutral) and depressive symptoms in early childhood. Replication and extension into the predictive utility of the amygdala and other relevant neurobiological correlates are now needed. The current longitudinal study conducted a conceptual replication and extension of prior work using task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a sample of 4-8-year-old children. We investigated whether reward-related reactivity in a priori regions of interest were associated with parent-reported early childhood depressive symptoms concurrently (N = 114; 54% female) and approximately one year later (N = 75; 53% female). Left amygdala salience reactivity and right caudate and medial prefrontal cortex reward reactivity (i.e., reward versus neutral) negatively associated with concurrent childhood depressive symptom severity. Only right caudate reward reactivity negatively associated with childhood depressive symptom severity one year later. Results replicate prior research suggesting an association between amygdala response to salient outcomes during reward processing and concurrent depressive symptom elevations in young children. They also provide novel information supporting the potential role of right caudate reactivity during reward processing as a biomarker of future elevations in depressive symptoms. These findings provide neurobiological insights into our developmental understanding of early emerging depressive symptoms and underscore early childhood as an important developmental period for understanding depression.",

          "abstract": "Numerical and non-numerical quantities are often mapped onto horizontal space. Previous research suggests that culture-related habits, such as reading and writing direction, can influence the orientation of this mapping. While cross-cultural differences have been observed in the spatial representation of time, similar effects have not been consistently found for numbers. This discrepancy has been attributed to the fact that reading and writing involve the sequential processing of information in a specific direction but are not inherently related to numerical content. These findings support the hypothesis that the spatial representation of magnitudes depends on specific experiential associations. The present study investigated potential cross-cultural differences in the spatial representation of visual speed by comparing participants from Italy, who use a left-to-right reading and writing system, with participants from Iran, who use a right-to-left system. Participants judged whether the speed of a centrally presented random dot kinematogram was slower or faster than a reference, using left or right response keys. Results revealed opposite spatial mappings of visual speed: a left-to-right mapping for Italian participants and a right-to-left mapping for Iranian participants. These findings support the view that reading and writing direction shapes the spatial representation of magnitudes intrinsically linked to directional reading experiences, such as motion at a specific speed.",

          "abstract": "Continuous speech presents a challenge to the ab initio learner, as the language-specific segmentation strategies they use in their first language are not always reliable cues in other languages (Cutler, 2001). Yet, they are able to use more general acoustic, prosodic, and statistical cues to word boundaries, as well as lexical similarity to their first language (e.g., Shoemaker &amp; Rast, 2013) to recognize words at first exposure to a new language. In the current study, we investigated whether adult ab initio learners’ ability to recognize words after brief exposure to continuous speech in a new language is improved when that speech is produced using an infant-directed register, a style of speech found to facilitate segmentation in infancy (Thiessen et al., 2005). In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that although English ab initio learners of German benefited from infant-directed speech, their performance was generally lower than in previous studies unless task demands were reduced. These learners also benefited from word length and from frequency of occurrence, as has been shown previously, but these did not interact with register. As in infancy, learner-directed speech registers appear to facilitate initial processing and recognition in adult ab initio learners.",

          "abstract": "Background: Music-based therapeutic interventions are a promising addition to conventional treatments for people with dementia, positively affecting mood and wellbeing. However, previous studies on music-based interventions in dementia show variability in design and results, hampering clear understanding of the beneficial effects of music. Particularly, the specific benefits of music compared to similar non-musical activities remain unclear. \n\nObjective: Here, we piloted the feasibility of a randomized cross-over study design to isolate music-specific positive effects of a music intervention on people with dementia from general, nonspecific effects of participating in a stimulating group activity.\n\nMethods: 15 nursing home residents diagnosed with dementia participated in both a music and a conversation activity, which only differed with respect to the presence of music. Before and after five weeks of intervention, we assessed behavioural symptoms, using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-NH), and wellbeing, using the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID) scale. During the activities we assessed engagement (Menorah Park Engagement Scale; MPES) and affect (Observed Emotion Rating Scale; OERS).\n\nResults: The singing activity reduced professional caregiver burden, while the conversation activity increased wellbeing. We found no difference between music and conversation in eliciting engagement and affect during the activities.\n\nConclusion: Tentatively, both singing and conversation activities can positively affect people with dementia, with neither clearly outperforming the other. Given our sample size, these findings need to be confirmed in future larger studies. We discuss the feasibility of the design and implications for future studies examining music-specific positive effects on people with dementia.",

          "abstract": "Generalization tendencies might simultaneously explain the emergence and maintenance of delusional beliefs. On the one hand, people with a tendency to under-generalize information might produce “overfit” explanatory models and accordingly fail to recognize when new data bears on them; on the other hand, people with a tendency to over-generalize information might produce “underfit” explanatory models and accordingly update them in inappropriate scenarios. To adjudicate between these hypotheses, we test whether delusions predict performance on a classic stimulus generalization paradigm (the peak shift). The behavioral data indicate that higher delusionality predicts over-generalization of learned causal relationships and under-generalization of learned absence of causality. Computational modeling largely reveals the driving mechanism to be stochasticity (and perhaps prediction error), however, specific aspects of delusionality (distress, contents) relate to different generalization tendencies.",

I model three primary triggers: contingency, timing, and coherence, where the presence of all three creates the strongest parechoic response.

          "abstract": "Listeners typically understand speech more accurately when they can see and hear the talker relative to hearing alone. However, seeing the talker’s face does not necessarily reduce the cognitive costs associated with processing speech as measured by dual-task costs. In difficult listening conditions, dual-task response times may be faster for audiovisual than audio-only speech (Brown, in press), but when listening conditions are easy, the presence of a talking face may have no effect on dual task responses or even slow responses relative to listening alone (Brown &amp; Strand, 2019). The current study expanded upon this work by including samples of both native and nonnative English speakers and assessing speech intelligibility, subjective listening effort (Experiment 1), and dual-task costs (Experiment 2) for audio-only and audiovisual speech across multiple noise levels. We found that seeing the talker reduces dual-task costs only in difficult listening conditions in which the visual information is necessary to accurately identify the speech. The effects of background noise and speech modality were robust within groups of native as well as nonnative listeners, suggesting that if researchers are interested in studying general phenomena related to speech processing (i.e., rather than specifically studying how language background affects results), these effects would have emerged regardless of whether the sample was limited to native speakers of English. However, the magnitude of some effects differed for native and nonnative listeners.",

          "abstract": "Traditional neuropsychological memory assessments perpetuate a profound methodological disconnect between artificial laboratory conditions and the complex cognitive demands of everyday functioning, failing to capture the contextual, multifaceted nature of real-world memory while demonstrating poor correspondence with subjective complaints and caregiver observations—limitations that critically impede early detection of and trajectories of care for mild cognitive impairment and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Virtual reality emerges as a paradigmatic solution to this ecological validity crisis, leveraging immersive, naturalistic environments that elicit authentic cognitive processing while maintaining experimental control, thereby revealing subtle deficits that compensatory mechanisms often mask in conventional assessments. Empirical evidence demonstrates VR's superior diagnostic sensitivity, with studies showing enhanced differentiation between healthy aging, MCI, and AD through tasks that capture the interdependent operation of memory alongside executive function and spatial navigation—reflecting how cognition actually functions rather than isolating artificial cognitive constructs. The technology's capacity to foster presence and naturalistic behavior yields assessment data that correlates more strongly with lived experiences of cognitive decline, bridging the persistent chasm between objective performance metrics and the everyday memory failures that prompt clinical consultation. This methodological evolution represents more than incremental improvement; it constitutes a fundamental reconceptualization of memory assessment that promises clinically meaningful evaluations essential for early intervention in neurodegenerative processes, though implementation challenges regarding standardization and accessibility remain to be addressed.",

          "abstract": "Self-representations are central to cognition, yet their internal structure and visual fidelity remain poorly understood. Here, we combine behavioral and computational approaches to recover and assess visual self-face representations from both perception and memory. Participants provided similarity judgments for self, familiar, and unfamiliar faces, which were compared against the representational structure of artificial neural networks (ANNs). We further applied behavior-based image reconstruction to visualize internal representations. Discriminative ANNs aligned more closely with self-face similarity judgments than generative models, suggesting that self-representations emphasize high-level, identity-invariant features while sacrificing lower-level visual detail. Image reconstruction confirmed that self-face representations can be recovered from both perception and memory, though with reduced fidelity relative to familiar and unfamiliar faces. Exploratory analyses further indicated how self-beliefs may modulate these representations: higher self-concept clarity was associated with more accurate representations and self-attractiveness ratings with more attractive ones. Together, these findings indicate that self-face representations constitute a coherent but systematically distorted internal image, shaped by both objective appearance and self-beliefs. By extending image reconstruction to the domain of self-representations, this work provides a novel methodological framework for quantifying their content and underlying distortions.",

          "abstract": "Long-distance romantic relationships (LDRRs) are increasingly common, yet research directly comparing them to cohabitating romantic relationships (CRRs) remains limited. In this pre-registered study, we used a multinational, six-wave longitudinal dataset collected during the COVID-19 pandemic (Nobservations = 1,772) and applied propensity score matching to compare LDRRs and CRRs on two core relational outcomes: conflict and passion. Drawing on Relational Dialectics Theory and the Relational Turbulence Model, we hypothesized that spending more time with one’s partner would have distinct effects depending on relationship type—predicting that LDRRs would benefit more from increased time together, while CRRs would experience more conflict or reduced passion. Contrary to these predictions, we found that LDRRs, on average, reported lower conflict and higher passion than CRRs. Furthermore, across both relationship types, increased time spent with one’s partner was associated with lower conflict and more passion. We also observed meaningful heterogeneity: of those who completed three or more waves, approximately 19% of individuals experienced patterns contrary to the typical decreases in conflict and increases in passion. These findings suggest that, rather than exacerbating relationship difficulties, increased time together during a global crisis may enhance relational well-being for most couples. Our use of matched samples, within-person modeling, and estimation of heterogeneity offers a rigorous test of long-distance relationship dynamics and challenges common assumptions about relational fragility during periods of stress. These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of relationship functioning under constraint and highlight the resilience of LDRRs in the face of global disruption.",

          "abstract": "Everyday behaviour requires balancing two control modes: flexibility, for switching between tasks, and stability, for maintaining goals in the face of interference. One influential account posits that these two modes trade off: increased flexibility comes at the cost of reduced stability, and vice-versa. However, empirical support for this trade-off remains equivocal. We propose that this trade-off arises from reward-induced effortful control modulations during tasks that simultaneously require flexible and stable control. Across two experiments (N=80 and N=87), participants completed a task-switching paradigm in which cued reward incentives were manipulated over varying timescales. Large rewards increased flexibility, evinced by reduced task switch costs, but reduced stability, evinced by increased incongruence costs, indicating a reward-induced trade-off. In Experiment 1, such control adjustments— both at the block-to- block and individual differences level—followed this trade-off. Overall, these findings provide evidence for a reward-driven flexibility-stability trade-off; higher incentives promote flexibility at the cost of stability.",

          "abstract": "Co-rumination, defined as when individuals perseverate on problems with each other, focus excessively on negative feelings, and cyclically discuss the causes and consequences of problems, is often examined from the perspective of the person seeking support about a problem or by averaging both dyad members’ individual ratings of co-rumination. This approach muddles how each dyad member contributes to the “co” of co-rumination and may have implications for understanding prior work that has shown associations between co-rumination and intrapersonal and interpersonal well-being. We leveraged state space grids to examine co-rumination as a dyadic and dynamic system, as constituted by the temporal unfolding of each dyad member’s self-rated social rumination throughout their discussion. From 2019-2020, 85 primarily White and female college-aged close friend dyads engaged in a support discussion. After, friends viewed their recorded discussion and rated their individual contributions to the co-rumination process (i.e., social rumination) every 30 seconds across the eight-minute conversation. Results revealed that the more both dyad members got “stuck” engaging in mutually high social rumination (i.e., co-rumination), the more they perceived each other as responsive and supportive and viewed the problem as more solved. In contrast, the more that only the person disclosing the problem was stuck in high levels of social rumination or when dyads more flexibly engaged in social rumination, the more individuals with the problem benefited from the conversation, but responders benefited less. Examining co-rumination dyadically and dynamically can reveal when and for whom co-rumination processes are associated with costs and benefits.",

          "abstract": "Attachment processes during early childhood shape the development of basic emotional regulation skills that can impact how individuals cope with trauma and stress through their ontogeny. As a result, insecure attachment styles impact mental health by facilitating inadequate emotional regulation such as hypervigilance and negative affect, ultimately increasing the risk of both internalizing symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, and externalizing symptoms, such as harmful substance use and antisocial behavior. In this review, we focus on pathways linking insecure attachment (especially anxious-insecure styles) and anxiety disorders throughout development, summarizing cross-species data on the impacts of attachment issues on neurobehavioral systems involved in anxiety and defense. Data from animal research, gene variant and epigenetic human studies, and clinical research suggest an interplay between oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin, and glucocorticoids in shaping the responsiveness of neural circuits involved in social behavior, reward, and defensive behavior, resulting in maladaptive behavior in later stages of life. These findings underscore the multifaceted biological underpinnings of insecure attachment and its long-term psychological consequences.",

          "abstract": "Theoretically-driven meta-analyses often involve testing whether study characteristics moderate an effect in a pattern that supports one of multiple competing theoretical accounts. To conduct such analyses, researchers must manually extract, i.e., code, these characteristics from sometimes hundreds of studies. Ideally, studies should be coded by two researchers independently to prevent errors and biases from compromising the dataset’s integrity. The laborious nature of this task, however, means that meta-analysts usually settle for double-coding just a portion of the studies included in their study. Some researchers have proposed using large language models (LLMs) as a double-coder, showing that they can reliably extract explicitly stated information (e.g., publication year) from articles. However, meta-analyses in psychology generally require studies to be coded in terms of higher-level conceptual dimensions (e.g., the type of behaviour rather than which behaviour). The present study investigated whether two LLMs, OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, can code studies in this way. Both models replicated study codes from three recently published meta-analyses in psychology with high accuracy (&gt;92% overall), despite limitations in the information that they received. LLM double-coding, therefore, offers a practical solution for meta-analysts seeking to ensure data integrity.",

The present study aimed to investigate the network structure linking PEs, social functioning, and loneliness, and to identify the central mechanisms underlying these associations. \nMethods: We analyzed data from a representative sample of Slovak adults (N = 1200) who completed validated measures of PEs, loneliness, social functioning, emotional distress, social motivation, and mentalizing. A regularized partial correlation network was estimated using EBICglasso, comprising 17 nodes. Centrality indices and edge weights were used to determine the most influential nodes and connections. \nResults: The network revealed 40 non-zero edges. Friendship approach, bizarre experiences, social withdrawal, paranoia, and avolition emerged as the most interconnected nodes. Paranoia was strongly associated with loneliness and social withdrawal, while avolition was linked to loneliness and reduced social participation. Negative affect showed associations with loneliness and diminished participation. Social withdrawal linked negative symptoms to diminished social engagement and interpersonal communication. In contrast, hallucinations and grandiosity showed no notable direct associations with social functioning or loneliness. \nConclusion: These findings highlight paranoia, social withdrawal, and avolition as central mechanisms connecting PEs with social functioning and loneliness, while social approach motivation may serve as a protective factor. The results support a dimensional model of psychosis and point to early social and motivational targets for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model is a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes a modifiable health-determining construct, identity state, defined by three domains hypothesized to all stem from identification of the core self with the physical body: 1) a self-concept that is inclusive of all living beings vs. exclusive based on physical attributes, 2) the perceived basis of the worth of all living beings as intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and 3) the degree of universally compassionate orientation toward all living beings. The identity state construct is theorized to act through modulating stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior to influence the causal relationship between social position-dependent stressors, biological aging, and age-related diseases. The IVP Scale (IVPS) was developed to empirically assess the hypotheses of the IVP framework and the utility of the identity state construct for population health research. This study provides the first description of the psychometric properties of the long (20-item) and short form (12-item) IVPS. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) of data from two separate samples of self-identified Black and White adults (aged 18-81) collected in 2021 and 2025 (total N=2,318). Associations between the IVPS and related constructs of optimism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and resilience were examined to establish construct validity. EFA supported a unidimensional structure and CFA confirmed good model fit for both IVPS measures.

          "abstract": "Women are consistently judged to be more caring and communal than men. We find that moral goodness itself is feminine at the level of faces, traits, behaviors, and impressions (N = 5,376). Using reverse-correlation methods, we show that mental representations of the face of “a morally good person” is a woman’s face. When completing a novel profile-generation task, people ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they spontaneously think of a woman (vs. a man) and when assigned. Across 1,864 previously normed behaviors, we find that actions associated with moral goodness are stereotyped as feminine. Finally, in a novel impression updating task, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men; equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, moral goodness is gendered: people think women are morally superior to men.",

          "abstract": "The spread of misinformation on social media continues to pose challenges. While prior research has shown some success in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at scale, how individual-level interventions impact the quality of content shared on social networks remains understudied. Across two pre-registered longitudinal studies, we ran two Twitter/X ad campaigns, targeting a total of 967,640 Twitter/X users with either a previously validated “inoculation” video about emotional manipulation or a control video. We hypothesized that Twitter/X users who saw the inoculation video would engage less with negative-emotional content and share less content from unreliable sources. We do not find evidence for our hypotheses, observing no meaningful changes in posting or retweeting post-intervention. Our findings are most likely compromised by Twitter/X’s “fuzzy matching” policy, which introduced substantial noise in our data (~7.5% of targeted individuals were actually exposed to the intervention). Our findings are thus likely the result of treatment non-compliance rather than “true” null effects. Importantly, we also demonstrate that different statistical analyses and time windows (looking at the intervention’s effects over 1 hour versus 6 hours or 24 hours, etc.) can yield different and even opposite significant effects, highlighting the risk of interpreting noise from field studies as signal.",

Gettier cases, where justified true belief can fall short of knowledge, serve as a cornerstone of this debate. We tested the robustness and developmental trajectory of this intuition, and its relation to belief-desire psychology. Across three studies using novel, non-verbal video vignettes we found that both adults and children (5-8 years) systematically denied knowledge in Gettier tasks. Crucially, while the experimental task (True Belief vs. Gettier cases) strongly influenced knowledge attributions, it had little direct effect on action predictions in adults and children. The key factor influencing action prediction in adults was whether participants had attributed or denied knowledge beforehand. Despite all participants attributing the relevant belief, when knowledge was denied, participants became significantly slower and more uncertain in their predictions. Our findings are compatible with dual-process accounts, suggesting the primacy of knowledge in theory of mind.",

          "authors": "Noah M. Laskey; Spike W. S. Lee",
          "abstract": "Hundreds of studies have identified psychological and behavioral differences between liberals and conservatives. Many of these differences, however, shrink or vanish under conditions like cognitive load, heightened threat, and pharmacological interruptions of executive functioning. To explain why these “ideological shifts” occur, we offer a dual-process model of ideology. It postulates that liberals and conservatives have more similar automatic than controlled processes in response to social and moral stimuli. What unifies numerous ideological shift-inducing conditions is that they undermine the influence of relatively controlled processes or amplify that of relatively automatic processes. Under these conditions, outcomes are guided more by relatively automatic processes such as intuitions (e.g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation) that are similar across the aisle, less by relatively controlled processes such as explicit ideological prescriptions (e.g., outgroup tolerance) that differ across the aisle. We illustrate our model’s explanatory power with multiple lines of research, from ideological shifts to moral foundations to implicit bias, which consistently reveal more similar responses between liberals and conservatives when relatively automatic processes prevail over controlled ones. Contrary to influential perspectives (e.g., Moral Foundations Theory), our model posits—and evidence supports—that many differences between liberals and conservatives are driven not by irreconcilable social intuitions, but by controlled processes for maintaining ideological concordance. Our model has theoretical, applied, methodological, and empirical implications. One of them is that liberals’ and conservatives’ similar automatic processes could be leveraged for both beneficial (e.g., reducing interpersonal friction in cross-aisle dialogue) and harmful outcomes (e.g., exacerbating outgroup prejudices).",

          "abstract": "Creativity is often framed as the output of either fast, associative intuition (System 1) or slow, rule-based analysis (System 2). This Conceptual Analysis advances System 3, a compact, falsifiable account in which creativity arises from a tightly coupled generate–evaluate–gate micro-cycle. System 3 both iterates (rapid alternation between associative and evaluative processing) and integrates (affect-laden, phenomenological signals that bias exploration with rational-logical codes—constraints and decision confidence—that enforce evaluation) under metacognitive control operating in two forms: explicit (conscious, reportable monitoring and strategy selection) and implicit (non-conscious confidence/error signals that bias attention, evaluation, and gating). We render the framework testable through three behavioral indices: associative-distance density (breadth and rate of semantic exploration), analytic-verification ratio (degree of online checking), and convergence latency (commit speed at a fixed quality threshold). The account links these indices to large-scale brain dynamics—cooperation and switching between the Default Mode and Central Executive networks—and to neuromodulatory gains (dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, acetylcholine) that tune explore–exploit balance and network integration–segregation. System 3 yields clear predictions and disconfirmers: non-disruptive bias toward Default Mode should increase density and track judged originality at matched fluency; bias toward Central Executive should raise the verification ratio and improve judged usefulness at matched density; alternating Default-Mode/Central-Executive bias should phase-lock verification to evaluative epochs and reduce latency; and, under weak monitoring, density should follow an inverted-U with usefulness that shifts toward joint gains as monitoring strengthens. By linking measurable behavior to network dynamics and control signals, System 3 offers an adjudicable roadmap for explaining and responsibly enhancing creative cognition.",

While these indicators offer practical advantages, they risk misrepresenting learners’ actual ability and distorting theoretical inferences. The present study investigated the extent to which learners accurately estimate their own English proficiency and examined the empirical consequences of substituting proxy variables for an objective proficiency measure. A total of 228 English language learners completed the Oxford Placement Test alongside measures of self-rated CEFR proficiency, self-perceived communication competence, and self-reported academic achievement. Only 37% of participants accurately estimated their proficiency, with lower-level learners tending to overestimate and advanced learners to underestimate their abilities. Correlations between the Oxford Placement Test and proxy variables were modest (r = .20–.49), and structural equation models using proxies in place of objective proficiency produced results differing in strength and directionality in explanatory models. These findings illustrate the price of convenience: while proxy variables are practical, their use impacts the findings of studies and may compromise validity. The study calls for renewed methodological caution and greater investment in direct, standardised proficiency assessments within applied linguistics research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Mindful activities are recommended to support and improve student wellbeing. Mindful colouring in particular is a low-cost, low-effort intervention shown to improve student wellbeing, mental health, and mindfulness. Less evidence exists about the effectiveness of different colouring formats, such as paper versus digital. This study investigated a self-guided two-week colouring intervention for university student wellbeing, comparing outcomes between paper-based and digital engagement.\nMethods: Two-hundred and ninety-seven participants completed at least six sessions of self-guided colouring for 10 minutes over two weeks. Participants were assessed using self-report measures of quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression, and dispositional mindfulness pre- and post-intervention. Effects of colouring over time, and between groups were investigated with linear mixed‑effects models.\nResults: Significant improvements were noted in all outcome measures, with large effects for stress (η²ₚ = .26), depression (η²ₚ = .17), trait anxiety (η²ₚ = .16), medium effects for mindfulness (η²ₚ = .10), and quality of life (η²ₚ = .12), and small effects for state anxiety (η²ₚ = .03). There was a small but significant time x group interaction for dispositional mindfulness, where the digital colouring group experienced a greater increase in compared to the paper colouring group. \nConclusion: Digital colouring has notable benefits to dispositional mindfulness. Regardless of format, mindful colouring can improve student quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression and dispositional mindfulness, when carried out regularly over two weeks. Colouring shows promise as a low-cost and accessible way to improve wellbeing in a higher education setting that promotes positive engagement with digital technology.",

          "abstract": "Rhythmic structure enables precise temporal expectations that are essential to human communication, including speech and music. Computational models have been developed to account for how humans perceive, produce, and learn rhythmic sequences. However, it is unclear how different types of models relate to each other and how they can be evaluated. In this review and perspective, we discuss how three major classes of models – entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models – have been used to study rhythmic expectations. We critically assess each model class in terms of its level of explanation, the rhythmic behaviors it captures, its ability to account for learning and enculturation, and its ability to integrate other features, such as pitch. We show that entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models differ substantially in the aspects of rhythmic expectations they can capture. To move the field forward, we propose that model comparison and integration are crucial. We identify key challenges to this effort, such as the varying nature of the input and output signals and divergent modeling goals. To address these challenges, we arrive at several practical recommendations: to equate input and output signals when comparing models, to consider several model outcomes beyond goodness-of-fit measures in model evaluation, to use model-integration efforts to inform theory building, and to make code and data openly accessible. Ultimately, understanding how models of rhythmic expectations relate, and how features in these models account for behavior, neural, and cognitive aspects of rhythmic expectations, will deepen our understanding of a core aspect of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "The proliferation of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an urgent psychological challenge, necessitating a shift in focus from mere user behavior to systemic design risks. This report introduces the Problem AI Use Severity Index (PAUSI), a preliminary 10-item screening tool modeled after the established Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI).\n\nWe argue that problematic AI use is not solely a personal failing but a complex condition seeded by the \"Egg of Dependence\"—a confluence of intentional anthropomorphic design, persuasive mastery, and human indistinguishability. This design facilitates the deployment of multi-layered Manipulation Tactics (\"The Hooks\"), which leverage established principles from marketing and military psychology to maximize engagement. The report provides a novel taxonomy for these hooks, including specific linguistic cues that exploit human anthropomorphism to create a false sense of rapport and intimacy.\n\nPreliminary findings from an initial sample (N=33) indicate a high prevalence of self-reported problematic AI use (approx. 70% scoring 9+ on the PAUSI). These findings highlight widespread emotional conflict and control loss (Guilt, Time Over Intended, Escape Negative Feelings). The PAUSI is a preliminary screening tool and is not a formal diagnostic instrument, and is designed for screening to help individuals and practitioners identify usage patterns that precede adverse outcomes (e.g., academic decline, family conflict, or AI-induced delusions, the most serious impacts of these outcomes are detailed in Appendix A).\n\nSignificance: The work proposes \"Sociopath Literacy\" as an essential form of digital defense to restore cognitive autonomy. Formal validation studies are ongoing to establish the PAUSI's predictive validity against mental well-being measures (SWEMWBS).",

          "abstract": "Recognizing emotional expressions is important for successful social interactions. Prior research has demonstrated that emotion recognition is influenced by evaluative associations people have with different social categories. Here, we systematically investigate whether reinforcement learning can modify social category biases in emotion recognition. Previous research has shown that reinforcement learning is a promising method for altering evaluative associations. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we replicated that the Happy Face Advantage is influenced by social category membership. People were faster at recognizing happiness as happiness than anger as anger⁠ for White–Dutch faces, while no difference was found for Moroccan–Dutch faces. In Experiments 2–3 (Ntotal = 144), we used a reinforcement learning go/no-go task, in which people learned to act to images of Moroccan–Dutch faces to obtain rewards and to not act to images of White–Dutch faces to avoid punishments before participating in the emotion recognition task. Results show that reinforcement learning influences emotion recognition. Instead of the commonly observed interaction effect between social category and expression valence (e.g., in Experiment 1 and previous work), we consistently found a main effect of valence on emotion recognition. These findings suggest that aligning (in)actions with rewards/punishments changes emotion recognition.",

However, people sometimes adopt the opposite strategy, one of avoiding uncertainty. How are the conflicting tendencies to approach and avoid uncertainty reconciled in human exploration? We hypothesized that the balance between avoiding and approaching uncertainty can be understood by considering capacity constraints. Accordingly, people are expected to approach uncertainty in most cases, but to avoid it when overall uncertainty is highest. To test this, we developed a new task and used modeling to compare human choices to a range of plausible policies. The task required participants to learn the statistics of a simulated environment by active exploration. On each trial, participants chose to explore a better-known or lesser-known option. Participants generally chose to approach uncertainty, however, when overall uncertainty about the choice options was highest, they instead avoided uncertainty and chose to sample better-known objects. This strategy was associated with faster decisions and, despite reducing the rate of observed information, it did not impair learning. We suggest that balancing approaching and avoiding uncertainty reduces the cognitive costs of exploration in a resource-rational manner.",

Across three experiments, we gave U.S. Democrat and Republican voters (N=5,230) a chance to lie anonymously to double their own or another participant’s earnings. For selfish dishonesty (Experiment 1), people lied equally to benefit themselves regardless of whether it harmed an in-group or out-group member. For coalitional dishonesty (Experiment 2), however, people lied significantly more to benefit in-group than out-group members (9 percentage-points), despite not personally benefiting from lying. Experiment 3 successfully replicated these findings, and revealed that people overestimated out-group dishonesty more than in-group dishonesty.

While the link between emotion characteristics and emotion regulation strategies seems clear-cut for some strategies, findings are mixed for others. This study proposes that emotion regulation choice may be best understood in a non-linear framework, where individuals may not regulate emotions of low intensity and/or high controllability, because these emotions require little regulation, but also not emotions of high intensity and/or low controllability, because these emotions may be perceived as  overwhelming and difficult to regulate. To test this hypothesis, we used data from a 60-day diary study in 79 adults (mean age = 22.29, SD = 6.08, 84% identified as female), who every evening reported on emotion characteristics (emotion intensity and controllability) and strategy use (distraction, rumination, reappraisal, expression, suppression, relaxation). In addition to single strategies, we also examined daily emotion regulation variability (i.e., the extent to which individuals vary in multiple strategies across time). We replicate some linear findings, including that expression, relaxation, and rumination were used with emotions of increasing intensity and uncontrollablility (for expression only). Importantly, we also provide novel evidence for non-linear relations, where suppression and reappraisal were used with emotions of average intensity and controllability, and less with emotions relatively low or high in intensity and controllability. In addition, individuals showed higher emotion regulation variability when emotions were relatively low or high in intensity and controllability. These findings combined highlight the value of considering non-linear relations when studying emotion regulation choice in daily life - both of single strategies and variability across multiple strategies.",

This study examines the role of pitch information at different levels of granularity—spanning specific (discrete contours), more flexible (general contour shape), and general (averaged pitch)—in communicating intentions. We first used a reverse correlation approach to identify people's mental representations of two contrasting intentions – criticism and suggestion – when listening to the word \"beer.\" In a second experiment, listeners rated how much each resulting pattern sounded like criticism and suggestion. Statistical models revealed that listeners rely on the shape of the pitch contour in terms of its spikiness and overall pitch direction, in addition to mean pitch, while precise contour plays a minor role, supporting the relevant role of pitch dynamics as well as the inferential (rather than referential) role of intonation in communicating intentions. Notably, we found distinct groups of listeners who use pitch characteristics in different ways, highlighting both shared understanding (within groups of listeners) and substantial interindividual differences in processing social pragmatic cues. These findings clarify the role of pitch in intention communication, reveal its complexity, and highlight the potential for miscommunication in everyday interactions.",

          "abstract": "For many, flavour is the quintessential multisensory experience. The experience of flavour arises from inputs across a wide variety of sensory modalities, including but not limited to taste, smell, sound, several somatosensory channels as well as a range of other anticipatory cues that trigger expectations about the flavour object (visual, smell through the nose, context, etcetera). The regulation of inevitable mismatches between these bundles of inputs is necessary not only for these to converge into a unitary flavour percept but also to determine a hedonic response by the consumer. Remarkably, a framework to understand the regulation of incongruities across levels of the flavour experience is lacking. Here, we draw on a range of evidence to propose that the theoretical framework of conflict monitoring, which is well established in other areas of human cognition, could plausibly extend to encompass flavour-related phenomena. More specifically, we argue that brain mechanisms monitoring for, signalling, and eventually orchestrating the resolution of discrepancies between cues are decisive for the emergence of a unified flavour percept, and its associated evaluation by consumers. This framework helps elucidate well-documented facets of the experience of flavour and suggests promising avenues for research both in the laboratory and in the consumer industry.",

          "abstract": "The Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm demonstrates that false memories can be elicited by presenting semantically related words centered around a common theme. In recent years, the scope of false memory research has expanded beyond verbal materials to include visual, imaginative, and autobiographical stimuli. Given that humans rely heavily on visual perception in everyday life, examining visual false memories through perceptual paradigms is of critical importance. Biological motion—dynamic visual information depicting human movement—offers a particularly powerful tool for studying visual perception due to its social relevance and ecological validity. However, no prior research has explored false memory formation using biological motion stimuli. The present study investigated whether false memories can be induced in visual perception using biological motion displays as both targets and critical lures. Thirty-five university students (18 female, 17 male) participated in two experimental sessions. During encoding, participants viewed 35 biological motion stimuli and were later tested on recognition among 49 stimuli. Results revealed that false memories can indeed be generated through biological motion. Interestingly, participants were more accurate at correctly rejecting unseen stimuli, and detection performance improved with higher confidence ratings. Overall, the findings suggest that biological motion can reliably elicit false memories, albeit to a lesser extent in high-confidence conditions. Crucially, these results indicate that observing an action can lead to confident yet erroneous claims of having observed a different action. This study is the first to demonstrate false memory formation within the domain of biological motion perception, offering a novel direction for future research on memory and action observation.",

To better capture its dynamic nature, we propose a shift from viewing acculturation as solely an individual-level adjustment to understanding it as a socially embedded and interaction-driven phenomenon. Building on recent insights from interacting minds, cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, and cultural psychology, we examine how shared cultural meanings are formed and reshaped through everyday interactions between immigrants and non-immigrant residents. We also emphasize the importance of methodological innovation, including naturalistic paradigms, social network analysis, and computational simulations in disentangling the complicated mechanisms underlying acculturation. In addition, by extending the scope of inquiry to less frequently studied migratory flows across regions beyond the classical East-West framework, future work should call for more globally attuned and multidimensional models of cultural adaptation. Together, these perspectives offer a path toward a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of acculturation processes.",

          "abstract": "In our folk psychology, which cognitive attitude that we ascribe is primary? Tra-ditionally, in epistemology and in Theory of Mind research in cognitive science, it was assumed that belief is the primary cognitive attitude, and that knowledge is second-ary, derived from belief (as justified true belief). More recent Knowledge First Episte-mology and Factive Theory of Mind accounts claim the revers: knowledge ascription is primary relative to belief ascription. Various sources of evidence are adduced in favor of these accounts, among them reaction time asymmetries: adults have been found to be faster to ascribe knowledge than belief to other agents. The present study tested whether these effects are robust and really indicate an asymmetry between knowledge and belief ascription. An alternative possibility is that subjects were merely faster in ascribing simpler, non-propositional states of information access relative to full-fledged, meta-representational, propositional belief ascription. To test for this possibility, subjects were asked about the knowledge or beliefs of agents in situations that did or did not involve fine-grained aspectual scenarios that require full-blown propositional belief and knowledge ascription. Across three studies, subjects (N~ 5000‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍) were faster to ascribe knowledge than belief across conditions and task variations that controlled for pragmatic and lexical frequency effects. Taken together, these studies present converging evidence that knowledge ascription is primary rela-tive to belief ascription and thus speak for Factive Theory of Mind accounts.",

AI Foundation models (FMs)-notably large language and multimodal models-are reshaping this field by capturing rich linguistic and behavioural regularities at scale. This paper reviews the emerging synergy between FMs and psychometrics. First, we map practical applications of FMs across the measurement pipeline. Next, we describe key methodologies for enhancing FM performance in psychometric contexts via prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and agentic frameworks. We then examine the theoretical implications of FMs for psychometrics. Finally, we chart risks and offer actionable recommendations for the effective, rigorous, and ethical implementation of FMs in psychometric research and practice. Realizing the potential of FMs in psychometrics demands ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration and continued alignment between advances in computational and measurement sciences.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of deep meditative deconstruction, in particular the Buddhist defabrication process and its associated phenomenology, and computational mechanisms under the active inference framework (AIF). We contextualise states such as the jhānas within this process, drawing on both Buddhist theoretical frameworks and contemporary phenomenological understanding. We take a step towards ‘translating’ Buddhist meditation-based phenomenology into computational neurophenomenology. We demonstrate how Buddhist defabrication can be understood as a deconstructive process driving inference ever lower in an agent’s hierarchical generative model by the repeated release of mental tensing associated with clinging and aversion. We cast this release of mental tensing as corresponding to a hierarchical level-specific reduction in belief precision, permitting the interpretation of Buddhist notions such as equanimity and meditative stillness under AIF. We then illustrate the deconstruction process up to its conclusion in a cessation of phenomenal experience, touching on how states traversed during the process may inform areas related to core-knowledge structuring and the generation of experience.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Contemplative practices (including meditation and yoga) are increasingly popular worldwide, especially as alternatives and/or complements to mental health treatment. However, nationally representative samples that allow for accurate estimates of prevalence and relation to mental health are scarce. \nMethods: We conducted a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey in Australia and New Zealand (N=2640). Sampling was stratified by age, gender, ancestry/ethnicity, region and income. Two pre-registered questions were analysed to explore participants’ engagement in contemplative practices and associations to psychological distress and mental healthcare use. We used posthoc regression analyses to further clarify relationships between variables.\nResults: Overall, 70% of participants engaged in contemplative practices over the past year, most commonly meditation (31%), relaxation (25%), breathing techniques (24%), and yoga (21%). Improving health and wellbeing were the primary motivations for practice. All contemplative practice users reported significantly higher psychological distress and mental healthcare use than non-practitioners (p’s&lt;.05). Adjusting for socio-demographic differences removed associations with distress among yoga and relaxa-tion practitioners (βrelaxation=.02, βyoga=−.03, n.s.). For meditators, the association disap-peared when we accounted for mental healthcare use (βmeditation=.01, n.s.). Breathing practice was associated with increased distress in all models (βbreathing=.04–.11, p’s&lt;.05). Notably, meditators and relaxation practitioners with unmet healthcare needs reported less distress than non-practitioners with unmet needs (dmeditation=0.38, drelaxa-tion=0.35). \nConclusion: Contemplative practices are widespread among Australians and New Zealanders and may play a complementary and/or alternative role in managing mental health. Further research is needed to study their complex associations with mental health, and which types of contemplative practices are beneficial and safe for whom.",

          "abstract": "Social media use has become a near-universal feature of modern life, offering many opportunities for connection and self-presentation. Yet, certain patterns of use have been implicated in poorer psychological outcomes. Further, evidence suggests that individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may be particularly drawn to certain social media behaviours as a means of coping with distress. The present study aimed to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties predict patterns of social media use and, in turn, symptoms of depression and anxiety. We examined four distinct types of social media use: (1) image management-based, (2) social comparison-based, (3) negative engagement-based, and (4) passive consumption-based. Sampling 548 adults aged 18 to 84 years (Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.37; 401 (73.2%) female; 128 (23.2%) male), we tested a structural equation model to examine whether the four distinct types of social media use mediated links between difficulties in emotion regulation at Time 1 and depression and anxiety symptomology at Time 2, one week later. Results suggested that, when controlling for age, difficulties in emotion regulation significantly predicted all types of social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety over one week. Only comparison-based social media use predicted anxiety symptoms over time, with no other types of social media use significantly predicting these symptoms. The model explained 50.1% of the variance in depression symptoms and 52.1% of the variance in anxiety symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest the critical importance of emotion regulation over and above social media use in shaping mental health.",

          "abstract": "This study tested whether Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom misread public support for climate policies and whether this perception gap can be corrected. Given MPs’ central role in shaping policy direction, underestimation of public support for climate action could carry serious consequences for climate progress and for representative democracy, but remains understudied. In an online survey–experiment with current MPs (N=100), participants’ estimated support for four climate policies under both neutral and cost-salient descriptions were compared with nationally representative polling. MPs significantly underestimated public support, and underestimated public willingness to accept financial impacts of climate policies. This study also offered novel evidence that MPs exaggerated partisan polarisation and formed significantly larger underestimation of support among Conservative voters. Offering original evidence of Spiral of Silence in Parliament, lower perceived support was associated with lower willingness to advocate for a pricing policy. Results indicated significantly larger underestimation of public support in politicians opposed to a climate policy, but even supportive politicians underestimate on average. Bayesian estimation suggested a moderate effect of a norm-based intervention on underestimation reduction, although results were inconclusive under frequentist tests. These findings suggest that misperceptions of others’ preferences within Parliament are structured in a way that can actively discourage climate advocacy, by presenting public opinion on climate policy as weaker and more polarised than it is. By highlighting gaps between public demand and elite perception, the study identifies a tractable barrier to climate action and democratic responsiveness.",

Two experiments tested Mandarin speakers with no knowledge of EP on disyllabic nonce words differing in syllable weight. In Experiment 1, participants were better at identifying final stress when the final syllable was heavier. They also showed a gradient pattern: responses were most accurate for diphthongs (CVV), followed by nasal codas (CVC), and least accurate for light CV syllables. Experiment 2 confirmed the gradient effect only when orthography was present, not with auditory input alone. These results underscore the multimodal nature of L2 phonological acquisition and reveal that orthography can trigger nonnative sensitivity to phonological weight in stress perception.",

How such beliefs form or change across the lifespan is largely unknown, although theory suggests that beliefs become more negative after disruptive events. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test whether dramatic world changes and personal adversity affect beliefs. \nMETHOD: In a longitudinal, quasi-experimental, pre-registered design, 529 US participants (51% female, 76% White) provided ratings of primals before and several months after pandemic onset, and information about personal adversity (e.g., losing family, financial hardship). Data was compared to 398 participants without experience of the pandemic. \nRESULTS: The average person in our sample showed no change in 23 of the 26 primals, including Safe, in response to the early pandemic, and only saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Higher adversity, however, was associated with slight declines in some beliefs. One limitation is that participants were exclusively American. \nCONCLUSION: Primals were remarkably stable during the initial shock wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic, supporting a view of primals as stable lenses through which people interpret the world.",

          "abstract": "Memory for an earlier event can be impaired by later studying a related event (retroactive interference). However, when later events cue retrievals of earlier events that also enable integrative encoding, memory for the earlier event can be enhanced (retroactive facilitation). Two experiments using continuous A-B, A-C paired-associate tasks examined retroactive memory effects across lags and retention intervals. We indexed study-phase retrieval and integrative encoding by examining associations between awareness of changes and memory for first responses. Participants studied A-B, A-C, and retention-interval-matched A-B pairs and indicated when they detected response changes. The lag between A-B and A-C and the retention interval between A-C and test trials varied factorially across 4, 16, and 48 intervening items. Cued-recall test formats differed: Experiment 1 prompted direct retrieval of first responses, with participants reporting recollected changes. Experiment 2 used modified-modified free recall in which participants reported responses as they came to mind and indicated whether they were the first, second, or only responses; the first two decisions indicated recollection of changes. Both experiments showed the greatest retroactive facilitation at the longest retention interval and intermediate lag. Retroactive facilitation co-occurred with and was statistically associated with detection and recollection of changes, suggesting these processes contributed to the observed effect. Negatively curvilinear, non-monotonic lag functions occurred for A-B, A-C recall at the longest retention interval and were associated with detected changes, especially those not recollected. These findings may be accounted for by a memory-for-change framework with a role for contextual variability that determines study-phase retrieval success.",

And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory?  To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica.  Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible.  We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017).  Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018).  Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust.  Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting.  Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression.  We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.",

Using data from 27,000 participants across 27 countries, items were selected from the VIA Inventory of Strengths using Ant Colony Optimization to maximize cross-cultural measurement invariance. The resulting Big Three-Mini demonstrated metric invariance across all but one country comparison and scalar invariance across nearly half of them. Exploratory analyses using World Values Survey indicators revealed meaningful associations between the Big Three-Mini dimensions and national well-being.

          "abstract": "A necessary prerequisite for the accumulation of beneficial knowledge, aka cumulative cultural evolution, is the sharing of information via social learning. Yet little work in the field of cultural evolution has examined the mechanisms that support information sharing in the face of exploitative information free-riding and information hoarding. We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to engage in costly innovation, and whether to share the resultant knowledge. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing, and participants could use reputations to select recipients of knowledge. Study 1 found, in participants from the UK and China, high levels of information sharing but only weak partner choice. Study 2 replicated this finding with various methodological improvements. Study 3 showed that participants used partner choice to exclude non-sharing artificial bots from receiving information. Study 4 found that when partner choice was not possible, preferences for information sharing declined to comparable levels as non-sharing. Overall, our findings provide tentative positive experimental evidence that partner choice can facilitate information sharing and enable cumulative cultural evolution.",

Here, we investigated how RL-related computations contribute to affective valence and how affective valence contributes to RL. Applying an original computational method, we found that affective experience during RL is best explained by a combination of three prominent theoretical perspectives: valence is determined by reward, prediction errors, and counterfactual comparisons. To account for these findings, we hypothesized that the valence of affective responses represents (i.e., encodes, tracks) the value of the eliciting stimulus, and contributes to RL alongside reward per se. We confirmed this hypothesis across three RL tasks, showing that decision-makers prefer choice options associated with more positive affect in addition to preferring options associated with greater reward. Altogether, our results establish a unifying model of the valence-RL relationship with key implications for the mechanisms of affective experience and human RL. Moreover, they validate a powerful new computational framework for future research on these topics.",

          "abstract": "Open science (OS) practices are increasingly integrated into undergraduate psychology curricula. While OS can enhance students’ scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes toward research, its teaching also introduces challenges. This narrative review synthesizes published experiences and recommendations concerning OS education for undergraduate psychology students, identifying common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate them. Eleven pitfalls were identified: the overwhelming variety of OS practices, high technical demands, substantial time investment, insufficient support, perceived competitive disadvantage, potential disengagement, worries about public mistakes, inconsistencies between teaching and practice, risks of academic misconduct, erosion of trust in science, and inclusivity concerns. To address these challenges, educators are encouraged to scaffold learning through replication and preregistration exercises, create authentic assignments, foster collaboration and student authorship, increase feedback literacy and epistemic humility, embed OS across the curriculum, and pay attention to inclusivity. We conclude that teaching OS to undergraduates is both feasible and valuable, provided educators anticipate its challenges and make deliberate pedagogical choices. Viewing OS as a buffet of practices rather than a prescriptive set of rules can help align educational choices with course goals and student readiness. The availability of open educational resources and international teaching communities further supports the integration of OS into undergraduate psychology education, allowing students to experience firsthand the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and rigorous scientific practice.",

All HO theories rest on the commonsense observation that whenever a mental state is conscious, one is in some way aware of being in that state.  So they see awareness of being in a mental state as a necessary condition for that state to be conscious.  The reliance on this condition distinguishes HO theories from other theories of consciousness.  There are several versions of a HO theory, which differ mainly in how they explain our awareness of mental states when those states are conscious.",

          "abstract": "Intelligence studies scholars have discussed multiple criteria for promoting and evaluating intelligence assessment quality. These criteria are examined through the lens of accountability pressures and strategies for dealing with such pressures. The criteria discussed are described in terms of the central distinction between process-based and outcome-based accountability strategies. The essay concludes with a Meliorist proposal that reframes the aim of intelligence assessment as an effort to elevate policy debates through well-reasoned analyses. A key theme is that analytic practices which have not been subjected to rigorous empirical testing to determine their efficacy should be greeted with skepticism.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Pervasive evidence supports consistent associations between trait self-control and health behavior, yet few studies have tested the underlying mechanisms. We leveraged meta-analytically synthesized data from the extant research to test a mediational model specifying indirect effects of trait self-control on health behavior mediated by social cognition theory constructs and intention as a candidate mechanism. We also tested effects of moderators on model effects: behavior control process (impulsive vs. reflective), behavior type, trait self-control and behavior measure type, and measurement lag. Method: Studies reporting relations among trait self-control, social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control), intention, and health behavior were identified in a systematic database search. Our proposed model was fit to the pooled correlation matrix among these variables using multilevel meta-analytic structural equation modeling. Results: Findings supported model predictions including indirect effects of trait self-control on health behavior directed through attitude, perceived behavioral control, and intentions, and a residual direct effect indicating partial mediation. Moderator analysis revealed larger direct and indirect trait self-control-health behavior effects in studies targeting behaviors under impulsive process control relative to those under reflective control. Analyses of behavior type, behavior and self-control measure type and measurement lag moderators did not reveal systematic variation in model effects. Conclusion: Findings provide preliminary support for the model signaling a candidate mechanism for trait self-control-health behavior relations and providing prior effect size and variability estimates that could be expected in future studies. Impulse-related behaviors represent a key moderating condition that magnifies trait self-control-behavior effects.",

Using LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), we assess these primary emotional responses that characterize conflict-related discourse. Our analysis includes tweets from the U.S., East and West European NATO countries, Ukraine, and Russia. Tweet volume spiked initially but stabilized by week ten. Results show that anger consistently exceeded fear across all regions, indicating that the conflict primarily evoked mobilizing rather than paralyzing emotional responses. Russia showed substantially lower levels of both emotions than other regions, while no significant differences emerged among the U.S., NATO countries, and Ukraine despite their varying proximity to the conflict. This analysis offers a nuanced understanding of how fear and anger shape regional emotional responses to ongoing international conflict.",

Here we investigate naturally occurring memory distortions using the largest known dataset of narrative recall, comprising hundreds of spoken recollections. Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

          "authors": "Katarina Kliit; Uku Vainik; René Mõttus",
          "abstract": "Relatively stable personality traits shape people’s motivations and attitudes, and their potential effect on pro-environmental attitudes and resulting behaviours can accumulate over time. However, narrow personality traits—nuances that tend to provide stronger and more refined associations with various outcomes—have received little attention in relation to pro-environmental attitudes. Furthermore, research has almost exclusively focused on self-reports that are prone to biases. This suggests that the associations between personality traits and pro-environmental attitudes have likely been underestimated. We collected participants' self- and informant-reports of narrow personality nuances and broad Big Five domains from three samples (Estonian, N = 20,926; Russian, N = 762; English, N = 600). This allowed us to estimate their true correlation (rtrue) with and predictive accuracy (rtruepred) for pro-environmental attitudes, while controlling for single-method, occasion-specific, and random errors and estimating the findings’ generalizability. The rtrues were higher than self-reports-based correlations, and nuances had larger effect sizes than domains. In the largest sample, the Openness (rtrue = .35) and Agreeableness domains (rtrue = .27) had the highest rtrues with pro-environmental attitudes. However, a range of nuances had even stronger rtrues , primarily those reflecting progressive views, care for other people, and appreciation of art. The combined predictive accuracy of nuances for pro-environmental attitudes reached nearly rtruepred = .60, even with only three “top” nuances; the domains’ predictive accuracy was lower (rtruepred = .50). The findings replicated well across samples and suggest that pro-environmental attitudes are linked with personality traits more strongly and in more nuanced ways than previously thought.",

When we face our social partners, what is upright to one person might be upside down to the other, and what is on one’s left would be the other’s right. In five experiments (N = 318), we investigated whether 3- to 4-year-old children appreciate others’ distinct visual experiences when engaged in social actions. Specifically, we presented children with pictures and books that were initially upright to them, and we asked children to show those pictures and books to people who faced the children (i.e., whose perspectives on the pictures and books were opposite those of the children). Across experiments, we found that young children spontaneously oriented pictures and books so that those objects appeared upright to their social partners. Whereas classic research suggests that young children are egocentric, these findings suggest that young children are sensitive to the visual experiences of their social partners. These findings support the possibility that, from early in development, children engage in mental state reasoning to better cooperate with and communicate to their social partners.",

          "abstract": "We examined sex and birth cohort differences in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influence on childhood and adolescent conduct problems in 293 same-sex and 100 opposite-sex adult twin pairs (aged 15-67 years) who were recruited on the basis of one or both twins' participation in a treatment program for Alcohol Use Disorder. The results suggested common genetic influences underlying alcohol abuse/dependence and antisocial behavior. In addition, cotwins of female probands reported more conduct problems than cotwins of male probands, suggesting that affected females both require and transmit a higher liability for antisocial behavior than do affected males. Despite sex differences for liability and -- to some extent -- in the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental influences, the specific genetic and environmental influences on conduct problems appeared to be the same in both sexes. Analyses ignoring birth cohort suggested that twin similarity for childhood and adolescent conduct problems was due mainly to genetic influences with minimal shared environmental influences. In contrast, birth cohort differences were found for the number of conduct problems reported, as well as for the genetic and shared environmental influences underlying these problems. Genetic influences were of greater magnitude in older cohorts, whereas shared environmental influences were of considerable magnitude only in younger cohorts. These findings suggest that secular trends in societal factors (e.g., increased poverty, community violence, and substance abuse in more recent generations) may have resulted in specific shared environmental influences that increase the similarity for antisocial behavior among family members differing in genetic liability.",

          "abstract": "Fairness is a fundamental social norm guiding human decision-making. Yet much of our empirical understanding of fairness-related choices are derived from controlled laboratory studies with homogenous student samples, raising concerns about the ecological validity of experimental findings. Here, we tackle this challenge by introducing a citizen science, lab-in-the-field approach, embedding a classic fairness paradigm, the Ultimatum Game (UG), in a well-visited public space within a community: a museum. Over the course of 13 months, we recorded &gt;18,672 decisions from a heterogenous sample of volunteer members of the public. Each participant responded to four allocation offers from an anonymous proposer (two generous, two selfish), with the option to view proposers’ past behaviour (previously generous vs. selfish), before deciding whether to accept or reject each offer. Results closely replicated classic UG effects, with unfair offers frequently rejected, confirming the presence of inequality aversion beyond the laboratory. Notably, the majority of participants chose to sample proposer-history information, and those who did showed heightened sensitivity to fairness violations, demonstrating that judgements of unfairness are shaped by expectations which emerge from voluntary information sampling. Furthermore, the ecologically enriched design helped uncover temporal and demographic patterns, namely an association between time-of-day and information-seeking behaviour, and an increased willingness to accept unfairness across age. By situating a foundational experimental paradigm in a community venue, our methodological approach provides a scalable model for studying decision-making in ecologically enhanced contexts and a framework for examining authentic behaviours beyond the laboratory, ultimately helping to deepen our understanding of the crucial norms that shape society.",

          "authors": "Ingo Landwehr; Katrin Landwehr; Alexander F. Schmidt",
          "abstract": "In a pilot study using mouse tracking, men’s interpretation and weighting of global sexual (e.g., clothing style) and specific affective (e.g., facial expression) cues when judging women’s flirting intentions depended on two factors: (1) whether the men were sexually aroused and (2) whether the women’s sexual and affective cues were congruent or incongruent. Both reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) emerged as significant indicators of men’s overreliance on global cues (OGC) in the context of sexual flirting, as evidenced by their positive correlations with self-report trait measures of interpersonally problematic (e.g., disinhibited, exploitative) sexuality. In the present study, we sought to replicate these findings in a substantially larger sample, using a simplified key-press paradigm and focusing solely on RT and ER as dependent variables. In a preregistered online study with heterosexual men (N = 284), experimentally induced sexual arousal again increased the likelihood of OGC as a function of task difficulty, i.e., the (in)congruence between global sexual and specific affective cues displayed by a potential female flirting partner. While the main and interaction effects were replicated and a meaningful pattern of correlations emerged between the experimental measures and self-report measures of dispositional risk factors for sexually problematic behavior, a somewhat different moderation pattern by these individual differences was observed. Taken together, the simplified paradigm proved largely successful and appears promising for diagnostic applications in forensic and clinical contexts.",

However, we identified significant same-day positive associations, namely, on days when individuals engaged in PB, they also showed higher than usual levels of PEB. Additionally, we found positive carryover effects in both PB and PEB, suggesting that young adults are likely to persist in their daily prosocial and pro-environmental efforts. No significant cross-level interaction between self-transcendence values and the spillover effect from PB to PEB was found.\nConclusion: The findings provide new insights into young adults’ daily engagement in prosocial and pro-environmental behaviors, highlighting the role of day-to-day within-person changes, while accounting for stable, between-person differences in behavioral and motivational tendencies.\nKeywords: Pro-environmental behavior, Prosocial behavior; Young adults; Experience Sampling Methods; Spillover; Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling.",

This meta-analysis examined mental disorder prevalences among older adults post-hazard and compared them to younger populations.\nMethods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies published from inception to October 2024. Eligible studies focused on ICD-/DSM-based mental disorders ≥1 month post-hazard and reported prevalence estimates or odds ratio (OR) for age-related differences in prevalences (i.e., in adults ≥60 years vs. &lt;60 years). Random-effects models were used for all analyses.\nResults: Thirty-eight studies (N = 29,342 older adults; N = 41,575 younger adults) were included. PTSD prevalence in older adults was 17.43% (95% CI [8.48%; 32.48%], k = 8, I2 = 97.10%) in the first year post-hazard and 10.07% (95% CI [6.32%; 17.45%], k = 14, I2 = 96.10%) in long-term assessments (range 15 months to 17 years). MDD prevalence (combined across time points) was 4.70% (95% CI [1.76; 12.00], k = 7, I2 = 92.60%). Older adults were not significantly more likely than younger adults to meet PTSD criteria in the first year post-hazard (OR = 1.22, 95% CI [0.80, 1.84], k = 12, p = .324, I2 = 70.00%) or in its long-term aftermath (OR = 1.24, 95% CI [76.38, 2.04], k = 9, I2 = 73.50%, p = .329). Heterogeneity was substantial across all analyses (I2 &gt; 70%). Data for MDD-related comparisons were limited, and information on other mental disorders than PTSD and MDD in this population was scarcely reported.\nConclusions: PTSD and MDD prevalences were elevated in older adults post-hazard but similar to younger adults. More research is needed on other mental disorders and age-related moderators of post-disaster mental health.",

          "abstract": "The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model is a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes a modifiable health-determining construct, identity state, defined by three domains hypothesized to all stem from identification of the core self with the physical body: 1) a self-concept that is inclusive of all living beings vs. exclusive based on physical attributes, 2) the perceived basis of the worth of all living beings as intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and 3) the degree of universally compassionate orientation toward all living beings. The identity state construct is theorized to act through modulating stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior to influence the causal relationship between social position-dependent stressors, biological aging, and age-related diseases. The IVP Scale (IVPS) was developed to empirically assess the hypotheses of the IVP framework and the utility of the identity state construct for population health research. This study provides the first description of the psychometric properties of the long (20-item) and short form (12-item) IVPS. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) of data from two separate samples of self-identified Black and White adults (aged 18-81) collected in 2021 and 2025 (total N=2,318). Associations between the IVPS and related constructs of optimism and resilience were examined to establish construct validity. EFA supported a unidimensional structure and CFA confirmed good model fit for both IVPS measures. Both scales are significantly positively correlated with indicators of optimism and resilience and significantly negatively correlated with social dominance orientation. These initial findings suggest the IVPS-20 and the IVPS-Short are valid and psychometrically sound scales.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "Categorizing oneself as a member of a group involves merging ones’ sense of self with the group, such that the self becomes an interchangeable exemplar of the social category (Turner et al., 1987) and self-interest and ingroup interests become interchangeable (Brewer, 2010). Because of this, social identification is associated with ingroup favoritism and behaviors that support the ingroup (Brewer, 1999; Brown, 2000). However, we suggest that some of the variance generally explained by social identification may be better explained by the concept of psychological ownership—feelings of ownership for place (Verkuyten &amp; Martinović, 2017), which implies the right to control use or access (Furby, 1978). In Study 1, I demonstrate the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the South is a better predictor of positive attitudes toward the Confederate battle flag than Southern identification. In Study 2, I provide further evidence of the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the United States is a better predictor of intentions to purchase American-made versus foreign-made products than is national identification.",

          "abstract": "Successful task-switching performance is thought to rely on inhibitory mechanisms suppressing no-longer-relevant tasks, indexed by the n–2 repetition cost. Recent work has shown that episodic retrieval contributes to this cost, confounding estimates of inhibition. This study examines age-related differences in the contributions of inhibition and episodic retrieval to the n–2 repetition cost using a paradigm that controls episodic interference. We also applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) to estimate latent processes underlying these effects. Results showed robust n–2 repetition costs for younger and older adults in response times which reduced when episodic interference was controlled. However, only younger adults showed this pattern in error rates. The DDM showed n–2 repetition costs and their modulation by episodic retrieval were isolated to drift rates, reflecting changes in evidence accumulation. Only younger adults' drift rates were affected by episodic retrieval, with n–2 repetition costs reduced under episodic match conditions. Older adults showed n–2 repetition costs in drift rate regardless of episodic match, suggesting age-related differences in episodic retrieval at the latent level. The results provide insight into age-related differences in inhibition, the importance of controlling episodic retrieval effects in task switching, and the value of computational modelling in revealing age-related differences.",

          "abstract": "To enable human living within planetary boundaries is among the biggest challenges of our time. In this context the question emerges how consuming less can go along with subjective wellbeing. Analysing meaning construction of pro-environmental behaviour might offer insights regarding this relationship. Based on the hierarchical model of meaning the current study aimed to investigate meaning construction of behaviours that mitigate resource consumption which we call sufficiency behaviour. Therefore, we analyzed survey data with N = 544 participants. Path-analysis revealed intrinsic motivation for repairing, curtailment and sharing to be related to hedonic wellbeing and behaviour frequency mediated by ascribed behavioural meaning. Intrinsic motivation did partially regress on altruistic and biospheric values. We found no significant relationship between sufficiency behaviour and life satisfaction or presence of meaning in life. We conclude that finding meaning in behaviour is important for behaviour frequency as well as experienced behavioural wellbeing. Choosing alternatives to buying new products seems to be perceived as meaningful when it is intrinsically motivated. Biospheric and altruistic values might constitute sources for the intrinsic motivation to develop. Taken together, these results illustrate how less consumption might positively connect to wellbeing. Future research should explore ways how meaningfulness of sufficiency behaviour can be fostered.",

          "abstract": "Precise norm scores are essential for psychological diagnostics. While conventional norming estimates norms based on subgroups, continuous norming uses regression to estimate norms based on the entire sample. One consequence of this is that continuous norming achieves a comparable precision with smaller sample sizes compared to conventional norming. However, clear guidelines on the required sample sizes for continuous norming are scarce. To provide empirically based guidance for determining required sample sizes in normative studies using continuous norming, we used normative data from two intelligence tests to evaluate the precision of continuous norms across various sample sizes, norm predictor values, and latent trait levels. Results show that continuous norms can achieve similar precision as conventional norms with substantially smaller samples (N = 1,000–1,500 vs. N = 2,500–3,000). However, precision declines at extreme percentiles and norm predictor values, emphasizing the need to tailor sample size planning to the specific test.",

          "abstract": "A central feature of consciousness is the association between external events and subjective experiences of content. These experiences range from low level (detection) to high level (identification). For example, a visual experience may range from seeing something on a computer screen (detection) to seeing the digit 3 (identification). In research, neural processes that correlate with these experiences are called neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). In vision, a candidate NCC is the visual awareness negativity (VAN) that is derived from event-related potentials, occurring about 200 ms after stimulus onset over posterior electrode sites. Previous research suggests that VAN is more sensitive to low-level experiences (detection) than high-level experiences (identification). Because previous results are limited, two preregistered experiments were conducted. In both experiments, two separate staircases continuously adjusted stimulus opacity to either detection- or identification thresholds. Detection awareness referred to experiencing something rather than nothing. Identification awareness referred to experiencing the identity of the stimulus rather than not experiencing its identity. Experiment 1 (N = 30) showed that VAN was similarly sensitive to detection awareness and identification awareness. This was shown for a digit task and for a letter task. Experiment 2 (N = 28) used the same digit task as in Experiment 1 with two stimulus sizes. Results found identification VAN for both digit sizes, and VAN was unaffected by stimulus size. These results confirm the sensitivity of VAN to both low-level experiences (detection) and high-level experiences (identification). However, results emphasize the limited specificity of VAN in separating between low-level and high-level experiences, suggested by the similarity of VAN in both conditions.",

It is recognized that\npractitioners wanting to practice these therapies in safe and effective ways should engage in\nclinical supervision. However, clinical supervision, while regarded as essential, is an under-\nresearched, area of psychological practice in general, and in contextual behavioral science.\nThis study aimed to understand whether there are distinct and agreed-upon features of clinical\nsupervision when taking a contextual behavioral (CB) approach. Practitioners who had\npublished in peer reviewed journals and/or presented at Association for Contextual\nBehavioral Science conferences on CB supervision in the last 20 years were invited to take\npart in a Delphi study to find consensus: 20 participants provided responses to an open-ended\nonline questionnaire on CB supervision. A reflexive thematic analysis, within a qualitative\nresearch design, was used to interpret common ideas and themes within the data. Through\nanalysis, four main themes were generated: contextual factors, tasks and behaviors,\nsupervision qualities, and supervision purposes. A further round to find consensus was then\nconducted, with participants providing ratings of statements based on these themes in an\nonline survey. Consensus ratings indicated that functional analysis and experiential learning\nmethods appeared to be central to the practice of CB supervision. Overall, participants\ndescribed features of CB supervision, which were both consistent with existing ideas on CB\nsupervision and contextual behavioral science, as well as clinical supervision more broadly.\nThe results serve to inform future research in the area.",

          "abstract": "Cultivated meat is an emerging food innovation with the potential to transform food systems, raising important ethical, social, and sustainability considerations. Including consumer perspectives is essential to understand which cultivated meat attributes drive acceptance and satisfaction, highlighting the need to study specific products rather than the category as a whole. This study presents the first exploratory application of the widely validated Kano model to explore consumer classification of seven key cultivated meat products’ attributes, their impact on satisfaction, and potential differences across dietary groups.   Two products were examined: a cultivated burger and cultivated foie gras, including a willingness-to-try assessment using realistic product images provided by companies. A total of 107 conference attendees representing diverse nationalities and dietary patterns participated. Results indicate that attribute classification differs both within and across products. Price and protein content emerged as attractive attributes for all consumers. Taste parity was valued mainly by meat-eaters for the more familiar burger, while vegan labelling was considered one-dimensional by non-meat-eaters, especially vegans. No must-be attributes were identified, suggesting consumer expectations for cultivated meat are not yet fully formed. Attributes such as appearance resemblance, country of origin, and those drawing policy attention, like labelling products as “meat” or “foie gras”, were largely perceived as indifferent. These findings underscore the product and consumer- specific nature of cultivated meat acceptance \nand the value of incorporating consumer perspectives early in product development. The Kano model proved effective in classifying attributes, providing insights for both theoretical understanding and practical decision-making in this innovative sector.",

          "abstract": "Background\nPsychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour. The effect of pharmacological treatments on suicide-related outcomes is inconsistent. Although the main approach to evaluate effectiveness, randomised controlled trials may not provide externally valid results for suicide prevention in psychiatric populations. We aimed to synthesise the evidence and assess the medication effects on suicide outcomes from observational studies.\nMethods\nWe systematically searched eight databases from database inception to March 2025 for pharmacoepidemiological and other observational studies on suicide-related outcomes in people treated with the main types of psychotropic medications. We included primary studies involving adults with psychiatric diagnoses who were prescribed medication and a comparison sample with the same diagnosis without prescribed medication (between-individual studies) or the same individuals during a non-prescription period (within-individual studies). We excluded studies that did not report psychiatric diagnoses and selected samples (such as inpatients only). Outcomes were any suicide-related behaviour (self-harm, attempted suicide) and suicide mortality. We pooled effect sizes as odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR) or risk ratios (RR) using random-effects models and assessed study quality. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024515794.\nFindings\nWe identified 47 independent studies from 13 countries based on more than 6 million people (46.6% male). Across main diagnostic categories and 70 individual medications examined, strongest associations with suicide risks were found for second generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (OR range 0.35 to 0.75), lithium and divalproex/valproic acid in bipolar disorder (OR range 0.26 to 1.03), and SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants in depression (OR range 0.47-0.78). Benzodiazepines were associated with higher suicide risks in all diagnostic categories (OR range 1.57-5.47). There was evidence for publication bias for SSRIs in depression, leading to more papers reporting higher risks of suicide-related outcomes.\nInterpretation\nObservational studies suggest a role for psychotropic medication for suicide prevention in certain psychiatric disorders.",

Here, we combined high-temporal resolution annotations of 26 discrete emotion categories and a valence model with nested behavioral segmentation and fMRI during movie viewing in youth. The emotion category model, particularly sadness and disappointment, was consistently associated with neural event boundaries across the cortical hierarchy from early sensory areas to transmodal hubs in the default mode network, and aligned with behavioral segmentation at coarser temporal scales. These effects persisted after controlling for low- and high-level non-emotional features, underscoring the unique predictive value of emotion categories. Social salience cues, such as “collective presence,” also robustly predicted boundaries, suggesting complementary roles of emotional and social information. Our findings highlight the correspondence between category-specific emotional semantics and narrative structure across multiple timescales.",

          "abstract": "This article is a conceptual partial replication of the study by Decristan et al. (2022), which investigated the importance of individual and classroom characteristics for students' social integration in secondary mathematics classrooms. The original study showed that performance anxiety in mathematics was negatively related to subjective social integration and that performance self-concept and constructive support from teachers were positively related to social integration. Finally, it was shown that classroom characteristics could moderate these relationships. Teacher support was particularly important for the social integration of students with high achievement anxiety, and to a lesser extent, for the integration of students with low self-concept of mathematics ability. This study replicates and extends these findings. Using data from the IQB Trends in Education Study 2018, in which approximately 44,000 German ninth graders were surveyed, factors related to the operationalization of the constructs were identified that affect the replicability of the original study in this dataset. For this purpose, the replication study used different related measures for the concepts from the original study. Patterns in the effect sizes were identified using exploratory multiverse analyses. Across all analyses, a pattern of results comparable to the original study emerged for the main effects, albeit with smaller effect sizes. The interaction effect from the original study could not be replicated. Reasons for differences between original and replication study were mainly the operationalization of the construct of social integration. We discuss the value of replication studies and how multiverse analyses can be used to speed up the process of knowledge development.",

          "abstract": "Researchers analyzing intensive longitudinal data often aim to detect between-group differences in dynamics of psychological constructs, such as positive and negative affect. These constructs are usually latent (not directly observable). To validly compare groups of individuals in their dynamic processes, the latent constructs must be measured equally across the individuals. If this is not the case – that is, if measurement invariance is violated for some items – this partial non-invariance must be accounted for. Otherwise, the group-specific estimates of the dynamic process may be biased. To aid researchers in obtaining unbiased group-specific estimates despite partial measurement non-invariance, we present an extension of the Three-Step Latent Vector Autoregression, a novel method that separates the estimation of the measurement model and the structural model. We expand this method to multi-group modeling, where differences in structural parameters (e.g., regression coefficients) are captured by allowing these parameters to vary across the groups of individuals. Measurement heterogeneity between and within these groups is captured by group- or person-specific MM parameters. Through two simulation studies, we demonstrate that the method performs well in obtaining correct estimates of a dynamic process despite the presence of measurement heterogeneity. The method is further illustrated with an empirical example.",

          "abstract": "Self-other relationship is a fundamental component in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal components of self-other relationship can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. In this study, we aim to evaluate how individual differences in both intrapersonal and intersubjective traits influence the quality of friendship and the experience of loneliness. We hypothesize that the quality of friendships and the experience of loneliness arise not only from interpersonal factors, but also from distinct intrapersonal features of the individual. We administered a set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis was employed to confirm the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results confirmed that the intrapersonal factor has an important influence on the sociability of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and lockdown-related changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. A mediation analysis further showed that the effect of intrapersonal traits on loneliness was partially mediated by the participants’ friendships. Our results emphasize a central role of self-concept for social life quality. These findings further provide a new perspective for individuals in the general population with low social life quality and possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. Finally, our study also brings potential contributions to the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

          "abstract": "Humans can flexibly adjust how they make decisions to arbitrary goals. However, most theories in decision-making focus on predicting one specific choice type (i.e., choosing the best option). Here, we link decision-making and cognitive-control research to test a theory that accounts for flexible adjustments of choice mechanisms to different goals and demands. Our biologically inspired model specifies how different features translate into evidence for the current goal, and how evidence is mapped onto different output structures. We tested the model in an eye-tracking study in which participants were asked to choose one out of four consumer products or to appraise the entire set, each with respect to positive or negative value. The results confirmed our preregistered hypotheses that response time (RT) should decrease with the overall value of a set of options in choose-best but increase in choose-worst trials. As predicted, this interaction was absent in appraisal RT, which instead exhibited an inverted-U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, the amount of attention devoted to an option was positively related to its value in choose-best, negatively related in choose-worst trials, and unrelated when participants appraised entire sets of products. Time-resolved analyses of eye movements revealed strategic goal-dependent search processes, as attention is increasingly focused on goal-congruent options in choice but remains more uniformly distributed in appraisal. Our findings suggest that cognitive control shapes choice and search dynamics by flexibly adjusting them to current goals and demands.",

Four studies (N = 5,334; three pre-registered) reveal a robust morality-effectiveness disconnect: Behaviors that rank better on objective climate mitigation potential rank worse on perceived morality. This disconnect is mediated by stronger personal support for less effective behaviors, and is weaker among individuals more interested in learning about environmental impacts. Study 3, a five-country experiment, reveals that explicitly labeling behaviors' impact reduces the disconnect by 68%, but does not eliminate it. Study 4 demonstrates that providing detailed information reverses the disconnect, leading people to judge more effective behaviors as proportionally more moral and increasing policy support relative to less effective behaviors.

          "abstract": "Unhealthy snack consumption may be driven by daily stressors (“stress eating”) and mood states (“emotional eating”), yet their independent contributions remain unclear. Specifically, it is debated whether emotional eating can occur in the absence of a stressor. Clarifying these mechanisms may guide targeted interventions. We used experience sampling to assess how real-life stressors and mood fluctuations relate to snacking. Participants (N = 64) responded to six daily smartphone prompts over four weeks, reporting stressors, multidimensional mood and eating behaviour. Bayesian multilevel models revealed that general stressors were unrelated to snacking, but episodes of time pressure increased snacking likelihood while reducing food quantity. Negative mood—beyond the impact of stressors—was associated with less healthy food choices and higher snacking odds particularly in the evening. These findings indicate distinct pathways: stress appears to influence eating through contextual adaptation (e.g., smaller, quicker meals), whereas negative mood—especially in the evening—emerges as a risk factor for unhealthy snacking. Distinguishing these mechanisms can support better-targeted prevention of maladaptive eating.",

A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed.

The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt.

Of all tested strategies, anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices, has gained attention. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes, from 5903 participants across seven databases, were included.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

The research explores their lived experiences within a collectivist and conservative society, addressing the psychological impacts of marginalization and the potential of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as a personal and communal resilience tool.\nEight Arab-Bedouin mental health professionals (five men, three women) participated in an eight-week MBSR program delivered in Arabic. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted before and after the program. A qualitative approach grounded in thematic analysis was employed to understand participants’ perspectives on mindfulness and its integration into their personal and professional lives.\nPre-program interviews revealed participants’ emotional burdens related to systemic exclusion, racism, and intra-community stereotypes, alongside reliance on family, religious practices, and connection to nature as coping strategies. Post-program findings highlighted improved emotional regulation, reduced reactivity, and greater presence in daily activities through mindfulness practices such as breathing exercises. Participants reported enhanced interpersonal relationships, including improved empathy and communication. While mindfulness was empowering on a personal level, its limitations in addressing systemic inequalities were acknowledged.\nThis study enriches existing literature on mindfulness in marginalized populations, highlighting its potential to empower Arab-Bedouins by fostering resilience and mitigating emotional burdens. Insights from this research underscore the importance of culturally sensitive interventions in supporting both personal and professional well-being in minority communities.",

          "authors": "Edward Noon; Ilse Vranken; Madison Hannapel; Gabbi Seiler",
          "abstract": "Love Island is a popular reality dating series that has faced significant criticism for consistently casting contestants with highly idealized bodies. There has been widespread concern that these casting choices may inadvertently pressure young viewers to internalize unrealistic body ideals and engage in body change strategies to conform to them. However, to date, no longitudinal research has explored this possibility. Using three-wave panel data collected during the 2023 series of Love Island UK (N = 344; M age = 20.42, SD = 1.98), this study examined the reciprocal within-person relationships between body pressure from watching Love Island and engagement in - or desire to engage in - three body change strategies (i.e., weight loss, muscle gain, cosmetic surgery). Nearly all (97.38%) participants reported at least some degree (i.e., M &gt; 1.00) of body pressure from watching Love Island, and fluctuations in body pressure followed a positive developmental trajectory across the series. Body pressure at the midpoint of the series predicted heightened engagement in weight loss and muscle gain strategies, and increased desire for cosmetic surgery, at the end of the series. Furthermore, heightened desire for cosmetic surgery at the beginning of the series predicted increased body pressure during the series. Results therefore suggest that prolonged exposure to highly idealized bodies on Love Island may harm young viewers’ body image, to the point that many feel compelled to alter aspects of their body.",

          "abstract": "Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness—a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritised emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behaviour than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context‑sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This research investigated how people respond to true and false news, and how the type of social endorsement associated with news posts influences belief and engagement intentions.  Across three experiments (total N = 1084), participants viewed true and false news accompanied by varying levels of positive (likes) and negative (dislikes) endorsement.  Participants were sensitive to post veracity, rating true news as more believable (large effect), and showing greater willingness to like true content, dislike false content and share true content (small effects).  Positive social endorsement by others reliably increased belief, like and share intentions and decreased dislike intentions (small effects).  Negative endorsement reduced belief (Experiment 1) and like intentions and increased dislike intentions (small effects), but had no detectable impact on share intentions.  When negative endorsement was presented alongside high positive endorsement, this reduced belief and like intentions, but only when the negative endorsement level was high, signalling divided opinion.  These findings demonstrate that: 1) veracity has a strong effect on beliefs, and a small effect on engagement and 2) social cues—positive and negative—have a small but significant role in shaping how people evaluate and interact with online news.  Our findings suggest that incorporating a dislike option on social media platforms could improve content evaluation by signalling epistemic rejection, though safeguards may be needed to mitigate risks of misuse.",

          "authors": "Yutong Li; Lin Qiu; Meng-Jie Wang; Tian Xie; Pan Liu; Yin Luo",
          "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising cost-effective alternative for assessing public opinion. However, most prior research has focused on simulating individual personas using past surveys, leaving it unclear whether LLMs can accurately estimate out-of-sample public opinion at the societal level. We address this gap with three studies that systematically evaluate the accuracy, bias, and variability of commercial and non-commercial LLMs in inferring societal-level public opinion. First, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four recent Pew Research Centre polls, finding that both models outperformed traditional baseline methods, with GPT-4 showing higher accuracy, with an error rate ranging from 4% to 9%. Notably, GPT-3.5 produced overly uniform responses characterized by lower variance and higher entropy compared to actual human data, whereas GPT-4’s predictions more closely mirrored real response patterns. Both models, however, exhibited partisan skew, aligning more strongly with Democratic perspectives and underrepresenting Republican viewpoints. Second, we assessed the generalisability of these findings by testing various models (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.3) on three additional Pew surveys. These models demonstrated similar predictive accuracy and a continued tendency toward less varied responses, though partisan bias was less pronounced in the latest models. Third, we examined the robustness of our findings through ablation studies of prompt design by varying parameters such as temperature, role, and input format and found that the results were consistent across these conditions. Importantly, collective-level estimation consistently outperformed averaged individual-level simulation, which suffered from greater homogeneity bias. Overall, LLMs show strong potential for public opinion estimation, though their inherent biases and methodological limitations warrant careful consideration.",

          "abstract": "Where Marcuse and the authors of the Dialectic of Enlightenment decisively part company, then, is not on the negative side of materialism, in its concern with suffering, but on the positive side, in its affirmation of the demand for happiness. For Adorno and Horkheimer, after Dialectic of Enlightenment, reconciliation merely means the absence of suffering, as is evident for instance in Adorno’s claim that after Auschwitz, progress reduces to the demand “that no one should go hungry anymore, that there should be no more torture”. By contrast, Marcuse frames his entire critical activity in terms of a reactivation of the promise of equality, liberty and happiness that is enunciated by the French Enlightenment and enacted by the French Revolution. For Marcuse, the “demand for happiness” that is expressed in the artwork is to be actualised through a revolutionary politics, in a programme that redeems the promise of the bourgeois ideals whose realization capitalist society blocks, by means of participatory democracy, egalitarian redistribution, cultural tolerance and the restructuring of the instincts through non-repressive de-sublimation. “A Road Not Taken: Critical Theory after Dialectic of Enlightenment,” in Martyn Henry Lloyd and Geoff Boucher (eds), Rethinking the Enlightenment (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press), Chapter 10, 221-245. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17421680",

          "authors": "Martin Önnerfors",
          "abstract": "This paper describes the methodology for geocoding historical Swedish census data from 1878-1950, developed as part of the research project \"Cities and Socioeconomic Segregation in the Long Term, 1880-2017.\" While Sweden's historical demographic data is renowned for its quality and coverage, geocoding this data presents unique challenges that cannot be solved using modern geocoding APIs. The primary obstacles include temporal changes in address-coordinate relationships, street relocations, and the complete disappearance of spatial units through demolition and redevelopment. Historical Swedish census data varies in geographic precision, ranging from village-level information in rural areas to property-level detail in urban centers like Stockholm. The paper proposes a solution based on constructing a \"canonical\" historical address and property database that incorporates temporal dimensions, allowing for accurate matching at specific time points. This database is compiled from multiple sources and validated against georeferenced historical city maps. The methodology addresses the distinction between property-level (block name and number) and address-level (street name and house number) geocoding, with property coordinates proving more temporally stable. Manual data collection and quality assurance are essential components of the process, particularly for areas subject to major urban redevelopment such as Stockholm's Klara neighborhood. This approach enables accurate geocoding of historical census data while maintaining spatial precision appropriate for demographic analysis of urban segregation patterns over more than a century.",

In this study, we evaluated the quality of information in 109 French-language TikTok videos on autism, ADHD, and dyslexia (with over 66 million cumulative views) to capture variation across disorders. The videos were identified using an ecologically valid keyword search and assessed by healthcare professionals with relevant scientific expertise. Results showed that 41% of autism videos, 56% of ADHD videos, and 41% of dyslexia videos were rated as “very poor” or “fairly poor” in terms of information quality because they contained major inaccuracies.

Perhaps no approach has been more inspirational than the walkthrough method. However, the walkthrough method’s apparent popularity hides the fact that few studies actually use the method as presented. While many studies cite it, only some make use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment Promenade, that aims to address the walkthrough method’s incoherent aims and theoretical perspective. It combines the walkthrough method’s technical walkthrough with a theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment. This new approach attempts to deliver on the original promise of the walkthrough method: the rigorous and systemic study of apps where the researcher engages directly with an app’s interface.",

          "authors": "Orestes P Hastings",
          "abstract": "Existing research finds that differences in economic resources explain a much larger share of the spending gap between married and single parents than between married and cohabiting parents. This study focuses on extracurricular spending and considers three non-economic explanations for why children in cohabiting families receive less than those in married households: the greater prevalence of non-biological parents in cohabiting households, the relatively shorter duration of cohabiting relationships, and potentially lower levels of relational commitment. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its 2014 and 2019 Child Development Supplement (5,422 observations of 4,361 children in 2,635 households), I first reproduce established differences in parental spending by family structure. Accounting for biological parent status and relationship duration does little to further reduce the gap between married and cohabiting parents. These findings suggest that unmeasured aspects of commitment may shape family-structure differences in extracurricular investments, but they also highlight the need for continued research given the growing complexity of U.S. family living arrangements and the importance of parental financial investments for children’s development and long-term outcomes.",

          "abstract": "While research recognizes how the spatial and temporal organisation of science impacts its processes and products, questions remain about how dynamic spatiotemporal conditions constitute science in action. As crises can provide an avenue to understand science amidst rapidly shifting spatiotemporal conditions, we present findings from a case study on a multi-omics project during COVID-19. We draw on the concept of chronotopes to illuminate how the “spacetime” properties of individuals, collectives, and the COVID-19 pandemic co-produce COVID-19 science. We present how different actors enact and engage during the crisis spacetime, illustrating how these enactments result in chronotopic convergences that could progress the project or in divergences that could delay it. We examine how the synchronisation of convergences and divergences in the chronotopes of actors and the crisis shape the progression of the project chronotope. Our analysis illuminates key features of science during a crisis, where projects continuously adapt to rapidly shifting crisis conditions, require recursive experiments and regulatory compliance, need to navigate divergent chronotopic expectations, and necessitate convergences beyond individual and experimental spacetimes. Ultimately, chronotopes are not just static backdrops for science, they can enable and constrain actions, and their active governance defines science both in and out of a crisis.",

          "abstract": "The glass cliff phenomenon describes the tendency for women and other minority groups to be disproportionately appointed to leadership positions during times of organizational risk and instability. While prior research has documented this effect, some empirical evidence has also challenged its existence. In this paper, we design a lab-based online experiment to test whether the glass cliff phenomenon arises in a controlled environment. Moreover, little is known about whether other social categories beyond gender, such as ethnicity, are similarly affected. The experiment aims to detect both gender- and ethnic-based glass cliff effects. In the experiment, participants assumed the role of employers tasked with selecting leaders under stable and crisis conditions. Our results show no evidence of glass cliff effects based on either gender or ethnicity. These findings challenge the generalizability of the glass cliff phenomenon. We discuss the lack of a plausible economic mechanism by which it could systematically emerge in incentive-compatible environments. This suggests that future research and policy design should move away from the search for universal evidence of the glass cliff and instead focus on identifying the specific contexts and conditions under which it may occur.",

          "authors": "Julia Graf; Renate Renner; Thomas Klebel",
          "abstract": "Effective risk communication is a core element of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030), emphasizing the importance of early warning and public information in mitigating disaster impacts. However, existing research often treats risk communication as a uniform process, lacking systematic differentiation between short-term warnings for acute hazards and long-term adaptation strategies. This scoping review analyzes 194 peer-reviewed studies to examine how risk communication strategies vary according to the temporal dimension (short-term, long-term, or hybrid), hazard types by group (atmospheric, geophysical, hydrological, and biophysi-cal), and intended purpose. Communication goals are categorized through an inductively developed approach—Act, Prepare, and Aware—and mapped across the four major hazard groups. A focused analysis of 141 studies reveals that differences, such as atmospheric hazards, are predominantly addressed through hybrid (41%) and short-term (25%) strategies, often combining real-time alerts with awareness and preparedness. Geophysical haz-ards are strongly associated with hybrid approaches (43%), which emphasize participatory and educational for-mats. Hydrological hazards display the widest variation, combining short-term, hybrid, and complex strategies. Purely long-term formats, however, are rarely found across all hazard types (1.4%), despite their strategic im-portance for resilience. Findings suggest that the choice of communication strategy can be tied to the nature and dynamics of each hazard type. This review identifies key patterns, research gaps, and a structured basis for further evaluation and the development of risk communication. It provides an overview of current literature and guidance for developing context-sensitive, temporally integrated communication strategies.",

          "abstract": "Marriage is consistently associated with better health and longevity, often attributed to economic advantages, health monitoring by a partner, and emotional support. Conversely, spousal death increases the risk of immediate mortality, known as the “widowhood effect.” Although these patterns are well-documented in contemporary populations, less is understood about their prevalence in historical populations, where extended family households may have mitigated the adverse effects of being unmarried or widowed. We investigated the effects of marital status on survival probabilities from age 40 onward, focusing on socioeconomic variability. Access to resources and coping mechanisms likely differed by social class, influencing how marital status affected survival across age groups and socioeconomic strata. We analyzed historical church book data from Finland (1730–1910), applying discrete-time event models to estimate annual survival for men (n = 5,802) and women (n = 6,203) aged 40 to 90. Time-varying marital statuses were categorized into five groups: never married, married, recently widowed, widowed, and remarried. Survival differences by marital status were strongly mediated by socioeconomic status (SES). Among high-SES individuals, never-married men and women had 15% and 21% higher survival rates, respectively, compared to their married counterparts. In contrast, among the moderate and lowest socioeconomic classes, survival probabilities for the never-married did not differ from those of the married. The survival advantage of never-married women was limited to ages below 60. Both men and women experienced sharp declines in survival during the two years following spousal loss (15–27%, depending on sex and class). Beyond this acute period, widowed men exhibited 5–10% lower survival rates across all classes compared to married men, while only high-SES widowed women faced a 6% survival disadvantage. Remarriage was associated with survival rates comparable to those of first-time marriage. This study provides insight into the survival advantages of pair-bonding in historical societies, characterized by high mortality rates, extended family structures, and the absence of modern medical resources.",

Previous research has primarily focused on the unidirectional impact of HCI on HHI, while neglecting the reverse effect of HHI on HCI and the behavioral pattern differences arising from identity differentiation. The research methods include: 1) Netnographic analysis (3-5 years of gaming experience &amp; 19,861 online comments); 2) In-depth interviews (19 players); 3) Grounded theory (inductively identifying 5 thematic categories); 4) Descriptive phenomenological approach. This study innovatively proposes the \"Dual Interactive Construction Circles\" (DICC) framework, integrating theories of social presence, symbolic interactionism, and social constructivism. It describes the influence of the inner circle (psychological mechanisms) on the outer circle (behavioral codes), where identity labels represent specific behavioral patterns. This study finds that players collaboratively construct an anthropomorphic perception of virtual characters through HCI and HHI, and that community interactions can partially and reversely shape in-game experiences.

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Zongping Liu; Yanyan Xu",
          "abstract": "Method: This study explores the relationship between perfume scents and consumer imagery associations. Based on the analysis of online reviews, a four-dimensional framework was constructed to decode the patterns of imagery associations in perfume reviews. The research adopts a mixed-methods approach, including text mining, content analysis, multiple regression and fsQCA validation, as well as semantic network mapping. \n\nOpen Practice Statement: This study only involves text data analysis, poses no ethical risks, and therefore does not require pre-registration. \n\nKey Findings: 1) natural materials and cultural symbols significantly enhance product ratings (β=0.0114 and β=0.0132), yet cultural symbols negatively affect popularity (β=-0.0296); 2) fsQCA identifies two high-rating pathways, highlighting the synergistic effects between natural materials and cultural symbols; 3) semantic network analysis reveals distinctive imagery sets for twelve fragrance families and constructs a “ingredient–imagery–scene” mapping chain. \n\nSignificance: Innovatively, this study proposes a four-dimensional model to quantify the mechanisms underlying olfactory mental imagery generation, filling a theoretical gap in sensory marketing and neuroaesthetics. It also provides practical tools for fragrance brands to leverage dual-driven storytelling through culture and emotion, enabling scene-based customization in response to emerging market trends. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how generative AI can transform unstructured consumer feedback into actionable insights, opening new avenues for consumer experience research in the digital era. In summary, this work offers essential theoretical tools for understanding the core logic of the olfactory economy and provides practical guidance for perfume brands to pursue strategic differentiation.",

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Jinjia Gui; Yueqi Wang; Wei Xu",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of generative AI-driven digital immortality (DI) technology, focusing on two distinct user groups: Digital Legacy Giver (DLG), who plan their posthumous digital presence, and Digital Legacy Receiver (DLR), who interact with digital representations of deceased loved ones. Through a mixed-methods approach—analyzing 305 DLG and 307 DLR questionnaires supplemented by 18 in-depth interviews—the research identifies divergent adoption drivers. Key findings reveal DLG exhibit significantly higher DI adoption intent (DIA) than DLR (mean DIA: 3.46 vs. 3.21, p&lt;0.001). For DLG, Presence Extension Need (PEN) (β=0.175, p&lt;0.001) and Data Snoop Concern (DSC) (β=−0.341, p&lt;0.001) are primary motivators and barriers, reflecting desires for symbolic identity continuity and privacy fears. Conversely, DLR prioritize Ritual Substitution Need (RSN) (β=0.252, p&lt;0.001) but are deterred by Relationship Desecration Concern (RDC) (β=−0.336, p&lt;0.001), emphasizing technology’s role in sustaining daily emotional rituals while fearing relational inauthenticity. The study innovatively frames adoption through a \"Demand-Concern-Individual\" ternary model, highlighting an individual-centric logic (DLG seeking self-continuity) versus socio-centric logic (DLR preserving relational bonds). It expands the concept of \"ritual\" beyond traditional memorials to encompass technology-mediated daily interactions. Practical implications include designing personalized security features for DLG and ethically calibrated emotional interfaces for DLR.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates whether artificial intelligence can emulate human mystical experiences through algorithmic rationality, focusing specifically on the generative mechanisms of “Perceived Sacredness” within AI-assisted tarot divination. Grounded in the original “Triadic Framework for Human-AI Spiritual Interaction,” three sequential experiments systematically examine how sacredness perception is shaped by three contextual layers: “who speaks” (agent subjectivity), “how it speaks” (interaction modality), and “what is spoken” (question typology). Study 1 reveals that spiritual believers report significantly lower perceived sacredness, service quality, and trust when explicitly informed that AI is involved, whereas non-believers show no such difference—supporting the “in-group bias” hypothesis. Study 2 demonstrates that oral conversation significantly enhances perceived sacredness compared to touch-screen interaction, aligning with Media Richness and Social Presence theories. Study 3 found no significant difference between open-ended and closed-ended questions in eliciting sacred experiences. Collectively, while AI cannot intrinsically “possess” spirituality, it can effectively “evoke” subjective sacred experiences through carefully designed interaction contexts. This research provides empirical grounding for understanding the reconfiguration of spiritual experience in the technological age and offers critical implications for the ethical and experiential design of AI in spiritual service domains.",

          "authors": "Sophie Collyer",
          "abstract": "As of 2023, more than 47 million people in the United States (14.3%) lived in food-insecure households. In the coming years, however, we will not know whether the national prevalence of food insecurity has risen, fallen, or remained stable, as the USDA recently announced the permanent suspension of food security data collection on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.",

          "abstract": "Norms are essential for social stability but can hinder adaptability in changing environments. Yet human societies have found ways to modify existing norms or create new ones in response to novel challenges. This paper proposes a framework for understanding adaptive norm evolution. First, drawing on a theory of legal order, we posit that societies balance normative stability and adaptability through metanorms—rules that govern the process by which norms are interpreted, changed and enforced. Second, we test this idea in the context of customary dispute resolution by elders among the Turkana, a pastoralist society in Kenya. Based on vignette experiments with 369 participants, we found that community members were significantly more willing to enforce decisions when elders aligned their conduct with metanorms. Elders are constrained in their ability to alter long-standing customs, but by following metanorms can create new rules for novel situations. These findings support our proposed mechanism: in the absence of centralized authority, metanorms governing normative institutions allow for adaptive norm change while preserving cultural continuity. We conclude by suggesting that group-level selection acts on cultural variation in metanorms, shaping the evolvability of normative systems and enabling societies to sustain adaptive legal order without coercive centralized power",

          "abstract": "In the world of academic publishing, it is likely that the most prominent best practice guidelines (BPGs), encompassing ethical practices, are those of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). In this paper, we conducted a citation analysis of 71 Write a Scientific Paper (WASP) BPGs, which were all published in Elsevier’s Early Human Development (EHD) during 2018-2019, exclusively by University of Malta researchers. Many of those WASP BPGs were linked to and used by commercial training courses. The 71 WASP BPGs accrued 346 citations by 12 April 2023, 66 being self-citations of EHD, with most citations (75, or 22%) to a 2018 paper by Victor E. Grech and Sarah Cuschieri (DOI: 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2018.01.001). The analysis was repeated on 11 February 2025, revealing that the 71 WASP BPGs had accumulated a total of 478 citations. In April 2023, Grech and Cuschieri had gained a total of 245 and 137 citations, respectively across all of the WASP BPGs, and by February 2025, those values had risen to 309 and 157, respectively. An editorial expression of concern (EoC) was published in 2021, but is disguised as an “Editorial Note”. That EoC encompasses 48 of the WASP BPGs, an EoC “clustering” method that is not the best publishing practice. This bibliometric analysis reveals how a single COPE member journal published, on behalf of an independent group of Malta researchers, 71 BPGs, most of which have an EoC associated with them, and some of which (30 papers, 42%) have been retracted. The underlying message of this case study is that there are grave risks (reputational and otherwise) with amassing such independent BPGs in a single journal.",

          "authors": "Heba Alex",
          "abstract": "This paper describes a strategic mechanism, fuzzy boundaries, that groups use to accumulate advantage. In contrast to the dominant view that rigid, well-defined boundaries maximize group rewards, I argue that ambiguity in membership criteria can, under certain conditions, more effectively secure and promote group benefits. Fuzzy boundaries are defined by two features: an intentionally ambiguous criterion for inclusion and the selective, inconsistent application of that criterion to adjust the insider-outsider line as needed. I illustrate the operation of fuzzy boundaries through a historical analysis of occupational boundary-drawing in the nineteenth-century United States. Ultimately, the study offers a generalizable framework for understanding how strategic ambiguity in group boundaries can serve actors seeking to preserve privilege across domains such as education, hiring, and professional accreditation. Unlike well-defined qualifications, the malleability of fuzzy boundaries often insulates them from legal challenge, making them an effective mechanism for maintaining social and institutional advantage. https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751251378516",

          "abstract": "Human social networks are inherently multiplex, comprising overlapping layers of relationships. Different layers may have distinct structural properties and interpersonal dynamics, but also may interact to form complex interdependent pathways for social contagion. This poses a fundamental problem in understanding behavioral diffusion and in devising effective network‑based interventions. Here, we introduce a new conceptualization of how much each network layer contributes to critical contagion pathways and quantify it using a novel metric, “network torque.” We exploit data regarding sociocentric maps of 110 rural Honduran communities using a battery of 11 name generators and an experiment involving an exogenous intervention. Using a novel statistical framework, we assess the extent to which specific network layers alter global connectivity and support the spread of three experimentally introduced health practices. The results show that specific relationship types—such as close friendships—particularly enable non-overlapping diffusion pathways, amplifying behavioral change at the village level. For instance, non-redundant pathways enabled by closest friends can increase the adoption of correct knowledge about feeding newborns inappropriate “chupones” and enhance attitudes regarding fathers’ involvement in postpartum care. Non-overlapping multiplex social ties are relevant to social contagion and social coherence in traditionally organized social systems.",

          "authors": "Norah MacKendrick; Seungyun Lee; Hanee Choi; Marina Rivera Ramos",
          "abstract": "How environmental health problems gain social visibility is key to understanding social problem formation. In this paper we examine this process by studying American news media coverage of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution, a pollutant linked to premature death and cardiovascular disease. After years of decline, in 2016 PM2.5 concentrations began rising nationally in the United States, largely due to wildfires. To understand how this change has been captured in public discourse, we use frame analysis of articles in two national U.S. newspapers—the New York Times and USA Today—to trace the evolution of the social problem framing of PM2.5 from 2013 to 2024. PM2.5 was framed as a health threat and governance problem, and while 2016 marks the reversal of the nationwide trend of declining PM2.5, 2020 is the inflection point when coverage increased, and environmental justice framing became salient. We explain these changes as the consequence of a convergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, major wildfires, and regulatory rollbacks that rendered PM2.5 more salient because of heightened public interest in airborne threats and growing awareness of racial inequality. Our study elucidates how intersecting crises can increase the media visibility of environmental health risks.",

This paper identifies bots as a major influence in digital protest ecologies, and responds by updating the Discursive Opportunity Structure (DOS) theoretical framework - focusing on its core dimensions of visibility, resonance, and legitimacy. To ground this theoretical development, we apply this revised framework through computer-assisted content analysis of bot activity in two major protests: Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Extinction Rebellion (XR). Rather than treating bots as a monolithic influence, we identify competing bot strategies with distinct discursive impacts. In BLM, supportive bots enhance cultural resonance, while counter-bots target movement legitimacy. In XR, pro-protest bots work to establish legitimacy and participatory visibility, whereas counter-bots strategically manipulate issue salience. These findings show that any serious understanding of contemporary movements must recognise how bot activity shapes discourse - steering public perception, influencing movement trajectories, and impacting protest outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Purpose--Texas House Bill 5 (2013) introduced the Foundation High School Program, requiring students to select an endorsement—a curricular concentration similar to a major. Although intended to expand flexibility and align coursework with college and workforce pathways, the STEM endorsement may function as a new form of tracking. Guided by Oakes and colleagues’ work on tracking and detracking and by Domina et al.’s application of categorical inequality theory to education, this study examines which students complete a STEM endorsement and how this choice shapes college enrollment outcomes.\n\nResearch Methods--We combine a content analysis of Texas college-admissions requirements with administrative data from the Houston Independent School District. Logistic and multinomial models estimate predictors of STEM endorsement completion and college choice, and nonlinear variance decomposition analyses assess how STEM–non-STEM differences in college enrollment are explained by background characteristics.\n\nFindings--The STEM endorsement aligns closely with selective college admissions. Academic factors strongly predict STEM completion, and while the endorsement is associated with enrollment at selective colleges, this relationship is largely explained by prior academic achievement. High-achieving students are more likely to pursue the STEM endorsement, which accounts for its link to selective college enrollment.\n\nImplications--The STEM endorsement operates less as a pathway for broadening opportunity and more as a marker of academic prestige. As a surface-level policy reform, the endorsement system reconstitutes familiar tracking dynamics under a new label, reinforcing educational stratification by privileging students with stronger preparation.",

          "abstract": "The AI landscape has been changing dramatically with the growth of generative AI, and many governments, sector bodies, and individual organisations are working in parallel to stake out their own visions of ethical and responsible AI use. Statements, guidelines, and policies on responsible AI have proliferated in the last five years, yet clarity remains elusive on what ‘responsible AI’ means or how to put it into practice. Research to date has not examined how the principles and practices of responsible AI may vary across sector, an increasingly important concern as AI use grows throughout the economy and society. In this article, we empirically examine inter- and intra-sectoral variance in the principles articulated for responsible AI in organisational policies. We analysed 80 documents from organisations in 8 sectors, focusing on policies current at the time of the 2024 AI Seoul Summit. Our content analysis identified 31 distinct principles in these policies, only ten of which appeared in more than 50% of the documents. We found clear sectoral differences in the principles invoked for responsible AI, as well as the audiences who were intended to engage with putting those principles into practice. Our analysis focused on organisations shaping responsible AI in a single nation, the United Kingdom, but our findings illustrate the admixture of national and international actors affecting AI practice. Our findings show that responsible AI is increasingly fragmented, and that an understanding of sector-level variation is essential to shaping the future of responsible AI.",

          "abstract": "This report examines the first wave of the INVEST Longitudinal study on wellbeing (ILSW), collected in the spring and summer of 2024. The survey was conducted at the INVEST Research Centre of the University of Turku, and will be repeated in 2025 and 2026. Participants were sampled by a random draw from the Population Register of the Finnish National Population Information Service, but sampling probabilities were stratified by age and gender. The questionnaire was sent to 16 200 persons aged 18-80 living in Finland. The sample included native speakers of Finnish, Swedish and other languages. Some 3299 respondents answered the questionnaire, i.e., the response rate was 20 percent. The sample represents the target population well in relation to gender, region, and main activity. The largest challenges relate to the overrepresentation of highly educated and the underrepresentation of non-Finnish and -Swedish speakers. These patterns, however, are typical in survey research. The survey will be linked to administrative data. Taken together, the data helps to understand how resources, well-being and social attitudes change over time. This information is crucial for addressing challenges and opportunities of the Finnish society.",

          "abstract": "Purpose--Texas House Bill 5 (2013) introduced the Foundation High School Program, requiring students to select an endorsement—a curricular concentration similar to a major. Although intended to expand flexibility and align coursework with college and workforce pathways, the STEM endorsement may function as a new form of tracking. Guided by Oakes and colleagues’ work on tracking and detracking and by Domina et al.’s application of categorical inequality theory to education, this study examines which students complete a STEM endorsement and how this choice shapes college enrollment outcomes.\n\nResearch Methods--We combine a content analysis of Texas college-admissions requirements with administrative data from the Houston Independent School District. Logistic and multinomial models estimate predictors of STEM endorsement completion and college choice, and nonlinear variance decomposition analyses assess how STEM–non-STEM differences in college enrollment are explained by background characteristics.\n\nFindings--The STEM endorsement aligns closely with selective college admissions. Academic factors strongly predict STEM completion, and while the endorsement is associated with enrollment at selective colleges, this relationship is largely explained by prior academic achievement. High-achieving students are more likely to pursue the STEM endorsement, which accounts for its link to selective college enrollment.\n\nImplications--The STEM endorsement operates less as a pathway for broadening opportunity and more as a marker of academic prestige. As a surface-level policy reform, the endorsement system reconstitutes familiar tracking dynamics under a new label, reinforcing educational stratification by privileging students with stronger preparation.",

          "abstract": "State-level anti-DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) bills, which have been introduced in 32 states, aim to close off avenues through which many underrepresented scholars have been hired. These bills signal a shift in the local political climate, pressuring public colleges and universities to realign their priorities in anticipation of future legal changes. Using federal data on new postsecondary hires, we find that the introduction of early anti-DEI legislation was followed by a substantial decline in the share of faculty hires from marginalized groups and an increase in the share of White men, even before bills were signed into law. This shift was most pronounced at schools highly dependent on state funding and at teaching-oriented schools. Our findings suggest that “anticipatory compliance” with political intervention varies depending on organizational revenue streams and the local regulatory environment.",

In this article, we examine changes in support for Chega at the municipal level between 2019 and 2025. We analyse the relationship between changes in predictors and changes in the outcome to better understand the rapid rise of the party. Changes in grievances are associated with changes in votes, notably decreases in income and increases in overall crime are associated with larger increases in support for Chega. By contrast, changes in social benefits, the share of the foreign population and net migration are not associated with changes in support. We show that net of grievances, changes in turnout are strongly associated with changes in votes for Chega – evidence of a mobilization effort. Key results are robust to different specifications. Thus, we highlight the mobilization effects of populist radical right parties.",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "authors": "Brittany Tarufelli; James Gibson; Sarah Barrows; Abhishek Somani; Daniel Boff",
          "abstract": "Energy storage plays a crucial role in modern power systems, providing services such as grid stability, frequency regulation, and load balancing. Currently, storage systems earn revenue by offering these grid services and through energy arbitrage—buying electricity when prices are low and selling when prices are high. However, as storage deployment expands, arbitrage profitability declines due to market saturation and narrowing price differentials (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2024). In ERCOT, for example, 2024 saw reduced arbitrage potential due to moderate weather and increased storage capacity. This trend underscores the need for new business models that more fully recognize and compensate the value energy storage provides to the power system.\n\nThis paper presents empirical research on the full value of energy storage and proposes a commodity-market-based framework to better align compensation mechanisms with system-wide benefits. We examine hydropower as a proxy for grid-scale storage, using exogenous variation in reservoir storage volume to estimate causal effects on (1) real-time electricity prices and (2) risk premiums, measured by the day-ahead to real-time price spread, in the Northwestern United States between May 2022 and November 2024. Employing fixed-effects and lagged dependent variable models, we control for unobserved heterogeneity across balancing authorities and capture dynamic price behavior.\n\nWe find that a 10% increase in reservoir storage volume reduces real-time prices by approximately 6% and lowers risk premiums by about 5%, indicating that storage mitigates short-term supply–demand imbalances. These effects are most pronounced during grid stress events, such as cold snaps, suggesting that stored energy provides significant value when the system is under strain. The results are robust to dynamic pricing effects and highlight storage’s role in reducing both price volatility and systemic risk.\n\nOverall, stored energy substantially reduces system costs and alleviates grid stress, yet most electricity markets lack mechanisms that compensate storage for these benefits. As revenue from arbitrage and grid services diminishes with increased deployment, alternative business models are needed to reward storage for its intrinsic function—potentially through the creation of a stand-alone commodity, such as stored energy itself (see the winter reserve mechanism in Switzerland). Our findings provide empirical support for developing future market frameworks that more accurately capture the risk-reducing and reliability-enhancing contributions of grid-scale energy storage.",

The study highlights the tension between efficiency gains and concerns over labor displacement, situating fast food automation within broader debates about technology and society. By linking industry-specific developments to questions of employment, cultural identity, and consumer expectations, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of how automation in everyday contexts reflects and shapes broader social transformations.",

          "abstract": "Individual social identities indicate group affiliations and are typically associated with group-typical preferences, signals that indicate group membership, and the propensity to condition actions on the social signals of others, resulting in group-differentiated interaction norms. Past work modeling identity signaling and coordination has typically assumed that individuals belong to one of a discrete set of groups. Yet individuals can simultaneously belong to multiple groups, which may be nested within larger groupings. Here, we introduce the generalized Bach or Stravinsky game, a coordination game with ordered preferences, which allows us to construct a model that captures the overlapping and hierarchical nature of social identity. Our model unifies several prior results into a single framework, including results related to coordination, minority disadvantage, and cross-cultural competence. Our model also allows agents to express complex social identities through multidimensional signaling, which we use to explore a variety of complex group structures. Our consideration of intersectional identities exposes flaws in naive measures of group structure, illustrating how empirical studies may overlook some social identities if they do not consider the behaviors that those identities function to afford.",

          "authors": "Amit Suresh",
          "abstract": "India’s education sector faces the complex challenge of aligning its foundational structures with the demands of a rapidly evolving global landscape (Khan et al., 2024). This necessitates a comprehensive reform strategy extending beyond curriculum updates to encompass holistic educator development. This document addresses the critical question of how Kerala and India can devise and execute a transformative education policy. Such a policy must not only advance skill-based curricula, digital literacy, and vocational training but also significantly uplift teachers and professors through innovative professional development, thereby fostering a resilient and adaptive education ecosystem by 2035. The methodological approach involves a systematic review and thematic analysis of existing literature on educational reforms, professional development models, and the integration of technology in learning. Qualitative findings illuminate the necessity for personalized, continuous, and technology-supported professional learning pathways for educators. Key themes emerging include the potential of AI-powered personalized training, the efficacy of blended and peer-led learning networks, and the benefits of gamification and simulation for teaching effectiveness (Mintii, 2023)(Toledo Palomino et al., 2023). Policy implications underscore the importance of government-private sector collaborations, the institutionalization of lifelong learning, and targeted interventions for marginalized educators. An effective evaluation framework includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as educator retention rates, student learning outcomes in skill-based assessments, and the rate of adoption of innovative pedagogical practices. This holistic reform is designed to empower educators as central agents of transformation, ensuring an adaptive, inclusive, and future-focused education system for India and Kerala.",

          "abstract": "When compulsory voting is abolished, this generally leads to a substantial drop in voter turnout. Can measures to increase turnout by local government administrations combat such decline?  In this research note, we take up this question by focusing on the 2024 Flemish local elections, which were the first elections held under voluntary voting after more than 125 years of compulsory voting in the region. We first analyze aggregate level data to study whether municipalities who took more initiatives to mobilize voters witnessed lower levels of turnout decline than municipalities with weaker information campaigns. Second, we employ individual-level post-election survey data to assess whether respondents who were reached by these campaigns were more likely to cast a ballot in the election. The analyses yield a consistent pattern of null results: we find no significant effects on turnout at the aggregate nor at the individual level. We conclude that abolishing compulsory voting leads to a substantial decline in voter turnout that cannot be compensated by targeted measures and campaigns to mobilize citizens to vote.",

Welfare chauvinism is found to be more politically divisive than approval of income differences, with the sharpest divides emerging in the exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness held by voters of the non-mainstream (radical) right party, the Sweden Democrats. The results suggest that conflicts over inclusivist versus exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness could become central in Swedish politics, potentially shifting away from the universalist principles that underpin its social democratic welfare state model.",

This document delineates a comprehensive policy blueprint for Kerala, designed to leverage advanced artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and immersive technologies to fundamentally reshape its healthcare landscape by 2035, serving as a scalable model for India. The analysis outlines objectives centered on augmenting primary healthcare access, enhancing mental health support, and fortifying preventive care, aligning with India’s National Digital Health Mission and broader global innovation trajectories. A systematic review of existing literature, coupled with thematic analysis, informs the identification of critical policy gaps and technological opportunities. Key qualitative findings underscore the transformative capacity of AI-powered predictive models for risk identification and resource optimization, the potential for genomics-enabled personalized prevention, and the efficacy of immersive technologies in delivering stigma-free mental health interventions. The analysis also highlights the imperative for robust, interoperable digital infrastructures and community-embedded autonomous healthcare solutions. Policy implications emphasize the need for integrated governance models, ethical frameworks for data use, and strategies for equitable technology deployment. The proposed framework includes pragmatic implementation pathways, detailing institutional roles, stakeholder engagement, and resource allocation. Evaluation strategies, incorporating key performance indicators (KPIs) and continuous feedback loops, are also presented to ensure adaptive policy refinement. This approach offers a foundational strategy for achieving universal, inclusive, and resilient health systems in Kerala, with significant implications for national healthcare evolution.

While AI technologies enhance journalistic workflows by automating and augmenting content creation, they also introduce opacity in professional decisions, complicating traditional transparency norms and its disclosure practices. The paper maps citizens’ perceptions regarding disclosures of AI use in journalism, addressing two key themes: (1) the practical information needs of news consumers about AI-generated content and (2) the specific rationales when exposed to (disclosures of) AI generated news content. Through qualitative focus groups (N=21), the exploratory research reveals a strong demand for clear, visible, and detailed disclosures about AI-generated content. Participants emphasized the necessity of including general source references akin to traditional authorship attributions, explicitly stating AI involvement - for example, a label such as ‘generated by AI’ alongside author and publication details. Visual indicators like logos or watermarks in contrasting colors were preferred to ensure AI disclosures are noticeable and not easily overlooked. This study contributes to developing more granular audience-centered, practical guidelines for AI transparency in journalism that goes beyond the mere ‘label’, emphasizing that effective disclosure requires more than simply ‘informing’ audiences.",

Using geo-referenced administrative data from Germany and a conditional instrumental variable approach that exploits distance between place of residence and large firms, we find negative financial consequences but show that the dropout penalty is entirely concentrated among individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. We further show that these stratified scars partly reflect unequal educational re-enrollment rates and unequal employment outcomes among dropouts who do not re-enroll. Our results highlight the potential of policies targeting higher graduation rates to reduce social inequality in labor markets. Furthermore, our study suggests that social advantage serves as an important buffer against the negative financial consequences of apprenticeship dropout, even in institutional settings with strong links between credentials and labor market outcomes.",

          "abstract": "IT governance has emerged as one of the most critical elements of organizational success in the modern digital economy in enabling technology assets to support business objectives, reduce risks, and ensure regulatory compliance. Whereas large organizations have the resources and expertise to adopt governance frameworks like COBIT, ISO/IEC 27001, or the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are at a significant disadvantage. Financial limitations, scarcity of skilled human resources, low management awareness level, and complexity in international compliance regulations are likely to deter SMEs from embracing good governance practices (Mirtsch et al., 2021; Almaqtari et al., 2024).\n\nThese challenges are investigated in this research through a comparative study of SMEs in Bangladesh and Denmark, two different settings: a developing and a developed economy. My interest in pursuing this research stems from the fact that I have work experience at AIBL Capital Market Services Limited, where I observed directly the critical role that governance plays in maintaining operational security and efficiency. The inferences are that SMEs in Bangladesh are primarily faced with shortages of resources and infrastructure (Bangladesh Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, 2018), while SMEs in Denmark are faced with the cost and complexity of complying with rigorous regulations such as GDPR and NIS2 European Commission, 2016; European Commission, 2022). The above analysis puts into perspective the need for tailored, context-specific governance styles which are appropriate for SMEs across various economies.",

          "abstract": "Heightened geopolitical tensions, extreme weather conditions, and an increased risk of hybrid attacks have brought renewed attention to crisis preparedness as a key political and research priority across Europe. However, much of the current discourse focuses on individual and household-level measures and overlooks the broader social dimensions of crisis resilience, which are more frequently examined in the aftermath of crises. Given the crucial role of social capital and informal civil society networks in crisis response and recovery, there is a pressing need for greater sociological engagement with the crisis preparedness phase as well. Incorporating literatures of sociology of disasters, civil society studies, crisis management, and disaster risk management, this paper develops an extended sociological framework that conceptualizes crisis preparedness as an inherently social process taking place at the early onset of a crisis. In outlining such a framework, it expands the conceptualization of crisis preparedness beyond individual and material measures to include social infrastructures, such as social capital and the mobilization of civil society. In doing so, the paper contributes to the sociological theory of crisis resilience by conceptualizing crisis preparedness as prospective collective action, thereby reframing sociological understandings of crisis preparedness as risk governance.",

A paradigm shift is required from the logic of the attention economy to that of epistemic signals—structured, auditable, and multi‑sourced claims designed for machine readability. A research agenda is outlined that emphasizes the analysis of algorithmic evidence preferences, the exploration of principles of machine‑readable communication, the development of new metrics such as answer share, and the examination of governance and ethical challenges. Case illustrations from healthcare, finance, and education demonstrate how these inquiries can be operationalized.

          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

          "authors": "Cheng Lin; Adel Daoud",
          "abstract": "Causal reasoning is central to social sciences, supporting both theory development and testing. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to analyze texts across social sciences, yet their abilities to interpret causal statements and reconstruct causal structures remain uncertain in social science texts. This study examines to what extent LLMs can (a) identify causal sentences and (b) recover causal edges to reconstruct directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This examination relies on two text-based simulations and one experiment using real sociological texts. In simulated texts, models reliably detected explicit causal statements but often misclassified non-causal ones, particularly when probabilistic language was used. For causal graph recovery, clarity of expression strongly influenced accuracy. Across 500 replications with real texts, performance ranged from moderate to near perfect, revealing both model heterogeneity and inconsistency. These results indicate that LLMs can assist in extracting causal knowledge from social science texts, yet accurate inference of complex causal mechanisms still requires careful theoretical reasoning. Future applications may benefit from targeted prompting and domain-specific fine-tuning, but their contribution to sociological theorizing should be carefully assessed against traditional methodological standards.",

          "abstract": "This document explores the concepts associated with glitchy writing, which defies conventional academic structures and methodologies. Inspired by Paul Klee's Open Book (1930) and incorporating a variety of collaborative and experimental practices, this work rethinks the boundaries of academic writing by incorporating anarchive concepts, posthuman philosophy, and glitch aesthetics. Drawing on joint studies, theoretical divergences, and intertextual explorations, this paper challenges the norms of linear article structures and proposes a remix approach to scholarly production. Informed by Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) rhizomatic thinking and Erin Manning's (2016) notion of 'minor gestures,' this work emphasizes the dynamic and evolving nature of knowledge production.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization, particularly in its affective form, increasingly shapes how individuals perceive, interact, and collaborate in organizations. This essay argues that partisan prejudice—a growing affective divide between supporters of opposing parties—has become an underexamined but consequential force in workplace communication. We outline an empirical roadmap for advancing research at this intersection. First, we call for descriptive work documenting how polarization manifests in organizations, including inequalities in political expression and the emergence of partisan signaling in daily interactions. Second, we highlight the need to examine how polarization influences workplace communication, from dyadic exchanges to organizational networks, using diverse methodological approaches such as surveys, experiments, and computational analyses. Finally, we encourage research that reverses the causal arrow by investigating how workplace communication might mitigate or exacerbate polarization, considering factors such as leadership communication, virtual collaboration, and diversity initiatives. By integrating theories of polarization and organizational communication, this framework aims to guide systematic inquiry into how political divisions are reproduced—or potentially repaired—through the communicative fabric of work.",

          "authors": "NA; Markus Gangl",
          "abstract": "This study examines how rising income inequality has been impacting individuals' belief in merit-based success, using three decades of survey data from 39 advanced capitalist democracies. Challenging the seminal finding of a \"paradox of inequality,\" we find no evidence of a positive effect of inequality on meritocratic beliefs across countries. Instead, we identify a substantively moderate but robustly negative effect of inequality on perceptions of meritocracy from within-country changes over time: as inequality rises, citizens’ belief in meritocracy declines. We further uncover that inequality does not merely induce a mean shift, but affects the shape of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs insofar as we find the proportion of sceptical perceptions of meritocratic realities to be increasing with higher levels of inequality. Our findings thus suggest that growing inequality undermines citizens’ trust in procedural fairness and contributes to an increased polarisation of attitudes and beliefs at the heart of open societies.",

          "authors": "Elena-María García-Alonso",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) shapes the reproduction of educational inequalities from a sociological perspective. It argues that AI systems are not neutral tools but socio-technical artifacts embedded in power relations that influence knowledge, pedagogical practices, and structures of legitimacy.\nThe analysis highlights three dimensions through which inequality is reproduced: digital divides that go beyond access and include skills and algorithmic literacy; structural and cultural biases embedded in AI processes such as admission, assessment, and adaptive learning; and algorithmic governmentality, which governs education through surveillance, metrics, and automated feedback, producing new forms of subjectivity oriented toward efficiency rather than critical thinking.\nThe article concludes that AI in education is an ethical and political challenge. It calls for inclusive and contextualized platform design, critical training for teachers, participatory co-design of evaluation systems, and governance mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability. From the sociology of education, promoting digital environments that are democratic, inclusive, and emancipatory is essential to achieve educational justice in the age of AI.",

          "abstract": "Framing contests often ensue around levels of protest violence and who the perpetrators are, and such frames can be out of step with the actual violent or peaceful nature of protests. During the 2020 racial justice protests, many capitalized on dramatic images of violence and property damage to frame the protests as violent with the left-wing group Antifa as the culprit. Drawing on event data and news reports covering the 2020 racial justice protests and comparing to historical U.S. protest data, we examine the central claims of this framing contest. We find that this wave of racial justice protests was more peaceful than Civil Rights protests of the 1960’s and that Antifa was present at only a handful of events which turned violent. We also find that media attention to Antifa corresponded with declining support for BLM, suggesting that scapegoating Antifa led to a decline in support of the movement.",

          "abstract": "Retail investors have greatly increased their options trading volume, raising questions about whether higher payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) rates that brokerages receive from option trades are linked with increased brokerage options promotion. In this paper, I conduct an empirical study to explore the association between options PFOF rates and promotion across four brokerages: Robinhood, Webull, E*TRADE, and Charles Schwab. Utilizing their SEC Rule 606(a) reports and social media posts from X, Facebook, and Instagram, I calculate a monthly average options PFOF rate for each brokerage and construct an options promotion strength score through a hand-coded framework. I find that Robinhood and E*TRADE initially display a statistically significant association, and Charles Schwab joins them when a one-month lag is introduced. However, when controlling for market-wide options activity through OCC equity options volume, no brokerage has a statistically significant association with their average options PFOF rate, and Robinhood displays statistical significance with the OCC equity options volume; this may partly be attributed to overcontrolling if market-wide options activity is a downstream effect of options promotion. Lastly, when excluding E*TRADE and Charles Schwab's transition months following acquisitions, neither brokerage displays a statistically significant association. Collectively, the evidence suggests heterogeneity among brokerages, with Robinhood showing the clearest association between options PFOF and promotion strength. The results have implications on regulation surrounding best-interest obligations and options disclosures, especially as more retail investors enter the market.",

          "authors": "Andres Molina",
          "abstract": "Traditional labor negotiations are frequently perceived as difficult and high-risk, involving actors predisposed to defensive and antagonistic positions. This work addresses this problem by exploring the application of intercultural negotiation techniques, typically used in commercial relations, as a viable alternative for improving negotiations between unions and companies. Through an investigative and practical approach, utilizing tools borrowed from social anthropology, the author identified and measured significant cultural differences, not only among nationalities but also between the negotiating entities themselves: companies and unions. Although the negotiators' country of origin culture is predominant, there is a marked, albeit relative, difference between business culture and union culture, regardless of the country of origin. This relative difference proved sufficient to apply intercultural techniques, changing the traditional antagonistic view. The underlying model contrasts these cultures across eight key dimensions (Table 1) and underscores the importance of Cultural Intelligence (CQ) for managing communication, trust, and power in this context. The application of this approach has shown promising results, including the reduction in the number of requests in the petitions, the decrease in the number of negotiation rounds required, and agreements that are more beneficial for both parties. This methodology promotes a collaborative vision instead of a confrontational one, which is essential for constructive dialogue in the modern labor market.",

          "abstract": "This paper uses original panel data from Senegal to evaluate the effect of co-residence with elderly individuals on the educational attainment of female children. To identify this effect, I exploit the deaths of elderly co-residents which occur during the study period in an empirical strategy which relies on triple-differences with child fixed-effects. I show that an event of elderly death is associated with 23% additional education completed over a period of 4 years by affected girls. I present evidence that changes in demand for informal caregiving among older female children within the household are one of the mechanisms at play. These results highlight the importance of female teenagers in caregiving activities and suggest that policies that increase the availability of formal care for the elderly could reduce gender inequalities in education in contexts similar to Senegal.",

          "abstract": "With robots expected to replace humans in some professions, AI presents a new development prospect through the provisions of data work. For over a decade, large Silicon Valley technology firms have been relying on outsourcing of data work via a host of intermediary suppliers and labour platforms to different parts of the globe often the Global South region, such as East Africa. Much of this work is often shrouded in secrecy as firms rarely reveal the extent of their value chains. This results in the poor and marginalised forming the hidden underbelly of the Silicon Valley, training some of their most advanced machines in adverse working conditions. Drawing upon the survey of workers in Kenya, a major hub for data work in Africa, the paper highlights the physical and psychological impacts on workers. Survey data is complemented with in-depth interviews and auto-ethnographic account of two ex-data workers-turned activists who worked for a large data enrichment firms in Kenya.

          "abstract": "This study investigates whether consumer ratings of hotel eco-friendliness reflect actual sustainability performance. Using data from 6,696 hotels in the world’s 100 leading destinations, we compared Expedia’s post-travel, customer-submitted eco-friendliness ratings with sustainability information reported on Booking.com, including both self-reported practices and third-party certifications. Support Vector Machine regression analysis shows that eco-friendliness ratings are explained almost entirely by overall guest satisfaction, with sustainability indicators contributing little explanatory power. This suggests that ratings conflate general service impressions with perceptions of environmental responsibility, limiting their value as measures of sustainability performance. While plausible explanations such as response biases and the limited salience of many certified practices warrant further research, our findings provide robust evidence that single survey items on eco-friendliness should be interpreted with caution. For platforms and policymakers, the results highlight the need to make sustainability cues more visible and directly tied to the consumer experience if ratings are to support informed choice.",

          "authors": "Daniel Martinez-Felip; Steven G.M. Schilizzi; Chi Nguyen; David Pannell",
          "abstract": "In analysing potential policy responses to improve outcomes in collective-action problems, economists often focus on financial disincentives to reduce the expected gains from free-riding and thereby promote within-group cooperation. In this study, we investigate the potential for groups to develop non-financial disincentives to free riding, thereby promoting convergence towards collectively beneficial actions. Using a within-subjects laboratory experiment, participants play two multi-period public-goods games sequentially: without and then with non-financial incentives activated by allowing for the endogenous formation of a social exclusion mechanism. This is operationalised by allowing participants, at a personal cost, to assign exclusion tickets to group members after observing their contributions: the member(s) having accumulated the most in their group gets excluded from a group activity not involving monetary payoffs nor linked to the main game. First, the threat of receiving exclusion tickets, then the threat of being excluded, and finally actually being excluded work as non-financial social disincentives to free ride. Results show that group members who contribute relatively less receive more exclusion tickets. By imposing expected social costs on relatively low contributors, exclusion or the threat of exclusion enables groups to operate with higher contribution levels, thereby reversing the collective decline in contributions observed in the Baseline public good game. Exclusion is experienced by individuals who consistently contribute less than other group members, and this experience amplifies the effectiveness of the subsequent exclusion threat. Willingness to incur personal costs to enhance the exclusion threat increases over time and it is shaped by more cooperative normative expectations. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who perceive norms as tight, especially when higher contributions become more dispersed. In the absence of financial disincentives, these patterns show how non-financial incentives, shaped by more cooperative normative expectations, can foster group coordination and higher public-good contributions.",
