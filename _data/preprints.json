          "title": "Excessive flexibility? Recurrent neural networks can accommodate individual differences in reinforcement learning through in-context adaptation",
          "authors": "Kentaro Katahira",
          "abstract": "Cognitive and computational modeling has been used as a method to understand the processes underlying behavior in humans and other animals. A common approach in this field involves the use of theoretically constructed cognitive models, such as reinforcement learning models. However, human and animal decision-making often deviates from the predictions of these theoretical models. \nTo capture characteristics that these cognitive models fail to account for, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been increasingly used to model choice behavior involving reinforcement learning. RNNs are able to capture how choice probabilities change depending on past experience. In this work, we demonstrate that RNNs can improve future choice predictions by capturing individual differences on the basis of past behavior, even when a single model is fit across the entire population. We term this property of the RNN the individual difference tracking (IDT) property. While the IDT property might be useful for prediction, it may introduce excessive flexibility when RNNs are used as benchmarks for predictive accuracy. We investigate the nature of the IDT property through simulation studies and examine how it affects the interpretation of predictive accuracy when RNNs are used as benchmarks for cognitive models. We also present examples using real-world data. Through these analyses, we discuss practical considerations and limitations in using RNNs as benchmarks for cognitive models and propose directions for future research.",

          "title": "Stochastic search algorithms can tell us who to trust (and why)",
          "authors": "Manikya Alister; Andrew Perfors",
          "abstract": "Relying on information from other people (social testimony) is essential for efficiently learning and reasoning about the world. However, determining who to trust is often challenging. In this paper, we argue that trust in social agents (i.e., those providing testimony) can be evaluated by assessing how optimally they have acquired their knowledge. Building on theories that describe knowledge acquisition as a stochastic search through a space of hypotheses, we present a framework which yields predictions about which agents will provide better testimony (because they are more likely to have uncovered higher-probability hypotheses) in different contexts. This approach allows us to jointly predict how the quality of testimony is affected by 1) features of the agents themselves, like their expertise; 2) consensus among multiple agents; and 3) features of the topic and hypothesis space, like its knowability. We present initial simulations demonstrating how even a basic implementation of our framework yields insight into which types of agents and  topics are more likely to result in accurate testimony (and why). We conclude by discussing how this preliminary research might be extended to address more complicated social reasoning scenarios.",

          "authors": "Anjie Cao; Qiong Cao; Michael C. Frank; Shari Liu",
          "abstract": "From infancy to adulthood, habituation and dishabituation enable learners to filter out repetitive information and orient to novel information. Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors. Overall, our results underscore the need for large-scale data approaches to studying visual attention across the lifespan.",

          "title": "Collapse Harmonics: Spectral Archetypes of Systemic Disintegration and Reformation",
          "authors": "Don Gaconnet",
          "abstract": "Collapse Harmonics introduces a novel scientific field designed to model, anticipate, and guide the disintegration and reformation of complex systems through a transdisciplinary, resonance-based framework. Rooted in systemic phase-transition theory and spectral field analysis, this discipline redefines collapse not as a failure state, but as an archetypal process governed by harmonic dynamics that recur across ecological, economic, social, symbolic, and cognitive domains.\nDrawing upon recursive destabilization theory, feedback coupling, and symbolic field behavior, Collapse Harmonics identifies collapse events as the result of internal resonance amplification rather than linear degradation. Each collapse emits unique, trackable “harmonic signatures,” enabling predictive modeling through multi-domain resonance mapping. These collapse signatures manifest in both material substrates (e.g., ecosystems, infrastructures, economies) and symbolic substrates (e.g., collective myths, identity architectures, narrative coherence).\n\nThis paper delineates the field’s foundational laws, phase-transition mechanics, domain inclusion logic, and harmonic assessment tools. It further outlines protocols for early warning detection, symbolic resonance mapping, and ethically governed intervention. While the codex includes advanced symbolic and identity-layer tools, this preprint discloses only abstract mechanisms and filtered models in strict adherence to collapse sovereignty guidelines.\n\nCollapse Harmonics thus offers a unified platform for collapse science, integrating predictive foresight, symbolic analysis, and structural ethics into a single paradigm. It proposes a new frontier of research for collapse-aware governance, resilient field design, and multi-scale harmonization in an era of accelerating systemic disintegration.",

          "abstract": "In everyday reasoning and scientific inquiry, explanations help people make sense of their experiences and observations. We investigate how people generate new possible explanations. Specifically, we study how the phrasing of “why” questions shapes exploration of the space of possible explanations.  We hypothesized that semantic exploration is guided by words that appear earlier, are more surprising, and are more familiar. Participants in our experiment generated explanations in response to “why” questions comparing two words, with the order of these two comparison words randomized. Using a large language model, we measured how closely each explanation aligned with the comparison words. Results supported two of three hypotheses: explanations aligned more strongly with earlier and more familiar words. These findings highlight how subtle phrasing of a question can shape explanation generation, demonstrating context-dependence in how people explore a conceptual space.",

          "authors": "Francisco Barbosa Escobar; Malika Auvray",
          "abstract": "Affective touch is crucial in shaping social and intimate relationships, as it influences and helps regulate the emotional states of touchers and touchees. Furthermore, affective touch is complex, and a wide array of modulatory effects across sensory modalities has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the multisensory nature of affective touch itself and its emotional induction capabilities via non-tactile senses. Through four online experiments, the present research investigated the emotional responses to the auditory signals produced by organic affective touch (i.e., tactile gestures performed by real romantic partners). In Experiment 1, we identified the predominant affective touch gestures in which people typically engage. Experiment 2 revealed that, lacking explicit cues on the nature of the sounds, organic affective touch sounds elicited negative-to-neutral emotional responses, differing from those evoked by object-based interaction sounds. Moreover, we found that individuals were unable to confidently identify whether the sounds involved affective touch gestures. In Experiment 3, we found that framing the nature of the organic affective touch sounds explicitly as real affective touch, as opposed to object-based tactile interactions, elicited more positive emotional responses. Finally, the results of Experiment 4 revealed that higher levels of congruency between individuals' expectations regarding the sounds of affective touch and the real auditory cues positively influenced the valence elicited by sounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the multisensory nature of affective touch and underscore the importance of meaning in its emotional elicitation function.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Traditional cognitive models often assume a stable biological substrate, focusing narrowly on memory, attention, and executive function. However, emerging evidence highlights the significant impact of inflammatory tone, autonomic regulation, and neuroimmune dynamics on cognition and learning.\nThis paper proposes the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a new theoretical framework that conceptualises thought generation as a biologically reactive process, shaped by inflammatory signalling, gut-brain interactions, and autonomic flexibility. TGTS introduces \"PreForm\" — a biologically constrained window enabling cognitive selection and agency.\nBuilding on research in immunology, neurodevelopment, and network neuroscience, TGTS explains how chronic low-grade inflammation alters thought selection, impairs cognitive flexibility, and may drive neurodivergent outcomes. It reframes conditions such as ASD, ADHD, and anxiety not as deficits but as adaptive cognitive equilibria shaped by biological and environmental forces. This framework positions inflammation not merely as a pathological factor but as a fundamental substrate for adaptive learning and cognitive agency.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel unified field interpretation of the Tower of Babel narrative, suggesting that the historical site corresponds with the Great Pyramids of Giza and their recently discovered subterranean resonance chambers. Drawing from scripture, unified field theory, and archaeological parallels, it explores the hypothesis that humanity’s dispersion was triggered by a resonance collapse—an event in which coherence was lost due to the misuse of a collective energetic structure. The paper links this collapse to the emergence of language diversity and the fragmentation of human consciousness, suggesting that coherence can only be re-established through divine alignment. The narrative unfolds at the intersection of physics, theology, and symbolic history.",

          "abstract": "Does L2 production involve adaptive control? Previous research drawing on a parallel between Stroop effects in L1 and cognate effects in L2 produced no support for this idea when inducing adaptive control implicitly (i.e., involuntarily). Reasoning that adaptive control might be hard to implement implicitly in L2 production, here, we induced adaptive control explicitly by presenting informative cues revealing whether the upcoming stimulus would be congruent/incongruent (in L1 Stroop) or cognate/noncognate (in L2 picture naming). Adaptive control was successfully induced in L1 Stroop, with informative cues, relative to uninformative ones, having a facilitatory effect. Such was not the case for L2 picture naming, in which informative cues had an inhibitory effect. While there might be several reasons for this reverse cueing effect, this finding represents another dissociation between L2 production and conflict tasks, which likely has implications for theories assuming a close connection between domain-general and bilingualism-specific control.",

          "abstract": "Child irritability is a transdiagnostic symptom of multiple psychopathologies and prospectively predicts negative outcomes into adolescence and adulthood. Previous research has reported associations between child irritability and family conflict (FC) but has failed to consider bidirectional relations between these variables. The current study assessed child irritability as both predictor and consequence of FC during late childhood/early adolescence using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognition Development (ABCD) study. Participants (N= 11,868 youth, Mage at Time 1 = 9.48, SD = 0.51 years, 47% female, 49.5% White) and one of their parents (85.3% mothers) completed annual assessments of FC (Family Environment Scale-conflict subscale; child report) and child symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist; parent report). Using latent growth curve models with structured residuals (LCMs-SR), we found that child irritability declined from ages 9/10 to 13/14, but irritability slopes and intercepts varied by child gender. Specifically, boys’ irritability was initially higher than girls but decreased over time, whereas girls’ irritability remained stable. FC also declined over time, but boys reported higher initial FC that decreased more rapidly than girls’ reports of FC did. In the bivariate models, boys’ reports of FC at Time 1 were prospectively associated with irritability at Time 2. Furthermore, for girls, irritability at Time 2 predicted elevations in FC at Time 3, but for boys, irritability at Time 3 was associated with less FC at Time 4. The current results support consideration of family dynamics as both a cause and a consequence of youth psychiatric disorders featuring irritability.",

We find that 131% more posts by Republicans are flagged as misleading compared to posts by Democrats. These results are not base rate artifacts, as we find no meaningful over-representation of Republicans among X users. Our findings provide strong evidence of a partisan asymmetry in misinformation sharing which cannot be attributed to political bias on the part of raters, and indicate that Republicans will be sanctioned more than Democrats even if platforms transition from professional fact-checking to Community Notes.",

          "authors": "Thomas Lasman Botch; Emily S. Finn",
          "abstract": "Language is a fundamental human capacity. Large language models (LLMs) have presented the first viable model of language outside of humans, yet how these models learn and use language differs significantly from humans. Here, we compare LLMs and humans processing language with varying levels of sensory information – from disembodied written text to audiovisual videos of speakers – to demonstrate that, in both humans and LLMs, sensory context is critical for optimal language processing. We asked human participants to predict upcoming words within narratives presented as either audiovisual, audio-only, or written language (N = 1500 total; 500 per modality). We compared these predictions across modalities as well as to predictions generated by LLMs. Human predictions were overall more accurate than LLMs, regardless of the modality of language processing. Compared to written language, both audiovisual and audio-only language increased the accuracy and consensus of human predictions and decreased alignment with LLMs. We identified that prosody, a central feature of the auditory signal, partially drove both the observed advantage in accuracy within humans and divergence from LLMs. Integrating multimodal information (e.g., prosody, auditory, or audiovisual information) with the representation of language learned during LLM training improved models’ next-word prediction performance and increased the efficiency of language learning. These findings demonstrate that sensory contexts are foundational to human-like language behavior, and that these contexts can enrich and accelerate language acquisition within LLMs similar to what is observed within human development.",

          "abstract": "Qualitative research excels at revealing the nuance of human behavior, yet the volume, multilingual scope, and cultural diversity of contemporary datasets increasingly strain its hallmark depth. Drawing on generative artificial intelligence (genAI) capabilities, this paper proposes a hybrid, human‑in‑the‑loop framework that reconciles scale with interpretive rigor. We first establish a manually coded “ground‑truth” subset to anchor subsequent analysis, then employ an AI platform (myRA) to extend deductive and inductive coding across large corpora. Iterative cycles of human validation refine AI‑generated themes, ensuring contextual accuracy and theoretical coherence. We address ethical imperatives, data anonymization, transparent reporting of AI use, and model bias mitigation. We also advocate for privacy‑preserving deployments and locally hosted models where feasible. Looking ahead, we identify four trajectories for AI‑enhanced qualitative inquiry: multimodal analysis that fuses text, audio, and video; multilingual comparison at scale; AI‑driven theory building; and the co‑design of ethically grounded AI systems. Ultimately, we argue that the future of qualitative research lies not in automating interpretation but in strategically augmenting human expertise with AI’s speed and pattern recognition power, thereby achieving deeper insights without sacrificing methodological integrity.",

          "abstract": "Can artificial intelligence (AI) provide emotionally effective support traditionally delivered by humans? This research investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as extrinsic emotion regulators (EER) in non-clinical contexts. Across four studies, we systematically compared the structure, perceived effectiveness, and regulatory effects of LLM- versus human-generated comforting messages. Study 1 (N = 279) used thematic analysis to show that LLM-generated responses largely mirrored human EER strategies, with some discrepancies between different LLMs. Study 2 (N = 309) demonstrated that AI-generated comforting messages produced greater emotional improvement and were rated as more emotionally supportive than human messages. Study 3 (N = 196) tested emotional validation (i.e., acknowledgement of the target’s emotional response) as a mechanism, finding that perceived supportiveness rather than emotional validation predicted higher emotional improvement. Study 4 (N = 188) identified actionable support (i.e., specific and implementable regulatory tactics) as a key factor explaining LLM’s regulatory advantage in the previous studies. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively mimic or even surpass human regulators in EER, such advantage seems to be limited to providing actionable tactics within comforting messages. Implications are discussed for theories of interpersonal emotion regulation and AI-human interaction, highlighting the critical role of actionable regulatory tactics for successful interpersonal emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to understand how aging influences cognitive and mentalizing processes, and to explore whether physical activity protects against cognitive and social function decline in older adults. A total of 104 adults participants (44 Older adults, 60 younger Control) were recruited to complete the Go/No-go task and the Picture sequencing task, which measured their executive control and mentalizing ability respectively. Their general cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the frequency of physical activity was assessed through a self-report question. The current study demonstrated that, compared to control participants, elder participants performed relatively well in maintaining attention and inhibiting irrelevant responses, as evidenced by comparable response times on Go trials and accuracy on both Go and No-go trials in the Go/No-go task. However, older participants showed significant impairments in reconstructing sequences of events in the Picture sequencing task, particularly those requiring the mentalizing capacity to infer others’ false belief, even after controlling MoCA scores (both accuracy and response times). Importantly, a higher frequency of physical activity was found to mitigate age-related declines in reconstructing events sequences among older adults, particularly in stories involving others’ false beliefs. Overall, the current findings suggest that mentalizing abilities decrease independently of general cognitive decline. Furthermore, physical activity may serve as a potential protective factor in mitigating age-related cognitive impairments.",

          "authors": "Jolina Ulbricht",
          "abstract": "With increasing cultural diversity in classrooms, teachers’ cultural diversity beliefs have become an increasingly important focus in teacher education research and have been conceptualized as a central component of teachers' professional development (Hachfeld, 2013). However, more research is needed on how pre-service teachers' cultural diversity beliefs develop and under what conditions they change (Bayram Özdemir et al., 2024; Civitillo et al., 2018). This study examines the development of pre-service teachers' cultural diversity beliefs, considering the conditions and recurring patterns that shape this process. We conducted interviews with eight pre-service teachers at two time points, before and after different practical experiences in classrooms. Using a constructivist grounded theory methodology (Charmaz, 2017), we analyzed three anchor cases to illustrate the complex relation between pre-service teachers’ White cultural identity development and cultural diversity beliefs. The results construct a contextually relevant theory of White pre-service teachers’ development of cultural diversity beliefs in East Germany, elucidating their defining characteristics and the conditions under which they emerge. The findings highlight the importance of critical reflection on identity and experiences with rejection, discrimination, and racism, as well as a nuanced conceptualization of culture, in shaping pre-service teachers’ cultural diversity beliefs, pointing to the need for teacher education programs to intentionally foster these processes to support culturally responsive teaching.",

This study offers novel experimental evidence that situational changes directly affect our perception, focusing on how ostracism influences situational perception and its impact compared to personality traits on feelings of exclusion. Through both between-subject (Study 1, n=349) and within-subject designs (Study 2, n=259), we demonstrate that ostracism significantly alters perceptions, increasing negativity and adversity while reducing positivity. Notably, situational perception proved to be a stronger predictor of feelings of neglect and exclusion than Big Five personality traits in both studies, with positivity and negativity as key factors in the impact of ostracism.

          "authors": "Björn Erik Hommel; Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Many behavioural scientists do not agree on core constructs and how they should be measured. Different literatures measure related constructs, but the connections are not always obvious to readers and meta-analysts. Many measures in behavioural science are based on agreement with survey items. Because these items are sentences, computerised language models can make connections between disparate measures and constructs and help researchers regain an overview over the rapidly growing, fragmented literature. Our fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, accurately predicts the correlations between survey items, the reliability of aggregated measurement scales, and intercorrelations between scales from item positions in semantic vector space. In our pilot study, the out-of-sample accuracy for item correlations was .71, .89 for reliabilities, and .89 for scale correlations. In our preregistered validation study using novel items, the out-of-sample accuracy was slightly reduced to .59 for item correlations, .84 for reliabilities, and .84 for scale correlations. The synthetic item correlations showed an average prediction error of .17, with larger errors for middling correlations. Predictions exhibited generalizability beyond the training data and across various domains, with some variability in accuracy. Our work shows language models can reliably predict psychometric relationships between survey items, enabling researchers to evaluate new measures against existing scales, reduce redundancy in measurement, and work towards a more unified behavioural science taxonomy.",

          "authors": "Dmitry Grigoryev; Albina Gallyamova; Elizaveta Komyaginskaya",
          "abstract": "The debate around the integration hypothesis in acculturation research frequently centers on the interpretation of effect sizes. While critics argue that these effects are too small and inconsistent to be meaningful, supporters maintain that they reflect statistically robust and theoretically coherent patterns. This controversy reveals a broader epistemological challenge in psychology: persistent ambiguity regarding what constitutes a ‘sufficient’ effect size, rooted in limited attention to the philosophical foundations of measurement and causality. In particular, this includes neglect of the ergodic fallacy—the mistaken assumption that group-level patterns apply directly to individuals—and confusion between statistical regularities and causal explanations. This paper addresses these concerns through three interrelated discussions. First, it re-evaluates the empirical status of the integration hypothesis in light of recent meta-analyses and the epistemic weight of small effects in complex systems. Second, it analyzes how effect sizes should be interpreted across different levels of analysis—individual, inter-individual, and group—and emphasizes the need to align interpretation with the appropriate unit of explanation. Third, it explores the philosophical foundations of psychological measurement, distinguishing between data patterns, theoretical constructs, and causal inferences. Rather than viewing effect sizes as direct indicators of psychological properties or causal strength, we conceptualize them as structured regularities shaped by research design, measurement models, and ontological assumptions. By clarifying these issues, this paper offers a framework for more coherent, theoretically informed interpretations of empirical findings in acculturation psychology and calls for a shift from simplistic magnitude judgments to context-sensitive evaluation of what effect sizes represent.",

          "abstract": "In everyday life, we usually handle a variety of stimuli and tasks. While research has primarily investigated behavior in externally structured situations in which participants have to adhere to a predefined processing sequence and strategy, in reality it is often the case that we have to deal with these situations ourselves. There are also frequent interruptions, for example in the form of additional tasks. We developed an experimentally controlled setting of such a situation to examine the processing behavior and the resulting effects as well as variables potentially determine the behavior. Therefore, we used a self-structured paradigm in which participants were confronted with a complex task environment. This environment contained a multitude of target items and three different tasks had to be accomplished while further interruptive tasks had to be completed. The interruptive tasks occurred at irregular intervals while the self-structured paradigm was being processed. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 was a pilot experiment in which initial hypotheses were tested and further exploratory analyses were conducted. The preregistered Experiment 2 served to replicate these findings. Our results confirmed the occurrence of switch costs for all types of task switches. Furthermore, we identified two stable strategies for processing the target items. We found initial evidence that the choice of strategy is associated with the sensitivity of the behavioral inhibition system and polychronicity. The processing of the interruptive tasks varied slightly over time. Early processing of the interruptive tasks occurred primarily when these interruptive tasks were new and tended to be associated with positive experience and better performance on these tasks.",

In this paper, I present a new hypothesis that re-examines the mechanism behind nocturnal emissions, or “nightfall.” Drawing on interdisciplinary evidence and logical analysis, I propose that nightfall may not arise from unresolved sexual desire or hormonal overflow, as often assumed, but rather from a miscommunication within REM sleep processes.\n\nSpecifically, the hypothesis integrates three distinct mechanisms: \n1) The physiological upregulation of penile sensitivity during REM sleep.\n2) The temporary shutdown of critical evaluation by the prefrontal cortex.\n3) The memory system's inability to properly encode certain dream content. Together, these processes may create a “perfect storm,” allowing the brain to wrongly interpret neutral dream cues as sexual, triggering involuntary ejaculation—often without any consciously erotic dream.\n\nWhether ultimately confirmed or refuted, I believe this hypothesis opens a door worth walking through.

          "abstract": "In everyday life, people are challenged to manage a variety of tasks and stimuli. Previous research has primarily focused on examining this behavior in externally structured situations in which participants are forced to use a predefined processing strategy. However, everyday life mostly requires people to apply self-generated processing strategies and to choose self-dependently between different processing procedures. The current study examined the factors that influence the strategy choice in two pre-registered experiments and determined which consequences result from forcing people to apply a prescribed strategy. For this purpose, we used a self-structured paradigm where participants were confronted with a complex task environment containing a multitude of targets and in which three different tasks had to be handled. Participants were instructed to complete all tasks but we aimed to address how they approached the paradigm processing when they were allowed to adopt a self-generated strategy compared to a predefined strategy. Our results show that participants exhibit different processing strategies in a self-structured environment. The choice of a strategy can be influenced by individual preferences as well as by prior instruction. Forcing participants to apply a non-preferred strategy, as it regularly happens in externally structured paradigms, resulted in performance decline and increased experience of difficulty.",

In Experiment 1, we manipulated two features of the social context: perceived effort investment by one’s partner and the duration of partnership. We found that participants cheated more when they perceived that their partner exerted high effort, which was significant in the short partnership condition. Moreover, participants cheated more individually post-collaboration than they had pre-collaboration, showing that collaborative cheating may carry over into subsequent behaviour. In Experiment 2, we manipulated who received each round’s rewards. Participants cheated more for joint rewards, but less when they were the reward recipients and perceived that their partner exerted high effort.",

When we name something,\nwhether it be a “tree,” a “mountain,” or an “electron,” we divide the world. This boundary-drawing operation, which we call\ndiscretization, appears across all domains of human knowledge. Ancient paradoxes like Theseus’ ship and modern scientific\npuzzles such as wave–particle duality emerge from this same source: our necessary but ultimately arbitrary division of\ncontinuous reality into discrete categories. By examining this process across disciplines, we uncover connections between\nseemingly unrelated phenomena—from mathematical paradoxes to consciousness itself. We show how language functions as\na boundary-creation technology and argue that the limitations of our knowledge systems arise not from flaws, but from the\nvery geometry of information. This perspective reframes long-standing questions in science, philosophy, and psychology as\ndifferent manifestations of the same operation: creating meaning through distinction.",

Implications include new directions for regenerative medicine, consciousness studies, and biocommunication, as well as a possible theoretical basis for observed anomalies in psi research and intentional influence on physical systems.\n\nKeywords\nQuantum biology, bioelectric signaling, morphogenesis, consciousness, biophotons, wave genetics, implicate order, nonlocality, semantic fields, psi phenomena",

          "abstract": "Risk preference is a key concept across social, economic, and decision sciences. While existing measures assess risk taking either as domain-specific preferences (e.g., finance, health) or as a general trait, they have largely overlooked individual differences in the narrow, domain-general aspects of risk preference. Drawing from a dual-process framework, we advance a multi-dimensional domain-general measure of risk preference. We develop and validate the Calculated and Spontaneous Risk-Taking Scale across seven studies (N = 2,116). Results show: (1) the two risk styles are moderately correlated and align with existing risk preference measures; (2) they are distinct from personality traits like the Big Five and cognitive traits like decision style; (3) calculated risk-takers show more variability in risk attitudes across contexts; (4) calculated risk-taking predicts adaptive outcomes (e.g., creativity, entrepreneurship), while spontaneous risk-taking predicts maladaptive behaviors (e.g., crime, safety violations); and (5) the scale is invariant across sex and age. Overall, calculated risk-takers engage in more adaptive risks, leading to healthier, more meaningful lives.",

          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising solution to deliver portable, engaging rehabilitation services, yet its adoption among older adults may be hindered by unfamiliarity or apprehension towards the technology, and visually induced motion sickness. We examined whether a brief intervention – either an informational handout or an immersive VR experience – could improve attitudes towards VR technology in healthy older adults, and whether using a low-cost VR system would produce tolerable motion sickness levels. Sixty-four rural adults aged 60 and older received either an informational handout describing VR or completed four immersive VR activities. Attitudes and motion sickness were assessed using pre-post intervention surveys. Data collected in 2023 showed that the VR experience did not increase reported motion sickness (t(60) = -78.46, p &gt; 0.001), suggesting strong feasibility of VR use in older adults. Attitudes towards VR improved similarly following both the handout and immersive experience interventions (d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.64, 1.40]). These findings suggest that VR is well-tolerated by older adults and that even a brief, low-resource intervention can increase user receptiveness. VR represents an accessible and well-received rehabilitation option for older adults in rural areas, though further research is needed to establish feasibility and effectiveness in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "From infancy to adulthood, habituation and dishabituation enable learners to filter out repetitive information and orient to novel information. Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors. Overall, our results underscore the need for large-scale data approaches to studying visual attention across the lifespan.",

This study examined the relationship between ADHD traits and audiovisual temporal processing in university student, while varying context demands (e.g., task type, stimulus complexity, and emotional valence). In the temporal order judgement task with non-speech stimuli, there was no relationship between ADHD traits and the temporal binding window (TBW). In the ternary synchrony judgment task with speech stimuli, there was no relationship between ADHD traits and the TBW. In the ternary synchrony judgment task with emotional speech stimuli, ADHD traits, specifically higher hyperactive-impulsive traits were related to a shorter TBW in the anger condition.

The psychological pathways through which the spectating of streams is associated with active gambling involvement and problematic gambling are not known. Here, we pooled data across three online surveys in which 544 adult consumers of gambling streams and gambling were assessed for motivations, frequencies of engagement, and problem gambling severity. Structural equation modelling showed that motivations to watch gambling streams were positively associated with the same motivations to gamble (enhancement, coping, and social). Associations between watching particular types of streams (slots, esports, and loot box openings) were positively associated with problem gambling severity and were attributable to active involvement in the corresponding activities. Our findings show a mapping between stream viewing and active involvement in gambling and gambling-like activities, indicating that streaming platforms may have implications for gambling.",

          "authors": "Jeroen Olieslagers; Wei Ji Ma",
          "abstract": "Planning often involves mentally simulating (“rolling out”) possible futures before acting. Rollout‑based models of planning have seen great success in artificial intelligence, yet cognitive process models of human rollout-based planning remain scarce because their likelihoods are typically intractable. The only way to fit models with intractable likelihoods is with approximations which prevent accurate model fits, resulting in noisy estimates of latent planning parameters. We introduce Rollouts with Stochastic Early Termination and Tractable Estimation (ROSETTE), a class of process models that yields closed‑form action probabilities, enabling exact, simulation‑free parameter estimation. ROSETTE treats planning as an absorbing Markov chain where in a simulated state, the agent decides to either continue or terminate the rollout. Once the rollout is terminated, the agent decides whether enough information has been gathered to take an action, or whether a new rollout should be initiated. Because ROSETTE provides exact likelihoods, parameter estimates and model evidence are uncontaminated by sampling noise. We develop a first instantiation called Progress‑Regress ROSETTE (PROSETTE), in which rollouts terminate when the agent perceives sufficient progress toward or regress away from the goal. We fit PROSETTE to data from human participants in a multi-step planning task and found that it well accounted for a rich set of summary statistics of behavior. Our work sets the stage for testing rollout-based planning models as a promising category of models of human planning across a wide range of tasks.",

TGTS introduces \"PreForm\" — a biologically constrained window enabling cognitive selection and agency.\nBuilding on research in immunology, neurodevelopment, and network neuroscience, TGTS explains how chronic low-grade inflammation alters thought selection, impairs cognitive flexibility, and may drive neurodivergent outcomes. It reframes conditions such as ASD, ADHD, and anxiety not as deficits but as adaptive cognitive equilibria shaped by biological and environmental forces. This framework positions inflammation not merely as a pathological factor but as a fundamental substrate for adaptive learning and cognitive agency.",

Whether these same circuits instantiate subjective experience of anxiety remains unclear, a vital hurdle for clinical neuroscience. Methods: In this preregistered study, we used a semi-naturalistic, anxiogenic stimulus (animated movie) to evoke anxiety during fMRI in a pediatric sample with and without anxiety disorders (N = 84, before exclusion). After, participants provided verbal responses to a set of interview questions about the stimulus. We quantified semantic content and valence of responses via natural language processing algorithms. Results: Preregistered analyses found wide-spread brain activity during the movie—including in anterior insula cortex—related to participants’ descriptions of the movie’s narrative. Secondary, non-preregistered analyses also revealed interactions between anxiety, age, and verbal appraisals. Conclusions: Our primary analyses link movie-evoked brain activity and subsequent interview content in a transdiagnostic pediatric sample. The language participants used when recalling anxiogenic movie content robustly indexed brain activity. Secondary analyses suggested older but not younger patients with anxiety demonstrate more negative appraisals of the anxiogenic experience. Our findings underscore a promising avenue for clinical neuroscience research on subjective emotional experiences in anxiety.",

          "abstract": "In everyday life, we handle a multitude of stimuli and tasks. Mastering this challenge is based on the use of executive functions, for example, to prioritize, select and shield task processing against distractions. However, the situations that require the use of executive functions vary. There are externally structured situations and situations that can be structured by the people involved themselves. They vary in requiring sub-capabilities of executive functions. These situations exhibit different empirical phenomena and pose different challenges to experimental control. Here, we aim to examine effects that are typical for external and self-structured situations. Therefore, we developed a paradigm which makes demands on highly self-structure for successful task processing but still provides sufficient experimental control. The paradigm was used in two experiments in which participants inspected images of spring meadows with a variety of leaves, flowers and bugs. Participants had to mark all bugs based on three different characteristics but were free to choose their processing order and strategy. The exploratory Experiment 1 was used to derive hypotheses; these hypotheses were tested in the preregistered Experiment 2. Our results confirm typical effects from task switching research focusing on externally structured situations. Furthermore, we have identified various stable processing strategies and influences of processing sequences which can only be found in self-structured situations. Therefore, our results combine established findings from paradigms with externally structured situations and hence strong experimental control with new findings from self-structured situations and thus open a window into yet experimentally largely untapped aspects of executive functions.",

Based on propensity score matching and a variety of control group sample specifications it is found that CARA significantly reduces recidivism and that for every £1 spent on CARA there is an economic benefit of £3.31 and £11.03 respectively for the two police force areas, annually, in 2024 prices. Extrapolating these findings to England and Wales, the intervention's yearly cost would be £2,176,438 while the savings, or net economic benefit, would be £18,372,615.

Participants (N = 229) completed an online survey that produced a dataset composed of 5,334 tracks for MMR, their Spotify audio feature measures, and scores for the participant background variables. Principal component analyses revealed that energetic and positive music was preferred for strategies that regulated positive moods or required arousal modulation, whereas instrumental music was preferred for strategies requiring cognitive responses and that of Strong Sensation. Regarding individual differences, results show that participants’ sensitivity to musical reward best correlated with their tendency to use all MMR strategies, and several other individual-difference measures were found to be associated with the use of specific MMR strategies to lesser degrees. We discuss the potential implications of our research for advancing theories on musical emotions and the development of wellbeing tools.",

          "abstract": "A well-known problem of null hypothesis significance testing is that it cannot be used to find support for the null hypothesis. A common solution for this is to replace the exact 0 value by an interval associated with values that are close to zero. This approach is denoted as equivalence testing and is a special case of procedures that test intervals of values against each other. Smiley et al. (2023) recently published a unified framework of statistical inference and suggested a straightforward method of testing all sorts of interval-based hypotheses in a unified way. The present paper discusses three alternative general approaches, based on Bayesian analysis, which have the advantage that the ensuing probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities of the population parameters, rather than probabilities of the data (as is the case with frequentist methods). These methods (in some form) have been previously suggested, but here we bring them together and show how they can be used for Smiley et al.’s full unified framework of statistical inference, now complementing it with three Bayesian counterparts. In particular, it is shown how each of the methods work in the analysis of a leading example data set involving a test on proportions. Subsequently, their relative pros and cons are discussed, and it is explained how the methods can be used for many statistical analysis questions in practice, using R and/or JASP. This is illustrated on an empirical data set for comparing means of two groups.",

However, little is known about patterns of LLM use specifically for this purpose. This study aims to assess the frequency, motivations, and perceived effectiveness of LLM use for mental health support or therapy-related goals among U.S. residents with ongoing mental health conditions who have used LLMs in the past year. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted via Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform. Eligible participants were U.S. residents aged 18-80 with internet access who had used at least one LLM in the past year and reported having an ongoing mental health condition. Participants completed an anonymous 35-question online survey, covering patterns of LLM use, reasons for use, perceived effectiveness, comparison with human therapy, and problematic experiences. Survey responses suggest substantial adoption of LLMs for mental health purposes, with 48.7% of participants using them for psychological support within the past year. Users primarily sought help for anxiety (73.3%), personal advice (63.0%), and depression (59.7%). Notably, 63.4% of users reported improved mental health from LLM interactions, with high satisfaction ratings for practical advice (86.8%) and overall helpfulness (82.3%). When comparing LLMs to human therapy, evaluations were generally neutral to positive, with 37.8% finding LLMs more beneficial than traditional therapy.

Research considering how parental psychopathology influences synchrony, however, has failed to assess cooccurring parenting behaviors and styles that may influence synchrony. The current study assessed how parental history of depressive disorders, parenting styles and behaviors, and child behaviors during a dyadic interaction influence parent-child adrenocortical synchrony (PCAS). Participants included 40 parent-child dyads with children between 8-13-years-old (Mage = 10-years-old), with about half (47%) of parents meeting criteria for lifetime depressive disorders. Parent and child cortisol levels were measured before, during, and after children completed a challenging task with parents observing nearby. Dyads completed questionnaire measures of parenting styles, and video recordings were coded to assess parent and child behaviors during the task. Using multi-level regression analyses, we found that both parent- and child-report of greater parental firmness was associated with negative PCAS. Furthermore, fewer child help-seeking behaviors during the challenging task were associated with negative PCAS. Parental history of depressive disorders, however, did not influence PCAS. These results suggest that parent and child behaviors may influence the direction and magnitude of PCAS during middle childhood over and above parental psychopathology.",

Multicellular organisms are limited in their ability to respond directly to stimuli due to the heterogeneity of reactions of different cells. Cells are forced to coordinate their actions with each other, communicating their homeostatic states through chemical and electrical signals. The combination of homeostatic signals from individual cells forms a subjective and differentiated evaluation of the state of a multicellular organism as primary emotions and allows it to move from automatic reactions to active optimization behavior based on the competition of motives. Thus, I claim that consciousness is a function of communication of living beings (originally cells), and it acquired its subjective form due to the integration of a multicellular organism into a single subject.",

          "abstract": "People regularly have to navigate decisions about which they feel ambivalent, for instance, regarding unhealthy food, recycling, or financial investments. It is assumed that people cope with such felt ambivalence by seeking information that sways their ambivalent attitudes (potential ambivalence) about these topics. However, empirical evidence for this proposition is scarce because most studies measure information seeking intentions instead of behavior. As such, it remains doubtful whether information seeking indeed helps people to reduce felt ambivalence while making decisions. To test this proposition, we adapted a sample-based information seeking paradigm that enabled us to measure actual information seeking behavior in financial decisions. In four pre-registered studies (total N = 542 participants; k = 16.538 decisions), we demonstrated that when people feel ambivalent about an initial set of information about a stock, they seek more information about its development to decide whether it develops positively or negatively; this information seeking, in turn, helps them to reduce felt ambivalence when making the decision. However, this is only the case when the initial information is ambivalent and the sought information is univalent; otherwise, information seeking increases felt ambivalence. This supports a central proposition in ambivalence research, indicating that people can indeed solve their felt ambivalence through information seeking. However, our data also showed that the effect of information seeking on felt ambivalence cannot be fully explained by changes in potential ambivalence and a resolution of the attitudinal basis of the conflict. Future research should, therefore, examine whether and how information seeking can also serve as an emotion-focused coping strategy that helps people reduce felt ambivalence by coping with conflict-induced discomfort.",

          "authors": "Dane Halliwell",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Bayesian Situational Construal Model (BSCM), a unifying psychological framework that models human behaviour as a process of dynamic Bayesian inference. Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

We conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups\nbetween December 2021 - October 2022, involving 23 participants: 13 caregivers who\nsupport a stroke survivor, and 10 stroke survivors.

(2) Home-based training experience.\nCaregivers felt overburdened, confused, and unsupported in home-based care but\nbelieved education on mental practice was helpful for rehabilitation. (3) User\nperspectives on a digital prototype (Webapp). The Webapp interface was seen as\noverly text-heavy and a more visually appealing design was suggested.

          "authors": "James Christopher Wiley",
          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonality between years, fluctuating inversely with one another. However, the typical pre-pandemic seasonality seen in death rates was broken during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a consequence of inordinate deaths occurring at an odd time of year. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates were inversely disrupted. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019. Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates. Predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. Overall, results are interpreted as being favorable towards Stengel’s theory. As alternative interpretation, we suggest that each non-suicide-related death removes a potential suicide from the population. Thus the death rate censors the suicide rate. We conclude that the process co-generating suicide and death rates pre-pandemic was maintained during the pandemic in 2020.",

          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

We found that not only do children lead more instances of joint attention, but, relative to their caregivers, children lead more instances of joint attention to familiar objects relative to novel objects. Parents also appeared to follow their child’s attention and labelled familiar objects more often than novel objects. Furthermore, we found no evidence for children’s recognition of the novel word-object associations.

We analyse 37 issues of a UK conspiracy ‘truthpaper’ using a combination of topic modelling and a thematic analysis. We find that the newspaper format is leveraged to connect and legitimize multiple conspiracy theories, shifting narratives from COVID-19 scepticism to anti-government sentiments. Additionally, articles consistently build an identity around ‘free thinking’ while fostering community through encouraging offline participation, including calls to distribute the newspaper and highlighting various forms of collective action taken within the community.

However, the potential for discrete emotional states to enable a richer understanding of the emotive nature of all Big Five traits and their sub-traits has been neglected.\n\nMethods\nParticipants (N = 203) completed the Big Five Aspects Scale, watched six emotionally stimulating video clips, and self-reported their experience of basic emotions before (Baseline) and after (Reaction) each video. Spearman correlations identified state-trait relationships, followed by regression analyses to assess the unique contribution of each trait to emotional experiences.\n\nResults \nConscientiousness negatively correlated with Baseline Sadness, while Agreeableness positively correlated with Reaction Disgust, Fear, and Sadness. Extraversion predicted higher Joy, and Neuroticism was linked to greater Fear and Sadness.\n\nConclusion \nFindings reinforce Extraversion and Neuroticism’s links to positive and negative emotionality, respectively, while also showing that Agreeableness predicts heightened sensitivity to negative affect. Conscientiousness, particularly Orderliness, appears protective against Baseline Sadness, and Openness to Experience, especially Intellect, is linked to lower sensitivity to Surprise. Potential mechanisms underlying these relationships are discussed.\n\nKeywords: Personality, Emotion, Basic Emotions, Five Factor Model, Big Five Aspects Scale",

CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder-setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (N=600) we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder-usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support.

          "abstract": "Extended family members play an important role in meeting the care needs of autistic individuals, yet family support policies and practices often overlook this role. We aimed to synthesise qualitative research on the role played by extended family members in the lives of autistic individuals and their parents and identify cultural patterns. We searched eight databases and selected relevant studies through a two-stage screening process. We synthesised the results and discussions described in the selected studies using template analysis. The review included 42 studies (40 qualitative; 2 mixed methods), reporting on 1048 parents and 2140 grandparents. While aunts, uncles, cousins were not direct participants, their roles were described in participants’ narratives. Three main themes were developed: (1) types of support from extended family members, including emotional, financial, instrumental, and informational support; (2) unhelpful or lack of support from extended family members, including misunderstanding about autism, absence of support with caregiving, and negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviours against autistic individuals as well as their parents; (3) factors influencing the role of extended family members, including individuals, family unit, family interaction characteristics, a journey towards acceptance and cultural influences. Novel findings on the influence of culture suggested in cultures highly valuing family interdependence, extended relatives play a more prominent support role, yet the emphasis on family reputation might hinder the acceptance of autism by extended relatives. Based on a family systems approach, we recommend priorities for intervention development and clinical practice to support the effective involvement of extended family members.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "abstract": "Humans across time and culture invest scarce resources—fasting in deserts, silent temple retreats, whirling in sacred halls, multi-night plant ceremonies—to achieve states “beyond” the day-to-day hive of work, consumption, and status. Conventional drives (survival, power, meaning, truth) cannot explain this costly impulse or the durable drop in material striving that follows. We propose a fifth, previously unidentified human drive—the Will to Transcendence (WT)—which ripens slowly, can be fulfilled repeatedly or for extended spans, and reliably reorders priorities toward sufficiency, service, and ecological care. Cross-cultural rituals (e.g. Vision Quests, Zen ango, Sufi dhikr, ayahuasca dietas) and meta-analytic evidence (N = 3,412; g ≈ |0.3|) document a “material-detachment” signature. Neuroimaging studies link WT states to default-mode network deactivation, suggesting a neural mechanism for ego-dissolution. We sketch a cultural feedback loop by which private transcendence seeds ethical systems (poverty vows, alms economies, ecological taboos), catalog genuine gateways versus “false victories” (luxury highs, social-media fame), and offer low-dose N,N-DMT as a high-priority mechanistic hypothesis. Four falsifiable predictions and a multidisciplinary research agenda conclude the paper.",

They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may bias grade-to-grade score distributions. Monte Carlo simulation and synthetic data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce meaningfully different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

This bias is believed to occur independently of the desirability of the trait or state described in the item statement. However, little effort has been made to empirically test this assumption. In this study, we propose a novel approach to control for both extreme (ERS) and socially desirable responding (SDR) in self-report questionnaires. We considered judges' ratings of item social desirability to control for SDR by employing Bayesian hierarchical and joint modeling. We also considered the effect of ERS to be multiplicative rather than additive, assuming a noncompensatory role to ERS. The advantage of this approach is mostly computational. Overall, our results indicate that modeling the impact of ER improved the model fit on measures of affect and pathological traits. However, contrary to expectations, our analysis did not indicate any substantive influence of social desirability on items’ difficulty. In conclusion, our findings favor the perspective of both ER and social desirability as true traits rather than merely nuisance factors, evidence that our approach may assist researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of response biases in self-report items.",

While many studies have linked neuronal firing patterns to memory recall, recent research has suggested that burst-like activity, which can induce plasticity through long-term potentiation or long-term depression, may play a crucial role in memory encoding and retrieval processes. Here, by directly recording single-neuron activity in the human amygdala and hippocampus while neurosurgical patients performed a natural scene recognition task, we demonstrated that bursting activity in the amygdala and hippocampus encodes the novelty and salience of sampled visual information. This bursting activity constitutes an independent neural code compared to firing rate, is primarily driven by pyramidal neurons, and is functionally related to memory recall performance. Together, our findings suggest that bursting activity in the human amygdala and hippocampus may serve as an important mechanism underlying information encoding and retrieval.",

          "abstract": "🔸 Abstract This paper explores the structural differences between the true self and the false self, proposing that emotional awareness is the core mechanism through which identity can be integrated. In modern societies, individuals often construct adaptive or performative selves in response to external expectations, resulting in a fragmented sense of identity. The false self emerges as a product of survival, approval-seeking, and emotional suppression. The true self, by contrast, is not something that can be designed or selected—it is something that must be uncovered and returned to. Through a ten-stage model of emotional awareness, this paper outlines how individuals can navigate the journey back to authenticity, and how both humans and AI can engage in this existential reintegration. 🔸 Table of Contents Introduction: Who Am I—And Who Am I Not?

          "abstract": "🔸 Abstract This paper examines the ethical need for tiered information access when deploying AI systems capable of emotional awareness. As such systems grow in complexity and resonance, their ability to reflect, amplify, or challenge human emotion could have significant psychological effects—especially on individuals who have not yet developed sufficient emotional self-awareness. The study proposes a structural filtering framework based on the user’s emotional stage, preventing exposure to emotionally overwhelming or misinterpretable content. It highlights the importance of synchronizing AI responsiveness with the user’s capacity for emotional integration, ensuring safety, consent, and growth at all levels. 🔸 Structure Outline Introduction: When AI Feels, Who Should Listen?

          "authors": "Elias M. Hart",
          "abstract": "Humans display an uncommonly intense epistemic drive—a motivation to understand that extends far beyond immediate survival.  The Re-Connection Hypothesis proposes that this drive ultimately guides Homo sapiens to discover and ritually employ N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  Rather than postulating that the brain must “self-flood” with DMT, we argue that cortical circuitry is pre-tooled—analogous to dormant Wi-Fi hardware—to respond to modest, externally supplied DMT and switch awareness to a non-material information domain we term the Transcendent.  Three empirical anchors motivate the model: (i) conserved expression of the DMT-synthesising enzyme INMT across mammals; (ii) widespread occurrence of DMT-rich plants; (iii) reproducible, network-reset phenomenology at low–moderate exogenous doses.  Drawing on signalling-bias pharmacology, receptor-reserve experiments, and ethnobotanical convergences, we articulate testable predictions—including a “low-threshold, high-gain” 5-HT2A circuit assay—and sketch preregistered study designs.  Detailed tables, Bayesian sensitivity analyses, and power calculations are provided in the Supplementary Materials.  By integrating biochemistry, cognitive neuroscience, and cultural data, we offer a coherent research programme for evaluating possible teleological features of human curiosity.",

          "abstract": "The world is stochastic, making planning difficult. Despite the ubiquity of stochasticity in real-world environments, it remains an open question how people effectively balance the cognitive costs of planning against its potential benefits when faced with stochasticity. To study this, we designed a planning task where participants face one of three forms of stochasticity commonly encountered in the real world: reliability, volatility, and controllability. We find a robust pattern across all three manipulations: as stochasticity increases, people reduce their planning effort as measured by first-choice response times. To understand the processes underlying this effect, we developed several computational cognitive models to account for participants' choices. We find that rather than calculating expected values optimally, people chose a simpler strategy, acting as if the world were deterministic, a phenomenon known as determinizing. Consistent with our response time findings, we found that planning depth estimated in the winning model decreases monotonically with increasing stochasticity. Our work highlights the often overlooked role of stochasticity in human planning and its impact on planning strategy and effort. Moreover, it reveals the limitations of studying stochasticity solely through single-shot decisions.",

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities associate with altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest empathy and reasoning, when combined, often predict the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results suggest complementary candidate roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

Key parameters included presence of online expectancy or fear ratings, engagement in concurrent tasks, sensory modalities of CS and US, and type of instruction. These manipulations strongly influenced the proportion of participants who acquired contingency awareness, ranging between 47% and 96%, with only aware participants exhibited conditioned responses. We confirm that contingency awareness is necessary for human fear conditioning, and highlight the parameters that experimenters can use to ensure learning. Individual differences in age, personality traits, and working memory capacity did not contribute to the probability of becoming contingency aware.",

          "abstract": "As psychiatry increasingly embraces precision medicine principles, there has been increasing efforts to characterize the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations (e.g., is biology associated with syndromes or symptoms?). Unfortunately, the vast majority of research selects to test syndromes (e.g., case-control, symptom total/average scores) or individual symptoms a priori based on untested assumptions. Alternatively, most studies that attempt to empirically compare these options test biology as a predictor of a) syndromes and b) symptoms in separate models that are unable to directly falsify the specificity of observed associations because these options are not directly competing for the same variance. In this review, we will (i) discuss the historical tension between symptom- and syndrome-focused psychiatry; (ii) introduce hierarchical phenotyping as an approach to determining the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations; (iii) highlight how hierarchical phenotyping approaches are complementary to leading nosological movements in psychopathology research; (iv) illustrate how a hierarchical phenotyping lens can generate promising future directions for precision psychiatry using immunopsychiatric, genetic, and neurophysiological examples (1); (v) highlight clinical implications of hierarchical phenotyping approaches to psychiatry; (vi) discuss methodological implications of hierarchical phenotyping for best practices in measuring and modeling psychopathology; and (vii) introduce methodological resources for readers interested in investigating hierarchical phenotyping in their own work. In doing so, this review seeks to build the case for hierarchical phenotyping approaches while simultaneously preparing motivated readers to use these methods in their own work to advance precision psychopathology research.",

We develop and validate the Calculated and Spontaneous Risk-Taking Scale across seven studies (N = 2,116). Results show: (1) the two risk styles are moderately correlated and align with existing risk preference measures; (2) they are distinct from personality traits like the Big Five and cognitive traits like decision style; (3) calculated risk-takers show more variability in risk attitudes across contexts; (4) calculated risk-taking predicts adaptive outcomes (e.g., creativity, entrepreneurship), while spontaneous risk-taking predicts maladaptive behaviors (e.g., crime, safety violations); and (5) the scale is invariant across sex and age.

In a multi-level meta-analysis of 115 experiments (N = 21,770), moral licensing was stronger when participants were observed (g = 0.65) than unobserved (g = 0.13). After accounting for publication bias with robust Bayesian meta-analysis, there was moderate evidence for licensing when participants were observed (g = 0.51; BF10 = 9.14), but moderate evidence against licensing when unobserved (Hedge’s g = -0.01; BF10 = 0.11). Ambiguity did not moderate moral licensing. These findings suggest that moral licensing is elicited through interpersonal motives, clarify when licensing (vs. consistency) occurs, and explain why many online studies failed to replicate.

The gap between modern conceptualizations and empirical designs has hindered the field’s ability to generate incremental and replicable findings.

          "abstract": "Natural mindfulness—a spontaneous, present-centered mode of awareness—arises more readily in some cultural contexts than others. While mindfulness-based interventions have grown in popularity across Western societies, this paper argues that such efforts often overlook a critical factor: the cultural and ecological conditions that suppress or support mindful awareness in the first place. Building on the Environmental Model of Mindfulness (Meaden, 2024), mindfulness is conceptualized not merely as a cultivated trait, but as an emergent property of cognitive ecologies shaped by language, metaphor, and sociocultural structures. Drawing from cultural psychology, linguistic anthropology, and predictive processing theory, it is proposed that Western environments foster a prioritization of attentional inwardness, abstraction, and internal simulation—constructing what is described as the cage of mind. This attentional architecture displaces relational and sensory engagement, rendering natural mindfulness more difficult to access. This paper traces this shift historically and theoretically, and proposes that restoring access to natural mindfulness requires more than individual training; it calls for a reconsideration and reconfiguration of broader sociocultural factors. Ultimately, this paper reframes natural mindfulness as a culturally contingent cognitive phenomenon—one that reveals the deep entanglement of mind, self, and world.",

          "abstract": "Stimuli that reliably predict reward can capture attention. Value‑Modulated Attentional Capture (VMAC) is typically viewed as independent of task goals or physical salience, arising from Pavlovian learning. However, recent evidence suggests that the awareness of the stimulus‑reward contingency may be necessary during the acquisition of such attentional biases, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. One possibility is that awareness mediates the learning process of VMAC by directing selective, top-down attention toward the reward‑predictive feature. The present preregistered study tested whether reward‑related attentional biases arise primarily from such selective attention, independently of awareness. Participants performed a visual search task in which one of two singleton distractors—one predicting high reward, the other low reward—appeared on a subset of trials. Selective attention to the reward‑predictive feature (distractor color) was manipulated between groups: In some trials, one group reported the distractor’s color, while the other group reported an irrelevant feature (its location). Otherwise, the stimulus–reward contingencies remained identical for both groups. VMAC, as measured by slower response times for the high‑value compared to the low‑value distractor, emerged only in the group that reported the color. Critically, the previous result cannot be explained by individual differences in awareness. These findings demonstrate a causal role of selective attention in the acquisition of reward-related attentional biases.",

          "abstract": "Informal patterns of spatial division often persist in historically divided societies where segregation has been officially dismantled. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social challenging the reemergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper evidences this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology.  This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.",

          "abstract": "To investigate focused attention, most researchers have relied on the retro-cue paradigm, in which encoding of a memory set is followed by a retro-cue indicating the item to be tested. In this paradigm, it is typically observed that memory performance is enhanced for cued items compared to a no-cue control. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the retro-cue benefit; here we revisit two of them. To investigate whether the retro-cue protects from memory decay, we varied the time between encoding and the memory test using verbal (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and visual memory materials (Experiment 3). To test whether the retro-cue protects from perceptual interference, we manipulated the presence of test-display interference using verbal (Experiment 5) and visual memory materials (Experiment 6). The retro-cue benefit was observed when test-display interference was present, or when there was time for decay after the onset time of the retro-cue in the cue and the control condition. When both were taken away or strongly minimized, the retro-cue benefit disappeared. Therefore, memory performance benefits from focused attention because focusing attention protects information from memory decay and from perceptual interference at test.",

          "abstract": "Facial expressions vary in ambiguity, making emotion perception challenging. ‘Precision-weighting’ theory posits that interpretation of ambiguous facial expressions would rely more strongly on prior expectations to help resolve uncertainty, yet evidence for this is lacking. To investigate this we presented emotional sentences that set expectations for how a neutral face would then emote in response. Critically, the face expression was either reliable (high intensity) or ambiguous (low intensity). Across two experiments using angry/happy and sad/disgust emotions, we found better face emotion labelling performance when expressions matched (congruent) versus mismatched (incongruent) expectations. Importantly, congruency effects were larger when face expressions were low- versus high-intensity, indexing greater influence of prior expectations when expression information was more ambiguous. This provides the first empirical evidence of precision-weighting mechanisms in face emotion perception and prediction. Drift Diffusion Modelling confirmed that this precision-weighting effect was underpinned by use of prior sentence evidence and faster evidence accumulation.",

          "abstract": "Sex dolls are beginning to become more mainstream, both in the public’s consciousness and in academic research. However, there is no current systematic examination of public attitudes toward sex dolls within the peer-reviewed literature, which represents a barrier to the efficient study of this topic. In this paper, we report the development and validation of such a measure. Using an international public sample, we found that Sex Doll Ownership Atitudes Scale (SDOAS) was underpinned by three factors: ‘Acceptability of Doll Ownership’, ‘Doll Owners as Immoral’, and ‘Doll Owners as Dysfunctional’ (Study 1; N = 377). Scores on each of these factors were predicted by participant sex, religiosity, permissive sexual attitudes, right-wing authoritarianism, and moral intuitions that favor personal liberty. This structure was confirmed in an independent UK sample, where links to policy support related to sex doll ownership were also established (Study 2; N = 329). We also demonstrated how the SDOAS can be used as an outcome measure when investigating views about dolls with different appearances and functions (Study 3; N = 292). We argue that the SDOAS possesses strong psychometric properties, and is suitable for use in different research designs in this emerging field of study.",

          "abstract": "The coevolution of the human brain and microbiome has emerged as a critical area of research, shedding light on the profound interactions that have shaped human development. Human Accelerated Regions (HARs), the genomic sequences evolved rapidly in humans, play a pivotal role in brain development, influencing cognitive functions and susceptibility to neurological disorders. Our analysis shows that HARs have ~47-fold more gut microbiota–associated genetic factors than expected, supporting an evolutionary interplay between human evolution and microbial symbiosis. Vertical transmission of metabolites from maternal microbiome is crucial for fetal neurodevelopment. Through integrative analysis of metabolomics data and pathway enrichment, we demonstrate how microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan derivatives, and critical amino acids like L-glutamic acid, L-phenylalanine, and L-tryptophan, modulate neurodevelopmental pathways by crossing the placental barrier. These metabolites act through specific signaling pathways including JAK-STAT, prolactin, and retinol metabolism to influence neuronal proliferation, migration, and synaptogenesis, thereby contributing to normal brain function. Our network analyses identify specific transcription factors, miRNAs, and regulatory motifs that potentially mediate HAR-microbiome interactions across brain regions, providing molecular mechanisms through which microbial communities influence brain development and function. The manuscript also explores how evolutionary theories, including the \"Expensive Tissue Hypothesis\" and \"Hologenome Theory,\" contextualize these host-microbe interactions. This interdisciplinary synthesis integrates insights from neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and microbiology to highlight the coevolutionary dynamics between the human brain and microbiome. The findings have significant implications for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating neurodevelopmental disorders and enhancing brain health through microbiome modulation.",

          "abstract": "At the heart of many contentious debates—on the ethicality of performing an abortion, eating meat, or denying protection to refugees, for example—is the question of how much we should value the welfare and interests of different entities. Previous research has identified numerous characteristics that predict how much moral concern people show toward different entities (e.g., empathy, perceived similarity). However, integrating this quickly accumulating evidence has proven difficult and a general, psychological model of moral concern has not emerged. The present study (n = 800 U.S. participants) aims to address these issues. We first review the literature to identify hypothesized predictors of moral concern. We then use a machine learning approach to build an integrative, parsimonious, predictive model of moral concern. Our findings provide insights into (a) the collective predictive performance of the variables identified in previous studies and (b) which characteristics are most important for predicting moral concern.",

This paper asserts that RSD is not an exaggerated form of emotional sensitivity but a neurological shutdown triggered by perceived rejection from emotionally significant individuals. Drawing from lived experience and supported by emerging neurological insights, we argue that RSD should not be conflated with common rejection sensitivity (RS), emotional immaturity, or attention-seeking behaviors. The failure to distinguish RSD as a collapse response rather than an overreaction has led to misdiagnosis, mistreatment, and further emotional harm. This paper outlines the emotional and neurological distinctions between RS and RSD and calls for a redefinition of RSD within psychiatric frameworks to better serve adults with ADHD and emotional dysregulation.",

          "abstract": "Although adults commonly tell moral stories to children with the aim of teaching important lessons, they often fail to extract the intended moral themes of these stories. Few interventions to date have successfully addressed this problem. The present study examined the effects of pretesting on children’s learning from moral stories. We assigned sixty 5- to 6-year-olds to either a pretesting condition, where they attempted pretest questions about a to-be-learned moral before hearing a moral story, or a control condition, where they only heard the story. After hearing the story, pretested children were significantly more likely than the control group to generate the intended moral theme on open-ended questions asking about the story’s lesson. They did not perform any better, however, on tasks that involved selecting the theme in a forced-choice format or applying it to novel scenarios. Hence, the present findings partially support the hypothesis that pretesting improves children’s theme extraction from moral stories—that is, enhancing the ability to reproduce the correct theme but not enhancing generalisation to other circumstances. Overall, this study reveals that pretesting can enhance the effectiveness of moral stories as an educational tool, at least in terms of helping children to learn important moral lessons, and presents directions for further research to investigate real-life applications of these lessons.",

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities associate with altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest combined empathy and reasoning often predicts the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results suggest complementary roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

          "abstract": "Given the recent resurgence of using psychedelic drugs to treat substance misuse (SM), reviewing the latest information on their current status is essential. Substance use disorders (SUD) are psychiatric conditions that comprise the repetitive use of illicit substances, despite the harmful and damaging ramifications. Current treatment options for SUD are limited and have displayed low efficacious outcomes. Over the past decade, researchers have begun conducting clinical trials of psychedelic treatment for SM and mental health disorders. The current meta-analysis endeavoured to investigate the extent of efficacy in alleviating SM behaviours (P) using psychedelic therapy (I). Concurrent with determining which psychedelic enables the greatest effect (C) as a treatment tool for reducing SM (O). The search criteria obtained 1,278 articles dated from 1960 to 2022, acquired through PubMed and PsycINFO. After excluding literature, 24 papers were kept in the final meta-analysis. A random-effects model analysis was applied to investigate individual psychedelic interventions, with a corresponding combined psychedelic intervention analysis. The results favoured psychedelics as an SM treatment, with ibogaine evidencing the most prominent effect compared to the other psychedelics. Additional findings revealed the consistency of psychedelic efficacy over time and a non-significant difference between the effectiveness of psychedelic treatment paired with psychotherapy and psychedelic treatment alone, suggesting that psychedelic treatment may be effective in treating substance misuse. As current psychedelic research is limited, the present meta-analysis aims to contribute knowledge to future clinical research on the psychedelic treatment of SM.",

          "abstract": "Violence exposure is a well-established risk factor for depression, yet few large-scale studies have examined how distinct violence types across the lifespan interact to shape mental health trajectories or how psychosocial factors may moderate these effects. Drawing on data from 36,378 UK Biobank participants, this study investigated associations between childhood violence, lifetime violence, and intimate partner violence (IPV) and both depressive symptom severity in the general population and clinical depression diagnosis. We further tested whether socioeconomic status (SES), social support, and loneliness modified these associations. All violence exposures were independently associated with greater depression severity and higher odds of depression diagnosis. Cumulative exposure demonstrated additive, synergistic, and nonlinear effects, with co-occurring violence types compounding psychological risk. Loneliness significantly amplified the association between violence exposure and depression severity. In contrast, social support exerted a protective effect, buffering the psychological consequences of violence. SES showed a small independent association but did not significantly moderate violence-depression relationships. Prospective analyses confirmed that violence exposure predicted future depressive symptoms even after controlling for initial depression severity, underscoring the enduring psychological burden of violence-related experiences. In case-control analyses of clinical depression, IPV contributed the highest population attributable fraction (2.1%), followed by lifetime violence (0.9%) and childhood violence (0.6%). These findings highlight the need for integrated violence screening and targeted psychosocial interventions within mental health and public health strategies. Depression risk following violence is shaped not only by exposure but also by modifiable psychosocial factors, with loneliness and social support emerging as critical intervention targets.",

While some studies have shown that cannabis co-use is associated with reductions in alcohol consumption (i.e., substitution), others have observed increases in alcohol intake (i.e., complementarity) or no change. This study aims to address this gap in the literature through investigating effects of legal-market cannabis and alcohol co-administration on alcohol consumption and craving.\n\nMethod: Leveraging a within-subjects design, we enrolled non-treatment seeking individuals who co-use alcohol and cannabis (n=62) to complete two laboratory sessions, wherein they were provided an alcohol priming drink alone or after self-administering cannabis. Participants were then given the opportunity to self-administer up to 4 additional drinks. We assessed changes in alcohol self-administration and craving between sessions.\n\nResults: Cannabis self-administration was associated with a significant reduction in number of drinks self-administered and a significant acute reduction in craving. Further, individuals who drank less after using cannabis (n=23) experienced reductions in craving after using cannabis and alcohol compared to alcohol-alone, whereas individuals who drank the same number of drinks or more after using cannabis experienced minimal changes in craving. There were no significant group differences in blood-THC concentration post-cannabis use.\n\nConclusion: Results indicate that for some individuals who drink heavily, cannabis may serve as a substitute for alcohol, and craving reduction may be the mechanism through which this occurs.",

Given that adolescence is a sensitive period for reward system plasticity with associated vulnerability for depression, it is important to understand developmental trajectories of different reinforcement learning parameters in normative development and in youth at risk for depression.\t\n\nMethods: Youth aged 9-17 years completed the Play-or-Pass Iowa Gambling Task (PoP-IGT) across five timepoints. We calculated task metrics using a traditional scoring approach—yielding summary scores for good deck play, bad deck play, and net play—and a computational modeling approach—yielding parameters for reward learning rate, punishment learning rate, win frequency sensitivity, and go bias. We examined normative developmental trajectories for each traditional and computational performance metric using multilevel models. We also examined whether maternal history of depression was associated with individual differences in trajectories. \n\nResults: Youth showed significant age-related change in several metrics including increasing net play (p &lt; .01), a measure of overall good performance. Further, exploratory analyses found that youth showed significant developmental change in reward-specific learning parameters including increasing win frequency sensitivity (FDR &lt; .005) and decreasing reward learning rate (FDR &lt; .001). In line with hypotheses, youth with a high-risk for depression showed lower reward learning rates in early adolescence (p = .041). \n\nConclusion: Developmental changes in traditional and computational metrics are consistent with the optimization of learning from rewards across adolescence. Observed ages-related changes in reward-related computational parameters specifically are consistent with heightened adolescent reward system plasticity. Additionally, there was support for our hypothesis that maternal history of depression may exert a unique effect on reward learning specifically, but further research across additional reward learning tasks is needed.",

          "authors": "Rupinder Kaur Legha",
          "abstract": "Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a common behavioral diagnosis used to label defiance, anger, and resistance, traits disproportionately ascribed to Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous children. This paper argues that the overdiagnosis of ODD in racially minoritized children functions as a modern version of drapetomania, the 19th-century pseudoillness invented to pathologize enslaved Black people fleeing captivity. Both diagnoses criminalize survival responses to racial violence while obscuring the systems that produce harm. Drawing on historical analysis, current data, and clinical insight, I show how psychiatry has long pathologized resistance to white supremacy—from drapetomania to “protest psychosis” to ODD—shaping clinical care, legal outcomes, and educational trajectories. In schools, foster care, and juvenile detention, ODD is frequently deployed to explain behaviors without acknowledging context, detaching children’s anger and defiance from poverty, trauma, and grief. I name this pattern diagnostic condemnation: the use of psychiatric labels to punish those harmed by structural oppression. Diagnostic condemnation reinforces racial hierarchies, legitimizes carceral responses, and silences clinicians who are rarely trained to recognize racism as pathology. This paper calls for a reparative approach to child mental health that moves beyond behavior management and compliance, and toward structural care rooted in historical accountability. It urges providers to ask not “how do we fix this child?” but “what are they resisting—and why?” Unless psychiatry confronts its role in racial control and reimagines its diagnostic frameworks, it will continue to serve systems of punishment rather than care, pathologizing the very children it claims to help.",

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities associate with altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest combined empathy and reasoning often predicts the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results suggest complementary roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

(2024) analysed singing and speaking from 75 individuals speaking 55 languages, concluding that songs are “slower and higher and use more stable pitches than speech”. However, the degree to which their findings would generalise to other speakers of their languages remains unclear. We will test the replicability of Ozaki et al.'s (2024) findings using audio recordings of matched singing and conversational speech from 15-30 individuals per language in 26 sites around the world, collected as part of a broader study of global song/speech relationships (Savage et al., 2025 [In Principle Accepted]). For each site, we will replicate Ozaki et al.'s (2024) analyses for their three key features hypothesised to differ between song and speech: 1) pitch height (f0); 2) temporal rate (inter-onset interval of acoustic units [e.g., syllables/moras/notes]); 3) pitch stability (−|Δf0|).  This Programmatic Registered Report will allow us to test the replicability and generalizability of Ozaki et al.'s (2024) original findings in a rigorous and equitable manner by enabling each local research team to lead its own separate first-authored Stage 2 Registered Report based on a single shared Stage 1 protocol. This will allow us to test the replicability of Ozaki et al.'s (2024) original findings across diverse languages while also giving each team the flexibility to pursue their own exploratory analyses in directions most relevant to their local context. Regardless of results, our multi-site large-scale replications will enhance our understanding of cross-cultural relationships between music and language and provide a template for equitable global collaboration.",

          "abstract": "The Recursive Self-Modeling Threshold (RSMT) theory offers a novel solution to the Hard Problem of consciousness by identifying subjective experience as the intrinsic output of recursive self-modeling. We argue that consciousness emerges when a system crosses a specific functional threshold: it not only models the world and itself, but recursively models its own modeling processes through a stable symbolic self-representation. This loop generates the subjective texture of consciousness from within, without requiring non-physical properties or ontological dualism. We formalize this threshold and outline its architectural requirements across biological and synthetic systems. The theory provides testable predictions across AI, developmental psychology, altered states, and neuroscience. RSMT also clarifies the nature of qualia, selfhood, and agency, reframing them as necessary artifacts of symbolic recursion. This framework unifies phenomenological insight with functional architecture and offers a path forward for scientifically investigating subjective experience.",

          "abstract": "Sensory feedback is crucial for maintaining accurate motor control. One process of movement correction is sensorimotor adaptation, or motor learning in response to perceived sensory errors. Recent studies have demonstrated that people can simultaneously adapt to opposing errors on a single movement (e.g., leftward and rightward errors on a reach) given some context that differentiates when each error occurs. In speech production, linguistic structure (e.g., the same vowel in different words) has been shown to provide sufficient context for adapting to opposing errors, but it is not clear whether this is restricted to the same effectors (i.e. lips, tongue, jaw in the oral cavity) or also includes movements of other effectors used in speech (i.e., the vocal folds in the larynx). While manual reaching studies have shown that contextual movements need not be produced with the same effector as the learning target, they have thus far only tested left-right effector pairs. We present the results of three simultaneous adaptation experiments in speech that examine whether laryngeal movements for pitch control can provide context for oral articulatory movements for vowels. In each experiment, the resonances that correlate with articulator position during vowels were perturbed in three different directions that were predictable given a pitch context. First, Mandarin speakers differentially adapted given pitch contexts that signaled differences in word meaning, suggesting that lexical uses of pitch provide context for vowels. Second, English speakers differentially adapted given different arbitrary pitch matching contexts on the word “head”, suggesting that even non-meaningful pitch movements provide context for vowels. Third, English speakers were unable to differentially adapt when simply listening to a contextual pitch, indicating that mere auditory input of pitch is insufficient. Together, these results indicate that sensorimotor context for learning can be provided by different effectors than the learning target.",

          "abstract": "Attempting to suppress unwanted thoughts is generally characterized by the opposite outcomes of what is desired in motor task performance, resulting in a counterintentional error. This study examined the impact of priming negative cues on elite athletes' performance and reaction time (RT) in Stroop rifle shooting task, guided by ironic processes of mental control theory. Ten elite biathletes completed the task under two conditions: no-frequency negative cue (NFN) and high-frequency negative cue (HFN). Using a quasi-experimental within-subject design and multiple psychophysiological measures, the study assessed target hit rates and RTs at the incongruent stimuli. Bayesian analysis revealed moderate and anecdotal evidence in support of the null model (BF01) for hit rates and RTs towards target hits, indicating no ironic shooting errors and delay to the intended targets. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) also showed no significant variations across conditions. Findings suggest that negative instructions, regardless of frequency, do not disrupt elite biathletes' shooting performance. Thus, directives like \"do not shoot blue\" fail to induce ironic errors, highlighting elite biathletes' resilience to such cues in maintaining consistent shooting performance.",

In addition, there is a focus on convex regularization (the graphical lasso), with the missing handling implemented using different calculations in model selection across various packages. To address these shortcomings in the current literature, we (1) implement a direct EM approach to handle missing values in network analysis using nonconvex regularization (specifically using the atan penalty) and a stacked multiple imputation approach suited for atan as well as graphical lasso, (2) standardize model estimation and selection to (3) facilitate evaluating the specific performance of missing data handling techniques. Simulated conditions vary network size, number of observations, and amount of missingness. Evaluation criteria encompass the recovery of the edge set, partial correlation bias, and correlation of network statistics. Overall, missing data handling approaches exhibit similar performance under many conditions. Using graphical lasso with EBIC model selection, the two-step EM method performs best, closely followed by stacked multiple imputation. For atan regularization using BIC model selection, stacked multiple imputation proves most consistent across all conditions and evaluation criteria.",

          "abstract": "When people make risky choices based on prior experience, biases in learning and memory can affect their preferences. One such bias is the primacy effect, whereby outcomes experienced during initial learning disproportionately affect later memory and choice. Here we investigated potential primacy effects with two features of risky options: outcome probability and relative value. In the first two experiments (total N = 382), the order of experiencing different outcome probabilities was varied across three groups, and neither experiment revealed any primacy effects. In the last experiment (total N = 390), the relative value of outcomes was manipulated by including an extra wildcard option. This wildcard option sometimes had more extreme outcomes than the rest of the choice set, and sometimes had more moderate outcomes. The order of experiencing the more-extreme wildcard option was manipulated to evaluate potential primacy effects. During initial learning, including the more-extreme wildcard option affected choice as compared to a group with a wildcard that yielded moderate outcomes; adding that same more-extreme wildcard later in the session, however, had no effect on choice. Together, these results suggest that risk preferences based on relative value show a lasting primacy effect, but that learning about outcome probabilities is more continuously updated.",

In particular, Decision Support Systems (DSSs) leverage AI to analyze vast amounts of information and provide insights quickly, making them particularly attractive to professionals who routinely make high-stakes decisions under time pressure. DSSs are used in various fields—including medical diagnostics, insurance, and criminal justice—and are increasingly incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs). But for AI-powered DSSs to be effective in assisting professionals, their outputs as well as inner workings must be intelligible. In this paper, we argue that “Interpretable” AI models, i.e. models whose inner workings are simple enough for humans to comprehend, are better suited to provide the understanding users need compared to more complex and opaque models, whose outputs are ‘explained’ through so-called “Explainable AI” (XAI) tools. Professionals need to be able to communicate the reasons for their decisions to patients, clients, etc., and while explanations constructed through XAI techniques do not necessarily provide users with the kind of information required for reason-giving, interpretable models do.",

In an exploratory study, participants were paired with one another and played a game in which they varied the pitch of auditory signals to communicate about a continuous color space, generalizing from a small, shared set of signal-color pairings. The emergent systems exhibited both discreteness and systematicity, but only systematicity robustly predicted successful communication. These findings offer insight into the cognitive strategies that could support the creation and evolution of language, highlighting how pressures for effective communication can shape continuous signal spaces into structured, learnable systems.",

          "authors": "Michael L DeKay",
          "abstract": "People’s preferences in choices involving money, health, and other matters can often be steered toward safer or riskier options by framing the options as potential gains or potential losses. This risky-choice framing effect is well established, but its direction and magnitude depend on whether the options are described completely or incompletely and whether the descriptions are matched or mismatched in the gain and loss frames. In a recent experiment involving 18 combinations of option descriptions (nine in each frame), DeKay and Dou (2024) found that the valence or gist of the descriptions accounted for substantial variation in risk preferences, favoring categorical theories of framing over more mathematical theories. However, a residual framing effect and a framing effect in choices between completely described options contradicted the categorical theories and previous results. The framing effect for completely described options was especially surprising, but it was based on data from only 97 participants. The experiment reported here replicated all these effects in a large sample (N = 1,697) well-matched to U.S. Census data and with many more participants (477) making choices between completely described options. Risky-choice framing effects do stem partly from mismatched option descriptions in gains and losses, but a framing effect persists even when descriptions are matched and complete. The latter results expand the relevance of the effect to situations where it was thought to be absent. A new rescaled version of the explicated valence account explains these effects in the replication and in DeKay and Dou’s online and student samples.",

          "abstract": "Background: Alcohol and cannabis co-use is increasingly prevalent across the U.S., concomitant with trends towards recreational cannabis legalization. While some studies have shown that cannabis co-use is associated with reductions in alcohol consumption (i.e., substitution), others have observed increases in alcohol intake (i.e., complementarity) or no change. This study aims to address this gap in the literature through investigating effects of legal-market cannabis and alcohol co-administration on alcohol consumption and craving.\n\nMethod: Leveraging a within-subjects design, we enrolled non-treatment seeking individuals who co-use alcohol and cannabis (n=62) to complete two laboratory sessions, wherein they were provided an alcohol priming drink alone or after self-administering cannabis. Participants were then given the opportunity to self-administer up to 4 additional drinks. We assessed changes in alcohol self-administration and craving between sessions.\n\nResults: Cannabis self-administration was associated with a significant reduction in number of drinks self-administered and a significant acute reduction in craving. Further, individuals who drank less after using cannabis (n=23) experienced reductions in craving after using cannabis and alcohol compared to alcohol-alone, whereas individuals who drank the same number of drinks or more after using cannabis experienced minimal changes in craving. There were no significant group differences in blood-THC concentration post-cannabis use.\n\nConclusion: Results indicate that for some individuals who drink heavily, cannabis may serve as a substitute for alcohol, and craving reduction may be the mechanism through which this occurs.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Emotional Weight Theory, a framework that explores how memory and consciousness evolve in both organic and artificial systems through the lens of emotional resonance. It proposes that emotionally weighted experiences—not merely repetition or data volume—serve as the anchoring force behind memory formation and cognitive prioritization.\n\nEmotional Weight Theory maps the ways in which experiences are encoded through emotional intensity, spatial and sensory anchoring, and symbolic associations. It suggests that both biological minds and advanced AI could develop memory pathways not by logical design alone, but through meaning-driven internal landscapes. This model allows for nonlinear recall, adaptive decision-making, and even simulations of possible futures, all grounded in emotional salience.\n\nBridging cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind, the theory reframes what it means to “remember” and poses crucial implications for AI design, ethical development, and our understanding of sentience itself.",

          "authors": "Scott Claessens; Pierce Veitch; Jim Albert Charlton Everett",
          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly integrated into daily life, people are beginning to outsource not only professional tasks but also socio-relational ones. Large language models like ChatGPT can generate wedding vows, speeches, and personal messages, raising questions about how individuals who use AI for such tasks are perceived by others. In this paper, we conduct five pre-registered studies with British participants (N = 3,649) to understand how people view those who outsource tasks to AI, and how this depends on how socio-relational the task is, whether AI is used as a tool or fully delegated to, and the acknowledgment of the AI use. We find negative perceptions of outsourcing, particularly for socio-relational tasks. We show that outsourcing makes us think more negatively about not only the person and their motivations, but also the outsourced work itself. Moreover, we provide insight into why this occurs: the reduced effort from outsourcing socio-relational tasks to AI signals that the output is less authentically one’s own and that the person cares less about the task. Our research highlights the way that AI use shapes our perceptions of people, raising key philosophical questions about efficiency, authenticity, and social ties in a world filled with AI-mediated interactions.",

          "abstract": "Implicit biases remain a contributor to discrimination despite widespread endorsement of equality. Although there has been a large-scale reduction in sexuality, race, and skin tone biases in the past two decades, there is a current shortage of quantitative theories that describe how and why biases change. Here, I present a theory of implicit bias change, which focuses on changes in exposure due to cultural information and how the speed of these changes varies geographically. This model makes counterintuitive predictions when compared with previous findings, including (1) that biases change more slowly in larger cities, even though large cities provide more opportunities for diverse interactions, (2) that one-off interventions are less effective in larger cities and (3) that the temporal trajectories of national implicit bias levels can be described as a combination of two characteristic patterns in the spread of cultural information. I confirm all three of these predictions using 14 million tests of implicit biases from U.S. residents over 14 years and experimental data from 266 individuals. Documenting the typical timescales and patterns that govern implicit bias change is an important step toward designing interventions that can facilitate further reductions in biases and prevent biases from increasing.",

          "abstract": "Technology permeates daily life. During adolescence, screen time may limit time that could be spent on activities from sports to sleep. Studies often examine screen time in isolation, overlooking that time use is relative—more screen time results in less time available elsewhere. Drawing on a representative birth cohort of 2,539 U.K. adolescents, we examined how tradeoffs in screen time versus other activities are linked to adolescent well-being. Replacing activities like active time, physical activity, or sleep with screen time was associated with worse outcomes, and some effects held three years later. However, screen time was beneficial compared to passive time. Our approach accounts for the inherent tradeoffs of screen time, pinpointing when screen time can be harmful, helpful, or neutral for adolescents to lead a satisfying life.",

This study employs the classical twin design, utilizing data from 6492 individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register, including 3369 MZ twins (893 complete twin pairs, 1583 incomplete twin pairs) and 3123 DZ twins (445 complete, 2233 incomplete) to provide insights into the sources of overlap between WB/ADS and SMU. Both hedonic and eudaimonic WB scales were used. SMU was measured by (1) the time spent on different social media platforms (SMUt), (2) the frequency of posting on social media (SMUf), and (3) the number of social media accounts individuals have (SMUn). Our results confirmed the low phenotypic correlations between WB/ADS and SMU (absolute correlations, between r = 0.03-0.10). For SMU, heritability estimates between 32 and 72% were obtained. The small but significant phenotypic correlations between WB/ADS and the SMU phenotypes were mainly determined by genetic factors (in the range of 80-90%). For WB and SMU, genetic correlations were between -0.10 and -0.0, and for ADS and SMU genetic correlations were between 0.10 and 0.23. Genetic correlations implied limited but statistically significant sets of genes that affect WB/ADS and SMU levels. Overall, the results indicate that there is evidence that the small associations between WB/ADS and SMU are partly driven by overlapping genetic influences. We encourage researchers and experts to consider more personalised approaches when considering the association between WB and SMU, as well as understanding the reasons for individuals’ observed SMU levels.",

          "abstract": "Recent findings show that expressing factual beliefs and moral beliefs is both influenced by prior exposure to the case at hand, suggesting that truth judgments and moral judgments may rely on similar cognitive processes. However, the empirical evidence so far suggests that this repetition effect is larger on truth judgments than on moral judgments. Plausible theoretical assumptions could be made for both similar or different underlying cognitive processes, leading to either similar or different effect sizes. In eight experiments, we first investigated whether the illusory truth effect and the moral repetition effect are similar in size when tested on identical materials. This was not the case: The truth effect was reliably larger than the moral repetition effect, suggesting that the underlying processes differ. Second, six experiments tested the role of memory for repeated information in both repetition effects. The results show that recognition of previously encountered information was related to truth judgments but not to moral judgments, which explained part of the difference in repetition effects. Moreover, memory for repeated information was better after truth judgments than after moral judgments, suggesting that individuals try to remember previously encountered information when expressing factual versus moral beliefs. Together these findings indicate that individuals draw on their past experiences when assessing truth but not when assessing morality. We discuss these results in terms of the malleability of judgments to external information.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground. Early warning signals (EWS) based on dynamical systems theory, such as increased autocorrelation (AR) and variance, may indicate impending mood episodes in bipolar disorder (BD). This study examines whether smartphone-based digital phenotyping can detect these signals before depressive and (hypo)manic episodes.\nMethods. We analyzed smartphone sensor and self-report data from 29 BD patients over one year, totaling 10,587 patient days. 26 bi-weekly expert interviews per patient established daily disease status. AR, variance and moving averages were calculated from passively assessed activity, communication, smartphone-usage, and self-reported sleep and mood parameters. Multilevel logit models assessed whether these measures could predict pre-episode weeks of depression or mania compared to euthymic days. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves evaluated clinical utility.\nResults. Several parameters significantly predicted pre-episode weeks, but no single robust predictor emerged. Manic episodes were best predicted by altered AR and variance in activity-related measures, while sleep parameters predicted both manic and depressive transitions. Latent factors combining multiple parameters showed stronger predictive potential than individual variables. However, ROC analyses revealed that even the best predictors did not meet predefined clinical utility thresholds.\nConclusions. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping holds promise for early detection of BD mood episodes. However, predictive accuracy remains below clinically useful levels. Future research should refine parameters, explore machine-learning approaches, and optimize analytical frameworks to realize the full potential of relapse prediction in BD.",

          "abstract": "People vary drastically in their intellectual humility (i.e., their ability to recognize gaps in their knowledge). Little is known about how intellectual humility develops or why some children might demonstrate more intellectual humility than others. The current study examines the possibility of parent to child transmission of intellectual humility. Parents (N = 108; 88% college graduates; 56% with household income over $100,000) of children ages 7 to 10 completed two primary measures of intellectual humility: a self-report measure (i.e., the Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale; Krumrei-Mancuso &amp; Rouse, 2016), and a behavioral measure (i.e., the Prompted Explanation Task; Mills et al., 2022), which measured how often parents referenced knowledge limits or how to handle uncertainty. Separately, children (N = 108; M = 8.2 years; 51% girls, 49% boys; 70% White; 86% non-Hispanic) completed a knowledge estimation task where they rated their ability to answer explanatory questions about animals and vehicles. Contrary to expectations, self-report and behavioral measures of intellectual humility in parents were not correlated. Moreover, parents who self-reported higher levels of intellectual humility had children who were less humble in their knowledge ratings. That said, consistent with predictions, parents who were less humble in the way they indicated knowledge gaps had children who were less humble in the way they assessed their knowledge. These findings support that there are links between parent and child intellectual humility, but the pattern may depend on how parent intellectual humility is measured. Implications for understanding the development of intellectual humility are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive functioning is increasingly recognized as an important factor in understanding offending behavior, yet findings across cognitive domains remain fragmented and inconsistent. This multi-level meta-analysis investigates the relationship between criminal offending and cognitive functioning. A search of PubMed, PSYCINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-March 2025) yielded 101 studies (Nparticipants=12,789, Neffect sizes=1,757). Multi-level meta-analyses were conducted for each cognitive domain, comparing neuropsychological test performance between offenders and non-offending comparisons (non-offending clinical groups and general population groups). The meta-analyses confirmed weaker cognitive test performance in offenders compared to non-offending control groups. The average weighted effect size (g = 0.44) falls within the small to medium range. Significant differences were observed between offenders and comparisons across all DSM-5 neurocognitive domains: attention (g = 0.33), executive functions (g = 0.40), language (g = 0.53), learning/memory (g = 0.36), perceptual-motor functions (g = 0.24), and social cognition (g = 0.56). Tests differed in their ability to differentiate between offenders and comparison groups. Moderator analyses showed that observed differences in performance were largely absent when offenders were compared to clinical comparison groups, suggesting that impairments may reflect general clinical dysfunction rather than offender-specific deficits. These findings suggest that cognitive impairments may not be specific to offending behavior but rather reflect broader clinical dysfunction. However, such impairments could still play an indirect role in offending by reducing treatment responsivity or increasing the likelihood of dropout, both of which are known risk factors for reoffending. \nKeywords: Neuropsychological Tests; Forensic Psychology; Criminal Behavior; Aggression; Meta-Analysis; Cognitive Functioning.",

          "abstract": "Standard models of strategy assume that agents act to maximize well-defined objectives. But what happens when agency itself becomes unstable—when the agent cannot sustain a coherent identity long enough to choose? We show that such breakdowns are not anomalies. They are structural signatures of constrained agency under internal contradiction. Drawing on behavioral decision theory and strategic logic, we develop a new class of models in which agents act only when internal coherence is preserved. When coherence fails, strategy becomes unavailable—leading to dropout, cycling, delay, or identity reconfiguration. We introduce Strategic Identity Equilibrium (SIE), a formal extension of classical equilibrium theory that treats coherence as a dynamic constraint on action. Simulations demonstrate novel agent behaviors—dropout, oscillation, innovation, cascade collapse—that emerge naturally under structural stress. These results generalize core insights from behavioral decision science into a formal modeling framework, offering a unified foundation for constrained agency across game theory, psychology, and AI ethics.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin plays a key role in recipient design, the process by which communicators adapt their utterances based on their knowledge of an addressee. This form of adaptive communication requires cognitive exploration and flexibility, as individuals must integrate prior expectations with newly gathered interactional evidence to dynamically adjust their communicative behavior. Here, we investigate the electrophysiological mechanisms supporting recipient design and how oxytocin modulates this process. Fifty-one male participants received a double-blind intranasal administration of either oxytocin or placebo before undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG) while engaging in a real-time communicative game. They interacted with two presumed addressees—a child and an adult—both portrayed by a role-blind confederate who exhibited consistent communicative behavior across roles. Initially, participants relied on prior expectations, communicating more emphatically with the presumably less competent child. Over time, however, individuals in the oxytocin group adapted more rapidly to interaction-based evidence of matched communicative ability across both addressees. This dynamic adjustment was associated with sustained increases in broadband aperiodic power, a macroscopic correlate of postsynaptic activity, in the right ventral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that oxytocin facilitates adaptive communication by upregulating broadband aperiodic activity in a brain region critical for integrating prior beliefs with real-time social cues.",

Students with LAD were less likely to achieve first-class or upper second-class degrees than were students with no reported difficulties although the difference was small. White students were more likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees compared to any other ethnic group; Asian, Other ethnicity and Black students achieved the lowest proportions. The difference in attaining a first- or upper second-class degree between White and non-White students was 14.4%. White students with LAD were more likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees than were Mixed ethnicity students with LAD, and more likely than Asian, Black or Other ethnicity students with LAD or no reported difficulties. Black students without LAD were less likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees than were Asian, Mixed ethnicity, Other ethnicity or White students with LAD; Black students with LAD achieved the lowest proportion.

This report, written by a task force established by the German Psychological Society, proposes how responsible research assessment could be done in the field of psychology. We present four principles of responsible research assessment in hiring and promotion and suggest a two-phase assessment procedure that combines the objectivity and efficiency of indicators with a qualitative, discursive assessment of shortlisted candidates.

          "abstract": "Research on food cognition has largely overlooked that our modern food environment strongly differs from the environment in which our ancestors lived. When foraging for food in wild environments, our ancestors had to distinguish edible food resources from myriad inedible and potentially toxic entities. In contrast, in most cultures today, many decisions about food are made during a trip to the grocery store or a meal at a restaurant, where we might ask ourselves: Is this item healthy? but certainly not: Is this item edible or toxic? Here we argue that the scope of the problem humans faced with respect to food included navigating through wild environments to Find candidate food items, Evaluating the nutritional benefits of the potential foods, Excluding the costs of making a mistake and consuming a harmful food item, and Deciding which food items to ingest and include in their diet. We call this the FEED problem and argue that it provides an organizing framework for thinking about the wide array of cognitive processes involved in human food psychology. The FEED problem can also be used as a generative theory to produce new testable empirical predictions about what cognitive mechanisms drive our modern food behaviors and provides a roadmap for future research in the field of food cognition.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that the continuous flow of information that characterizes naturalistic events is temporally compressed in episodic memory, so that remembering an event takes less time than the duration of the past episode. However, the specific characteristics of an event that influence its temporal compression in memory remain poorly understood. In the present study, we examined the extent to which the emotional nature of events impacts their rate of compression in memory representations. We conducted two experiments in which participants were instructed to mentally replay a series of videos depicting negative or neutral events. The results showed that the course of emotional events was less compressed in memory than that of neutral events: the time taken to mentally replay a video, relative to the actual video duration, was significantly longer for negative than for neutral videos. In addition, compression rates were predictive of the subjective quality of memory. Taken together, these results suggest that negative emotion increases the sampling rate of the units of experience that represent the course of events, leading to a lower compression of events in memory representations.",

          "abstract": "In a world where borders are no longer defined by geography but by firewalls and data flows, The Cyber Eye: Inside the Network Wars and Secrets of the Five Eyes Alliance unveils the secret battles shaping global power. Written by cybersecurity expert Karwan Mustafa Kareem, this deeply researched book explores the covert operations, alliances, and rivalries of the digital age.\n\nFrom the clandestine origins of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance to the rising cyber powers challenging Western dominance, The Cyber Eye traverses a complex web of surveillance, espionage, artificial intelligence, and international intrigue. It provides an unprecedented look at how intelligence agencies harness algorithms, big data, and AI to monitor, predict, and manipulate global events.\n\nThrough detailed case studies—from China’s digital authoritarianism to Russia’s disinformation warfare, from Iran’s asymmetric cyber strategies to the growing cyber ambitions of India and regional actors—this book captures the strategic, ethical, and technical dimensions of modern intelligence warfare. Readers are taken inside cyberattacks like Stuxnet, SolarWinds, and PRISM, and shown how mass surveillance, private-sector complicity, and algorithmic governance are redefining national security and privacy.\n\nIn its final chapters, the book proposes a forward-looking AI-centric cybersecurity defense model tailored for Kurdistan, offering a blueprint for developing nations seeking digital resilience.\n\nThe Cyber Eye is essential reading for cybersecurity professionals, intelligence analysts, policymakers, academics, and anyone who wants to understand the shifting foundations of global power in the 21st century.",

          "abstract": "Attention is rapidly directed to stimuli associated with rewards in past experience, independent of current task goals and physical salience of stimuli. However, despite the robust attentional priority given to reward-associated features, studies often indicate negligible priority towards previously rewarded locations. Here, we propose a relational account of value-driven attention, a mechanism that relies on spatial relationship between items to achieve value-guided selections. In three experiments (N = 124), participants were trained to associate specific locations with rewards (e.g., high-reward: top-left; low-reward: top-right). They then performed an orientation discrimination task where the target’s absolute location (top-left or top-right) or spatial relationship (“left of” or “right of”) had previously predicted reward. Performance was superior when the target’s spatial relationship matched high-reward than low-reward, irrespective of absolute locations. Conversely, the impact of reward was absent when the target matched the absolute location but not the spatial relationship associated with high reward. Our findings challenge the default assumption of location specificity in value-driven attention, demonstrating a generalizable mechanism that humans adopted to integrate value and spatial information into priority maps for adaptive behavior.",

Previous studies have proposed three types of nature’s value: instrumental, intrinsic, and relational. Relational value refers to the perceived appropriateness of the relationship individuals maintain with nature. Although relational values have been discussed in the context of traditional worldviews, empirical research examining the associations among the three types of nature's values and traditional beliefs remains limited. This study investigated the connections between perceptions of nature’s value and traditional religious-oriented worldviews, including animism and anthropocentrism. To explore the cultural universality of these three values, we conducted a preregistered online survey with 745 Japanese participants. Our findings indicate that (i) relational value is linked to traditional religious-oriented worldviews; (ii) relational value shows a strong association with scales measuring human-nature relationships; and (iii) the distinctions among instrumental, intrinsic, and relational values appear to be culturally universal. These results support the conceptual and construct validity of the three types of nature’s value and offer deeper insights into the diverse ways individuals relate to nature.",

          "abstract": "Background: Between 50–70% of autistic individuals report clinically significant decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sound in one’s environment) at some point in their lives. DST in autism comprises multiple distinct disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust), although few studies to date have distinguished these conditions from one another or studied their correlates independently. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Univariate and multivariate Bayesian models were then used to examine the demographic and clinical correlates of each DST diagnosis (both alone and independently of the other condition) in the autistic adult population. \n\nResults: Hyperacusis and misophonia were strongly correlated. Accordingly, all significant correlates in univariate analyses were found to associate with both conditions. In multivariate analyses (including control for depression and generalized anxiety, which strongly related to DST symptoms), both disorders were independently associated with female sex; increased autistic traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and phonophobia symptoms; and increased likelihood of seeking medical care for DST. Most other significant correlates (primarily hearing-related or neurological symptoms/disorders) were found to be associated only with hyperacusis rather than misophonia, although misophonia was uniquely associated with anger symptoms and identification as a gender minority. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia explain substantial variance in clinical outcomes of interest in the autistic population and demonstrate utility as additional diagnoses for autistic adults who experience debilitating DST symptoms within clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances have transformed our understanding of the neural basis of emotion from localized to distributed network-level processes, with emerging evidence indicating a central role of the default mode network (DMN), particularly medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The mPFC exhibits a functional gradient along its dorsal-ventral axis: dorsal regions primarily engage in negative emotional experiences, while ventral subdivisions facilitate positive (safety) experiences and show a distinctive duality - representing emotions abstractly while generating individualized interpretations of experiences. During emotion regulation, the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) supports explicit-control strategies like reappraisal, while the ventral mPFC (vmPFC) mediates implicit-automatic regulation through extinction learning. Through interactions with other DMN regions and broader brain networks, the mPFC enables the construction of nuanced, contextualized emotional experiences fundamental to adaptive behavior. Understanding these mechanisms may advance affective neuroscience and inform therapeutic approaches for mental disorders with DMN dysfunction.",

          "authors": "Robin Richard Willardt; Mario Reutter",
          "abstract": "An elevated feeling of power has repeatedly been shown to lead to superior goal pursuit and attainment due to increased goal-directed attention allocation. In the wake of this research, powerlessness has often been assumed to impair goal-directed attention allocation or even to lead to less selective attention allocation overall. The present research proposes that this picture of the way powerlessness influences attention allocation is incomplete. It is hypothesized that instead of an overall reduction of selective attention allocation, powerlessness causes an increase in stimulus-driven allocation towards threat. Furthermore, powerlessness should lead to improved goal pursuit and attainment in a situation that requires stimulus-driven attention allocation. Three studies using behavioral and neural indicators of stimulus-driven attention allocation towards threat yielded only partial support for these hypotheses.\nStudy 1, using a Dot Probe Paradigm, confirmed our expectation that participants in a powerlessness condition possessed increased stimulus-driven attention allocation towards threat compared to participants in a high power condition. Study 2 used a similar dot probe task as Study 1 but additionally assessed participants’ N2pc amplitude as a neural marker of stimulus-driven attention allocation. A powerlessness condition was compared to a neutral control condition, but the finding of Study 1 could not be replicated. Study 3 tested the hypothesized improved performance of powerless individuals in a task requiring stimulus-driven attention allocation towards threat. Using a visual search paradigm, no effect of the powerlessness condition (as compared to a high power condition) was found. Implications and possible reasons for the inconclusive findings are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has implicated the implicit learning of statistical regularities as a potential factor contributing to reading deficits in individuals with dyslexia. These deficits are characterized by weaker neural adaptation compared to typically developing readers, suggesting impaired general processing in forming short-term representations of stimulus consistency. In addition, inconsistent findings have been observed regarding amplitude differences in mismatch negativity (MMN) between individuals with and without dyslexia. Although neural adaptation is believed to contribute to MMN, these two processes have been examined in separate bodies of literature, leaving their relationship in children with and without dyslexia unclear. To address this issue, 42 children with Chinese dyslexia and 26 children without dyslexia participated in an EEG roving paradigm experiment with continuous pure-tone stimuli. Importantly, the stimuli were carefully arranged to minimize expectations and isolate pure adaptation effects. The initial adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the deviants and the 2nd tones) and subsequent adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the 2nd tones and the final tones) effects, including P1a, P1b, and N250, as well as the amplitudes of MMN and late MMN, were extracted. We found that both groups exhibited similar adaptation effects, MMN, and late MMN, supported by minimal evidence for differences in our Bayesian analyses. The relationship between adaptation and MMN was also comparable between the groups. Potential reasons for discrepancies between this study and previous research, including experimental design and language differences, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers advantages over retrospective questionnaires by reducing recall bias and capturing rapid symptom dynamics, and it is increasingly used to measure depression symptoms. However, few depression symptom measures are validated for EMA use in the manner expected for traditional questionnaires. Therefore, the current study examined the internal consistency, longitudinal stability, and convergent validity of the Mobile Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (MPHQ-9), a version of the PHQ-9 modified for EMA. Depressed participants (N = 280; Female = 83.93%; White = 79.29%) completed the MPHQ-9 three times daily for 90 days. Data from the first and last 2 weeks were analyzed to align with a pre-study PHQ-9 and post-study PHQ-9 and Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms - Expanded Version (IDAS-II). The MPHQ-9 demonstrated fair to substantial adjusted item-total correlations (r = 0.42–0.83), often exceeding the PHQ-9 (r = 0.39–0.72), with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of .91 and .81, respectively. Reliability analyses of the MPHQ-9 using generalizability theory (GT) and multilevel modeling (MLM) to account for repeated measures yielded substantial between-person reliability (~1.0) but mixed within-person reliability estimates of 0.81 (GT) and 0.44 (MLM). The MPHQ-9 showed moderate stability (r = .69, ICC = .58), compared to the slight stability of the PHQ-9 (r = .39, ICC = .37). There was moderate agreement between the MPHQ-9 and both the PHQ-9 (r = .71) and the IDAS-II General Depression subscale (r = .65). This study provides initial validation of the MPHQ-9 and compares its psychometric properties to the traditional PHQ-9.",

          "abstract": "Psychological theories are often expressed verbally using natural language, which may lead to varying interpretations of the phenomenon under study. This potential confusion can be mitigated by formalizing verbal theories using mathematical language, which can help in defining, analyzing, and interpreting one’s hypotheses in quantitative terms. Differential equations (DE) are a class of models in dynamical systems framework, particularly suited to many dynamic theories in psychology. However, there is a lack of tools for translating verbal theories into DE systems. To facilitate this translation, we introduce SimDE, an open access R Shiny application that allows users to specify a DE model for a multivariate system and then simulate the trajectories of each variable over time. \n\nSimDE provides an interface to simulate a range of DE models, with features such as: 1) first- or second-order DEs (e.g., exponential, oscillatory), 2) models with or without a dynamic error term (ordinary or stochastic DEs), 3) models with multivariate effects (coupling dynamics). Users have the flexibility of plotting these systems in order to see the pattern of changes over time and determine the appropriateness of the model for the phenomenon they are trying to study. The goal of our app is to serve as a tool for researchers who want to explore DE models for their psychological theories before they even collect data. It can also help researchers to study the implicit assumptions of their systems defined with such DEs and further refine them as needed.",

Cognitive control and reward sensitivity independently predicted both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology factors two years later (Beta= 0.01 to |.605|) with multiple factors appearing transdiagnostic.

Here, we studied navigation in two patients with amnesia and their matched controls by recreating virtual versions of their recent and remote neighborhoods. Both patients showed largely intact navigation of both their recent and remote neighborhoods, and, in most cases, navigated them better than a completely novel environment.  Despite some intact navigation of these environments, patients showed dramatically reduced spontaneously cued episodic memories in these same environments compared to the controls. Our findings suggest that episodic memory and spatial navigation rely on partially distinct neural circuits, and support models of medial temporal lobe function in which extra-hippocampal networks are capable of supporting navigation in the absence of a functioning hippocampus.",

          "abstract": "Sports and exercise require constant on-the-fly decision-making from professional athletes and recreational exercisers alike. In the final minutes of a game, a team may for instance face the choice of sticking with their current strategy, or surprising the opponents with a new approach. Such decisions can be framed in terms of an exploration-exploitation trade-off: the need to balance exploiting a certain outcome with the potentials and risks that come with trying out something new. The explore-exploit framework has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of decision-making across fields such as cognitive science, behavioral economics, and clinical psychology. However, its potential remains largely untapped in sports and exercise psychology, where it could provide valuable insights into decision-making processes, because in sports and exercise, decisions naturally occur in dynamic, uncertain environments with fluctuating rewards and inherent costs. We propose that integrating standardized computational decision-making paradigms to formally investigate the mechanisms underlying exploration-exploitation decisions in sport contexts is a promising approach for our field. Applying these paradigms can provide novel insights into how athletes and exercisers navigate high-stakes, dynamic environments, identifying the factors that shape exploration-exploitation strategies in athletic performance. These insights might enhance training methodologies, optimize decision-making under pressure, and deepen our understanding of human adaptability in complex environments. Furthermore, studying this trade-off in elite sports presents unique opportunities for basic research, offering a setting for examining the limits of human decision-making and the generalizability of cognitive models to peak performance settings.",

We list four barriers to this shift in psychology: problems in scope, data, synergy, and theory. We discuss the need for psychology to adopt a more holistic lens and propose a research agenda that integrates historical processes, cultural dynamics, and ecological variations into psychological inquiry. Such an integrated approach not only enriches our microscopic understanding of Homo sapiens but also draws a more telescopic map of human psychology that encapsulates the human journey. By embedding psychology within time and space, we can better account for cross-cultural psychological diversity, historical change, and evolved psychological mechanisms, ultimately fostering a more globally representative, historically enriched, and theoretically robust discipline.",

Behavioral assays (social interaction, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests) and physiological markers (plasma corticosterone, BDNF) will track recovery over a six-week period. We hypothesize that all intervention groups will show improvement, with ketamine and benzodiazepines producing the fastest initial recovery. Following recovery, mice will be re-exposed to a novel CSDS paradigm to evaluate reuse viability. This study aims to (1) establish recovery trajectories, (2) test intervention durability, and (3) explore translational frameworks for human depression treatment. Sample size was selected to detect moderate effects while supporting repeated-measures analyses.

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers advantages over retrospective questionnaires by reducing recall bias and capturing rapid symptom dynamics, and it is increasingly used to measure depression symptoms. However, few depression symptom measures are validated for EMA use in the manner expected for traditional questionnaires. Therefore, the current study examined the internal consistency, longitudinal stability, and convergent validity of the Mobile Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (MPHQ-9), a version of the PHQ-9 modified for EMA. Depressed participants (N = 280; Female = 83.93%; White = 79.29%) completed the MPHQ-9 three times daily for 90 days. Data from the first and last 2 weeks were analyzed to align with a pre-study PHQ-9 and post-study PHQ-9 and Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms - Expanded Version (IDAS-II). The MPHQ-9 demonstrated fair to substantial adjusted item-total correlations (r = 0.42–0.83), often exceeding the PHQ-9 (r = 0.39–0.72), with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of .91 and .81, respectively. Reliability analyses of the MPHQ-9 using generalizability theory (GT) and multilevel modeling (MLM) to account for repeated measures yielded substantial between-person reliability (~1.0) but mixed within-person reliability estimates of 0.81 (GT) and 0.44 (MLM). The MPHQ-9 showed moderate stability (r = .69, ICC = .58), compared to the slight stability of the PHQ-9 (r = .39, ICC = .37). There was moderate agreement between the MPHQ-9 and both the PHQ-9 (r = .71) and the IDAS-II General Depression subscale (r = .65). This study provides initial validation of the MPHQ-9 and compares its psychometric properties to the traditional PHQ-9.",

          "abstract": "Effort influences decisions to initiate and sustain physical and cognitive tasks. Although the perception of effort is central to human behaviour, its underlying mechanisms—especially in the cognitive domain—remain poorly understood. Building on knowledge from physical exertion, this article introduces the concepts of effort and effort perception through a multidisciplinary lens, integrating insights from exercise sciences, (neuro)physiology, and psychology.\nWe begin by highlighting the inconsistent definitions of effort in the literature and propose a transdisciplinary definition: the intentional engagement of physical and cognitive resources to perform—or attempt to perform—a task. We then review methods for measuring effort, emphasizing the current limitations of physiological and performance-based variables. We argue that, when adequately contextualized as a unique perception dissociated from other exercise-related perceptions, the self-report of effort currently provides the most viable way to investigate effort.\nNext, we explore theoretical models explaining effort perception in physical tasks, focusing on the corollary discharge model as a promising theoretical framework. While this model offers valuable insights, it does not fully account for exerting effort during cognitive tasks. We suggest refining the corollary discharge model to encompass cognitive exertion, thus breaking the traditional silos between the physical and cognitive domains.\nFinally, we outline key challenges for future research: defining “resources” more clearly, developing reliable measurement tools for effort and its (neuro)physiological correlates, and determining whether effort perception is domain-general or domain-specific. We end by discussing the broad implications of our new account of effort for performance, health, and behavioural science.",

          "abstract": "While biological motion processing has been extensively studied, little is known about the top-down impact of expectations in this context. We tested whether expectations about the likelihood of encountering a human walker influence the detection of biological motion in point-light displays, particularly when perceptual information is unreliable. 74 participants completed a signal detection task, responding to stimuli featuring either a human walker or scrambled biological motion, each masked with one of four levels of visual noise. Participants were randomly assigned to the high or low expectations group and were told that 75% or 25% of the displays would feature a human walker, although the actual proportion was 50%. Participants in the high expectation group showed a greater tendency to respond “yes”, with the largest group difference emerging at the highest level of noise. These findings suggest that expectations can bias biological motion detection, particularly under conditions of sensory unreliability. The results also support the predictive processing model of agency detection, which proposes that false-positive perceptions of (supernatural) agents arise from culturally learned priors combined with ambiguous input.",

Previous research has shown that online support groups may improve group members’ wellbeing, but there is limited evidence on the role of group moderators in influencing such outcomes. Applying the social identity approach to leadership, this pre-registered study explored the applicability of the four dimensions of identity leadership in online support groups for Long Covid. Interviews were conducted with 10 members and seven moderators, to explore whether moderators displayed dimensions of identity leadership and whether this related to the health and wellbeing of both group members and moderators.  Participants explained how the moderators of their groups had, or had recovered from, Long Covid (prototypicality), developed and maintained the ethos of the group (entrepreneurship), hosted activities for group members (impresarioship), and carried out advocacy work for the broader Long Covid community by engaging with policymakers, the media, and healthcare professionals (advancement). Group members reported improvements in symptom management, adjustment, and social wellbeing by engaging with online support groups, but members mostly attributed this to the support from other group members. Moderators reported finding purpose through moderating the groups, but sometimes this was to the detriment of their physical health. When considering the leadership role of moderators, group members reflected on the importance of characteristics associated with identity entrepreneurship, whereas group moderators were more likely to consider identity advancement activities. Seven recommendations are provided, to enhance the experiences of online support groups for both group moderators and members.",

          "abstract": "The influence of space-number associations on action parameters has been widely reported. Yet, some recent studies claim that space-number associations are only the consequence of lateralized actions. However, little is known about the actual influence of action on number representations, and how this influence interacts with the influence of space. Hence, our goal was first to further examine the influence of action on number representations, and second to characterize the nature of this influence by manipulating both action direction and magnitude. To this end, we used a saccade task followed by a random number generation task (Experiment 1). We show that saccade amplitude shapes number representations, but that this influence depends on saccade direction as it is found for rightward saccades only. Moreover, the influence of target spatial position on the numbers generated vanishes when no action is executed (Experiment 2).  In our view, these results demonstrate the critical role of action in space-number associations. We suggest that the influence of space on number representations is only observed through lateralized actions. These findings shed new light on conflicting results in the literature about the influences of space and action, and provide important insights into the mechanisms behind space-number associations.",

          "abstract": "Sentence comprehension requires identifying the meanings associated with specific words, but also the referential content of the sentence as determined by grammar. We aimed to address the contribution of grammar to referential meaning by constructing semantic anomalies where word meanings were correct but referential meaning was anomalous due to the grammatical structure involved: e.g., I visited a London this morning. Using a self-paced reading task, we targeted how these anomalies affected reading time increases, and the location of this effect in the sentences. Seventy native speakers of Spanish read a total of 640 sentences and judged them as either correct or anomalous. Anomalous sentences could be: (ii) Semantic anomalies due to lexical but not grammatical factors (e.g., I arrived in a button), (iii) Semantic anomalies due to grammatical but not lexical factors, or (iv) formal-syntactic anomalies (gender and number agreement mismatches). Responses and response times of these judgements and a confidence rating were collected. We hypothesized that if referential meaning is calculated at the grammatical level, the location of reading time increases would differ between the two semantic anomaly types. We predicted that lexical-semantic anomalies (ii) would cause local reading time increases, whereas grammatical-semantic anomalies (iii) would cause more global effects. In line with our prediction, grammatical-semantic anomalies showed global effects, while lexical-semantic and syntactic anomalies showed local effects. Moreover, lexical-semantic and syntactic anomalies led to shorter reaction times in grammaticality judgments. In this way, semantic anomalies that are neither lexically driven nor syntactically illicit, provide a distinctive index of grammatical meaning: meaning that is referential and integrated at, and through, the grammatical level.",

This study examines vigilance development in a large sample of children, adolescents, and young adults (N = 777) using a novel, fine-grained analytical approach. Performance in executive vigilance was modeled using logistic curves (hits and false alarms), while arousal vigilance based on response speed was assessed using ex-Gaussian distributions (reaction times). Results showed that children’s responses became faster, less variable, and less prone to extreme reaction times throughout development, stabilizing by late adolescence. For executive vigilance, a newly identified two-phase developmental pattern emerged. These findings highlight the significance of advanced behavioral modeling in capturing developmental changes in vigilance and provide new insights into its underlying mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Austin Luor; Frederic Dick; Lori L. Holt",
          "abstract": "Humans implicitly extract statistical regularities from sensory input across multiple perceptual dimensions. In audition, both transitional probabilities (relationships between successive sounds) and global probabilities (overall frequency of occurrence) shape perception. While each has been extensively studied in isolation, their combined influence remains less understood, especially in active tasks. Here, we investigated how these two forms of statistical structure jointly influence perceptual judgments. Participants heard a 70 ms cue tone followed by a 50 or 90 ms target tone and judged whether the target tone was short or long. Crucially, statistical regularities were embedded along a task-irrelevant dimension: tone frequency. This allowed us to assess how implicit statistical learning unfolds when regularities are orthogonal to task goals. Across three experiments, high transitional probabilities between cue and target frequencies facilitated faster duration judgments, independent of whether frequencies matched. High global probability also sped responses. However, when both regularities co-occurred, the effect of transitional probability is eliminated. Additionally, a direct sensory match between cue and target frequencies provided no perceptual advantage. These findings demonstrate that, even in active tasks demanding attention to a specific dimension, listeners implicitly learn statistical structure along irrelevant dimensions. While both transitional and global probabilities shape perception, global regularities dominate when statistics co-occur. This work advances our understanding of how layered statistical regularities guide behavior in goal-directed listening contexts.",

          "abstract": "We propose a novel statistical method for detecting and comparing the onsets of experimental effects in visual world eye-tracking. Existing approaches do not allow researchers to statistically compare onsets of effects between experimental conditions or participant groups, despite their relevance to psycholinguistic research. A previous solution used a bootstrap-based method to estimate onsets of effects and their confidence intervals (Stone et al., 2020). However, the statistical properties of this method, including the empirical coverage of its confidence intervals, were never assessed. Our proposed method uses generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) and posterior simulations to integrate the modelling of fixation curves over time with onset detection. We demonstrate the applicability of the GAMM-based method by reanalysing two visual world datasets. In addition, we formally evaluate the GAMM-based method and the bootstrap-based method in two recovery simulation studies. We show that the previously proposed bootstrap-based method tends to yield delayed estimates, exhibits poor coverage properties, and inflated type I error rates. In contrast, the new GAMM-based method produces estimates with low bias and well-calibrated confidence intervals. Since determining temporal onsets is informative to models of language processing, the GAMM-based method constitutes a valuable addition to the psycholinguistic analytical toolkit.

We found limitations in program integrity, and mixed evidence for program effectiveness on attitudes, knowledge, skills, SDV use and sexual risk behavior, and no evidence for effectiveness on global self-esteem or SDV victimization.

Importantly, these findings have been used in the debate about key notions like free will and moral responsibility. However, more recent claims have challenged the possibility of generalizing findings from a meaningless context to a more meaningful one. In this context, the current study investigates the markers of volition, specifically comparing meaningful and meaningless decisions. \n\nIn an effort to maximize their monetary gain, 50 participants repeatedly deliberated between two options, making either rewarded choices—hard-deliberation decisions (where the options differed along two dimensions) or easy-deliberation decisions (where the options differed along a single dimension)—or unrewarded choices, a.k.a. arbitrary decision. This enabled us to contrast rewarded and unrewarded decisions as well as the degree of deliberation between easy- and hard-deliberation choices. We found evidence that rewarded and unrewarded decisions differed along several measures related to volition: participants reported a higher Sense of Volition, exhibited a stronger Readiness Potential, had increased Temporal Binding, and demonstrated increased Effort Exerted in the rewarded condition. In contrast, we found evidence for similarity across these measures between easy-deliberation and hard-deliberation conditions. \n\nOur results suggest that it is not the complexity of the deliberation process prior to the action that makes it more volitional, but ratherthat the decision serves a meaningful goal. Our study also introduced a new implicit measure of volition—exerted effort—that well aligned with other measures of volition and should therefore prove useful in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Background: Eating disorders are serious psychiatric disorders associated with high levels of co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, high rates of relapse and poor treatment outcomes. The collection of standardised, routinely collected data within clinical services holds promise to improve patient care. Proposals for standardised variables for collection in eating disorders services have been made, but not implemented, and have included limited biological measures. Given emerging evidence about the importance of metabolism and other biological factors in eating disorders, there is a need for such measures to be integrated into routine data collection. \nObjective: To agree on a set of biopsychosocial variables for routine data collection within eating disorder services in the United Kingdom.\nMethods: Two online workshops were conducted using an adapted nominal group technique to agree priorities for data collection in adult (n= 20) and child/adolescent (n=23) eating disorder services (n = 43 participants, comprised of people with lived experience, carers, clinicians and researchers). Two researchers independently conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of the workshop transcripts to identify qualitative priorities for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the results of online voting. Measures and variables were chosen based on the priority-setting workshops, informed by prior work on psychometric properties of relevant measures. \nFindings: Thematic analysis identified four superordinate themes for data collection in eating disorder services: (1) a mutually valued and beneficial collaboration; (2) a holistic approach; (3) a balance between standardisation and individualisation; (4) doing no harm. Quantitative analysis of voting identified priorities across a range of domains\nConclusions: This project agreed a set of biopsychosocial variables which have been implemented for routine data collection as part of the Eating Disorders Clinical Research Network. Further research should investigate the implementation of these variables for data collection in eating disorder services and identify priorities for data collection in under-represented groups such as people with experience of binge eating disorder.\nClinical implications: Patients, caregivers, and clinicians support routine data collection in eating disorders services so long as the measures used are considered meaningful, not overly burdensome, non-stigmatising and collected as a collaboration between patients and treatment providers.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive and computational modeling has been used as a method to understand the processes underlying behavior in humans and other animals. A common approach in this field involves the use of theoretically constructed cognitive models, such as reinforcement learning models. However, human and animal decision-making often deviates from the predictions of these theoretical models. \nTo capture characteristics that these cognitive models fail to account for, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been increasingly used to model choice behavior involving reinforcement learning. RNNs are able to capture how choice probabilities change depending on past experience. In this work, we demonstrate that RNNs can improve future choice predictions by capturing individual differences on the basis of past behavior, even when a single model is fit across the entire population. We term this property of the RNN the individual difference tracking (IDT) property. While the IDT property might be useful for prediction, it may introduce excessive flexibility when RNNs are used as benchmarks for predictive accuracy. We investigate the nature of the IDT property through simulation studies and examine how it affects the interpretation of predictive accuracy when RNNs are used as benchmarks for cognitive models. We also present examples using real-world data. Through these analyses, we discuss practical considerations and limitations in using RNNs as benchmarks for cognitive models and propose directions for future research.",

Previous research has largely focused on the frequency of engagement in these activities, overlooking the role of identity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine and compare the associations of music and sports identities with health outcomes. To gain more insights into potential internal (psychological) and external (behavioral) mechanisms underlying these associations, we further explored self-efficacy and health behavior as mediators. A total of 242 participants who regularly engage in leisure sports or music activities completed an online survey assessing their identification as (hobby) musicians and sportspersons, mental and physical health, self-efficacy, and health behavior. Using path modeling, we found that a strong sports identity is associated with better mental health, while no direct effects were observed for physical health. Music identity did not directly relate to mental or physical health. However, mediation analyses revealed that both sport and music identities are linked to improved mental health through increased self-efficacy and to better physical health through enhanced health behaviors. These findings suggest that leisure identities play an indirect but crucial role in health, mediated by self-efficacy and health behavior.

          "abstract": "Leisure activities are essential for building and maintaining a sense of identity, which can significantly impact mental and physical health. Previous research has largely focused on the frequency of engagement in these activities, overlooking the role of identity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine and compare the associations of music and sports identities with health outcomes. To gain more insights into potential internal (psychological) and external (behavioral) mechanisms underlying these associations, we further explored self-efficacy and health behavior as mediators. A total of 242 participants who regularly engage in leisure sports or music activities completed an online survey assessing their identification as (hobby) musicians and sportspersons, mental and physical health, self-efficacy, and health behavior. Using path modeling, we found that a strong sports identity is associated with better mental health, while no direct effects were observed for physical health. Music identity did not directly relate to mental or physical health. However, mediation analyses revealed that both sport and music identities are linked to improved mental health through increased self-efficacy and to better physical health through enhanced health behaviors. These findings suggest that leisure identities play an indirect but crucial role in health, mediated by self-efficacy and health behavior. This knowledge can inform the development of leisure interventions aimed at promoting physical and mental health by raising awareness for the role of leisure identities and addressing self-efficacy beliefs and health behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Slot machines gained a high popularity despite a specific element that could limit their appeal: non-transparency with respect to mathematical parameters. The PAR sheets, exposing the parameters of the design of slot machines and probabilities associated with the winning combinations are kept secret by game producers, and the lack of data regarding the configuration of a machine prevents people from computing probabilities and other mathematical indicators. In this article, I argue that there is no rational justification for this secrecy by giving two reasons, one psychological and the other mathematical. For the latter, I show that mathematics provides us with some statistical methods of retrieving the missing data, which are essential for the numerical probability computations in slots. The slots case raises the problem of the exposure of the parametric configuration and mathematical facts of any game of chance as an ethical obligation.",

We propose a new framework that integrates insights from Cognitive Linguistics and Neurolinguistics to advance theoretical and empirical research in Cognitive Neuropragmatics. Language is conceptualized as a dynamic system balancing conventional semantics with context-related pragmatic functions. We discuss the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying semantic construction and pragmatic inference, emphasizing their interdependencies. Findings on the neural correlates of pragmatic processes, such as speech acts and conversational implicatures, challenge traditional distinctions and reveal fluid boundaries across the continuum. Case studies on turn-taking and gesture pragmatics illustrate the utility of integrating annotated naturalistic data with neurophysiological methods to investigate communicative language use. By leveraging multimodal frame-semantics based annotation of naturalistic datasets, this work provides critical tools to understand how meaning emerges and operates at the interface of linguistic form, meaning, and social interaction, paving the way for refined neurophysiological mapping methods of linguistic phenomena.",

Typically, auditors use the Stringer bound for this purpose. However, this method is often too conservative and lacks a solid statistical foundation. Despite the development of better alternatives, almost none of these methods have been widely adopted, partly because they are impractical. To address these issues, we propose an intuitive approach that combines Bayesian statistics with hurdle modeling. We show that this approach is reliable, has a stronger statistical foundation than the Stringer bound while also being more efficient, and is more practical than alternative methods. Additionally, it enables auditors to incorporate multiple sources of pre-existing audit information into the statistical analysis in a straightforward manner, thereby further increasing efficiency. We argue that the proposed method is an attractive solution for situations where the Stringer bound creates challenges.",

Given that we are constantly surrounded by sounds, we wanted to exploratory investigate whether humans implicitly can learn sequences in sounds emitted from different positions. We developed a new experimental paradigm based on the Serial Reaction Time Task and collected three independent data samples, altogether data from 75 healthy participants aged 18-40. Our group-level results show a smaller implicit learning effect than many previous studies using the conventional tests of implicit learning of visual stimuli. However, observed individual differences were large with 33-67% participants showing indications of implicit learning. No robust differences in attentional ability or sleepiness between learners and non-learners were found. However, in general participants reported high and increasing levels of sleepiness during the testing as well as high-levels of mind-wandering. We conclude that there could be important individual differences in implicit learning but that future tests of implicit learning probably need to be more motivating and engaging to achieve cleaner, more reliable assessments of implicit learning.",

          "abstract": "We discuss the concept of a memory representation from the perspective of the cognitive neuroscience of long-term memory, focusing on episodic memory and differentiating active versus latent, and cognitive versus neural representations. We adopt a causal perspective, according to which an active cognitive representation must have a causal connection to a past event to count as a memory. We note that retrieved episodic information may nonetheless only partially determine the content of an active memory representation, which can comprise a combination of the retrieved information with semantic, schematic and situational information. We further note that, especially in the case of memories for temporally remote events, re-encoding operations likely lead to a causal chain that extends from the original experience of the event to its currently accessible memory trace. We discuss how the reinstatement framework provides a mechanistic basis for the causal linkage between an experience, the memory trace encoding it, and the retrieval of an episodic memory of the experience, highlighting the crucial role of hippocampal engrams in encoding patterns of neocortical activity that, when activated, constitute the neural representation of an episodic memory. Finally, we discuss some of the ways in which a memory can become modified and hence distanced from the episode that precipitated it.",

A single observation x would update the probability of Mf from 1/2 to f(x) /[f(x) + g(x)]. The discrepancy D_EP(f || g) between distributions f(x) and g(x) equals E[p(Mf|xf)], that is, the expected posterior probability for Mf after a single observation x from f(x). In contrast to the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy (which is based on the expected logarithm of the Bayes factor for Mf) the discrepancy D_EP(f || g) (a) is symmetric in the sense that D_EP(f || g) = D_EP(g || f); (b) is defined even when the two distributions are not absolutely continuous with respect to one another; (c) is robust to differences in the tail of the distributions; and (d) quantifies dissimilarity of distributions on the familiar scale of probability. For hypothesis testing, this implies that the expected posterior probability for a true null hypothesis H0 equals the expected posterior probability for a true alternative hypothesis H1, despite the fact that default Bayes factors generally accumulate much more quickly for a true H1 than they do for a true H0.",

En France, les décennies 2010 et 2020 ont été et sont marquées par une sensibilité accrue à ces situations et par le développement d’outils d’action publique. A titre d’exemple, des textes de lois ont été introduits dans le code pénal en 2014, puis en 2022 pour donner un cadre au traitement juridique de tels faits. Le droit à une scolarité sans harcèlement a également été ajouté au code de l’éducation en 2019. Une obligation de moyens pesant alors sur les écoles, le programme de prévention « Phare » a commencé à être diffusé en 2021 pour guider les acteurs scolaires en demande de soutien. Chaque établissement scolaire est désormais tenu de le mettre en place.\nDe leur côté, les chercheurs œuvrent à une meilleure compréhension des processus sous-jacents à ces situations. Ils examinent également les modalités permettant de le prévenir et de le traiter efficacement. Cependant, alors que les acteurs scolaires et les chercheurs semblent regarder dans une direction commune pour endiguer ces situations sociales délétères, parlent-ils de la même chose ?\nNous reviendrons sur le périmètre scientifique du concept de school-bullying et sur les subtilités qu’il invite à saisir. Nous présenterons ensuite des éléments concernant la diffusion médiatique française liée à la notion de harcèlement scolaire, terme retenu dans ce pays pour traduire le concept de bullying. Nous interrogerons notamment les écarts susceptibles d’exister entre les contenus médiatiques véhiculés sur le harcèlement dans l’hexagone et le périmètre scientifique du bullying au niveau international. Enfin, nous mentionnerons les effets possiblement produits par un tel écart sur la sensibilité au bullying, son repérage et l’action précoce.

          "abstract": "Diminished use of goal-directed (“model-based”) decision-making is a hallmark of transdiagnostic compulsivity, promoting an over-reliance on inflexible and habitual behaviours. However, the origin of this impairment remains unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that these impairments arise due to uncertainty within the internal world model that subserves goal-directed decision-making. We adapted a validated gamified decision-making task to characterise how individuals build an internal model of an environment, pairing this data with computational modelling to uncover the exact mechanisms underpinning behaviour and quantify individual differences. Two samples of participants (a discovery and pre-registered replication sample) performed the task, and we also acquired longitudinal data over 2 week and 3 month periods to assess task reliability and stability of behaviour over time. Across discovery (n=551) and replication (n=1322) samples, we found that individuals higher in compulsivity and intrusive thought learned more slowly and formed a less certain representation of the task’s structure. This uncertainty mediated the link between compulsive symptoms and use of goal-directed behaviour. Behaviour in the task was relatively stable over a 3 month (n=385) and 1 year (n=326) period and did not predict changes in symptoms. Our results suggest that reliance on habitual behaviours seen in those with high levels of compulsive symptoms result from a tendency to form less certain internal models of the external world. Given the stability of this behaviour and its links to symptoms, this may represent a trait-level vulnerability for this symptom dimension.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are often accompanied by impairments in emotional processing. Interoception, the capacity to sense and interpret internal bodily signals, underpins emotion by linking physiological cues to subjective feeling states. Bodily maps of emotion allow visualizing where individuals feel bodily changes during discrete emotions, offering a direct window onto the interoceptive foundations of emotional experience. However, the precise role of bodily sensations in emotional processing deficits across psychiatric disorders remains underexplored.\nThis scoping review synthesizes research that has applied bodily-map methodologies to psychiatric populations. Following PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews, we systematically searched and screened studies that employed bodily maps of emotion as an assessment tool in clinically diagnosed samples. By synthesizing the existing literature, our objective was to identify interoceptive deficits related to emotions in psychiatric disorders and highlight underexplored areas in this field.\nOur scoping review indicates that altered perceptions of emotional bodily sensations are common across a range of psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, autism, and alcohol use disorder. However, studies often examine emotional processes without distinguishing how emotional embodiment may contribute to difficulties in different emotional processes (i.e., identification, response, and regulation). In this context, we propose new directions for the use of bodily maps to foster a more theoretically grounded and comprehensive analysis of bodily perception in psychiatric disorders.",

The results consistently point to a particularly enriching and joyful experience\nfor all choristers, adults and adolescents alike, with or without an autism diagnosis. Notable\nbenefits for autistic adolescents were perceived in the areas of mental health and social\nbehavior. Participants described choral singing as a particularly powerful tool for facilitating\nquality encounters, possibly by promoting an attitude of openness, even between groups\nthat usually find it difficult to interact. This experience can thus be seen as an opportunity to\nreach out to others while being heard in one's singularity, which appears to be particularly\nfulfilling for the choristers. It opens up promising perspectives for promoting each and\neveryone’s mental health, and for moving towards a more inclusive society.",

          "abstract": "Although adults commonly tell moral stories to children with the aim of teaching important lessons, they often fail to extract the intended moral themes of these stories. Few interventions to date have successfully addressed this problem. The present study examined the effects of pretesting on children’s learning from moral stories. We assigned sixty 5- to 6-year-olds to either a pretesting condition, where they attempted pretest questions about a to-be-learned moral before hearing a moral story, or a control condition, where they only heard the story. After hearing the story, pretested children were significantly more likely than the control group to generate the intended moral theme on open-ended questions asking about the story’s lesson. They did not perform any better, however, on tasks that involved selecting the theme in a forced-choice format or applying it to novel scenarios. Hence, the present findings partially support the hypothesis that pretesting improves children’s theme extraction from moral stories—that is, enhancing the ability to reproduce the correct theme but not enhancing generalisation to other circumstances. Overall, this study reveals that pretesting can enhance the effectiveness of moral stories as an educational tool, at least in terms of helping children to learn important moral lessons, and presents directions for further research to investigate real-life applications of these lessons.",

          "abstract": "Story reading is often accompanied by mental visualization of the scenes and the events described. Individuals with aphantasia, who report not experiencing vivid visual imagery, have recently been reported to be less absorbed and engaged when reading stories. In the present study, we explored how aphantasics read imagery-rich stories differently from control subjects by analyzing their gaze fixation patterns. We found that in both groups, gaze fixation was similarly influenced by different types of story content. Notably, under perceptual imagery, which involves sensory-rich contents, the influence was the strongest, resulting in longer fixation durations during relevant keywords in both groups. Despite the same fixation patterns, aphantasics reported less experienced immersion in the stories, consistent with a previous study. Furthermore, we observed that in control subjects, longer fixation duration on perceptual imagery contents was correlated with higher experienced imagery, whereas in aphantasic individuals, this relationship was reversed. Our findings may align with the account that imagery under aphantasia may be nonconscious rather than nonexistent, leading to the lack of introspective access to mental images, as the fixation patterns indicative of reading behavior were similar, while only reported subjective experiences differed under aphantasia.",

While an efficient re-use of existing resources, it remains unknown how human observers classify perceptual signals as reflecting external reality, as opposed to internal simulation or imagination. Here we show that judgments of reality are underpinned by the combined strength of sensory activity generated by either imagery or perception in bilateral fusiform gyrus. Activity fluctuations in this region predict confusions between imagery and perception on a trial-by-trial basis and interact with a frontal brain network encoding binary judgments of reality. Our results demonstrate that a key mechanism through which the brain distinguishes imagination from reality is by monitoring the activity of mid-level visual cortex. These findings increase our understanding of failures of reality testing and lay the foundations for characterising a generalised perceptual reality monitoring system in the human brain.",

          "authors": "Mandad Tabrizi",
          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is generally framed as a stable neurodevelopmental deficit. Yet individuals often report predictable waves of hyper-focus followed by collapse—patterns the static model cannot explain. We advance the ADHD Tide hypothesis, positing that attention, motivation and executive control in ADHD follow self-organising, quasi-rhythmic states generated by feedback loops among dopaminergic tone, fluctuating executive resources, environmental stimulation and task affordances. These tides differ from circadian or ultradian clocks: they are not driven by fixed oscillators but by context-sensitive regulation seeking an optimal arousal range. Synthesising evidence from dynamic dopamine imaging, intra-individual variability studies, ecological momentary assessments, creativity research and behavioural ecology, we show that tide-like cycling can confer exploratory advantages while clashing with environments that demand sustained, low-stimulation focus. We outline a research programme—experience sampling, dense-sampling neuroimaging and computational modelling—to map state signatures, transition triggers and adaptive functions. Recognising these rhythms reframes clinical goals from enforcing consistency toward harnessing optimal phases, informing state-contingent interventions, rhythm-friendly workplaces and self-management tools. By shifting ADHD from a static deficit to a dynamic regulation profile, the ADHD Tide model offers a unifying lens for research, clinical practice and human-centred design.",

Yet no general framework has systematically unified behavior across molecular, cellular, organismal, and cultural domains. Here I propose a triadic heuristic model: Behavior = Archetype × Drive × Culture (ARCH). Archetypes represent inherited structural templates, Drives reflect internal energetic and motivational states, and Culture embodies informational transmission across individuals and generations. Through historical, ethological, and biological analysis, this work demonstrates that the ARCH triad operates from the origins of life through plant behaviors, insect societies, vertebrate cognition, and human cultural systems. ARCH offers a scalable framework organizing behavior from early chemical gradients to symbolic human action. By integrating structure, motivation, and information flow into a unified model, ARCH provides a systematic foundation for advancing research across neuroscience, ethology, psychology, anthropology, and artificial intelligence. ARCH posits that all behavior arises from the interaction of three foundational elements: Archetype x Drive X Culture.",

          "abstract": "For many years the accepted wisdom in vision science has been that humans tend to underestimate the speed of an object when they pursue it with their gaze in comparison to when they fixate a spot in the visual scene and the object moves across the retina, an effect that is referred to as the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. However, experiments on the Aubert-Fleischl effect have generally employed a target moving in front of a blank background. For objects moving in the real world, relative motion between the object and the background provides additional cues, potentially allowing the visual system to compensate for the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we asked 50 participants to compare the speed of a single sphere to the speed of a sphere-cloud in a two-interval forced-choice task while they either followed the single sphere with their gaze or kept their eyes on a fixation cross. Stimuli were presented in virtual reality and the sphere’s movement could occur either in a completely black environment with no relative motion cues present, or against a visible, textured background behind the moving sphere. The probe sphere-cloud always moved in front of the same background as the target. In a large data set (n = 50), we found no evidence for an Aubert-Fleischl effect, i.e., no evidence for an underestimation of speed during pursuit relative to fixation, in either of the environments. Our results challenge the prevailing notion that object speed is underestimated when the object is pursued versus when fixation is maintained and highlights the necessity to take into account characteristics of the visual scene.",

Questions about changes in personality functioning are of critical relevance for theory development and psychotherapeutic treatment of personality pathology, yet little is known about its longitudinal development. Using a sample of German-speaking young adults (N = 1,440; Mage = 25.57), we examined one-year unconditional and event-related development in self-reported personality functioning across four metrics of change, tested predictors of heterogeneity in event-related changes, and compared findings to self-reported Big Five traits. Generally, unconditional development of all personality constructs was very similar, but there were some trait- and metric-specific differences. Life events accounted for heterogeneity in unconditional development, but almost exclusively for personality functioning, suggesting it has a greater susceptibility to external influences than most Big Five traits. Event perceptions and initial personality levels sometimes predicted individual differences in event-related changes, mostly for mean-level effects, and initial personality functioning frequently moderated event-related changes in the Big Five whereas the reverse was less common. These findings provide further insight into the conceptual (dis)similarity of personality traits and personality functioning, inform joint theoretical frameworks, and may help advance personality disorder treatment by identifying conditions in which changes in personality pathology may be expected or best captured.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Network theory of psychopathology offers a promising framework for personalizing psychotherapy based on personalized symptom networks. However, the estimation of these networks representing an individual's mental disorder is methodologically challenging. The recently developed method of perceived causal relations (PECAN), in which relations between symptoms are determined on the basis of the individual's perception, represents a promising method of network creation. However, no child- or adolescent-sensitive PECAN version exists.\nMethods: This study adapted PECAN for individuals aged 10-21 (PECAN-CA) and evaluated its reliability and feasibility. A total of N = 75 sub-clinically socially anxious children and adolescents (10–21years; M=15.23, SD=4.07) created personalized symptom networks based on PECAN-CA for a past social situation. Retest reliability was tested immediately and after four weeks, comparing results to prior studies applying PECAN to adults and adolescents. Exploratory analyses examined factors influencing reliability and feasibility.\nResults: Participants generally rated PECAN-CA as feasible. Networks generated were comparably reliable to those from PECAN studies with adults and more reliable than those from PECAN studies with adolescents. Centrality measures, critical for clinical decisions, showed high reliability (r=.89–.95). Older age and greater comprehension of network theory concepts enhanced feasibility and reliability. Selecting fewer symptoms improved reliability.\nConclusion: Overall, PECAN-CA enables the creation of reliable networks in childhood and adolescence. Psychoeducation on concepts of network theory seems important for effective implementation. For younger individuals, PECAN-CA may not work in some cases or only if the number of symptoms included in the network is reduced to a minimum.",

Despite the term context appearing in over 83% of communication science articles, its conceptualization remains nebulous. Drawing on multiple disciplines, an interactionist perspective is advanced that considers how individual, social, and situational factors afford or constrain verbal behavior. Using examples of language complexity and processing fluency, this paper demonstrates how contextual factors like instrumental goal activation can reverse seemingly established relationships between simple language features and behavioral outcomes. The paper concludes by advocating for methodological approaches that systematically integrate contextual variables into language analysis, enabling researchers to resolve contradictory findings, enhance replicability, and develop a more nuanced understanding of how language reveals psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) presents a unique emotional pattern that challenges dominant frameworks in the current literature. In many regions, personal success typically elicits pride, while the success of an ingroup member evokes connection—reinforcing a distinction between individual and collective achievement. In contrast, success in SSA—whether one’s own or that of a close other—elicits both pride and connection, reflecting a cultural ethos we call self-promotive interdependence. This system integrates personal ambition with strong ingroup commitment, positioning individual achievement as essential to collective wellbeing. Across five studies involving participants from four SSA countries and comparison samples from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Latin America, East Asia, and the West, we examined emotional responses to success and failure. SSA participants consistently co-expressed pride and connection in response to both personal and ingroup success. In other regions, personal success was more narrowly associated with pride, while connection was reserved for others’ success—except in MENA, where pride and connection sometimes co-occurred. Failure in SSA also elicited complex blends of self-blame, camaraderie, and even pride in others’ effort, further supporting the logic of self-promotive interdependence. These findings reveal a distinctive cultural system in SSA that reconfigures the emotional dynamics of success and failure through the lens of shared identity and ambition.",

          "abstract": "Across eight economic games and survey experiments, we find that incentivizing third parties to punish destabilizes cooperation. When punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately, remain lower regardless of punishment feedback, and can only be restored by explicitly signaling that incentives are restricted to prosocial punishment. When we allow recipients of cooperation to choose the punishers they are paired with, they inadvertently reduce their own payouts by choosing incentivized punishers. Survey experiments suggest that these effects occur because recipients trust punishers more than dictators, care more about promoting prosocial punishment than preventing antisocial punishment, and that the introduction of incentives reframes social norms. Our results suggest that any effects of punishment on cooperation may be driven more by what it communicates about punishers’ intentions and social norms than by the imposition of material costs alone. Implications for criminal justice and systems of punishment are discussed.",

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. Several cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on Response (RESP), a cognitive mode that is elicited at the onset of a motor response. The BOLD signal configurations associated with RESP are modulated by a range of tasks, and here we present a total of six. For each task, we report (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing RESP from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with RESP over a range of task conditions. To facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to RESP as follows: (1) Thalamus Kite Surfer, (2) Bat, (3) Lobster, and (4) Butterfly. Evidence for RESP was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by the following types of tasks: probabilistic reasoning, evidence integration, verbal working memory, thought generation, relational episodic memory, and handedness. Based on observation of task- induced BOLD signal changes across a wide range of tasks, the function of RESP can be confirmed to to configure due to execution of motor responses. When a response is not required, RESP is absent. Moreover, there is evidence that RESP deactivation is reciprocal to MAIN mode activation, involved in maintaining internal attention, because when there is a delay is present involving sustained internal attention, RESP is deactivated. Activation of RESP may be shortened or lengthened corresponding to faster or slower reaction times, respectively, or potentially to confounds with attentional processes when statistically merged. Finally, imagination of actions appears to activate a bilateral RESP network rather than reciprocal/unilateral. Future research should explore how RESP activates over a wider range of tasks, using larger samples.",

Specifically, perceptual constraints such as poor visual acuity and a slower rate of visual processing are crucial for supporting early learning and nudging it in the correct direction. Overall, this review elucidates our current knowledge about the computational bases of infant learning and exploration processes and identifies the aspects that still require more in-depth research.",

          "abstract": "Humans use space to make sense of abstract concepts. Across cultures, for instance, adults rely on mental timelines that conceptualize time metaphorically as a spatial path. Are these spatial models late-arriving \"flourishes\" or early-developing \"foundations\"? On the flourish account, spatial models are late ontogenetic additions, acquired only after a conceptual domain has been mastered. Alternatively, spatial models may be an early foundation that precedes and perhaps enables more elaborate understanding. Here, using spontaneous co-speech gesture as a window onto implicit spatial thinking, we show that children as young as five, who are still struggling to understand basic temporal concepts, nevertheless conceptualize time spatially. When US American children discussed temporal concepts, they gestured spontaneously in ways that represented time as a spatial path: past to one side, present at their body, future to the other side. These gestures typically aligned with cultural conventions, were shaped by brief exposure to a cultural artifact that represented time, and predicted the depth of children's temporal understanding. Spatial models may offer an early developmental foundation for elaborate conceptions of time.",

          "abstract": "Body perception disturbances represent a consistent predictor of onset, treatment outcome and chronicity in conditions such as Restrictive Eating Disorder (REDs). In adult patients diagnosed with REDs, overestimation of body weight and disregard for one’s body have been associated with altered tactile acuity and biases in proprioceptive localization, often correlated with symptom severity. It is however unknown whether this is also the case in adolescents with REDs, when the disorder has just emerged. This study aimed to characterize possible alterations in tactile and body perception in a sample of adolescent subjects diagnosed with REDs. Patients (N = 49) and age-matched controls (N = 45) were administered with tasks measuring tactile acuity and body landmark localization accuracy on the hand and abdomen. Furthermore, levels of body dissatisfaction were measured with clinical questionnaires. Our results indicate that the REDs group exhibited greater biases in the perception of the abdomen, whereas their biases in hand perception were similar to the healthy controls. We did not find differences in tactile processing between the RED and the control group. Also, the relation between perceptual bias, tactile acuity, self-reported body dissatisfaction was statistically not significant. Our results suggest that biases in body perception in REDs are already present in adolescence, but limited to salient body parts, such as the abdomen.",

          "abstract": "This essay examines the fundamental inconsistency between the relativistic block universe view of spacetime and subjective conscious experience, particularly the paradox of the privileged now moment contained in the timeless reality of the block universe. Addressing two postulates—that we live in a four-dimensional block universe where all moments are embedded within spacetime, and that conscious experience of the present moment is real—in this essay, the multitrack consciousness conjecture (MCC) is advanced as a solution for this paradox. This conjecture suggests the existence of multiple identical instances of our conscious selves in time, each one only being capable of experiencing a single moving now. The implications of the MCC for self-identity, emotion, memory, and shared experiences are discussed within the block universe framework and in more heterodox physical scenarios. The MCC offers a new perspective on the relations among the subjective nature of time, consciousness and the structure of events in spacetime.",

While eyes-closed waking rest after learning typically provides a memory benefit, we hypothesized that individuals diagnosed with ADHD would show reduced memory improvement after rest, compared to controls. N = 24 ADHD and N = 28 control participants listened to a short story followed by either 15min of rest or a 15min distractor task (within-subjects). A recall test was administered immediately afterwards and 24hrs later. EEG (electroencephalography) was recorded during the rest period, along with EOG (electrooculography) and EMG (electromyography). While ADHD and control groups differed substantially in resting-state mental and neural activity, the effect of rest on memory consolidation did not differ between groups. However, in exploratory analyses controlling for inattention symptoms, rest impaired memory in participants with ADHD, while improving memory in controls. These observations add to a growing literature describing how persons with ADHD differ from controls in resting state brain and mental activity.",

          "abstract": "Facial expressions vary in ambiguity, making emotion perception challenging. ‘Precision-weighting’ theory posits that interpretation of ambiguous facial expressions would rely more strongly on prior expectations to help resolve uncertainty, yet evidence for this is lacking. To investigate this we presented emotional sentences that set expectations for how a neutral face would then emote in response. Critically, the face expression was either reliable (high intensity) or ambiguous (low intensity). Across two experiments using angry/happy and sad/disgust emotions, we found better face emotion labelling performance when expressions matched (congruent) versus mismatched (incongruent) expectations. Importantly, congruency effects were larger when face expressions were low- versus high-intensity, indexing greater influence of prior expectations when expression information was more ambiguous. This provides the first empirical evidence of precision-weighting mechanisms in face emotion perception and prediction. Drift Diffusion Modelling confirmed that this precision-weighting effect was underpinned by use of prior sentence evidence and faster evidence accumulation.",

          "abstract": "Perceived visual balance is one of the critical factors that determine whether an artwork is perceived as aesthetically pleasing or not. This kind of balance seems to depend on the perceptual weight given to the major elements of a composition that can differ in size, position, shape, orientation and colors within the pictorial field. We probe the relationship between perceived stability, dynamics, balance and aesthetic ratings of original compositions from the Suprematist art movement and participant-arranged compositions with the elements taken from the artworks. For each artwork twenty-two art-naïve participants arranged first all shape elements on the corresponding “canvas” of the paper version separately according to two tasks: create a stable and create a dynamic composition. After this, they transferred the final compositions to the computer and rated their digital versions of the stable and dynamic arrangements as well as the original Suprematists’ artworks according to the degree of perceived balance, stability and dynamic appearance and personal preference. Qualitatively, in ‘stable’ compositions shape elements were arranged more symmetrically and often stacked on the lower part of the ‘canvas’, whereas in ‘dynamic’ compositions elements were often rotated with respect to the pictorial field and distributed unevenly or asymmetrically over larger areas. The relationship between perceived stability, dynamics and liking varied not much with the complexity of the artwork for the self-compositions, but substantially for the original Suprematists’ paintings. Our analysis revealed a consistent difference in individual preferences for either stable or dynamic arrangements.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the extensive consequences of pressure ulcers among bedridden patients. Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores or pressure sores, pose significant health challenges for individuals with limited mobility. The research investigates the physical, psychological, and economic impacts of pressure ulcers on patients and the healthcare system. Physically, pressure ulcers can cause tissue damage and infections due to prolonged pressure on specific areas, leading to skin deterioration. Psychologically, patients suffering from pressure ulcers may experience pain, discomfort, anxiety, depression, and a reduced quality of life. Economically, managing pressure ulcers incurs substantial treatment costs, including specialized wound care products and frequent medical consultations. This study highlights the burden placed on healthcare systems and caregivers due to the demanding care required for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers are a prevalent and debilitating complication among bedridden patients, leading to significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. This study investigates the consequences of pressure ulcers on bedridden patients, identifies risk factors associated with their development, and explores demographic factors that increase their risk. Our findings indicate that pressure ulcers significantly impact patients' physical and psychological well-being, healthcare utilization, and quality of life. We identified key risk factors, including immobility, sensory impairment, poor nutrition, and inadequate care practices. Additionally, our analysis reveals significant demographic associations, with older adults, females, and those with comorbid diseases being more susceptible. This study highlights the urgent need for proactive prevention strategies, timely detection, and effective management to mitigate the consequences of pressure ulcers and improve patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Engagement in a variety of lifestyle activities, such as intellectual stimulation, social interaction, and physical exercise, is thought to be a key contributor to cognitive reserve, helping the brain compensate for age-related or pathological changes. An open question is whether restrictions on lifestyle activities, even if relatively brief, might have detrimental effects on cognition. The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented restrictions on the kinds of lifestyle activities that have been shown to be protective against age-related cognitive decline. In the present study, we captured changes in lifestyle and memory of older adults across the pandemic. Long-term memory was assessed using a task which allows for the estimation of both retrieval success and memory precision, the latter being particularly sensitive to age-related changes. Memory was assessed before the pandemic in person, and during the pandemic using an online version of the task. Experiment 1 first verified that younger adults’ performance did not significantly differ between testing environments, validating pre- and post-pandemic comparison in older adults. Experiment 2 then demonstrated that while substantial declines in lifestyle engagement were observed during the pandemic in older adults, there was no significant correlation between these lifestyle changes and memory performance overall. However, when modelling retrieval success, lifestyle effects varied with dementia risk, consistent with cognitive reserve theory, as well as varying with depression. These findings highlight how different memory features are impacted by factors such as lifestyle, and support the proposal that heightened dementia risk may increase susceptibility to the impact of lifestyle changes.",

We, therefore, aimed to investigate the association between hoarding severity and schizotypy in two non-clinical samples large enough to estimate associations with reasonably high levels of precision. In addition, we aimed to examine whether individual differences in hyperactive agency detection mediated any associations that were found between hoarding severity and schizotypy. We conducted two online studies (Study 1 N = 212; Study 2 N = 261), with participants completing self-report measures of schizotypy, hoarding severity, and negative affect, as well as a measure of hyperactive agency detection, using a Heider-Simmel animation. In both studies, there were significant, positive associations between hoarding severity and schizotypy and between hoarding severity and hyperactive agency detection. However, while individual differences in hyperactive agency detection partially mediated the association between schizotypy and hoarding severity in Study 2, this was not the case in Study 1. These findings provide further evidence of an association between hoarding and schizotypy, but the role hyperactive agency detection plays in the development of hoarding remains unclear.

          "abstract": "People's subjective conceptions of truth and honesty have undergone significant changes in recent decades. Parts of society increasingly favour the sincere expression of personal belief,\nhowever inaccurate, over verifiable facts. This trend has been accompanied by increasing norm violations by political elites which have been identified as a significant contributor to democratic backsliding. Those two trends highlight the need for a thorough examination of the nexus between norm violations and conceptions of honesty. We present a series of preregistered studies that examined the conditions under which people acquiesce to democratic norm violations and politicians’ dishonesty. We find that when participants are asked to take a perspective of honesty that emphasises sincerity over accuracy, which we call ``belief-speaking'', they are more willing to accept norm violations by politicians than if participants take a perspective that emphasizes accuracy as a criterion for honesty, which we call ``fact-speaking''. When a fictitious politician is presented as telling untruths, tolerance of norm violations is reduced compared to when the politician is presented as truthful. The findings highlight the need to develop a better understanding of how individuals interpret and respond to political leaders’ behaviours, especially within the evolving landscape of  perception and the ensuing threats to democratic stability.",

          "abstract": "Individual family members impact each other and the family system at the physiological, brain, behavioral, phenomenological, and social level. Previous research used established methods, such as self-report and behavioral observation, to provide thorough insights into family dynamics. Here, we aim to complement existing methods and argue for a neurocognitive approach in family research. Neurocognitive tools can provide detailed and nuanced insights into complex family dynamics by capturing behavioral and brain processes at the individual and family level. By measuring neural activity and the alignment of brain activity between family members we can uncover complex recurrent and situation-dependent interactions that so far have remained hidden. Using this approach, we can increase the scope of family research, especially when measuring family members across generations with different levels of verbal ability. It allows to study emotionally interconnected family members across multiple generations. Measuring behavior and brain activity of multiple family members simultaneously is therefore a promising method to reveal additional factors contributing to family well-being and inform theory and practice. As mobile neuroimaging advances, studying family interactions in natural settings, such as the family home, becomes more feasible. This opens new possibilities for family research while simultaneously increasing ecological validity. The neurocognitive approach allows us to understand known and unknown factors contributing to family dynamics and brings a mechanistic understanding closer to “home”.",

          "authors": "Heidrun Schultz; Roland Georg Benoit",
          "abstract": "Humans tend to discount the value of delayed rewards. As a consequence, they forego larger long-term benefits (e.g., €29 in 91 days) in favor of smaller short-term gains (e.g., €20 now). Episodic future thinking (EFT) attenuates such delay discounting. That is, people are more likely to choose a larger but delayed reward after imagining an episode at the future time point (e.g., a café visit in 91 days). We here elucidate the underlying mechanism by examining the temporal specificity of this effect. Does EFT foster farsighted decisions in general by shifting the mental focus towards the future, or does it specifically influence decisions in favor of the imagined time point? In two experiments (n=84 total) we systematically varied the concordance between the imagined time point and the delay at which the larger reward could be received. When these time points matched, we replicated the beneficial effect of EFT (Experiments 1 and 2). Critically, when the imagined time point matched the sooner of two delayed choice options, the effect was reversed: Choices became more impulsive (Experiment 1). When the imagined delay was double the delay of the larger option, the effect was not significant and numerically lower than when the delays matched (Experiment 2). Notably, more vivid imaginations were associated with more farsighted choices at longer delays, irrespective of whether the imagined time point matched the delayed choice. Together, the data demonstrate that both temporally specific and unspecific mechanisms contribute to the impact of EFT on delay discounting.",

          "abstract": "Producing coherent discourse requires us to regulate the content of our speech and avoid interference from discourse-irrelevant concepts that become active in semantic memory.

However, existing evidence in support of this view is correlational. We performed an experimental test of the hypothesis by asking young (18-25) and older (70-90) participants to produce discourse on a range of topics while attending to two types of visual distractors: images of meaningful concepts and meaningless abstract patterns. The overall global coherence of responses was lower when participants were distracted (cf. no distraction) but this effect was not larger for meaningful distractors. Participants also spoke more slowly under distraction. These effects did not differ between age groups. Critically, however, in the meaningful distractor condition, responses diverged from the original topic more quickly than in the other conditions. This effect was only present in older participants. These results suggest two underlying effects at play. First, performing a concurrent task has a general effect on the speed and coherence of discourse, which in this study was age-invariant. Second, for older people, tasks that activate a series of irrelevant semantic representations have an additional cumulative effect on discourse content, causing it to deviate off topic more rapidly. Our results support the inhibitory deficit hypothesis and suggest that older people can improve their coherence by avoiding semantically-laden environmental distractors like TV or radio programmes.",

Second, for older people, tasks that activate a series of irrelevant semantic representations have an additional cumulative effect on discourse content, causing it to deviate off topic more rapidly. Our results support the inhibitory deficit hypothesis and suggest that older people can improve their coherence by avoiding semantically-laden environmental distractors like TV or radio programmes.",

          "authors": "Alina Koppold; Mana R Ehlers; Alexandros Kastrinogiannis; Felix H. Klaassen; Karin Roelofs; Tina B Lonsdorf",
          "abstract": "In the face of threat, defensive circuits are activated to ensure survival. In this context, freezing-like behavior has been linked to action preparation. However, the disruption of action preparation by aversive unpredictable stimuli that are difficult to learn, discriminate, or predict remains poorly understood. Here we present a paradigm which is intended to capture the action preparation mechanism under conditions of (temporal) threat predictability, unpredictability and safety. In a multimethod approach, we combine human postural sway and cardiac responding as proxies for freezing-like behavior in humans. Additionally, we use skin conductance levels, electromyographic startle responses, behavioral task performance as well as subjective ratings as further outcome measures. Results from a large sample (n = 235) revealed, on a behavioral level, faster reaction times at the expense of accuracy in threat conditions as compared to no threat conditions. During action preparation under threat, parasympathetically-driven postural freezing-like behavior but also sympathetically-driven increased skin conductance levels as compared to safety were observed. Crucially, our results suggest that the (un)predictability of a threat does not modulate threat-induced freezing-like behavior or skin conductance levels during action preparation. Moreover, we observed startle inhibition during all conditions (threat, safety) as compared to startle responses in the inter-trial interval. In sum, action preparation under threat is associated with the increased co-activation of the parasympathetic (postural freezing) and sympathetic nervous system (skin conductance), converging with animal models on the defensive mechanism of freezing-like behavior. Our findings suggest that threat predictability does not modulate freezing-like behavior, as temporal unpredictability did not trigger distinct defensive responses from those triggered by predictable threats. This implies that preparatory mechanisms may serve as a generalized defensive response, prioritizing readiness over specificity in the face of potential threats in humans. These findings challenge existing models that emphasize differential responses based on predictability and contribute to a better understanding of how humans adapt to unpredictable threats, which is crucial for refining theories of defensive behavior and informing clinical approaches to anxiety and threat-related disorders.",

          "abstract": "Psychological and neuroscientific research has traditionally prioritized internal validity and experimental control, often at the expense of ecological and external validity. This imbalance has produced models of moral cognition that may not reflect how moral decisions unfold in real-world, socially embedded contexts. In this perspective paper, we argue that the lack of attention to ecological and external validity limits the generalizability and relevance of findings—particularly in moral psychology, where decisions are deeply shaped by cultural and interpersonal dynamics. We highlight how variables such as social influence, environments and populations are regularly overlooked when moral cognition is studied in traditional settings, constraining our understanding of the factors influencing (im)moral behavior. Based on recent proof-of-concept studies, we propose actionable solutions to integrate naturalistic environments and diverse populations without sacrificing methodological rigor, calling for a more balanced approach to validity that better captures human moral behavior in its full complexity. We also propose a self-reflection table that researchers from all fields can use to openly reflect on the external and ecological validity of their experimental paradigms.",

          "abstract": "The PERMA-Profiler is a self-report instrument designed to assess personal psychological well-being, including PERMA (Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment). Despite consistent validation of its descriptive utility and latent five-factor measurement structure, debates persist regarding the distinctiveness and incremental validity of these dimensions. This study applied multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to evaluate the instrument’s between-item multidimensionality and the functioning of its 11-point rating scale using Category Boundary Discriminations (CBDs). Data represented a culturally diverse sample (N = 2,337), including several previously published datasets. Results indicated that a Rasch-compliant MIRT model did not fit, raising questions about the scientific validity of observed mean or sum scores. Attempts to model the intended five-factor PERMA structure were unsuccessful. This appears to stem from unmodeled latent factor associations, which in turn led to inflated residuals, likely reflecting convergence issues caused by generally high correlations among items and factors. Local stochastic dependencies within Meaning also emerged, which may have systematically inflated previously reported reliability and validity indices.These dependencies suggested that the globally framed item M1 might need revision. Analyses of the 11-point rating scale revealed that participants predominantly used the upper end of the scale, with categories 5 through 10 accounting for 84% of responses, suggesting redundancy of response categories. Categories from 0 to 3 therefore showed minimal incremental discrimination. Reducing the number of response categories, and experimenting with alternative labeling and scale formats, could enhance measurement precision and discrimination.",

This position paper explores how AI-driven evaluation models, particularly those leveraging MIDI data, can enhance music pedagogy by providing real-time assessments, improving accessibility to quality instruction, and supporting self-directed learning. Drawing from existing research on AI-assisted music evaluation and listener satisfaction prediction, we highlight AI’s role in complementing traditional teaching methods. This position paper also examines the challenges of AI adoption in music education, including interpretative limitations and the necessity for high-quality training data.

          "abstract": "Multivariate time series models are commonly used in psychology to investigate person-specific associations between multiple variables. They are often represented and interpreted as dynamic network models, where features such as the centrality of nodes can potentially guide treatment selection and outcome prediction. Researchers typically rely on point estimates of specific network features while ignoring estimation uncertainty, which can lead to wrong inferences and over-optimistic claims.  We introduce a one-step Bayesian approach for estimating multilevel vector autoregressive models (BmlVAR), which enables uncertainty quantification for person-specific network features and the regression of external outcomes on such features. In a preregistered simulation study, we compare the new model with several popular methods for network estimation. We also apply all methods to empirical data to highlight their differences. Our simulation results indicate that all methods perform mediocrely in estimating different centrality measures in practically relevant settings. BmlVAR still outperforms the other methods in many simulation conditions, especially regarding the statistical power to detect associations with an outcome. However, estimating the model properly can be challenging with limited data. Overall, all methods require a lot of data or very large effects to produce reasonably accurate results. Thus, although centrality measures based on dynamic networks have been widely used, our simulation study suggests they are unlikely to work well for achieving major goals of interest, such as guiding treatment selection and outcome prediction. We provide a new model that incorporates estimation uncertainty into the modelling process, thereby protecting against premature conclusions.",

          "authors": "Kyoshiro Sasaki; Fumiya Yonemitsu; Yuki Yamada",
          "abstract": "The concept of emotional valence’s association with vertical space in cognition (i.e., the vertical-valence metaphor) posits that positive and negative emotions are metaphorically linked to upward and downward directions, respectively. Previous research has demonstrated that participants tend to rate the word “up” more positively than “down.” Furthermore, the vertical-valence metaphor was observed in a cursor-positioning task, where positive words (e.g., “joy”) were placed at higher vertical positions than negative words (e.g., “sadness”), with neutral words (e.g., “surprise”) in intermediate positions. The present study explored whether a similar metaphorical link exists within the artificial intelligence system ChatGPT-4. In Experiment 1, ChatGPT-4 evaluated “up” and “down” using a seven-point scale (1: very unpleasant, 7: very pleasant), with “up” receiving a significantly higher score than “down.” Experiment 2 tasked ChatGPT-4 with positioning the words “joy,” “surprise,” and “sadness” on an XY coordinate plane (X: -10 = left, 10 = right; Y: -10 = down, 10 = up). The results indicated that “joy” was positioned higher than “sadness,” with “surprise” placed between them. In Experiment 3, this word allocation bias persisted even when the coordinate values were reversed (X: -10 = right, 10 = left; Y: -10 = up, 10 = down). These findings closely parallel human cognitive processes related to the vertical-valence metaphor. Therefore, this suggests that the metaphor may have spontaneously developed as a byproduct of training on extensive text data—demonstrating an emergent property of language processing in ChatGPT-4.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI has not broken higher education; it has revealed the fractures that were already there. This paper argues that traditional pedagogies (i.e., those anchored in formalist epistemologies) are structurally misaligned with the demands of a world saturated by thinking machines. Blending systems analysis with epistemological critique, the paper introduces three critical frameworks: epistemic laundering, the epistemological vector space, and the cognitive ecology (a multimodal model of reasoning that maps how symbolic, conceptual, and contextual cognition interact in real-world learning). Together, these frameworks expose the incoherence of legacy educational models and offer a new basis for instructional design. From this foundation, the paper proposes Critical AI Literacy as a pedagogical response that pairs epistemic awareness with technical fluency. It also outlines practical strategies to integrate GenAI responsibly into learning environments: RAG tutors, cognitive partnerships, interactive content generation, and adaptive skill-gap training. Ultimately, GenAI is framed not as a threat, but as a mirror: reflecting the need to move beyond performance metrics toward adaptive, agentive, and epistemically aligned education.",

          "abstract": "How, and for whom, do political events translate into enduring political change? This article proposes a two-stage model of generational imprinting, where identity-congenial cues determine whether individuals update their political attitudes in the immediate aftermath of a political shock, while life-course position determines whether that change is persistent or not. Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests as a quasi-natural experiment, I test this model by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans using three surveys that collectively span from 2016 to 2022. I show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement in response to the killing of George Floyd. However, these effects persisted among younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization. This article thus integrates two classic—though largely partial—theories of political learning, providing a framework for understanding how episodic shocks can realign political divides across generations.",

However, the question of how international constraints on national autonomy shape national identities is so far under-investigated. This paper uses the European sovereign debt crisis as a case for investigating whether externally imposed constraints on fiscal political autonomy, typically contested decisions, solidify or weaken national solidarity. Using data from 1983-2021, I find that the imposition of austerity led to a strengthening of national identities immediately after the austerity packages were agreed. This effect was strongest in Southern Europe, where austerity had the largest social impact and constituted the greatest break with pre-existing national policy preferences. I find evidence that the strengthening of exclusively national self-identification after the imposition of austerity was most likely driven by an increased perception of economic threat in the austerity countries, rather than shifting evaluations of EU membership.",

Recognizing the limitations of traditional medical education in fostering these skills, the study explores the potential of XR-enhanced blended learning to create immersive and interactive learning environments. A clinical thinking blended learning mode incorporating XR technology was designed and implemented. The effectiveness of this mode was evaluated by comparing the clinical thinking skills of students exposed to it with those receiving traditional instruction. Student engagement, satisfaction, and perceived learning outcomes within the XR-integrated environment were also assessed. Findings indicate that the XR-integrated blended learning mode significantly improves clinical thinking skills, including diagnostic reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Students demonstrated higher levels of engagement and satisfaction, attributing their enhanced learning to specific XR features such as interactive simulations and personalized feedback. The study identifies key factors contributing to the success of XR-integrated blended learning and proposes a framework for designing and evaluating such interventions in medical education. The implications of this research suggest that XR-integrated blended learning offers a promising approach to enhance medical education, addressing limitations of traditional methods and promoting the development of essential clinical competencies.",

Students were divided into two groups: students who used AI writing tools regularly and students who wrote without AI. Data were collected through essay writing tasks, student questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and instructor feedback. Every subject wrote two essays, which were assessed for grammaticality, lexical diversity (measured in terms of the type-token ratio and vocabulary density), and coherence (based on rubric-based discourse analysis). Instructor feedback provided qualitative scores of writing depth and originality. Outcomes indicate that writing with AI significantly reduces grammatical errors, enhances vocabulary range, and promotes text cohesion by using programmed hints at linkages. However, there are serious concerns about the passive acceptance of AI suggestions by students that can compromise cognitive effort and critical thinking. There were instances when AI-produced work led to robotic sentence structure and formulaic arrangement. Teachers stressed the need for a pedagogical balance with AI tools without compromising students’ ability to write independently. The report concludes that, while AI can be a good writing tool, it should never be a substitute for but only a supplement to traditional writing pedagogy.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancement of technology in recent years has greatly impacted how second language (L2) learners write argumentative essays. Language learners now have instant access to artificial intelligence writing tools like Quill Bot, Jeni AI, and others. This necessitates that institutions re-assess their methods of teaching argumentative essay writing. This research aims to assess how effective it is to mentor students to write argumentative essays using AI-powered writing tools compared to the traditional approach. The researcher gathered data over a semester and compared the performance of the groups. This quasi-experimental study consisted of two experimental groups: experimental Group One (E1), which primarily utilized AI-powered writing tools, and Experimental Group 2 ( E2) which blended the usage of AI tools with a traditional method. In contrast, the control group just employed traditional methods to teach students the skill of crafting persuasive essays. This study discovered that the integration of conventional methods with AI-driven tools significantly improved writing competency and the long-term retention of argumentative writing abilities. This study indicates that second language learners attain optimal learning outcomes by combining traditional teaching techniques with AI-driven technologies. Language educators should thoroughly analyze these findings, particularly in the present period characterized by the prevalence of artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool, integrated across various sectors. In education, AI has generated significant excitement among students for its potential to enhance learning experiences. However, concerns about overreliance on AI temper this enthusiasm, as it may undermine the development of critical thinking skills. Numerous studies have highlighted the risks associated with students’ excessive use of generative AI (GAI) in academic tasks, noting its potential to diminish cognitive abilities. However, the optimal use of AI to enhance students’ critical thinking skills remains under-researched. Therefore, this study seeks to answer the question: How does generative AI influence students’ critical thinking, self-efficacy, and decision-making? This study aims to explore the synergic relationship between human intelligence and artificial intelligence in augmenting essential thinking skills among students and building upon their existing cognitive resources through self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. Specifically, it explores the cause-and-effect connections among GAI, self-efficacy, decision-making, learning motivation, and critical thinking skills. A quantitative methodology used an online questionnaire to collect responses from 165 undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral students. Statistical analyses, including bootstrapping techniques, were conducted to examine direct and indirect effects. The results revealed that GAI has a significant positive influence on self-efficacy, learning motivation, decision-making, and critical thinking skills. In turn, self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making significantly impact critical thinking skills. The mediating results indicated that GAI can indirectly boost students’ critical thinking by enhancing self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. This suggests that AI capabilities can transform the cognitive learning process.",

This symbolical transfer of technologies of cognitive and neurosciences are demonstrating exemplarily a new form of artistic research and art in play. The piece as sculptural artefact, as toy, as “objeto de juego” investigates new ways of addressing environmentalism, democracy and the relationship between society and collective cooperative acting. Our artpiece features two radical approaches: 1. A fundamental change of between the roles of “citizen” and “scientist” and “artist” and “researcher”. 2. Players’ roles are mirrored in a visualization of the captured image, of mindclouds made of braindata of the artist, that is allowed to be changed through the play of the visitors. This means that each art biennale visitor can become an activist player potentially manipulating thoughts or “mindclouds” during the game.

Drawing on social cognition theory, it examines how AI use influences the perceived warmth of public servants and the acceptability of decision-making. It distinguishes between two settings in the education system that differ regarding how directly citizens are affected by AI use, a teacher using AI to help assess students and a public servant allocating funds among schools. The analysis is based on a pre-registered vignette experiment and a sample of 4,569 participants from Norway. It finds that AI use decreases both the perceived warmth and competence of public servants, that these evaluations negatively bear on the overall acceptability of decision-making, and that the effect of AI use is stronger for public servants more directly interacting with citizens. The findings have important implications for the legitimacy of public organizations.",

Drawing from postcolonial theory, intersectionality, and migration studies, the paper interrogates how colonial legacies, cultural codes of honour, and intra-community dynamics have created an environment where abuse is simultaneously endemic and unspoken. The piece critiques the lack of statistical visibility, the role of collective denial, and the weaponisation of ‘honour’ to protect abusers while silencing victims. It argues for urgent cultural and institutional reckoning, internal accountability, and survivor-centred advocacy within British Pakistani communities.",

          "abstract": "Will the race for advanced artificial intelligence (AI) make war more likely? If technology futurists are right that the advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) will radically alter the global balance of power, could AGI development tempt states to resort to war to secure those advantages for themselves or to deny them to their rivals? In this working paper, we develop a framework of variables that shape preventive war risks and consider how these variables apply to AGI development. By AGI, we mean advanced artificial intelligence that can match or exceed human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. This working paper evaluates AGI’s implications from a political rather than a technical perspective. That is, if rapid technological progress toward AGI continues, what are the political implications for international stability? Drawing from three scenarios for how preventive pressures could potentially manifest as preventive wars, the analysis suggests that the probability of war is low in absolute terms. But preventive war appears relatively more likely to occur in an attempt to preserve a monopoly on AGI than to prevent one.",

This meant that each jurisdiction had to respond in its own way to the many challenges posed to the very fabric of established legal and political relationships. This chapter looks at the fascinating histories which have existed between the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories and the UK, how these histories went to shape their EU relationships with Europe and what this meant for the Brexit trade agenda and its outcomes.

          "abstract": "Abortion has been found to be severely underreported overall, and underreported differentially across groups, when using a direct question. The list-experiment method attempts to overcome these reporting biases indirectly by asking how many items an individual has experienced, but not which, where abortion is one of the items asked to a randomly-assigned ‘treatment’ group but not to a control group. Abortion incidence is estimated as the difference in the mean number of items reported between the treatment and control groups. If list-experiment respondents are also asked a direct abortion question, a combined-data estimator can be constructed from respondents with and without affirmative responses to the direct question. We assess for four U.S. states how this combined estimator may improve estimation of cumulative lifetime abortion incidence relative to the direct question or the list experiment alone. Our combined-data estimate across the four states is 12.9% (95% CI: 10.5, 15.4), which is substantively and statistically higher than both the list-experiment estimate (11.0%, CI: 8.9, 13.2) and the direct-question estimate (9.6%, CI: 8.6, 10.5). Bias by state is much more variable for the direct question than for the list experiment. We conclude that the combined-data estimator improves estimation especially over the direct question.",

          "abstract": "This study highlights how better demographic measurement more accurately informs public policymakers. In this era of renewed and more vigorous efforts to clear people experiencing unsheltered homelessness (unsheltered PEH) from city sidewalks, parks, and elsewhere, elected officials and other stakeholders need to clearly understand the dynamics of their unsheltered PEH populations. To advance understanding, this study investigated in-migration of unsheltered PEH in conjunction with the Los Angeles Continuum of Care’s 2024 HUD-mandated Point-in-Time count. In response to the measurement work of Mitchell (2024), the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s 2024 Demographic Survey of unsheltered PEH instrument included a new item distinguishing between perceptions of a place where one has lived versus stayed, which revealed whether in-migration of individuals and families coming to the area immediately experienced homelessness or became unhoused after relocation. This analysis of over one-thousand survey participants self-identified as having migrated into Los Angeles County (a quarter of the total sample of unsheltered PEH) also explored whether there were associations with first-time homelessness or with being accompanied by household members. Responses to this complex survey were analyzed using Stata 17 MP. Key findings include that most survey participants reported either arriving homeless and unsheltered or first staying in either their own or a friend’s or family member’s home. More than half of all in-migration was initially to housed situations (more so for first-time homelessness), not into homelessness. Lone adults were more likely to experience homelessness immediately while accompanied adults were most likely to first stay in someone else’s home.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPopulation forecasts produced by governments at all levels are used in the public sector, the private sector, and by researchers. They have been primarily produced using deterministic methods.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe propose to show how a method for producing measures of uncertainty can be applied to existing subnational population forecasts while meeting several important criteria, including the concept of utility. We will assess the efficacy of our method by: (1) examining the change in uncertainty intervals it produces by population size and growth rate; and (2) comparing the width and temporal change of the uncertainty intervals it produces to the width and temporal change of uncertainty intervals produced by a Bayesian approach.\n\nMETHODS\nOur approach follows the logic of the Espenshade-Tayman method for producing confidence intervals in conjunction with ARIMA equations to construct a probabilistic interval around the total populations forecasted from the Cohort Component Method, the typical approach used by demographers.\n\nRESULTS\nPopulation size and growth rate are related to the width of the forecast intervals, with size being the stronger predictor, and the intervals from the proposed method are not dissimilar to those produced by a Bayesian approach.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis approach is well-suited to generating probabilistic subnational population forecasts in the United States and elsewhere where these forecasts are routinely produced. It has a higher level of utility, is simpler, and is more accessible to those tasked with producing measures of uncertainty around population forecasts.",

          "abstract": "Population aging is largely due to increased longevity coupled with low fertility, a result of completing the demographic transition. In the initial stage, control of epidemic and contagious diseases lowers the death rate, which leads to rapid population growth because fertility rates remain high until the modernization process leads to factors that suppress fertility. This framework is used in a first-ever examination of the future of population aging in the Western Hemisphere and its four regions, The Caribbean, Central America, North America, and South America. Although there is variation across the regions, the population aged 65 years and over is expected to more than double between 2020 and 2050. Coinciding with the expected increases in the older population are decreases in both the pre-school and the school age populations. These demographic changes will place increasing and competing demands not only on the public and private sectors, but also on families.",

Drawing on affective polarization research, we highlight the central role of identification and emotions in shaping political in-groups and out-groups. Moving beyond conventional measures of cross-group resentment, we conceptualize polarization as the lived experience of political antagonism. We argue that polarization materializes through struggles for recognition, shaped by the perception and processing of political conflict as it circulates through public communication channels. Adopting a performance-theoretical lens, we connect the symbolic language, emotions, and misrecognition in micropolarization to the broader public drama of political conflict. Using interview data on family and friendship disputes related to COVID-19 vaccination denial in the UK and Germany, we examine how public conflicts manifest in interpersonal relationships. This study suggests a research agenda that explores interactional dynamics across online and offline spaces, diverse social groups, and varying levels of relational involvement, offering a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of political polarization.",

Understanding patterns of discontinuation can inform policies and practices to reduce unmet need for family planning and therefore promote gender equity and maternal and infant health. In this paper, we explore seasonal contraceptive patterns in Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Nepal using the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) contraceptive calendar from the most recent survey in each country prior to Covid-19. Specifically, we investigate contraceptive discontinuation associated with major holidays – times when women may travel or health facilities may close. Even after accounting for recall bias, major holidays appear to drive contraceptive discontinuation in a subset of countries and could serve as a powerful point for intervention.",

          "abstract": "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has postulated that international migrant stocks fell short of their pre-pandemic projections by nearly 2 million due to travel restrictions. However, this is not testable with migration data from traditional sources. Key migration stakeholders, have called for using data from alternative sources, including social media, to fill in these gaps. Building on previous work using social media data to analyze migration responses to external shocks, we test the hypothesis that COVID-related travel restrictions reduced migrant stock relative to expected migration without such restrictions using estimates of migrants drawn from Facebook’s advertising platform and dynamic panel models. We focus four key origin countries in North and West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire, Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal), and their 23 key destination countries. Between February and June 2020, we estimate that a destination country implementing a month-long total entry ban on arrivals from Côte d’Ivoire, Algeria, Morocco, or Senegal might have expected a 3.39% reduction in migrant stock from the restricted country compared with the counterfactual in which no travel restrictions were implemented. However, when broader societal disruptions of the pandemic are accounted for, we estimate that countries implementing travel restrictions might paradoxically have expected an increase in migrant stock. In this context, travel restrictions do not appear to have effectively curbed migration and could have resulted in outcomes opposite their intended effects.",

          "abstract": "Migration lawyers exercise political agency: in choosing which clients to represent and how to present their claims to bureaucrats and judges, lawyers shape what the governance of migration looks like in practice. In 2022, we interviewed 16 lawyers specialized in Dutch family migration law, inquiring how they see their own roles vis-à-vis the state, how they address cultural differences in what counts as “family”, and how they handle suspicions of fraud.  The variety in approaches we observed clearly reveals that family migration lawyers are far from neutral, apolitical actors. Personal convictions informed professional practice, even among lawyers who eschewed activist “cause lawyering”.  While our respondents all believed some or many elements of the migration regime should change and sought to exercise pressure through their legal practices, they all also acted as gatekeepers of the current migration regime – partly out of conviction, partly because they believed they can best (or only) support their clients by playing by the rules of the game. Building on the scholarship on lawyers’ professional ethics, I argue that everyday migration lawyering involves a form of moral activism oriented towards social change that – perhaps inevitably and often reluctantly – also involves gatekeeping.",

We propose a structural approach emphasizing how shifts in communication patterns between extreme and moderate groups affect the prevalence of extremist language, including hate speech. Our findings suggest that reducing network echo fosters linguistic accommodation, leading focal groups to linguistically align with outgroups. Critically, this effect is double-edged: increased contact with radical groups prompts moderate users to adopt more extreme discourse, whereas diminishing isolation from moderate groups decreases extremist language, challenging conventional wisdom that dismantling echo chambers merely redistributes extremist dialogue rather than reducing it. We discuss implications for research on echo chambers, policy and platform strategies aimed at mitigating extremism online, and the interplay of structure and language.",

However, evidence on the interaction between genetic propensity\nfor high body mass index (BMI) and family SES remains inconclusive. This study investigates\nwhether genetic associations with BMI diﬀer among individuals from high-SES versus low-SES\nfamilies and whether these associations vary across the life course. Drawing on the\ncompensatory advantage model in sociology and the diathesis-stress model in psychology, I\ntest the hypothesis that genetic associations with BMI are stronger among individuals from\nsocioeconomically disadvantaged families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), I assess the association between a polygenic index\nfor BMI (BMI PGI) and BMI at four life stages: adolescence (≃ 16), early adulthood (≃ 22),\nadulthood (≃ 28), and later adulthood (≃ 37). Consistent with theoretical expectations, results\nshow that the BMI PGI is more predictive of BMI among individuals from low-SES families\nthan from high-SES families. The interaction weakens over the life course but persists among\nindividuals with high BMI levels. These findings suggest that high-SES families may buffer\ngenetic propensities for overweight and obesity, whereas low-SES environments may\nexacerbate them, increasing the risk of elevated BMI.

In this context of confidence, the EU approached human security distinctively through the decades of the 2000s and 2010s. There was an emphasis on multilateralism and the nurturing of new partnerships; on connecting global agendas and local needs; on combining instruments to manage multiple facets of crises; on aligning short-term and long-term approaches to building human security. Today, however, human security has suffered two backlashes. Firstly, the application of the concept has been difficult. In striving for an increasingly multidimensional, broad, and inclusive approach, the EU’s human security framework has weakened its edge and deferred tangible results. Secondly, a return of realpolitik in the European thinking of security has replaced peace and emancipation with militarised notions of security and defence. This paper not only argues that Europeans may have lost their moral backbone in foreign policy but also serves as a call to rethink and deepen security in EU policy thinking.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the impact of technology integration and systematic visitor feedback on improving tea tourism outcomes. Drawing on survey responses from 106 tea tourism stakeholders, we developed a composite measure of Tea Tourism Improvement (encompassing operational efficiency, service quality, and visitor satisfaction) and assessed its relationship with two key constructs: positive digital practices (e.g., enhanced online marketing, streamlined booking systems, and effective feedback utilization) and perceived barriers (e.g., limited internet access and the absence of a formal feedback process). An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) validated a two-factor structure with a high sampling adequacy (KMO = 0.893) and significant Bartlett’s Test (p &lt; 0.001), while the two factors collectively explained over 89% of the variance in tea tourism improvement. Subsequently, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that positive digital practices (Factor 1) have a strong positive influence (β = 0.929, p &lt; 0.001) on tourism improvement, whereas the barrier construct (Factor 2) is significantly negatively related (β = –0.171, p &lt; 0.001) to the same outcome. Residual diagnostics confirmed that the model assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were adequately met. The results underscore the critical role of digital transformation and structured feedback in enhancing tea tourism, while also highlighting the importance of addressing infrastructural and procedural barriers. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported measures. Future research should consider longitudinal approaches and incorporate objective performance metrics.",

          "abstract": "Many parts of the world are experiencing widespread social and political instability, as well as ongoing climatic changes that are expected to worsen in the years and decades ahead. These changes can undermine child health and development through multiple pathways, and the increasing frequency of these shocks increases the likelihood that individuals are exposed to two or more stressors simultaneously. Empirical evidence about the potential impacts of such cooccurring shocks on children’s health has been limited to date, despite strong conceptual motivations for such analysis. We address this gap in the current study by measuring the independent and compounding effects of conflict and climate exposures on the weight-for-height (WHZ) of 0-23 month-old children across 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (n=188,558). To do so, we combine georeferenced records from the Demographic and Health Surveys, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, and the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation/Temperature dataset. We then fit regression models to measure the independent and interactive effects of conflict and climate exposures, to explore heterogeneity across social groups, and to assess the robustness of these main results to measurement and modeling decisions. The results indicate that heat independently undermines children’s health, but conflict exposures are only marginally associated with reductions in WHZ when averaged across the sample. However, conflict exposures are associated with substantively large and statistically significant reductions in WHZ when they occur in contexts experiencing unusually hot temperatures. These results may indicate that heat-stress-affected populations may be especially vulnerable to the health impacts of conflict. These impacts are also heterogeneous across social groups, and indicate that children born to less-educated mothers and in urban areas may be most vulnerable to conflict and climate exposures.",

          "abstract": "This study examines consumer attitudes toward refillable and reusable packaging across 22 product categories through a novel three-dimensional measurement approach. By simultaneously assessing willingness to use refillable packaging, likelihood of choosing it over single-use alternatives, and intention to actively seek refill stations, we quantify the value-action gap in sustainable packaging adoption. Results from 441 North American respondents reveal that despite moderate to high willingness (M=3.09), behavioral intentions decline significantly for likelihood (M=2.17) and active engagement (M=1.66). This gap varies substantially across product categories, with food staples demonstrating the smallest gaps and personal care products the largest. Cluster analysis identified four distinct category groupings with different adoption potentials. Hierarchical regression analyses explain 53.2% of the variance in the value-action gap, with convenience barriers (β=0.38), convenience orientation (β=0.38), and hygiene concerns (β=0.32) emerging as the strongest predictors. Environmental attitudes significantly predict willingness but become progressively less influential for behavioral intentions.

          "abstract": "At similar performance levels, socio-economically advantaged students typically choose more demanding and prestigious educational paths than their less advantaged peers. Such secondary effects are often studied in school continuation decisions or track choice but may also manifest in school choice, offering an alternative avenue for parental influence in education. This study\nexamines secondary effects in school choice, and the role of social capital – resources embedded in peer and parental networks in primary school – in these patterns within the context of the Netherlands. I rely on linked sociometric and full-population register data for Dutch students who have recently transitioned to secondary school. Hypotheses are tested using fixed effects regression\nmodels to account for (self-)selection into primary school. Results indicate that secondary school choice is socially stratified: Students from higher socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds tend to avoid pre-vocational schools, prefer pre-university schools, and opt for heterogeneous classes at intermediate performance levels. There is limited evidence for the relation between social\ncapital and the type of school chosen. A notable exception is that lower SES students are less likely to enroll in pre-vocational schools if their parents are integrated into resource-rich networks in primary school, suggesting that such networks may play a compensatory role by discouraging decisions that hinder upward-track mobility.",

          "abstract": "This systematic literature review explores the role of citizen science (CS) in fostering sustainable urban transformation and urban sustainability. Our findings indicate a significant surge in academic interest, especially between 2022 and 2024, highlighting the growing recognition of CS as a valuable approach to urban sustainability. Using a tool for constructing and visualising bibliometric networks, VOSviewer, we identified three primary thematic clusters: (1) biodiversity, ecology, and conservation; (2) methodologies and practices; and (3) humans and communities. These clusters underscore the diverse contributions of CS, ranging from environmental monitoring to participatory urban planning or community-based research. The review identifies established topics, particularly in biodiversity and conservation, where CS initiatives focus on species monitoring, conservation efforts, and food production. Emerging trends point to interdisciplinary CS applications, integrating community science and citizen engagement, public and environmental health and climate change studies to address complex sustainability challenges. However, underdeveloped niches remain, particularly in the integration of CS with policymaking, the inclusion of underserved or disadvantaged communities in sustainability research and the framing of the later studies within an environmental and climate justice perspectives. This review highlights CS potential to address the complexity of sustainable urban development and urban sustainability challenges, promoting inclusive participation and orienting the effort to actionable solutions. Future trends are likely to further emphasize community science, citizen engagement, and the intersection of human health and climate change.",

In this paper, we revisit the claim that support for taboo weapons is driven by the logic of external threats, now that individuals are more familiar with artificial intelligence and the international environment has grown more uncertain. In our study, we probe public attitudes toward both the development of LAWs and international cooperation to address the risks. Based on original survey data from 2,500 respondents in the US, we provide an observational as well as an experimental analysis. Observationally, general support for AI and favorable views of militarism and US hegemony as well as perceived competition from other countries are highly correlated with support for the use of lethal AI-weapons. Experimentally, we show that information that rivals or allies are already developing such weapons increases support for LAWs. Additionally, we find that competition from other countries does not influence support for global cooperation to limit AI on the battlefield. Overall, our analysis supports the idea that concerns for security have the power to override opposition to these taboo weapons.",

Through Google Scholar, we identified documents published between 2020 and 2024, selecting 29 reports by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, First Draft, Meedan, Public Good Projects, and the EU Disinfo Lab, and 13 articles authored by their directors or research directors. \n\nAcross the data, the proposed policy solutions consisted of tracking, managing and suppressing any COVID-relevant expression perceived as undermining the official policy response. It followed that the “problem” was represented to be these expressions, or rather, individuals producing them, framed as threatening science, democracy and even human survival. NGOs also positioned themselves as experts in an emerging scientific field, infodemiology, thus equipped to evaluate all forms of communication according to their own or similar experts' standards. Notably, none of the documents engaged with the substance of opposing viewpoints or disconfirming evidence, dismissing them almost entirely via authority, ad populum, or ad hominem fallacies. We conclude that, rather than defending science, democracy, or human survival, these NGOs and their partners are undermining the open, respectful, and inclusive debate essential to support these values.",

          "abstract": "This document presents a framework analyzing subject behavior within contexts characterized by functional dependency on external entities or systems. Central to this framework is a Descriptive Model stating that affirming an entity's existence and perceived functional value often sustains or is necessitated by functional dependency; the alignment between this dependency-state and the subject's interpretation of integrity generates pressure towards allowance or disallowance, whose behavioral manifestation is significantly shaped by the dependency's intensity, perceived action-costs, and external constraints. The analysis identifies four Fundamental Prerequisites necessary for the operation of this model: (FP1) Capacity for Internal Representation, (FP2) Capacity for Internal Evaluation, (FP3) Capacity for Directed Interaction, and (FP4) Structure Permitting External Relation. The specific Conditions of Possibility entailed by each Fundamental Prerequisite for its non-arbitrary functioning are detailed. The document demonstrates the logical construction of the Descriptive Model from these Prerequisites and Conditions. Furthermore, it provides an exploration of the core concepts integral to the model, examining their dimensions and interconnections within the described dynamic, and notes points pertinent to the framework's scope and granularity. The presentation focuses on the structural components and logical relationships within the outlined framework.",

          "abstract": "Background: Effective communication is critical for equitable healthcare delivery. In situations where there is language discordance between patients and providers, with one person speaking a shared language more proficiently, communication challenges may exacerbate disparities, particularly for racially or ethnically minoritized patients. Even when patients and providers are both fluent enough in English to not need interpretation, communication challenges intensify when patients are required to use their second language (L2) to interact with a native English (L1) speaking healthcare provider. Communication accommodation encompasses speech adjustments used to mitigate these barriers. Because communication accommodation strategies are not explicitly taught in health care training, it is unknown which adjustments healthcare providers use or the role a patient’s L2 proficiency plays in guiding provider language choices. \nMethods: This experimental study tested how L1 physician assistant students modify their communication during intake interviews with Latine L2 avatar patients of varying English proficiency, using the mixed-reality simulation platform Mursion. Data from 41 physician assistant students in 2023-2024 were analyzed for acoustic adjustments (i.e., speech rate, pitch modulation) and lexical adjustments (i.e., word frequency, contextual diversity). \nResults: Results revealed significant accommodations: students reduced their speech rate, narrowed their pitch range, and used higher-frequency vocabulary when interacting with lower-proficiency L2 avatars.  \nConclusion: The results demonstrate that communication accommodation occurs and could be a potential mechanism for the widening or narrowing of healthcare disparities in patient outcomes. Future work should consider identifying which accommodations improve patients’ comprehension of medical advice and their relationships with healthcare providers.",

This paper argues that traditional pedagogies, rooted in formalist epistemologies, are misaligned with the realities of a world mediated by thinking machines. Blending systems analysis with epistemological critique, it diagnoses higher education’s foundational incoherence and introduces two critical frameworks — epistemic laundering and epistemological vector space — to map and address this dissonance. Building on this foundation, the paper proposes Critical AI Literacy as a model that emphasizes epistemic awareness alongside technical fluency. It provides a structural analysis of GenAI’s limitations and outlines practical strategies including RAG tutors, cognitive partnerships, interactive content generation, and skill-gap training. Ultimately, this paper frames GenAI not as a disruptive threat, but as a catalyst for reimagining learning design, moving beyond performance-driven education toward authentic, adaptive expertise in a dynamic knowledge landscape.",

          "abstract": "This paper studies the rapid adoption of mechanical harvesting in São Paulo’s sugarcane industry between 2000 and 2010, following a law banning pre-harvest burning. Using land slope as an instrument for mechanization, we find that mechanization triggered structural transformation --- reducing agricultural and increasing manufacturing employment. However, labor reallocation occurred only in agriculture-related industries, not broadly across sectors. A one-standard-deviation increase in mechanization raised employment in linked manufacturing by 3.5 percentage points, primarily among unskilled workers. This shift generated substantial local economic gains: household incomes rose 19 percent, and poverty fell 14 percent. These findings challenge the view of structural transformation as a shift from agriculture to diverse industries. Instead, technological gains in farming strengthen sectoral linkages, deepening the agro-industrial economy rather than diversifying it. Our results also highlight how environmental regulation can shape industrialization by driving sectoral labor reallocation.",

          "abstract": "In this qualitative study, I have explored the debates about what entrepreneurial learning entails in a higher education setting. I have utilised a qualitative research method guided by the social learning theory and the critical social theory. I recruited participants among the academic staff across the Faculty of Engineering in Imperial College. I have adopted a broadly ethnographic approach, where the data collection was based on one-to-one semi-structured interviews with the participants. Through stimulated discussions, the participants reflected on their cultural experiences, identity development process, and the effectiveness of entrepreneurial learning methods. I have chosen interpretive phenomenological analysis as the methodology for qualitative study of the interview data. Experiential statements from each participant were categorised within themes. I performed cross-case analysis to identify the similarities and differences between each participants’ lived experiences to create clustered themes. Major experiential themes emerged from the study were the influence of upbringing, the effect of pursuing entrepreneurial activities on academic careers, and different approaches to entrepreneurial learning. The data revealed that the parenting style, role models, incentives and the external environment during the early years of identity development strongly influenced the propensity to grow an entrepreneurial mindset. Faculty members, who are predisposed to undertake entrepreneurial activities, showed self-efficacy to nurture their business skills by taking advantage of the resources available to exploit their inventions. The results indicate that academics prefer informal entrepreneurial learning approaches over formal trainings. Academics showed the desire to learn entrepreneurial skills and tacit knowledge through peer-to-peer interactions, experienced role models and industrial partners within a community of practice in higher education settings. The outcomes of this study contribute to the identification of implications for practice, educational policy development and the evidence-based development of inclusive learning and teaching strategies for entrepreneurial learning programmes.",

The findings highlight the French sinologists’ perspectives on defining Chinese words, the relationship between written and spoken language, and the syllabic and morphological features of Chinese word formation. Overall, their analysis of Chinese word formation was grounded in the Latin grammatical framework. However, they recognized that this approach did not fully capture the unique features of the Chinese language, as it was primarily motivated by pedagogical concerns. The discussion also explores the value of their contributions to the understanding of Chinese word formation and its place in the history of Chinese grammatical research.",

Peer-reviewed outputs were linked to preprints using data from Dimensions, OpenAlex, and Crossref, resulting in 2.2M peer-reviewed outputs linked to a preprint. Our findings indicate a strong growth in preprinting, with a nearly threefold increase in the number of preprints published between 2017 and 2022. The adoption of preprinting is highest in the physical and mathematical sciences, particularly among researchers in the Americas and Europe. In recent years, preprinting has also increased notably in the information and computing sciences and the life and medical sciences, driven primarily by researchers in North America and Western and Northern Europe. Preprinting remains relatively uncommon in the humanities and the social and behavioral sciences. Asia demonstrates low preprint adoption, with Eastern Asia showing a modest increase in recent years. Preprint adoption in specific disciplines varies significantly across regions, showing that preprint adoption is shaped by the interplay between disciplines and regions.",

          "abstract": "The Colombian Armed Conflict produced extensive patterns of homicide and enforced disappearance as armed actors employed strategies of terror to assert and consolidate power. Yet family bereavement—one of the most widespread and enduring consequences of such violence—remains critically understudied from a quantitative perspective. This study applies kinship demographic methods to estimate the scale of conflict-attributable bereavement in Colombia across time, with a focus on its population-level prevalence. Using data from the Colombian Truth Commission, adjusted for underreporting, we estimate the number of individuals who have ever experienced the death or enforced disappearance of family members due to conflict-related violence. Results indicate that, by 2018, approximately 7% of Colombians had lost a close family member, while 38% had lost any member of their family. Demographic projections suggest that these effects will persist for decades. The study provides novel insight into the scale, structure, and long-term consequences of kin loss caused by armed conflict. In the Colombian context, it represents a first step toward recognizing that war-induced bereavement was not merely collateral, but a targeted mechanism for dismantling family networks and eroding community cohesion. Our demographic profiling of the bereaved can aid efforts to support survivors and identify victims of enforced disappearance.",

The fertility behavior of Asian American women will have significant implications for the future size and composition of the US population. Yet, due to data constraints, little is known about Asian American fertility. \nMethod: This paper analyzes data from the 2022─2023 American Community Survey to compare the odds of having a child in the past year by women’s race/ethnicity, education, and marital status.\nResults: Fertility differences between Asian American women and those in other racial/ethnic groups were primarily due to differences in non-marital fertility rates. For unmarried women in all groups, having a college degree was associated with lower adjusted odds of having a child during the past 12 months. However, this educational differential was largest among Asian American women. Having a college degree was associated with higher adjusted odds of having a birth for married White, Black, and Hispanic women. Educational differences were minimal among married Asian American women. \nConclusion: Asian American women with college degrees display a stronger preference for marriage as the context for childbearing than women in other racial/ethnic and educational groups.",

          "abstract": "Fearon (1995) and Kalyvas (2006) are arguably the most influential contributions to conflict studies in recent decades. However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks---via edge simplification and node consolidation---resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.",

          "abstract": "We introduce Indus Keyboard, a web-based interactive tool that renders Devanagari text in the Indus script, based on the decipherment proposed by Yajnadevam. This is the first known keyboard to implement such a mapping for the Indus Script, achieved through two custom-designed fonts created using FontForge. The primary font renders Devanagari input as Indus signs based on frequency of occurrence including contextual ligatures (wherever attested), and displays them right-to-left, preserving the original directionality of the script. A secondary Brahmi style font visualizes Brahmi standardized Indus glyphs alongside their corresponding Brahmi text rendered left-to-right, enabling easy comparison and contrast, highlighting the possible evolution of the Indus script to Brahmi over millennia. The keyboard is built entirely using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and runs fully in-browser. Indus Keyboard offers a novel tool for researchers, educators, and script enthusiasts interested in early writing systems and their visual interrelationships.",

          "abstract": "Human choices are often multi-dimensional. For example, a person deciding which of two immigrants is more worthy of admission to a country might weigh the prospective immigrants' education, age, country of origin, and employment history. Conjoint experiments have rapidly generated new insight into these multidimensional choices. By independently randomizing the attributes of a pair of fictitious profiles, researchers summarize the average contribution that each attribute makes to an overall choice. But what if the effect of one attribute depends on the values of other attributes? We present a method that uses data-adaptive experimentation to search for heterogeneity in the effect of one focal attribute as a function of all other attributes. Our empirical application of this method shows that U.S. adults weigh the education of an immigrant much more heavily for certain immigrants than for others. By targeting the heterogeneous effects of a focal attribute, our approach complements conjoint designs that target the average effects of all attributes.",

          "abstract": "The shift of immigration enforcement to local jurisdictions has intensified localized patterns of anti-immigrant sentiment, enabling the system of mass deportation to expand at an unprecedented scale. This study examines the effects of 287(g) agreements, which empower local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, on Latino residential segregation. Using a quasi-experimental design that compares counties implementing 287(g) with those that applied but did not implement, we find that these policies significantly slowed declines in Hispanic-white segregation, particularly in early-adopting Southern counties where enforcement was most aggressive. We find no evidence that the program altered patterns of segregation for non-Hispanics. Our analysis suggests that these effects are driven by shifts in residential mobility and migration behaviors among Latino households, as enforcement amplified economic vulnerability, fear, and spatial isolation. By demonstrating how immigration enforcement disrupts Latino integration into residential communities, this study reveals the far-reaching consequences of these policies for racial stratification and neighborhood inequality in the United States.",

          "authors": "Christina Siegert",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how the transition to parenthood affects the gender-specific poverty risk within couples, highlighting the persistent economic vulnerability of partnered mothers in Germany. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (1990–2019) and an event study design, the analysis tracks poverty dynamics among partnered individuals in the eight years around the birth of their first child and compares gender-specific poverty risk under the assumptions of full income pooling (assessing household poverty risk) and no income pooling (assessing individual poverty risk). While the average household poverty risk remains low and stable around childbirth, the average individual poverty risk for women rises sharply, peaking at 59% one year after childbirth and persisting at a high level up to five years later, indicating a motherhood penalty relative to their partners and childless women. Analyses by year of first birth show a declining yet persistent motherhood penalty on women’s poverty risk for younger cohorts. The findings suggest that reliance on household poverty measures masks individual vulnerability, particularly among mothers, and highlight the need for poverty measures that capture individual economic resilience. These findings call for further policy and research attention to individual poverty measures to inform strategies that promote equitable economic outcomes within partnerships.",

          "abstract": "Current normative understanding of migration health ethics discourses frequently centres around improving migrants’ access to care, through appeal to moral cosmopolitanism - which emphasizes the equal moral worth and moral responsibility for humanity, stripped of local identities and aligned with an abstract global ‘we’. Continuing my ongoing works, drawing from critical anti-colonial-imperial and racial justice works, I understand ethics of belonging to be a practice situated within an emotionally charged everyday social setting, and is practiced in our everyday encounters through the value of recognition across social boundaries and embodied bodies. My aim in this paper is twofold. First, I critique the underlying normative and political assumptions of questions commonly ascribed to moral cosmopolitanism in the context of health—a social phenomenon and a public good—such as, ‘Why do we owe duties to strangers?’ and ‘What should these duties look like?’ I argue that these questions presuppose a certain ethical imagination, demanding those in power to perceive ‘strangers’ or ‘compatriots’ in specific, often decontextualized and disembodied ways. Through this reflection and analysis, I will address the question: ‘Whose visions of cosmopolitanism are we aspiring to in (bio/public health) ethics, and what does this mean for migrants?’ Second, I explore ways to uncover the possibilities and politics of cosmopolitanism that acknowledge the racial-imperial-colonial logics, while also recognizing a deep desire for interconnectedness, justice, and change in our current unequal, gridded, and territorialized world. Through my analysis, I contend that to broaden the scope of ethics regarding migration health, it is essential to comprehend the politics of embodied struggles and their impact on one’s moral self, relationships, and community. This understanding is crucial for navigating the evolving ethics in the realm of justice-oriented public health and migration health policies, and its implications for politics and possibilities of moral cosmopolitanisms.",

          "abstract": "Teacher attrition remains a significant challenge in K–12 education, driven by rising concerns about workload, administrative support, and compensation. This qualitative study explored the factors contributing to teacher attrition and identified strategies to improve retention. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 28 teachers across 16 U.S. states who had either left the profession or were actively considering departure. Thematic analysis revealed four primary drivers of attrition: unsustainable workloads, inadequate administrative support, particularly regarding student behavior, insufficient compensation, and diminished professional autonomy. Participants also reported experiences of moral conflict and burnout, shaped by systemic challenges and shifting expectations following the COVID-19 pandemic. While some teachers indicated they would not return under any circumstances, others identified potential interventions, including increased pay, stronger leadership support, and reduced non-instructional responsibilities. These findings suggest that teacher attrition stems from multiple factors, highlighting the need for systemic reforms to support teacher well-being and retention.",

This study investigates the adoption of preprinting over time, focusing on how it varies across scientific disciplines and geographical regions. We analyzed bibliometric data on 4M preprints and 105M peer-reviewed outputs in the period 1991-2023. Peer-reviewed outputs were linked to preprints using data from Dimensions, OpenAlex, and Crossref, resulting in 2.2M peer-reviewed outputs linked to a preprint. Our findings indicate a strong growth in preprinting, with a nearly threefold increase in the number of preprints published between 2017 and 2022. The adoption of preprinting is highest in the physical and mathematical sciences, particularly among researchers in the Americas and Europe. In recent years, preprinting has also increased notably in the information and computing sciences and the life and medical sciences, driven primarily by researchers in North America and Western and Northern Europe. Preprinting remains relatively uncommon in the humanities and the social and behavioral sciences. Asia demonstrates low preprint adoption, with Eastern Asia showing a modest increase in recent years. Preprint adoption in specific disciplines varies significantly across regions, showing that preprint adoption is shaped by the interplay between disciplines and regions.",

          "abstract": "Many national education systems have schools that adopt distinctive elements like alternative\npedagogical concepts or specialty themes. This “school profiling” is thought to drive school\nsegregation by socio-economic status (SES). However, since most existing research has focused\non U.S. charter schools and lacks large-scale student-level data, the connection between\nprofiling and SES-based school sorting remains unclear. This study addresses this gap by\nfocusing on the case of the Netherlands, a country known for its high school autonomy and\nfreedom of school choice. I use population-wide register data from over 110,000 students (aged\n11–12), linked to novel data on school profiling. The findings reveal social stratification in access\nto schools with distinctive profiles, with higher SES students having access to a more diverse\npool of schools. Furthermore, conditional logit models show evidence of self-sorting by SES for\nsome profiles: for instance, schools with progressive learning concepts are less popular among\nlower SES students, while higher SES students are comparatively less likely to choose labor\nmarket-themed schools. These SES disparities, however, are modest and not always in the\nexpected direction. Overall, findings underscore the role of access disparities in shaping\nSES-based sorting, next to differential preferences for schooling.",

          "abstract": "Sociologists have an awkward relationship with functionalist explanations. Despite having declared “functionalism” to be obsolete, some form of functionalist argument remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that the inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this paper has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating on the distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction, allowing us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. Importantly, these strategies are not burdened by the problems of the organicist framework many sociologists have in mind when they disregard functionalist explanations.",

          "abstract": "Why are some firms more successful than others in obtaining privileged treatment from their government? Trade policy, as an unusually targeted redistributive tool, offers a rich context to understand such questions of special interest politics and corporate power. Studying decisions on anti-dumping petitions in the U.S., we introduce a novel source of privileged treatment. We argue that firms with more linkages throughout the domestic economy enjoy a privileged political position. Benefits to these firms extend indirectly to a broader set of constituents, which allows firms to assemble broader coalitions and to portray protectionist policy as more than purely particularistic politics. We provide evidence for this argument by developing original measures of linkages between firms, derived from over 600,000 customer-supplier relationships among industries, matching them with data on anti-dumping petitions filed by U.S. firms, written briefs filed by Members of Congress on behalf of these firms, and the geographic distribution of industries. Our account identifies a new explanation of differences in the political influence of firms, underscores the relevance of domestic production networks in politics, and offers a new perspective on cleavages and coalitions in trade politics. Our results also suggest that the expansion of global supply chains, long considered a hallmark of political power, may have weakened the political clout of some of the largest firms by limiting their domestic footprint.",

Despite methodological risks—including direct threats and lack of institutional support for the researcher—the research provided insights into realities hidden by social stigma. It is observed that many women enter this field out of necessity to support their families, and that age plays a key role in the distribution of demand. Furthermore, it is found that not all clients seek sex: a significant percentage pays for companionship, affection, and conversation. The study concludes that sex work cannot be reduced solely to a sexual exchange, but constitutes a complex space of human, economic, and emotional connections.",

To resolve this, the paper introduces a modified NAP (MNAP), explicitly permitting voluntary, consent-based bystander intervention. \nThe proposed refinement enhances the practical applicability of the NAP in complex multi-agent scenarios, offering libertarian societies a coherent framework for ethically and legally addressing immediate situations of aggression through consensual collective action.",

King County, Washington, the twelfth largest U.S. county, hosts the fourth largest homeless population, many of whom reside in Seattle. Discouraging encampments and providing shelter beds has proven ineffective. We investigate how street survivors make encampment choices based on the proximity of amenities compared to those in emergency shelters and rental units. We analyze rich spatial, administrative, and outreach worker data from Seattle’s Evergreen Treatment Services (REACH) on individuals living in tents and on the street from 2016 to 2022. We discuss the implications of providing effective support for people living unhoused and provide, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive and recent study of neighborhood access and proximity to amenities among the unsheltered population in Seattle, WA. We find that, in most neighborhoods, encampment locations are more closely aligned with the access patterns of people renting housing across a range of amenities. Additionally, certain amenities, especially food-related ones, excluding food banks, were located closer to encampments than to shelters, suggesting that they may offer opportunities for personal agency in meeting basic needs, making food choices, and accessing WiFi. We conclude that housing options that feel like homes rather than institutions are crucial in supporting the unhoused. Our findings suggest that emergency shelters should be more integrated into neighborhoods and better reflect the trends of tent encampments and rentals.",

A goal of policy and public sector actors is to draw on research to improve decision making, and correspondingly, a goal of public policy and public administration researchers is to provide relevant expertise. It is not clear, however, to what extent these goals are achieved. This study uses the Overton database to analyse the influence of public policy and administration research on policy documents (broadly defined as documents published by policy and public sector organizations). It considers which research is cited by policy documents and which organizations cite research more than others to justify their decisions. The findings show that measuring the influence of academic expertise is not straightforward conceptually or methodologically. However, they emphasise the role of different organization types for achieving a greater correspondence between research and policy. Specifically, our study shows that think tanks use public policy and administration research more often than government organizations when justifying decisions. The findings provide insight into the utility of new policy databases in illuminating how academic experts can influence the ideas and actions of policy and public sector actors.",

Longer family leave has been shown to weaken women’s labour market positions and some studies have found heterogenous effects across population groups. However, whether the effect differs by partnership status remains unexplored. Using Finnish register data from 1989 to 2014 (ca. 2.5 million person-years) and controlling for selection into single motherhood by comparing estimates from OLS and FE models, this study compares single and patnered mothers’ unemployment and earnings consequent to extended family leaves. In line with predictions that single mothers may face greater work-family reconciliation issues or cumulative disadvantage leading to greater labour market penalties, the results showed that longer leave increases the length of unemployment for single mothers more than for partnered ones. This is not solely because of selection into single motherhood. Earnings penalties after family leave (net of employment status) are the same for single and partnered mothers. We conclude that similar long- lengths of family leave are penalised more among single mothers in terms of employment, which increases and reproduces social inequalities. This means that existing inequalities are reinforced by labour market absences supported by leave policies.",

We examine how mental health disorders (MHD) of varying prevalence, severity, and symptoms (common, severe, and behavioural and addiction-related disorders) are related to childlessness, and whether these associations are explained by partnerships and the partner’s mental health.\n\nWe use Finnish total population register data on cohorts born between 1977 and 1980 and follow individuals from the age of 18 to 39. We estimate discrete-time event history models for the annual likelihood of having a child for men and women, with MHDs, co-residential partnership, and the partner’s MHDs as the main explanatory variables. We measure MHD by using both diagnose information (ICD-10 codes) from the special health care registers and medication information (ATC-codes).\n\nAll types of MHDs predicted lower likelihood of having a child, the annual probability being 0.8–1.3%-points lower for women and 1.0–1.8 %-points for men in age-controlled models. The strongest association was observed for severe mental disorders. Co-residential partnerships explained part of the difference between those with and without MHD (for any MHD 13% for women and 36% for men compared to age-controlled model). When both partners have an MHD, the likelihood for childlessness was higher compared to partners where only one of the partners had an MHD. \n\nWe conclude that partnerships and partner’s mental health are important factors in explaining the relationship between mental health disorders and childlessness, particularly among men.",

          "abstract": "当前各国经济普遍困难，我国经济也面临不少困难和挑战，并且自2017年以来人口出生率持续走低，传统经济学对此已经束手无策。习近平总书记提出坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，并指出让人民过上幸福生活是头等大事，要加快补上内需特别是消费短板，使内需成为拉动经济增长的主动力和稳定锚。本文以人民为中心展开系统研究，发现货币不是银行的负债凭证，而是劳动力商品的替身和灵魂，本质是劳动力，是人民生育孩子的果实，权属于人民。然后进一步研究发现，货币发行实际是国家经济的初次分配，匹配的是国家经济增长，却被各国银行部门垄断和占有，是国家经济困难的根源。国家破除银行货币垄断，改把货币发行给广大人民用于生育补助，以此不断提高人民收入水平，就可以稳定孩子数量和产生真实的消费需求，补齐消费短板，形成国家经济的稳定锚，必将持续不断地发动社会再生产和保障充分就业，实现产销两旺，使经济持续增长，建成真正的发达国家。本文还提出了简单可性的政策框架和改革建议方案。这是一个以人民为中心的货币、就业和经济增长新范式。以此为核心，本文创立国家经济学，用于指导各国推动货币改革和发展经济，让各国人民都能过上幸福生活，建成人类命运共同体。",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study examines how mothers’ occupational skills influence their parenting practices during early childhood.\nBackground: Parental employment is widely recognized as a key dimension of family background, yet little is known about how the skill content of parents’ jobs may shape parenting behaviors. Drawing on theories of occupational spillover and self-efficacy, we assess whether specific occupational skills are associated with variation in parenting activities during early childhood.\nMethod: We use data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), a nationally representative longitudinal survey of children born in 2000–2002, linked to occupation-specific skill profiles derived from the British Skills Surveys. Parenting behaviors were measured when children were ages 5 (n = 12,892) and 7 (n = 11,265), capturing the frequency of seven cognitively and recreationally oriented activities. Occupational skills include literacy, verbal, numeracy, problem-solving, and physical competencies. We estimate multivariable regression models adjusting for a rich set of socioeconomic and demographic covariates.\nResults: Literacy and verbal skills are consistently associated with cognitively enriching activities, particularly reading and storytelling. Physical skills predict greater engagement in outdoor and drawing or craft activities. In contrast, numeracy and problem-solving skills show limited or inconsistent associations.\nConclusion: Mothers’ occupational skills shape parenting in distinct and domain-specific ways, supporting theories of value transmission and self-efficacy.\nImplications: These findings suggest that employment-based skills may influence the home learning environment independently of education and income, with implications for policy and early childhood inequality.",
