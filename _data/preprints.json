          "authors": "Natascha Chtena; Juan Pablo Alperin; Stephen Pinfield; Alice Fleerackers; Irene Pasquetto",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the evolving role of preprint servers within the scholarly communication system and their relationship with peer-reviewed journals. Historically prominent in fields like physics and mathematics, preprints have flourished in popularity across various disciplines in the past decade. Today, over 50 preprint servers exist, offering a platform for early and rapid dissemination of research findings. Preprint servers have traditionally fulfilled several functions of scholarly communication, including registration of research findings and archiving. However, recent trends indicate a shift towards servers challenging the established roles of peer-reviewed journals by adopting aspects of the certification and curation function. Through qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 14 preprint server managers, this study explores how preprint servers view their role in the certification and curation of scientific knowledge, the significant challenges facing preprints, and the potential future dynamics between preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals. Our findings point to a lack of consensus on how the relationship between preprint servers and journals could or should develop, and to diverging views on how the certification and curation functions are best performed, and by whom. We consider these tensions in the context of the ongoing sustainability and credibility challenges faced by preprint servers, situate them within evolving research policy frameworks, and discuss their implications for the diversity of future scholarly communication practices.",

          "authors": "Alex Milovanov; Sarena Daljeet; Jonathan Oakman; Marjory Phillips",
          "abstract": "Observational coding provides a means of measuring psychotherapy processes when self-report data is unavailable. The quality of the therapeutic alliance is a robust predictor of outcome as well as the most widely studied element of psychotherapy. The current study is the first to measure the alliance using thin slicing, or nonexpert judgments formed based on brief video clips. Four archival psychotherapy sessions from 53 adults were coded by undergraduates viewing either thin slices or entire sessions. Results indicated that four to five one-minute slices were sufficient to represent a session. We provide empirically derived coding guidelines specifying the number of raters and segments needed to optimize reliability for one-minute slices and entire sessions. A novel multilevel interrater reliability approach was applied. In addition, a single slice from three therapy sessions (3 minutes of coding total) was sufficient to predict therapy outcome (r = .28), with maximal predictive power when five slices from four sessions were aggregated (r = .33). Findings support the utility of thin slicing for efficiently capturing the alliance without compromising validity. More broadly, these data highlight the potential of thin slicing for tracking elements of psychotherapy across multiple timescales; this represents a possible avenue for addressing the time- and labour-intensive nature of existing coding methods, a current bottleneck in psychotherapy research. Further applications for research and clinical training are discussed.",

          "authors": "Sarah Dunstan",
          "abstract": "Background\nDissociation occurs in “fight or flight” situations when someone is feeling overwhelmed. Depersonalisation/Derealisation disorder (DPDRD) is a type of dissociation that involves feeling removed from one’s self and reality. DPDRD has been linked with interpersonal abuse but research is less clear on the role childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has on this dissociative experience.\n\nMethod\nFollowing a systematic review protocol, four electronic database searches, a citation search and grey literature search were conducted. Overall, 10 papers assessing links between CSA and depersonalisation and derealisation were identified and quality assessed. A textual narrative synthesis was conducted to extract results from each study and identify patterns within the data. \n\nResults\nThe synthesis indicated that samples were predominantly female and White/Caucasian. Over half the papers identified an association between CSA and depersonalisation/derealisation although these relationships were mainly weak or moderate. Further analysis suggested that methodological issues with sampling may have caused some bias.\n\nConclusion\nTentative links do exist between CSA and depersonalisation/derealisation, but methodological limitations within the studies, suggest possible biased results. Therefore, this review highlights a need for further research addressing these issues, to produce conclusive results. \n\n\tKeywords: Depersonalisation, derealisation, systematic review, childhood sexual abuse (CSA)",

          "authors": "Ze Freeman",
          "abstract": "Many studies report changes to social cognition after delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the scalp. Across multiple paradigms, it is unclear whether changes in social cognition are a result of modulating fundamental cognitive processes, like attention-shifting, or multidimensional ones, like theory of mind. The aim of this study was to segment theory of mind into component processes and examine how tDCS modulates task performance in each to clarify the role of the temporoparietal junction in social cognition. Three stimulation conditions were used: anodal, cathodal, and sham. tDCS was applied to the right temporoparietal junction whilst participants completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, a shape association self-other distinction task, and the Wisconsin card-sorting task. Results showed no significant differences between anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS conditions, as well as no significant change in task accuracy from before tDCS was applied to during tDCS being applied (p = .05). A significant difference in task performance was found between the three tasks. Exploratory analyses showed a significant, un-corrected task by stimulation by time point interaction, which is likely driven by the difference in task difficulty. The efficacy of tDCS remains unclear, and we highlight a potential file-drawer problem in this field.",

          "authors": "Igor Grossmann; Jackson A Smith; Neil Wegenschimmel; Peter Diep; Anna Dorfman",
          "abstract": "Dynamic theories of wisdom emphasize that metacognitive attributes—including intellectual humility, open-mindedness, and empathy/perspective-taking—evolve in response to life’s challenges. These attributes are further recognized as essential for promoting societal and individual well-being, mitigating contemporary issues such as misinformation, polarization, and societal acrimony. Upon reviewing dominant theoretical models of wisdom, here we outline how expression of wisdom’s metacognitive attributes differs across situational contexts, with implications for measurement practices. Next, we posit that the temporal dimension—essential to virtually all theories of wisdom—is paradoxically neglected or misinterpreted in empirical studies. Our findings are supported by a systematic review of literature, demonstrating that many conclusions about developing wisdom or its downstream effects are based on cross-sectional, atemporal data. In response, we advocate for greater focus on the temporal bounds of empirical data in social psychology and offer tutorial-style recommendations for formalizing narrative theories to explicitly specify one’s level of analysis. Beyond wisdom, we provide case examples of temporal neglect across other clinical, social, and cultural domains. Our recommendations thus provide a template for advancing dynamic research practices across diverse fields critical to understanding psychological change.",

          "authors": "Nicholas Kathios; Benjamin M Kubit; Nicole Grout; Jake Everard; Emma Zachary; Arushi Sankhe; Adam Tierney; Aniruddh D. Patel; Psyche Loui",
          "abstract": "Some spoken phrases, when heard repeatedly, seem to transform into music, in a classic finding known as the speech-to-song illusion. Repeated listening to musical phrases can also lead to changes in liking, attributed to learning-related reduction of prediction errors generated by the dopaminergic reward system. Does repeating spoken phrases also result in changes in liking? Here we tested whether repeated presentation of spoken phrases can lead to changes in liking as well as in musicality, and whether these changes might vary with reward sensitivity. We also asked whether perceptual biases towards low versus high frequencies, as assessed using the Laurel/Yanny illusion, are linked to changes in musicality and liking with repetition. Results show a general reduction in liking for spoken phrases with repetition, but less so for phrases that transition more readily into song. People who upweight low frequencies in speech perception (and so perceive Laurel rather than Yanny) are more susceptible to changes in musicality with phrase repetition and marginally less susceptible to changes in liking. Individuals with musical anhedonia still perceived the speech-to-song illusion, but liked all spoken phrases less; this did not interact with repetition. Results show a dissociation between perception and emotional sensitivity to music, and support a model of frequency-weighted internal predictions for acoustic signals that might drive the speech-to-song illusion. Rather than treating illusions as isolated curiosities, we can use them as a window into theoretical debates surrounding models of perception and emotion.",

          "authors": "Nur Diyanah bte Abdul Wahab; Gladys Jiamin Heng; Leonardo Bonneti; SH Annabel Chen",
          "abstract": "Despite a longstanding interest in associations between musical competency and memory, the multi-dimensional facet of musical competency remains understudied. The current study thus examines (1) the relationship between music perceptual abilities and episodic musical memory, and (2) the influence of musical behaviors, such as music listening and instrument playing, on music perception skills. Sixty-one participants (35M, 26F) completed an episodic musical memory task, adapted from the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST; Stark et al., 2015), which measures general recognition and precision memory for music. Participants also completed a music perception task (Law &amp; Zentner, 2012) and provided data on musical behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that general recognition memory for music was predicted by overall music perception proficiency. Proficiency in music perception is in turn predicted only by the extent of music instrument playing, independent of formal musical training or other musical experiences. In contrast, precision memory for music was not predicted by overall music perception proficiency, but only by melody and tempo perception, underscoring distinct links between specific musical skills and memory. These findings highlight the nuanced connections between musical habits, perceptual skills and musical memory skills, emphasizing the role of music production activities in nurturing musical competence.",

          "authors": "Jareef Martuza; Esra Aslan",
          "abstract": "Individual behavior is often shaped by observing others’ actions. The seminal and widely cited Experiment 1 by Gino, Ayal, et al. (2009) found that individuals are more likely to behave dishonestly after witnessing blatant dishonest behavior by an ingroup member than by an outgroup member. However, because there was no strict baseline condition in the original study, where participants would be exposed to the dishonesty of others without any in/outgroup signals, it remains unclear whether the original effect is driven by ingroup contagion, outgroup differentiation, or both. Furthermore, because that experiment used natural groups only, it also remains unclear if distinct properties of natural groups are necessary, or if mere categorization into arbitrary groups suffices. In this registered report, we propose to test their general hypothesis that exposure to ingroup dishonesty norms increases individual dishonest behavior more than exposure to outgroup dishonesty norms does. Using validated procedures for studying dishonesty norms, we propose a conceptual replication and extension of Gino, Ayal, et al.'s (2009) Experiment 1. We will test their general hypothesis in both minimal and natural groups with 3,600 U.S. Americans. In the treatment conditions, participants will be exposed to standardized information about others’ dishonest behavior, where we will systematically vary the group identity signals of those dishonest others, and then allow participants to cheat and double their experimental earnings. Findings will bolster understanding of how group identity-based dishonesty norms affect individual dishonesty by clarifying mechanisms and generalizability of the effect.",

          "abstract": "Love is shaped by cultural context. The Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) framework can be used to explore shared beliefs within cultures. Immigrants are a growing subculture within the United States that may have diverse views on love. This study investigated the shared beliefs of everyday love among 230 U.S. adults who had immigrated from 78 countries; participants were aged 19–72 years (M = 37.82, SD = 11.38). We aimed to (1) assess whether U.S. immigrants come to a consensus on what love means in daily life, (2) explore the details of U.S. immigrants’ shared beliefs on love while comparing those beliefs with the general U.S. population, and (3) examine the individual differences in decision-making styles. Using the Extended Condorcet Model and Bayesian psychometric methods for CCT analysis, we found that U.S. immigrants converge on a single-culture consensus on love and have similar beliefs as the general U.S. population on a set of 60 everyday love scenarios. We also found differences between immigrants and the general population for some scenarios. Lastly, we found that individual differences (personality factors, integration index, education, country of origin) were associated with people’s ability to know the consensus and guessing tendencies. While beliefs on love are mostly shared among people from both majority and immigrant populations, this research highlights how cultural background can inform nuances in shared beliefs on love.",

          "abstract": "Performance crises in professional soccer can have profound psychological and organizational impacts, influencing team cohesion, confidence, decision-making, and stakeholder satisfaction. This study aims to develop and validate three quantitative indices – Relative Position (RP), Linear Rate of Change (LRC), and Exponential Rate of Change (ERC) – to assess team performance relative to expectations and detect the onset of crises. Using data from the 2023–24 Bundesliga season, the indices were applied to analyze patterns of underperformance and their connection to managerial changes, providing insights into the psychological dynamics underlying team crises.\nThe RP index quantifies a team’s position relative to preseason expectations, while the LRC index captures cumulative performance trends over the season. The ERC index emphasizes recent performance momentum, identifying acute downturns that may trigger psychological and structural crises. Results show that the indices are effective in diagnosing both chronic and acute performance issues, with sharp declines in ERC often coinciding with coaching dismissals, reflecting the psychological tipping points of team management decisions.\nIllustrative case studies of FC Augsburg and VfL Wolfsburg demonstrated the indices’ practical utility, highlighting contrasting patterns of early versus late interventions. Across the league, teams experiencing managerial changes exhibited significant negative trends in all three indices, underscoring their reliability in identifying crises. By integrating psychological momentum, expectation management, and performance analysis, the proposed indices provide a systematic approach to monitoring team performance, understanding the psychological precursors of crises, and enabling timely interventions to mitigate performance downturns.",

          "authors": "Nejc Plohl; Ana Lampret; Urška Smrke; Živa Krajnc; Tina Kos; Bojan Musil",
          "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of climate anxiety and its associations with mental health disorders have encouraged the scientific community to explore how individuals may effectively cope with this complex phenomenon. While existing research has primarily centered on behavioral strategies, much less is known about the role of traits and strategies that may help individuals mentally cope with adversity. Hence, the present preregistered review (PROSPERO: CRD42024574449) investigated the relationship between climate anxiety, psychological resilience, and cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies. We attempted to identify quantitative studies with observational designs that report novel results pertaining to associations of interest. To do so, we searched Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, ProQuest, and MEDLINE for published papers and theses, along with PsyArxiv, SocArXiv, and medRxiv for preprints. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of all eligible studies and assessed the quality of articles using the Survey Studies in Psychology checklist. In the end, 13 articles that contained 15 relevant studies and 97 relevant findings met our eligibility criteria. The results showed that psychological resilience was consistently negatively associated with climate anxiety, whereas the results were rather mixed for adaptive and maladaptive CER strategies. An additional identified construct, psychological adaptation to climate change - a blend of different (mal)adaptive CER strategies - was positively associated with climate anxiety. Despite limitations, such as the small number of studies and relatively low cohesion between them, our review highlights psychological resilience as a protective factor and the complexity of the relationship between CER strategies and climate anxiety.",

          "authors": "Chiara Battaglini; Federico Frau; Veronica Mangiaterra; Luca Bischetti; Paolo Canal; Valentina Bambini",
          "abstract": "When girls are pearls, do they have rare gracious attributes, or are they beautiful? It is well known that not only are metaphors open to different interpretations but also that these interpretations might vary across individuals, even with the same cultural context. However, the literature lacks a description of which patterns of interpretation emerge across individuals and which factors might drive them. Previous evidence suggests that interpreters differently recruit sensorimotor and sociocognitive strategies to interpret metaphors. Here, we tested the importance of metaphor multimodality to explain individual variability. We describe participants’ interpretations according to a series of psycholinguistic variables, including affective, cognitive, and sensory processes, that mirrors psychological states and hints at different cognitive mechanisms. With an innovative method that combines i) a multidimensional semi-automated linguistic analysis, ii) IS-RDM, which allows to uncover participant-level patterns of similarity, and iii) a data-driven clustering method, we were able to identify two groups of participants based on their verbal interpretations. Results showed that there are mentalizers, who explore the semantic networks and rely on sociocognitive information (e.g. they interpret Teachers are lanterns as They are able to make others understand whatever they want to) and imagers, who reenact sensory properties and rely on the activation of mental images (e.g. they interpret Teachers are lanterns as They are luminous). Our study showed that a data-driven approach can capture different metaphor interpretative profiles from the semantic features of the words used, suggesting that: i) participants focus on sensorimotor vs. sociocognitive features according to the different processing strategies they adopt and ii) the words they produce to interpret a metaphor are cues into these cognitive mechanisms. These data allow the reconciliation of the multiplicity of theories about metaphor comprehension, which might be due to the existence of differences across individuals. There seems to be multimodal alternative routes to solving metaphorical meaning, and acknowledging individual preferences allows to open windows on the modalities with which each individual conceptualizes the world.",

          "authors": "Martin Daumiller; Kristina Stockinger; Markus Dresel",
          "abstract": "Background: University teachers’ well-being plays a critical role in their productivity and educational effectiveness. Apart from cross-sectional research on demographic and institutional/contextual correlates, insight into potential causes and consequences of faculty well-being is limited. This includes insight into relations between different coping strategies and well-being.\nAims: We studied the interplay of different strategies for coping with teaching-related stress with university teachers’ well-being over the course of one semester.\nSample: Participants were 489 German university teachers (age: M=41.1 years, SD=11.4) from 34 universities. Their demographics were characteristic for German university staff.\nMethods: Participants reported on their use of task-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidance-oriented coping to manage teaching-related stress and on their subjective well-being (positive and negative affect; job satisfaction) at the beginning (T1: November) and end (T2: February) of the winter 2020/2021 term. Interrelations were examined via cross-lagged panel analysis.\nResults: Task-oriented coping was positively related to the slope of changes in positive affect, and vice versa, over time. Emotion-oriented coping (rumination) was positively related to the slope of changes in negative affect, and negatively to the slope of changes in positive affect and job satisfaction. Negative affect was positively related to the slope of changes in avoidance-oriented coping.\nConclusions: The findings provide directions for further developing supportive measures for promoting well-being in university teaching staff by highlighting the relevance of different coping strategies as causes and consequences thereof. Task-oriented coping may be particularly adaptive for well-being: at the same time, interventions aiming to promote well-being may also facilitate task-oriented coping behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Although there has been some research on the role of value conversion within therapy, such research tends to pertain to resolution of ethical dilemmas or specific instances of conflict between therapist and client values. This research takes a counter argument: rather than view value conversion as an occasional or isolated incident, it argues that such processes are integral to therapy. This argument is supported through a critical discourse analysis of the historic ‘Gloria Films’ featuring Carl Rogers, Albert Ellis, Fritz Perls and Gloria Szymanski. The research concludes value conversion is more prevalent and more complicated than is reflected in the existing literature and by current ethical frameworks.  However it also concludes that although such conversion processes are integral to therapy, there is less evidence to support the view that such conversions are successful.",

          "authors": "Ari Khoudary; Megan Peters; Aaron Bornstein",
          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models are powerful tools for enhancing the quantitative and theoretical rigor of cognitive neuroscience. It is thus imperative that model users—researchers who develop models, use existing models, or integrate model-based findings into their own research—understand how these tools work and what factors need to be considered when engaging with them. To this end, we developed a philosophical toolkit that address core questions about computational cognitive models in the brain and behavioral sciences. Drawing on recent advances in philosophy of modeling, we highlight the central role of model users’ reasoning goals in the application and interpretation of formal models. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by first offering a philosophical introduction to the highly popular drift diffusion model (DDM) and then providing a novel conceptual analysis of a long-standing debate about decision thresholds in the DDM. Contrary to most existing work, we suggest that the two model structures implicated in the debate offer complementary—rather than competing—explanations of speeded choice behavior. Further, by contrasting approaches to model development and comparison, we show how the explanation provided by each form of the model (parsimonious and normative) reflects the reasoning goals of the communities of users who developed them (cognitive psychometricians and formal decision scientists, respectively).

          "abstract": "Effective linguistic communication depends upon many different cognitive processes working together in concert. Yet our computational models of these processes are often developed in isolation, without considering how these processes fit together. In this work, we study a simplified variant of the popular board game Codenames, which highlights the integration of two important processes: (1) lexical retrieval and (2) pragmatic reasoning. In this task, speakers must generate a \"clue\" word from their full lexicon that allows their partner to select a pair of target words from a context of distractors.  In Experiment 1, we evaluate a suite of different models on an existing corpus of production data, finding that models with both semantic search and pragmatic reasoning components significantly outperform ablated variants. Experiment 2 elicits targeted endorsements for a particularly diagnostic set of clues, providing further evidence for the pragmatic selection component in isolation. Finally, Experiments 3 and 4 elicit lists of clues that speakers are considering for a target pair in the absence and presence of the board context, respectively, providing further evidence for the way context is infused into semantic search. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the way that retrieval processes (generating promising candidates) and selection processes (evaluating the likely communicative success of these candidates) must work in tandem to support effective communication.",

          "abstract": "Dreams may partially reflect the memory reorganizing that occurs nightly to improve the usefulness of what we learn each day. However, solid evidence has yet to link dreaming with adaptive overnight memory processes. Dream research faces several challenges, including the difficulty of experimentally controlling dream content and the susceptibility of dream reports to distortion and forgetting upon awakening. Memory consolidation can be systematically manipulated using Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR), whereby sensory stimulation during sleep triggers processing of previously acquired memories. Stimuli presented during sleep can be incorporated into dreams, but how reactivated memories might influence dream content is still unknown. This study aims to use TMR to strategically influence dreams. In the evening, participants performed two distinct tasks designed to be readily incorporated into dreams. Each task was associated with a unique sound and entailed a unique respiratory signature designed to be objectively verifiable during sleep. The association between each task and sound was further reinforced in a conditioning phase just prior to sleep. When a participant entered REM sleep, the experimenter presented one of the two sounds, thus attempting to induce dreams related to the associated task. Dream reports revealed incorporation of task elements that were high for both tasks, and relatively higher for the cued task. Dreaming of a task was linked with decreased negative valence and increased creativity. We conclude that this approach to dream curation provides a novel way to investigate the influence of dreaming on memory storage.",

          "abstract": "Data visualizations play a crucial role in communicating patterns in quantitative data, making data visualization literacy a key target of STEM education. However, it is currently unclear to what degree different assessments of data visualization literacy measure the same underlying constructs. Here, we administered two widely used graph comprehension assessments (Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2011; Lee, Kim, &amp; Kwon, 2016) to both a university-based convenience sample and a demographically representative sample of adult participants in the United States (N=1,113). Our analysis of individual variability in test performance suggests that overall scores are correlated between assessments and associated with the amount of prior coursework in mathematics. However, further exploration of individual error patterns suggests that these assessments probe somewhat distinct components of data visualization literacy, and we do not find evidence that these components correspond to the categories that guided the design of either test (e.g., questions that require retrieving values rather than making comparisons). Together, these findings suggest opportunities for development of more comprehensive assessments of data visualization literacy that are organized by components that better account for detailed behavioral patterns.",

Those benefits accrue from a resonance between how they approach questions and the questions they ask. For example, both rely on experiments to explore how individual interactions generate collective phenomena. The paper compares micro-mechanism-driven and macro-pattern-driven ABM paradigms and introduces a new research approach—the minimal society paradigm—and a modeling strategy, principle-oriented modeling. This framework integrates ABM into psychological research, supporting both theory building through minimal societies and adaptation to specific contexts.

          "abstract": "Suicidal thoughts and behaviors pose a major public health concern and are a leading cause of mortality in young adults. However, formal mental health care utilization remains limited due to attitudinal and structural barriers, including stigma. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer a promising alternative approach to help-seeking, especially for young adults who prefer self-managing their symptoms. Text messaging-based safety planning interventions can be a scalable approach to seek help that can mitigate many structural barriers and can be useful for young adults. In this study, we conducted two online focus groups (n=15 each) to understand what prevents young adults from seeking help for their suicidal thoughts and behaviors and what might prevent them from engaging with a fully automated text messaging-based safety planning intervention. Participants reported barriers to help seeking both within and outside crisis states. Outside crisis states, the major barriers to help seeking included an unwillingness to burden others, negative prior experiences, inability to verbalize distress, high cost of professional help, fear of repercussions, stigma, and inconsistency with self-image. During crisis, participants reported difficulty following through with a safety plan. Despite a preference for self-management, participants expressed skepticism towards a fully automated intervention, citing privacy concerns, doubts about effectiveness, and a desire for human support. Our findings highlight a key tension in designing DMHIs: while young adults prefer self-managing their problems, they may also disengage from DMHIs that lack human support. Understanding these barriers are critical for developing DMHIs that balance autonomy with perceived effectiveness and support.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, characterized by deficits in performance monitoring, predicts clinical and functional outcomes. The error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological index of error detection, is reduced in psychosis, but it is unclear why this impaired error detection is not closely linked to post-error behavioral adjustments. A possibility is that research has overrelied on examining between-person relationships of average ERN and behavior, rather than focusing on within-person, trial-by-trial changes. This study aimed to determine whether neurophysiological indices of error detection (ERN, error positivity [Pe]) predict within-person post-error behavioral adjustments in psychotic disorders and whether these relationships are weaker in people with psychosis than in controls. ERN and Pe were assessed during a modified flanker task in 72 patients with psychosis and 82 healthy comparison participants. Multilevel location-scale models were used to examine trial-by-trial changes in the relationships between ERPs and behavior (response [RTs], accuracy). Results showed that ERP-RT relationships were similar across patients and controls. In both groups, greater within-person increases in ERN amplitude predicted longer and mor variable RTs following correct trials. Larger within-person increases in Pe predicted shorter and more variable RTs following correct trials, but less variable RTs following error trials. Exploratory analyses in a subset of patients with schizophrenia showed a similar pattern of effects as in the overall analyses. ERP-accuracy relationships were neither observed nor moderated by diagnostic groups. Within-person ERP-behavior relationships were preserved in psychosis, indicating intact performance monitoring at the individual level. This supports performance-monitoring as a transdiagnostic construct and underscores the importance of examining intraindividual variability to understand performance monitoring in psychotic disorders.",

          "authors": "Dan Petrovitch; Samuel Hosford; Andrew K. Littlefield; Heather Austin-Robillard",
          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) is an emerging treatment approach that often combines pharmacotherapeutic dosing sessions with more traditional psychotherapy. Despite limited formal regulatory approval, treatment seekers can currently access PAT through a variety of avenues, including ketamine treatment centers and “supported adult use” psilocybin centers in the U.S., drug tourism, “underground” therapy, and participation in clinical trials, among other ways. This has created a heterogenous landscape of PAT access in which people self-report PAT utilization with a variety of psychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs. However, there is limited published data on patterns of PAT involvement across drugs among real-world patients.\n\nTherefore, the present study investigated patterns of PAT utilization by applying latent class analysis (LCA) to a purposive sample of 244 self-identified PAT patients. Participants were recruited from a variety of sources (e.g., ketamine clinics, social media groups, a large U.S. university) and asked to report lifetime PAT utilization involving six compounds: psilocybin, ketamine, mescaline, ayahuasca/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Participants also completed sociodemographic and internalizing measures (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory II, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and responses were compared across classes.\n\nLCA yielded a three-class solution. In addition to High- (55.7% of the sample) and Medium-PAT classes (29.1%), a unique Psilocybin-Ketamine class (15.2%) was identified—membership in this class was characterized by universal involvement with psilocybin and notable involvement with ketamine PAT compared to other compounds. Between-class comparisons of mental-health assessments indicated that the High-PAT class reported elevated depression and anxiety.\n\nThese findings suggest that high levels of lifetime involvement in a variety of PAT modalities may be associated with more severe self-reported psychiatric symptoms, raising questions about selection or iatrogenic effects within the current PAT landscape. The emergence of a Psilocybin-Ketamine class implies that these substances may serve as initial entry points into PAT.",

          "authors": "Nils Demurie; Kim Dierckx; Alain Van Hiel; Arne Roets",
          "abstract": "Research indicates a significant gap between the individual’s pro-environmental attitudes and actual behavior. To explain this gap, the present paper integrates prominent models of ecological behavior with theories of cognitive dissonance and moral disengagement into the new Behavior Attitude Alignment Model (BAAM). This model suggests that behavioral barriers can create an inconsistency between pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, leading to negative affect. Individuals may resolve this negative affect either by acting more pro-environmentally or by adjusting their attitudes through moral disengagement. Two studies were conducted to test this extended model. The first study (n = 256) focused on behaviors with varying behavioral barriers (eating less meat vs. recycling), while the second study (n = 188) manipulated behavioral barriers for sustainable consumption with a product choice task. The results from both studies indicate that higher behavioral barriers induce moral disengagement, which negatively affects behavioral attitudes, leading to less pro-environmental behavior. However, barriers had no significant effect on negative affect. These findings suggest that moral disengagement plays a crucial role in explaining pro-environmental behavior and offers new insights for developing interventions to counteract this process. Consequently, the present work lays the groundwork for identifying new strategies to close the attitude-behavior gap, and therefore contributes to a more sustainable future.",

          "abstract": "Self-esteem and depressive symptoms are important predictors of a range of societally relevant outcomes and are theorized to influence each other reciprocally over time. However, existing research offers only a limited understanding of how their dynamics unfold across different time scales. Using three datasets with different temporal resolutions, we aimed to advance our understanding of the temporal unfolding of the reciprocal dynamics between self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Across these datasets, participants (Ntotal = 6,210) rated their self-esteem and depressive symptoms between 6 and 14 times across days, months, and years, respectively. Using continuous time dynamic models, we found limited evidence for significant within-person cross-lagged effects between self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Only in the yearly dataset, a cross-lagged effect from depressive symptoms to self-esteem emerged quite consistently. However, in all datasets, cross-lagged effects were small in size (–0.04 ≤  ≤ –0.01). These findings suggest that the reciprocal dynamics between self-esteem and depressive symptoms may be less robust than commonly thought. Furthermore, exploratory analyses indicated that these effects depended on people’s overall levels of depressive symptoms, suggesting that theoretical frameworks that highlight transactions between self-esteem and depression may not generalize across all levels of depressive symptoms. Finally, self-esteem and depressive symptoms were strongly correlated within measurements, similarly stable over time, and changed similarly in response to negative life events, provoking questions as to their conceptual distinctiveness and measurement approaches.",

Alongside this mainstream, we highlight the increasing use of a diverse methodological toolbox, especially Bayesian methods and dynamic methods, for which we provide comprehensive reviews. Bayesian methods, as well as frequentist methods beyond linear and logistic regression, offer flexibility in model specification, interpretation, and incorporation of prior knowledge. Dynamic methods, such as GAMs and functional data analysis, capture non-linear patterns in acoustic and articulatory data. Machine learning techniques, such as random forests, expand the questions and types of data phoneticians can analyze.  We also discuss the growing importance of open science practices promoting replicability and transparency.

What remains unclear is whether relationship between bullying and mental health is different for autistic and neurotypical youth and whether friendships and social support moderate this relationship. In this United Kingdom based population-based study, we investigated the relationship between bullying involvement, victimisation and perpetration, from early childhood (age 5 years) through to mid-adolescence (age 14 years) with mental health outcomes in later adolescence (age 17 years) for autistic (n= 576) and neurotypical youth (n=14,963). We used parent-, teacher-, and self-reports of bullying at ages 5, 7, 11, and 14 years, to identify five bullying trajectory groups (uninvolved, adolescence victim, early childhood victim, early childhood bully, and bully-victims). Autistic youth were more likely than their neurotypical peers to be in one of the bullying trajectory groups compared to being in the uninvolved group. Specifically, 74% of autistic youth experienced bullying either as victims, bullies, or bully-victims between early childhood and adolescence compared to 38% of neurotypical youth. Both autistic and neurotypical youth who were involved in bullying, whether as a perpetrator or victim, experienced poorer subsequent mental health later in adolescence. Higher perceived social support buffered the effects of bullying involvement for neurotypical but not autistic youth. These findings highlight the need for further research focussing on possible targets for intervention to mitigate the possible impacts of bullying on subsequent mental health for autistic youth.",

While some of these approximate inference algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), have become well-known throughout the literature, other approaches exist that are not as widespread. Here, we provide an introduction to another family of approximate inference techniques known as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We show that SMC brings a number of benefits, which we illustrate in three different examples: linear regression and variable selection for depression, growth curve mixture modelling of grade point averages, and in computational modelling of the Iowa Gambling Task. These use cases demonstrate that SMC is efficient in exploring posterior distributions, reaching similar predictive performance as state-of-the-art MCMC approaches, in less wall-clock time. Moreover, they show that SMC is effective in dealing with multi-modal distributions, and that SMC not only approximates the posterior distribution, but simultaneously provides a useful estimate of the marginal likelihood, which is the essential quantity in Bayesian model comparison. All of this comes at no additional effort of the end user.",

          "abstract": "The infant-caregiver relationship is foundational to early development. Early atypical development can lead to long-term developmental cascades that cause later-life behavioural, emotional, and cognitive difficulties. Here, we focus on co-regulation – i.e., dynamic processes of mutual adaptation that underpin the caregiver-child relationship - during the 0-3 years age range. We explore the practical relevance of understanding co-regulation for intervention by pinpointing key mechanisms of change that drive the effectiveness of interventions. We discuss how mutual adaptation can be both beneficial (as it helps children to achieve and maintain an optimal, ‘critical’ state and fosters bio-behavioural synchrony) and detrimental (as short-term stress cycles can be dynamically reinforced across the dyad, and atypical long-term rhythms in one partner can progressively influence the other partner over time). We review how these principles are applied in current interventions, such as Circle of Security Parenting (COS-P), Video Interaction Guidance (VIG), Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP). We discuss under-explored areas that could be targeted in future intervention research. We highlight that child-caregiver relationships have been extensively studied at short-interval timescales - from seconds to minutes - in both naturalistic and controlled settings, and that most interventions focus on this timescale. There remains, though, a lack of quantitative data on how short-term interactions influence longer-term relationship dynamics over days, weeks and months, and this area is relatively under-explored in intervention research.",

Examples include introducing digital therapy, virtual reality, AI, large-scale language models, and wearable technology.

This paper proposes a framework called Data Relations Architecture (DRA), which integrates ethical, cultural, and historical perspectives in working with data and aims to architect relations based on diversity. The need for DRA is demonstrated by examining three hypothetical scenarios: treatment retention rates and cultural factors, optimizing mental health care design, and culturally adaptive data governance.",

          "abstract": "After considering a more or less random number (i.e., an anchor), people’s subsequent estimates are biased toward that number. Such anchoring phenomena have been explained via an adjustment process that ends too early. We present a formalized version of the insufficient adjustment model, which captures the idea that decreasing the time that people have to adjust from anchors draws their estimates closer to the anchors. In four independent studies (N = 898), we could not confirm this effect of time on anchoring. Moreover, anchoring effects vanished in the two studies that deviated from classical paradigms by using a visual scale or a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm to allow faster responses. Although we propose that the current version of the insufficient adjustment model should be discarded, we believe that adjustment models hold the most potential for the future of anchoring research, and we make suggestions for what these might look like.",

This study examined the associations between birth order, sibling characteristics and parent-reported vocabulary size in 6,163 Norwegian 8–36-month-old children (51.4% female). Results confirmed that birth order was negatively associated with vocabulary, yet exhibited a U-shaped pattern. A ‘child-to-caregiver ratio’ in the household was introduced, in which old-enough siblings are considered caregivers for their younger siblings. This index explained variance in vocabulary better than birth order, and suggested that female siblings may adopt a caregiving role 1–3 years earlier than males, indicating sex differences in the age at which siblings contribute, rather than deplete, available resources. A child-to-caregiver ratio might better capture the interplay between language learning resources and demands within households.",

          "abstract": "People appear to excel at generalization: they require little experience to generalize their knowledge to new situations. But can we confidently make such a conclusion? To make progress toward a better understanding, we characterize human generalization by introducing three proposed cognitive mechanisms allowing people to generalize: applying simple rules, judging new objects by considering their similarity to previously encountered objects, and applying abstract rules. We highlight the systematicity with which people use these three mechanisms by, perhaps surprisingly, focusing on failures of generalization. These failures show that people prefer simple ways to generalize, even when simple is not ideal. Together, these results can be subsumed under two proposed stages: First, people infer what aspects of an environment are task relevant. And second, while repeatedly carrying out the task, the mental representations required to solve the task change. Throughout the review, we compare humans to contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This comparison shows that AI systems use the same generalization mechanisms as humans. However, they differ from humans in the way they abstract patterns from observations and apply these patterns to previously unknown objects - often resulting in generalization performance that is superior to, but sometimes inferior to that of humans.",

Integrating social psychology and communication studies, we use lexicometric methods to analyze 12,996 articles on “the unemployed” published in the French press between 2005 and 2022. We show that unemployed people are largely invisible in the media, are mostly portrayed as dehumanized economic, political, or welfare issues requiring control and sanction procedures rather than individuals, and that unemployment is mostly individualized. When they are visible, which is rare, unemployed individuals are portrayed as persevering and willing poor men in need of guidance and support, who adhere to a strong social norm to work and take personal responsibility for their situation. Different discourses about unemployed people emerge both from political leaders in a top-down approach, and from liberal-left and local newspapers in a bottom-up perspective.",

While the neural and cognitive underpinnings of aphantasia remain hotly debated (see Zeman, 2024 for a recent review), a proposal that has recently gained attention is that people with aphantasia may have unconscious mental imagery (Nanay, 2021; Michel et al. 2025), meaning that despite lacking the experience associated with imagery, they may still possess the relevant neural activity. A recent CB article by Chang and colleagues (2025) reported finding “imageless imagery” in aphantasic subjects, thus seemingly supporting this view. However, we argue here that the representations found in aphantasic subjects by Chang and colleagues (2025), as well as in other studies (e.g., Liu et al., 2025), should not be viewed as unconscious imagery because they fail to show the perception-like pattern usually associated with mental imagery.",

          "abstract": "Crime and violence are highly prevalent in South Africa, exacerbated by numerous socioeconomic challenges. To investigate how exposure to crime and violence (and their impacts, e.g. stress) are perceived in low-income communities, we hosted a set of facilitated ‘community conversations’, as opportunities for community engagement. Our objective was to provide a safe space for community members to share their perceptions; we were interested to know if such conversations would be feasible with adolescents (&gt;12 years) and adults in the community. We hosted five conversations (each 2.5-3 hours in length) with 25 adults (56% female) and 47 adolescents (26% female) at a local church, providing refreshments. Overall, it proved feasible to arrange and conduct ‘community conversations’ about stress and exposure to crime and violence in this community. Despite the sensitive nature of the topics being discussed, participants in all groups were found to be willing to speak openly and appeared to respond well to the term ‘stress’ rather than mental health. The main challenges identified in discussions were poverty, safety (linked to crime and violence), substance abuse, lack of trust, and conflict in homes, and a lack of unity within the community linked to a lack of trust. Poverty and unemployment were seen as contributing to these challenges, contributing to community members feeling unsafe and unprotected, and living with the fear of being targeted by crime and violence. Based on our experience of these conversations, we make recommendations relating to the feasibility, facilitation, and the role of such activities in research. Participants’ responses provided a positive indication that facilitating similar conversations on a more regular basis (and potentially in other communities) could help provide support for community members while also increasing researchers’ understanding of community member experiences.",

          "abstract": "Exposure is highly effective for treating acrophobia and there is growing consensus that cognitive mechanisms play an important role in exposure-based therapies. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether adding a Cognitive Bias Modification - Interpretation (CBM-I) training to a single-session exposure therapy further facilitates cognitive change. The sample included diagnosed acrophobia patients (N = 81), all of whom received exposure therapy. One day after the exposure therapy, patients were randomized to receive either CBM-I or a sham training. The CBM-I trained patients to interpret and appraise ambiguous, height-related scenarios in a less threatening and adaptive manner, whereas the sham training comprised ambiguous, neutral scenarios. Outcomes included changes in interpretational biases (Encoding Recognition Task, Heights Interpretation Questionnaire, Scrambled Sentences Task), acrophobia-related symptoms (Acrophobia Questionnaire), and behavioral avoidance (Behavioral Approach Test). In intention-to-treat analyses patients receiving CBM-I showed a greater reduction in interpretational biases post-training compared to the sham condition (primary outcome). However, group differences were not sustained at follow-up and both groups demonstrated improvements across all outcomes, except for the Scrambled Sentences Task. Exploratory analyses revealed strong associations between the assessed cognitive, behavioral, and subjective outcomes, but neither of these outcomes correlated with hormonal measures (progesterone, estradiol). To conclude, our findings suggest that while CBM-I can temporarily facilitate cognitive change in the context of exposure, its long-term benefits and downstream effects may require further optimization. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols to maximize its efficacy as a potential adjunct to exposure therapy.",

          "abstract": "Psychological concepts are increasingly understood as complex dynamic systems that change\nover time. To study these complex systems, researchers are increasingly gathering intensive\nlongitudinal data (ILD), revealing non-linear phenomena such as asymptotic growth, mean-level\nswitching, and regulatory oscillations. However, psychological researchers currently lack\nadvanced statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture these non-linear processes\naccurately, which hinders theory development. While methods such as local polynomial\nregression, Gaussian processes, and generalized additive models (GAMs) exist outside of\npsychology, they are rarely applied within the field because they have not yet been reviewed\naccessibly and evaluated within the context of ILD. To address this important gap, this article\nintroduces these three methods for an applied psychological audience. We further conducted a\nsimulation study, which demonstrates that all three methods infer non-linear processes that have\nbeen found in ILD more accurately than polynomial regression. Particularly, GAMs closely\ncaptured the underlying processes, performing almost as well as the data-generating parametric\nmodels. Finally, we illustrate how GAMs can be applied to explore idiographic processes and\nidentify potential phenomena in ILD. This comprehensive analysis empowers psychological\nresearchers to model non-linear processes accurately and select a method that aligns with their\ndata and research goals.",

The current experiment examined the context dependency of faking-good effects. Participants (N = 231) completed the Big Five Inventory-2 twice, first honestly and then with faking-good instructions in a job or dating context. Socially desirable responding was present in both contexts. Yet, it was more pronounced in the job context than in the dating context for many (but not all) Big Five dimensions and facets. Future research should investigate whether faking behavior differs across contexts not only under faking-good instructions but also in high-stakes situations (e.g., personnel selection or online dating).",

In Aotearoa (New Zealand), the enduring impacts of colonisation on Māori include the suppression of Indigenous wisdom, even as research affirming the knowledge and practice of traditional Māori healing is on the rise. \n\nThe Tū Wairua project will explore the integration of rongoā Māori (traditional Māori healing practices) with psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) for addressing problematic methamphetamine use (PMU) in Māori communities. This Māori-led project is driven by kaupapa Māori methodology and rongoā Māori conceptualisations of health and informed by biomedical psychedelic science. Based at Rangiwaho Marae in Te Tairāwhiti, a community with a high Māori population and a significant burden of PMU, the project aims to develop a culturally-appropriate PAT to explore the efficacy of psilocybin in treating PMU. \n\nThis research represents a shift toward health interventions that respect and extend Indigenous wisdom, addressing the unique needs of Māori communities. It also seeks to develop a skilled Māori workforce to continue these healing practices, and challenge current legislation that restricts the use of Indigenous psychedelics.

          "abstract": "When people experience conflicts between their ideal standards and their partner’s actual state, they often resolve conflict through communication. Numerous observational studies suggest that direct regulation attempts (e.g., requesting one’s partner to change) are positively associated with the behavior change of the target partner. However, previous research using between-person and correlational designs has provided limited evidence. Moreover, the psychological components of partner regulation that affect targets’ intentions and behavior remain unclear. Therefore, we employed a within-person experimental paradigm to rigorously test targets’ psychological processes underlying interpersonal conflict resolution through communication. This focused on the discrepancy between targets’ actual states and requesters’ ideals. In the paradigm, we systematically manipulated targets’ perceived discrepancy. In our experiment (N = 78 couples), targets were asked to rate the actual frequency of 40–80 important actions, and requesters were asked to rate the ideal frequency of the targets’ actions. These actions were then randomly assigned to either the discrepancy feedback or no-feedback condition. Results showed that, in the feedback condition, discrepancies were positively associated with targets’ intentions to improve their behavior (but not with behavioral changes). These findings suggest that although people can facilitate their partners’ intention to change important actions by simply communicating their ideals, they must make additional efforts (e.g., suggesting a solution and promoting prospective memory) to get their partners to execute the intention. This study provides critical insight into the psychological process underlying conflict resolution in close relationships using a within-person experiment.",

Exposure to tobacco retail has been linked to adverse smoking outcomes, but research utilizing naturalistic and causal approaches to quantify these effects in the real world remains relatively sparse. To address this, we used ecological momentary assessment, geolocation tracking, and neuroimaging to assess smoking outcomes in the real world, and conducted a randomized controlled trial focused on the effects of real-world exposure to tobacco retail.\nObjective: The GeoSmoking Study aimed to evaluate: (1) within-person associations between real-world tobacco retail exposure and cigarette craving and smoking; (2) causal effects of real-world tobacco retail exposure; and (3) neural cue reactivity as a mechanism for real-world tobacco retail effects.\nMethods: In a two-week baseline period, we used ecological momentary assessment to collect reports of craving and smoking multiple times per day. Simultaneously, we used geolocation tracking to quantify tobacco retail exposure, through creation of a tobacco retailer database across three U.S. states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware). A four-week intervention period followed, in which participants were randomly assigned to enter either a non-tobacco retail store once per day (Non-tobacco retailer condition), a tobacco retail store once per day (Tobacco retailer condition), or follow their normal routines (Control condition). An optional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session concluded the study. Individuals participated remotely, unless they opted in to the fMRI session, which was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania.\nResults: The GeoSmoking Study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania on February 3rd, 2022. Data collection started on May 25th, 2022 and ended on June 10th, 2024. In total, 310 participants were enrolled, 282 participants completed the baseline phase, 244 participants completed the intervention phase, and 24 participants completed the fMRI scan.\nConclusions: This novel and innovative study protocol was successfully implemented. Findings from planned analyses may have significant implications for health behaviors, outcomes, and policy.\nTrial Registration: Cancer Prevention through Neural and Geospatial Examination of Tobacco Marketing Effects in Smokers: 1R01CA229305-01A1; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04279483",

          "abstract": "Importance: The tobacco industry spends over $8 billion annually in the United States on marketing at the point-of-sale. Exposure to tobacco retail has been associated with smoking outcomes, but few studies have objectively logged day-to-day, real-world tobacco retail exposure and linked exposure to smoking outcomes, which can provide insight into dynamic associations.\n\nObjective: To assess pre-registered hypotheses that individuals report greater craving and cigarettes smoked on days when their objectively logged retail exposure is higher than usual. \n\nDesign: A 14-day within-person observational study combining geolocating tracking, public tobacco-retail location records, and ecological momentary assessment. Data collection occurred from 2022 to 2024.\n\nSetting: A remote study including participants statewide in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.\n\nParticipants: Main eligibility criteria were: aged 21-65 years, smoked at least five cigarettes per day for the previous six months, owned an iPhone or Android smartphone, and a resident of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware. Participants were selected via convenience sampling. A total of 310 participants enrolled and 273 participants were included in the final analysis.\n\nExposure: To assess tobacco retail exposure, mobility data collected objectively via geolocation tracking was matched with locations of tobacco retailers across three states.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Daily average craving and daily number of cigarettes smoked, reported via ecological momentary assessment.\n\nResults: Multilevel models revealed support for both pre-registered hypotheses. On days when individuals had more tobacco marketing exposure than their usual baseline, they reported significantly higher levels of craving (b = 0.04, t(3,456.79) = 2.56, p = 0.01) and smoking significantly more cigarettes (b = 0.01, t(3,469) = 2.47, p = 0.01).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: People’s environments shape their feelings and behaviors. Exposure to tobacco retail in the real-world is associated with increases in craving and smoking. Findings highlight the significance of retail exposure in relation to smoking, information that is critical for developing effective tobacco control interventions.",

          "abstract": "In our prior research, we found that higher ratings of ownership were associated with increased body schema (BS) plasticity during virtual tool-use training in younger healthy adults. However, in older adults, the emergence of ownership remained stable, and no incorporation of virtual tools was observed. Moreover, an increased sense of agency in older adults depended on virtual tool-use training, which relied on visuo-tactile feedback compared to vision only feedback condition, and participants’ learning performance. In contrast, a sense of agency in younger adults emerged independently of these factors. In this study, we tested whether training temporarily visually deprived (blindfolded) participants with a cane affects emergence of ownership and agency over the cane, and if this relates to BS of the hand within the perceived space. For this study, datasets from a total of 43 healthy young and older adults who underwent two conditions of tool-use training were analyzed. Training conditions were as follows: (Condition A) while blindfolded, using a cane to find a target object with no time restriction; and (Condition B) walking blindfolded with a cane for 20 minutes. Older adults had 10 minutes of training in conditions B. Changes in the BS were assessed using a tactile distance judgment task (TDJ), where participants judged distances between two tactile stimuli applied to their right hand in a proximodistal orientation. Plasticity of peripersonal space (PPS) was assessed using a reaching distance estimation task (RDE). Participants further rated their perceived ownership and agency after training blocks A and B. Results revealed while young adults demonstrated stronger adaptability and control across conditions, older adults showed resilience by employing alternative strategies in the absence of visual input relying more on incorporation of cane and space around them. This study highlights age-related differences in sensory processing and motor adaptation under visually deprived conditions.\nKeyword: Tool-use, young adults, old adults, vision, blindfolded, body schema, peripersonal space, sense of ownership and agency",

          "abstract": "The present study (N = 427) investigated the predictive and incremental validity of two measures of Dark Triad traits—the Dirty Dozen (DD) and the Five-Factor Model Antagonistic Triad Measure (FFM ATM)—in their relation to self-reported managerial leadership. Prior research has highlighted the complexity of Dark Triad (DT) traits, suggesting that unidimensional measures like the DD may obscure the nuanced relationships between these constructs and relevant outcomes. The FFM ATM disaggregates Dark Triad traits into both core components (Antagonism, Emotional Stability, Impulsivity, and Agency) as well as traditional DT subscales (e.g., Psychopathy comprises Antagonism, Emotional Stability, and Impulsivity). Results demonstrated that the FFM ATM provided substantially better statistical prediction and incremental validity across leadership dimensions. Specifically, both FFM ATM empirically derived factors and multidimensional DT subscales accounted for nearly all explained variance in leadership factors, outperforming the DD in predictive accuracy in all cases. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing the multidimensional structure of Dark Triad traits to capture their distinct and overlapping influences on leadership. Moreover, the results suggest that theoretically grounded and empirically robust measures like the FFM ATM offer a clearer description of how individual differences in Dark Triad traits relate to self-reported managerial leadership compared to short, omnibus measures.",

          "abstract": "Prior research showed that active tool use extends the body representation of both the forearm and hand wielding the tool and the calf, even without direct tool-environment interaction, particularly under blindfolded conditions (short-term visual deprivation) in young adults. In this research, we examined whether changes in body schema (BS) in the absence of vision induced by active tool-use training are limb-specific in young and older adults. Additionally, we examined whether plasticity of peripersonal space (PPS) predicts such effects. A total of 43 healthy young and older adults underwent three conditions of tool-use training: (Condition A) while blindfolded, using a cane to find a target object with no time restriction; (Condition B) walking blindfolded with a cane for 20 minutes; (Condition C) walking blindfolded without a cane for 20 minutes. Older adults had 10 minutes of training in conditions B and C. Changes in the BS were assessed using a tactile distance judgment task (TDJ), where participants judged distances between two tactile stimuli applied to their right forearm, hand, shin, and foot in a proximodistal orientation. PPS was assessed using a reaching distance estimation task (RDE). Findings suggest that while tool-use and task-specific conditions influence BS, their effects may be more localized and context-dependent than broadly systematic. Therefore, results of this study call into question to what degree and how robustly BS is plastic and limb specific in the absence of vision and how malleable this is by extension of the PPS toward the acting space by tool-use training in healthy aging.  \n\nKeyword: Tool-use, young adults, old adults, vision, blindfolded, body schema, peripersonal space",

          "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have prompted concerns about the proliferation of deepfake content—synthetic images, audio, and videos—online. StyleGan2, a powerful generative adversarial network architecture, can generate synthetic images of human faces that appear more realistic than actual human faces—a phenomenon termed AI hyperrealism. Across four preregistered experiments (total N = 661), we tested whether a novel behavioral intervention, termed DISCERN-AI, improved people’s ability to discriminate between real and synthetic StyleGan2 images. DISCERN-AI combines instructions about which visual features are diagnostic for classifying real and synthetic images with an inductive learning training protocol. In Experiment 1, participants completed a pre-test, DISCERN-AI, and a post-test. In Experiment 2, participants underwent DISCERN-AI or a control task before completing a post-test. In Experiments 3A and 3B, participants completed a shortened version of the intervention or control task, followed by an immediate post-test and a second post-test after 20 days. In all experiments, participants showed below-chance discrimination performance (AI hyperrealism) in the pre-test and control conditions. After completing DISCERN-AI, however, participants consistently showed above-chance discrimination performance, even when tested after 20 days. Together, the results provide support for an easily scalable intervention that substantially improves people’s ability to discriminate between real and synthetic StyleGan2 images.",

          "abstract": "Spousal support can mitigate stress’s impact on daily functioning and neural responses to stressors. However, the effectiveness of spousal support in reducing stress may be moderated by gender. The present study investigated the impact of observer presence in 66 heterosexual married couples, specifically a spouse or a confederate, on two neural indices of performance monitoring: early error detection (error-related negativity [ERN]) and later error awareness (error positivity [Pe]). Contrary to predictions, ERN was consistently smaller in observed conditions, suggesting that being observed, irrespective of the observer’s identity, diminished attention to errors. Notably, only women exhibited an enhanced ERN in the presence of their spouse, suggesting gender-specific differences in neural responses to spousal support during performance monitoring. Pe was larger when completing the task in the presence of a spouse and men displayed larger Pe than women. The present findings underscore the complex role of social context in performance monitoring, challenging existing assumptions about the uniformity of neural indices of performance monitoring during observation. Findings emphasize the need to dissect the nuanced interplay between observer presence, gender differences, and performance monitoring and offer valuable insights into the social modulation of error processing, particularly in a stressful observation context.",

First, the same shape can receive\ndifferent structural representations depending on how a preceding animation organizes it.\nSecond, subparts of shapes are easier to detect when they belong to the same subtree than\nwhen spanning different subtrees. Third, shape fragments are easier to reconfigure the\nhigher in the tree they are split. Unlike humans, state-of-the-art deep networks show no\nsyntactic effects whatsoever.

          "abstract": "Do ideological differences in moral concern reflect a true reversal of ethical priorities, or do liberals simply extend moral concern more broadly without compromising their commitment to close relationships? Across two large-scale reanalyses, we test the claim that liberal moral universalism comes at the expense of concern for close others. First, we analyze a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 1,000) weighted to match census benchmarks. Second, we conduct an integrative reanalysis of four large online convenience samples (N = 3,201; Prolific). Using the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), a widely used measure of moral concern, we examine how ideology shapes moral circles and whether concern for distant others competes with––or coexists alongside––care for those closer to home. Results show that greater concern for distant entities, including outgroups and non-human entities, positively correlates with concern for close others rather than displacing it. Moreover, across the ideological spectrum, ingroup favoritism remains a strong and consistent pattern. However, very conservative individuals in the representative sample showed no meaningful difference between their moral concern for ingroups and outgroups, driven not by heightened outgroup concern but by lower concern for close others. These findings challenge the notion that liberals neglect their immediate social circles and instead suggest that ideological differences in moral expansiveness stem from the degree to which concern extends outward. Our results have important implications for understanding how ideological worldviews shape moral priorities, particularly in a political climate where moral concern is often framed in zero-sum terms.",

          "abstract": "The study aimed to explore the understudied area of typical adult handwriting performance, focusing on the potential predictive roles of fine motor skills and executive functions. While the initial stages of handwriting acquisition are assumed to rely upon executive functions and fine motor skills, both components are no longer viewed as needed in automatized, expert handwriting. We tested this assumption by assessing the contributions of these components to handwriting performance in a group of 33 adult participants. Linear regressions were used to examine whether dexterity, manual praxis, working memory, inhibition and flexibility predict handwriting speed, legibility, and fluency. Results revealed that fine motor skills were a significant contributor to all aspects of handwriting performance. Executive functions also predicted handwriting performance, with a significant effect of flexibility on writing speed and of working memory on legibility. These findings highlight that, even at a high level of expertise and automatization, handwriting remains a motor skill whose performance depends on executive and fine motor control capacities. They suggest a predictive coding account of graphomotor control, whereby internal forward and inverse models would support the execution and monitoring of handwriting movements. This raises important questions about the extent to which disorders in motor and executive processes can affect handwriting performance and highlights the need for further research into this complex motor behavior.",

Contrary to prior studies, children with autism responded 189ms faster on average than typically developing children,  due to more overlapping speech. Latency decreased in both groups (47-78ms every 4 months) and depended on individual differences in socio-cognitive, linguistic, and motor skills, which for autism explained all variance by age. Both groups equally adapted their tempo to their interlocutors. With robust conceptualization and modeling techniques, we highlight the importance of overlapping speech, show that latencies in autism might be faster than in typical development and situate turn-taking into fine-grained developmental and interpersonal contexts.",

One process of alignment is lexical entrainment, whereby\npartners mirror and abbreviate their word usage to converge on shared terms for referents\nrelevant to the conservation. However, lexical entrainment may result in inefficient mimicry that\ndoes not add new information, suggesting that task-oriented communication may favor alignment\nthrough other means. The present study investigates the process of alignment in Danish\nconversations in which dyads learned to categorize unfamiliar “aliens” using trial-and-error\nfeedback. Performance improved as dyad communication became less verbose, measured as a\ndecrease in the entropy of word usage. Word usage also diverged between partners as measured\nby Jensen-Shannon Divergence, which indicates that alignment was not achieved through lexical\nentrainment. A computational model of dyadic communication is shown to account for the alien\ngame results in terms of joint least effort. The model shows that alignment of partner referents\ncan increase as a result of minimizing both the joint entropy of dyadic word usage, and the\nentropy of word usage conditioned on the separate partner referent distributions. We conclude\nthat the principle of least effort, originally proposed to shape language evolution, may also\nsupport alignment in task-oriented communication.",

          "abstract": "Almost nine out of ten Americans get some of their news online, and outlets compete to monetize their attention. One strategy for news outlets to capture people’s attention is by producing headlines that activate negative feelings and make group identities salient. Prior research has found that headlines containing negative emotions or identity language receive more engagement. However, most existing research is based on correlational data, making it unclear why this content drives engagement. The present work addresses this gap by analyzing 43,932 headlines tested in randomized controlled trials that generated 164,053,523 impressions from the Upworthy Research Archive. We find that headlines containing both negativity and identity language increased the click rate by 9,9%, which is more than twice as likely as headlines containing only negative language (4.3%) and about two-thirds higher than headlines with only identity language (5.9%). We also found causal evidence in support of the out-group animosity hypothesis: Negativity about out-groups boosted engagement by 14.1%, compared to just 1.6% for negativity about in-groups. Our findings reveal that news media companies have an incentive to produce news headlines containing out-group derogation to maximize engagement, which may, in turn, heighten animosity between groups.",

          "abstract": "Solving arithmetic word problems requires individuals to create a correct mental representation, and this involves both text processing and number processing. The latter comprises understanding the semantic meaning of numbers (i.e., their magnitudes) and potentially executing the appropriate mathematical operation. However, it is not yet clear whether number processing occurs after text processing or both take place simultaneously. We hypothesize that number processing occurs early and simultaneously with other problem-solving processes such as text processing. To test this hypothesis, we created non-solvable word problems that do not require any number processing and we manipulated the calculation difficulty using carry/borrow vs. non-carry/non-borrow within addition and subtraction problems. According to a strictly sequential model, this manipulation should not matter, because the problem is non-solvable, and no calculation is required. In contrast, according to an interactive model, attention to numbers would be higher when word problems require a carry/borrow compared to a non-carry/non-borrow operation. Eye-tracking was used to measure attention to numbers and text in 63 adults, operationalized by static (duration and count of fixations and regressions) and dynamic measures (count of transitions). An interaction between difficulty and operation was found for all static and dynamic eye-tracking variables as well as for response times and error rates. The observed number processing in non-solvable word problems, which indicates that it occurs simultaneously with text processing, is inconsistent with strictly sequential models.",

          "abstract": "*This manuscript is not yet published* Developing the ability to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant information is crucial for navigating an ever-changing environment. This skill, cognitive control, can be studied using conflict tasks in which the relevant and irrelevant information in a trial either align or compete (congruency). Performance in these tasks can be affected not only by the current trial’s congruency but also by the previous trial’s congruency. In adults, this conflict adaptation has been reported to occur between trials of the same task and different tasks. The goal of this study was to study the development and flexibility of cognitive control by assessing conflict adaptation across different age groups and contexts. Two groups of children (aged 6 and 9 years) and one group of adults processed adaptations of the Stroop and Simon tasks and the resulting mouse-tracking variables (total movement time, initiation time, maximum absolute deviation, changes of direction) were analysed. Across three experiments different context similarities were created depending on which tasks were combined. The results indicate that within-task conflict adaptation occurs in all age groups, and that some aspects of the unfolding response are increasingly affected by the current and previous trial’s congruency with age (namely, the deviation from a direct path to the correct response). Adults show less consistent across-task conflict adaptation effects as the paired tasks become more dissimilar, whereas data collected from children demonstrated conflict adaptation effects that transferred across tasks that were considered to be medium or low similarity. This represents a remarkable capacity for conflict adaptation early in development.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we present findings on how minority Roma and majority Serbian preschoolers perceive their own and the other group ethnic identity, and whether they are willing to interact with one another. In a conceptual replication of the seminal Doll study (Clark &amp; Clark, 1947), we individually interviewed 212 children age 5 to 7 from ethnically heterogeneous and ethnically homogeneous preschool groups on group categorization and self-categorization, content of stereotypes, markers of social status, and contact preferences. While we observed a typical pattern of ingroup preference in children from the majority (Serbian) ethnic group, we found the inverse in the Roma group: they identified with the lighter skin doll, attributed more positive traits to it, saw it as a higher status one, and chose it as the one they want to interact with. These markers of negative identity testify to internalized oppression at a very early age. We address similarities and differences in manifestations of oppression across groups and cultures. Drawing from the results, we offer ways to empower minority groups in their first education settings.",

          "abstract": "This paper is an updated English version of a report filed by a commission that the German Psychological Society (DGPs) appointed in 2022. The commission’s task was a) to identify factors in the academic system that enable and/or promote unethical behaviors, and b) to propose corrective measures. Based on expert interviews, a literature review, feedback form the community and discussions within the commission, the following problematic issues were identified: (P1) negligent or fraudulent scientific practices, (P2) abuse of power, (P3) insufficient mentoring of Early Career Researchers, (P4) insufficient quality of teaching, (P5) counterproductive incentives, (P6) overburdening of professors with tasks, (P7) fixed- and short-term contracts for most employees, (P8) unnecessarily steep power differentials, (P9) an ineffective peer-review system, (P10) lack of validity in personnel selection procedures, (P11) low awareness and commitment regarding ethical norms, and (P12) weak mechanisms for detecting and sanctioning unethical behavior. The commission offers concrete recommendations for changes to the academic system that should make the occurrence of unethical behavior less likely. Even though some of these recommendations might be rather specific for the field of psychology and for the German academic system, most of them may be valid for science in general.",

We investigated the individual differences in linguistic and domain-general skills that support verbal fluency and lead to this variability. In particular, we focused on the role of linguistic knowledge, which was calculated through six tests capturing vocabulary, amount of reading, and knowledge of grammar rules. We compared this to the role of three key domain-general skills: working memory (WM), processing speed, and nonverbal reasoning (IQ). 571 young native Dutch speakers completed semantic (category) and phonemic (letter) VF tasks, along with an individual differences test battery. We assessed the VF trials for the total number of correct words as well as two temporal variables, the time to first response and the time by which half of the responses have been produced. Linear mixed effects models revealed that linguistic knowledge was the strongest predictor of performance across all scores, and it had a larger effect than the domain-general skills. We discuss the role of linguistic knowledge and how it shapes the mental lexicon, concluding that better language skills lead to more efficient and detailed associative links between words that share semantic or phonological/orthographic features. We also provide updated norms for VF performance in Dutch and practical suggestions for using the task.",

          "abstract": "We report two experiments demonstrating that visual word recognition is impeded by the presence of nearby stimuli, especially adjacent words. Reading research has converged on a consensus that skilled readers control their attention to make use of information from adjacent (primarily upcoming) words, increasing reading efficiency. Other lines of research seem to point to potential interference from nearby items, yet this has not been investigated at the critical lexical level. To specifically target lexical activation, here we employ a novel variant of the visual world paradigm with masked (75 ms) flanked visual word targets, contrasting five flanker conditions across two experiments, namely none, repeated symbols, unknown font strings, pseudowords, and words. Analysis of multiple observed variables from 60 and 58 adult Norwegian speakers showed strong interference—compared to no flankers—for all flanker conditions except the repeated symbols. Interference increased with additional levels of possible flanker processing, and was greatest for higher-frequency word targets, consistent with rapid dynamic modulation of attentional breadth. Our findings demonstrate that nearby words interfere with lexical activation of the fixated word and call for a more nuanced approach to the role of preview in fluent reading. We conclude that skilled reading involves a constant complex interplay between the drive toward efficiency, which requires a broad attentional field, and the need to shield processing from interference, which limits attentional breadth.",

          "abstract": "Automated scoring (AS) has gained significant attention as a tool to enhance the efficiency and reliability of assessment processes. Yet, its application in low-resource languages, such as Turkish, remains limited. This study addresses this gap by empirically evaluating AS for Turkish using a zero-shot approach with a rubric powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o. A dataset of 590 essays written by learners of Turkish as a second language was scored by professional human raters and an artificial intelligence (AI) model integrated via a custom-built interface. The scoring rubric, grounded in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, assessed six dimensions of writing quality. Results revealed a strong alignment between human and AI scores with a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.93, Pearson correlation of 0.73, and an overlap measure of 83.5%. Analysis of rater effects showed minimal influence on score discrepancies, though factors such as experience and gender exhibited modest effects. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-driven scoring in Turkish, offering valuable insights for broader implementation in underrepresented languages. The limitations of the study, such as reliance on single-rater scores and focusing on a specific task type, highlight avenues for future research to expand and refine the proposed approach.",

          "authors": "Sahba Saberi",
          "abstract": "Background: The field of preventive psychological intervention has made significant strides, but a need persists for comprehensive frameworks with a strategic direction for large-scale implementation. Existing preventive programs face limitations that hinder their ability to reach a larger audience and have a broad impact.\n\nBody: The Fount Prevention Framework aims to bridge this gap by proposing strategies to enable preventive intervention programs to achieve scalability, reach a wider audience, enhance mental health outcomes, reduce the financial burden, and allow faster access for communities. This paper examines the fundamental features of the Fount Prevention Framework, which serves as a protocol designed to guide prevention and mental health promotion programs in achieving a broader impact.\n\nAdditionally, the paper examines a preventive program, Mind Wellbeing, developed based on this framework, as a practical application of how these principles can be implemented. Strategies that render the program independent of experts, trained facilitators, and technology-based delivery modes—including the use of a self-help, group-based mode of program delivery through physical, paperback workbooks—are examined. Other features of the program, such as its transdiagnostic, universal, and comprehensive nature, are explored in light of the need to foster widespread prevention coverage and broader public engagement and participation. Limitations and challenges of the program are also addressed, offering insights into the broader application of the framework and considerations necessary for achieving a goal of this magnitude.\n\nConclusion: Through ongoing empirical research and innovative strategizing to overcome the intrinsic challenges faced by programs of this nature, the measures proposed by this framework may present a compelling avenue for influencing global mental health and a potential pathway to enhancing mental health outcomes worldwide.",

This study uses behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to investigate the STEM-focused mindset, i.e. ways of associating and perceiving ideas, of 177 human participants and 177 artificial humans simulated by GPT-3.5. Participants were split in 3 groups - trainees, experts and academics - to compare the influence of expertise level on their mindsets. The results revealed that human forma mentis networks exhibited significantly higher clustering coefficients compared to GPT-3.5’s, indicating that human mindsets displayed a tendency to form and close triads of conceptual associations while recollecting STEM ideas. Human experts, in particular, demonstrated robust clustering coefficients, reflecting better integration of STEM concepts into their cognitive networks. In contrast, GPT-3.5 produced sparser networks with weaker clustering, highlighting its limitations in replicating human-like mindsets. Furthermore, both human and GPT mindsets framed “mathematics” in neutral/positive terms, differently from STEM high-schoolers, researchers and other large language models sampled in other works. This research contributes to understanding how mindset structure can provide cognitive insights about memory structure and machine limitations.",

          "abstract": "For much of the global population, climate change appears as a slow, gradual shift in daily weather. This leads many to perceive its impacts as minor and results in apathy (the \"boiling frog\" effect). How can we convey the urgency of the crisis when its impacts appear so subtle? Here, through a series of large-scale cognitive experiments (N=799), we find that presenting people with binary climate data (e.g., lake freeze history) significantly increases the perceived impact of climate change (Cohen's d = 0.40 [0.26, 0.54]) compared to continuous data (e.g., mean temperature). Computational modeling and follow-up experiments (N=398) suggest that binary data enhances perceived impact by creating an \"illusion\" of sudden shifts. Crucially, our approach does not involve selective data presentation but rather compares different datasets that reflect equivalent trends in climate change over time. These findings, robustly replicated across multiple experiments, provide a cognitive basis for the \"boiling frog\" effect and offer a psychologically grounded approach for policymakers and educators to improve climate change communication while maintaining scientific accuracy.",

Following an identified community need, we co-developed a semi-structured discussion and arts-based measure with the guidance of an Indigenous Community Council. Methods. This study involved 12 adult community members, 11 of whom identify as First Nation and one of whom identifies a Métis. Two members were First Nations Elders. All members of the Council held knowledge related to mental health, wellbeing, social work, traditional knowledge, policy development, and/or Indigenous governance. Indigenous Community Council facilitated small group meetings were conducted online due to social-distancing pandemic requirements to develop a culturally grounded wellness assessment suitable for use with Indigenous children, youth and families. Results. Analyses suggest conversational and arts-based methods to be most culturally relevant in keeping with traditional values of relational wellbeing and storytelling. Additional themes of importance included reciprocity related to providing resources and tangible supports to those who interact with the wellness assessment. Wholism, a limited focus on numeracy, and a strengths-based approach were also revealed to be critical. These results produced the core questions to be used within the wellness assessment created in fulfillment of study aims. Implications and Future Directions. The purpose of the development of this tool is to meet the wellness needs of Indigenous children and families through traditional values and metrics of wellbeing. This approach is used to promote autonomy for Indigenous families by creating a means for understanding wellness developed by Indigenous people, for Indigenous people. The impact of this research will span across community, policy, and practice to contribute to health and wellness sovereignty for Indigenous Peoples in support of intergenerational family thriving.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies show that word learning from context can be intrinsically rewarding, even in the absence of external feedback or incentives. Intrinsic reward activates the brain’s reward-memory circuit, leading to enhanced memory for words people enjoyed learning. Existing studies have tested the link between contextual word learning and reward in the written domain only (i.e., through reading). However, word learning from context often occurs in the oral domain, where conversations provide a rich source for acquiring vocabulary in both first and second language learning. In this online behavioral study, we investigate whether word learning triggers intrinsic reward across modalities, focusing on listening, reading, and listening and reading in combination. In all the modalities, we found that when words are successfully learned from context, people report greater levels of enjoyment. We also found that words that were associated with higher enjoyment ratings during learning were recognised better than those associated with lower enjoyment. Our results demonstrate the relevance of intrinsic reward for language learning and suggest that the link between contextual word learning and reward operates on higher-level word representations, rather than on modality-specific ones.",

Specifically, a theoretical model that specifies how and how much people revise their goal following goal success or failure is lacking. Therefore, we synthesized previous empirical studies on goal revision to shed light on the processes and individual differences in goal revision. The 28 studies that met the inclusion criteria revealed a clear pattern: People raised their goals after success and lowered them after failure. Results of a meta-analysis further showed that the discrepancy between goal and performance predicted the strength of upward goal revision after success and downward goal revision after failure (r = .51). Moreover, a narrative summary of previously tested moderators revealed two mechanisms by which moderators might influence the direction and strength of goal revision, namely by affecting (1) the direct link between goal-performance discrepancy and goal revision or (2) self-efficacy, which emerged as a central mediating variable between goal-performance discrepancy and goal revision. Based on these findings, we developed the Triple-A Model (Assessment, Appraisal, Adjustment) of Goal Revision, which allows deriving directional hypotheses about how much people revise their goals after goal successes and failures.",

Intrapersonal conflicts related to internet consumption were negatively affected by Narcissism scores and positively affected by Machiavellianism. Psychopathy scores explained interpersonal conflicts related to internet consumption scores.

We found that people report lower autonomy when interacting with others compared to when alone. This is especially true for people with higher levels of trait attachment avoidance. Importantly, interaction partner matters: People report higher autonomy during interactions with romantic partners compared to when alone. These findings provide ecologically valid evidence for a tradeoff between relatedness and autonomy during social interactions with non-romantic others, but show that relatedness and autonomy go hand in hand during interactions with romantic partners.",

Despite the importance of trust in AI as an influencing factor for this interaction, there is a shortage of validated scales to reliably measure users’ trust.

To validate the scale, we conducted two studies. In study 1 (N = 883 participants), we derived 57 items from theory and existing scales for which an exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 30 item scale. In study 2 (N = 1204 participants), we tested the psychometric quality of the scale through confirmatory factor analysis for ordinal data. Employing a bifactor model with global trust as the higher-order factor, our results confirm the six-factor structure. Correlational results of context variables and related scales support the convergent validity of the scale. Results show that existing scales rather correlate with the global trust factor but less with specific factors (especially vigilance) - indicating that the TAIS scale helps to uncover new facets of trust and thereby goes beyond what existing, less validated scales can provide.",

          "abstract": "Affect dynamics are often studied by means of first-order autoregressive (AR) modeling applied to intensive longitudinal data. A key target in these studies is the AR parameter, which is often tied conceptually to regulatory behavior in the affective process. The data is typically gathered using experience sampling methods, which are designed to pick up on fluctuations in affective variables as they evolve over time in naturalistic settings. In this manuscript, we compare classical time-contingent sampling designs to episode-contingent sampling designs, which initiate sampling when an emotional episode has been signalled. We define emotional episodes as periods where an affective process strays relatively far away from its mean. Compared to time-contingent designs, episode-contingent designs leverage on increased affective variability, which can have beneficial implications for the precision of the ordinary least squares AR effect estimator. Using an extensive simulation study, we attempt to delineate which characteristics of an episode-contingent design are important to consider, and how these characteristics are related to estimation benefits. We then turn to an empirical illustration, showing how an episode-contingent design can be implemented in practice. We also show that various patterns we expect based on the theoretical parts of the manuscript are recovered in the data. We conclude that episode-contingent designs can have marked benefits for the precision of the AR effect estimator, and discuss a number of challenges when it comes to implementing episode-contingent designs in practice.",

          "authors": "Andrzej Uhl; Malia Marks; Paweł Ostaszewski",
          "abstract": "Right wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) are routinely used to predict punitiveness and believed by some to form the dispositional basis of punitive attitudes towards offenders. The measures of punishment preferences employed in this line of research have been discredited in criminology as vague and biased. Instead, this study used sentencing vignettes distributed as part of a large population survey. Contradicting the assumptions of extant research, our data indicated that there may not be a single underlying punitiveness trait. Rather, we identified clusters of punishment responses with a latent class analysis. At odds with theoretical and empirical understandings of the authoritarian personality, the effect of RWA on punitiveness was partially suppressed by SDO, which itself was associated with lower punitiveness. Moreover, the subscales of RWA produced opposing effects on recommended sentences, undermining the assumption that RWA should be considered unidimensionally. The predictive power of scales derived from political psychology is modest and does not improve models differentiating between higher levels of punitiveness.",

          "abstract": "We introduce the EnvisionHGdetector toolkit (v1.0.0.1), which allows for the kinematic analysis\nof automatically detected co-speech gestures from single-person videos. The convolutional neural net-\nwork model for detecting gestures is trained using TensorFlow on five open datasets – ZHUBO, SaGA,\nMULTISIMO, ECOLANG, and TEDM3D – which, combined, represent over 8,000 instances of ges-\ntures with varying recording conditions. Inspired and further building on the action detection tool Nod-\nding Pigeon [57], it utilizes MediaPipe Holistic for skeleton-based tracking, and a CNN model for classi-\nfication, running efficiently with CPU only. The tool is designed to work in an out-of-the-box fashion,\napplicable for any single-person frontal view recording, without custom (p)re-training on specific target\ndatasets. On our test set, we attain an average gesture detection accuracy of 73-78% (False Positive Rate 21-\n33%, False Negative Rate 36-48%) for co-speech gesture detection. The envisionHGdetector pypi package\npackage produces as output gesture segment labels, label confidence time series, segmented videos, as well\nas ELAN files, DTW distance matrices for gestures similarities, kinematic feature summaries, and a data\nvisualization and exploration dashboard. The code for the package and training is available on GitHub,\nand the training feature data is archived at the OSF. We further discuss this project’s outlook, which aims\nto improve the integration of open-source computational innovations in gesture studies.",

          "abstract": "This paper argues that psychological theories about conspiracy theories need better cross-cultural applicability. The authors demonstrate mathematically that complex theories are less likely to replicate across different cultures. They specifically critique the use of discrete emotions (like fear, anger, or pride) in explaining reactions to conspiracy theories, as these emotional concepts vary significantly across cultures. Instead, they propose using simpler dimensions of emotional response - valence (positive/negative) and arousal (intensity) - which have shown greater cross-cultural validity. This more streamlined approach could make theories about conspiracy beliefs more globally applicable, though it might capture fewer specifics about behavioral outcomes.",

College student participants completed experience sampling method self-reports (N = 352, 10,046 observations) of their momentary social interactions, feelings of social connectedness, autonomy, and positive affect. We found that people report lower autonomy when interacting with others compared to when alone. This is especially true for people with higher levels of trait attachment avoidance. Importantly, interaction partner matters: People report higher autonomy during interactions with romantic partners compared to when alone. These findings provide ecologically valid evidence for a tradeoff between relatedness and autonomy during social interactions with non-romantic others, but show that relatedness and autonomy go hand in hand during interactions with romantic partners.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents who possess effective emotion regulation skills are more likely to feel better and show positive development. While the social context plays an important role in emotional experiences and emotion regulation, research is lacking on the influence of social context on emotion regulation effectiveness. By capturing dynamic within-person patterns of emotion regulation strategy (ERS) use and emotions in adolescents’ social contexts, this study investigated associations between positive and negative ERS use in the past hour and changes in both positive and negative emotions in the current moment. Additionally, we examined whether these relationships were moderated by peer affiliation, as measured by peer closeness and peer status. This study employed Experience Sampling Methods during 14 consecutive days in 291 Dutch adolescents, collected in Spring 2023 and 2024 (N observations = 6,685, 36.3% boys, 92.6% Dutch, mean age = 15.76, SDage = 0.70, age range = 14-19, compliance = 54.70%). Findings indicated that rumination, expression, and sharing of negative emotions were related to increases in negative emotions, whereas rumination, expression, and sharing of positive emotions related to increases in positive emotions. Although ERS use of negative emotions was not associated with positive emotions, rumination over positive emotions was associated with increases in negative emotions and expression of positive emotions with decreases in negative emotions. No moderation effects of peer closeness and peer status were identified. Results highlight that ERS use has distinct effects on positive and negative emotions, emphasizing the potential importance of encouraging the use of certain positive ERS to support adolescents' mental well-being.",

          "abstract": "How prevalent is autism in higher education? Research to date has not specifically addressed this seemingly straightforward question. Yet, an answer may be critical to the advancement of research, policy, and practice related to autistic students in higher education. This paper addresses three related but distinct questions about autistic students’ college enrollment within the United States: 1) What percentage of autistic high school students go on to college? 2) What percentage of students registered with their postsecondary institutions’ Disability Services Offices are autistic? 3) What percentage of enrolled undergraduates are autistic? To answer these questions, we examined more than 700 publications, reviewed more than a dozen common survey instruments used at postsecondary institutions, and pulled data from several federal datasets. We assessed each of these sources and synthesized their findings to generate a range of estimates regarding the prevalence of autism in higher education. Considering only those studies for which we held moderate or high confidence regarding the quality and generalizability of their data, the best available evidence suggests 42.9% – 47.0% of high school students with autism continue on to college and 2.8% – 4.0% of college students registered with their schools’ Disability Service Offices are autistic. Ultimately, our calculations suggest there are likely between 84,896 and 213,598 autistic undergraduates currently attending college in the United States. These estimates can be used by researchers, policymakers, and educators to highlight the importance of attending to the interests, needs, experiences, and outcomes for autistic students.",

          "abstract": "Successful personalized treatment requires a thorough understanding of the complex dynamic processes underlying disorders. Intensive longitudinal methods (e.g., experience sampling) that ask patients to complete multiple-item questionnaires several times a day are ideally suited for this. However, collecting such data entails severe patient burden, especially for those with low energy and little concentration (e.g., patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue and/or psychological disorders such as Somatic Symptom Disorder). This burden is currently predominantly lightened with single-item measures, but these cannot validly capture complex conditions, leading to a catch-22 situation: Capturing complex dynamic processes and effective personalized treatment require intensive longitudinal patient data on multiple-item questionnaires, but patients cannot provide this type of data because it is too taxing. To solve this problem, we developed a personalized missingness design that presents an individualized and time-varying minimal subset of items on each occasion, thereby striking an optimal balance between thoroughly mapping patients’ symptoms and keeping the number of items a person needs to answer to a minimum. The design builds on multilevel factor analyses to determine which sets of items are most informative, which can change over time. Expert-informed simulations validated our new design. While the design can be universally applied to any measurement of (psychological) symptoms (e.g., to inform cognitive behavioral therapy), we tailored our simulations to patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue in collaboration with experts in Psycho-Oncology. In the near future, the design will be implemented in the widely used experience sampling app m-Path in collaboration with the developers.",

The vast majoriy of prior research explored the emotional contagion in face-to-face human interaction. The present study explored the degree to which emotional contagion occurs in dyadic online video conferences, using subjective self-report and automatically coded facial expression data. In a lab-based experimental approach, 104 participants (in 52 dyads) interacted via synchronized computers. They were prompted to talk to each other about recent personally relevant experiences that made them angry, happy, and sad (3 conditions). We recorded participants’ emotions by means of automated facial expression analysis and retrospective self-report after each condition. Our preregistered analyses provided evidence for emotional contagion of all three emotions during the video conferences based on the self-report data. Regarding facially expressed emotions, only joy seemed to be transmitted, while the frequency of facially expressed anger and sadness was generally very low, and did not differ across conditions. We further explored temporal co-occurrences of facially expressed joy through cross-recurrence quantification analysis. Those results showed that both interaction partners’ facial expressions of joy, but not of anger and sadness, co-occurred significantly above chance. Overall, we conclude that emotions can be transmitted across interaction partners during online video interactions, but the face does not seem to be the key channel for those contagion processes, particularly not for negative emotions.",

A common assumption is that children’s limited control explains their reduced moral responsibility --- but do adults' factual beliefs about children’s control align with their moral judgments? In three online vignette studies with UK and US adults (N = 481), participants assessed the likelihood of blameworthy behaviors in characters aged 2 to 40 years and judged their moral responsibility when these behaviors were explicitly attributed to a lack of specific types of control. Our findings suggest that the relationship between perceived control and moral responsibility is shaped by age: while participants expected a strong link between behavior likelihood and responsibility in adulthood, this association was absent in early childhood. This pattern indicates that early childhood may be viewed as a general phase of reduced moral responsibility, independent of adults’ beliefs about children’s actual levels of behavioral and cognitive control.",

The findings indicate that (1) the HCI community is less involved in the study of mental state attributions, (2) a lacking validity of the measures limits the current measurement of mental state attributions, (3) there is a skew towards chat- and voice bots, and (4) mental state attributions increased vulnerabilities of users and shifts in accountability.",

          "abstract": "Changes to one’s pain processing system via external or cognitive influences may influence how we perceive the world around us and interact with other people. To investigate the causal effects of different types of (psycho)pharmacological pain modulation on social emotions and behaviour, we conducted a pre-registered PRISMA-guided, systematic literature review. Our main aim was to investigate how interfering with the perception of pain in oneself through (psycho)pharmacological manipulations affects our abilities to perceive, process and react to positive and negative emotions (including pain) in other individuals. We included and synthesized 50 out of 2060 screened studies. Included studies investigated the effects of opioids and opioid antagonists, acetaminophen, capsaicin, cannabinoids, ketamine, alcohol, placebo analgesia and hypnotic analgesia. Overall risk of bias was low in 23, medium in 12 and high in 14 studies, while only 24% of studies checked whether the manipulation reduced first-hand pain (which it did in all of these). In summary, studies report inconsistent results, with findings generally showing small effects in both directions, i.e., an increase or decrease of social emotions or abilities. The strongest and most consistent effect was observed for placebo analgesia decreasing empathy for pain. These results can be attributed to study heterogeneity, pharmacological effect and mode of action, as well as dosage differences. This review thus shows that we are far away from understanding the intricacies of different (psycho)pharmacological pain manipulations and their effects on social emotions and behaviour. To advance as a field and better understand the mechanisms of this interplay, we need well-powered studies, large-scale, systematic replications and meta-analyses.",

          "abstract": "Common challenges such as feeling overwhelmed, burned out, or disengaged often remain hidden due to fear of judgment or social norms, contributing to rising mental health crises and organizational dysfunction. This study presents a brain-based framework for predicting these hidden and persistent psychological states through noninvasive neuroimaging. We used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record neural activity from 67 businesspeople in the field as they watched a video about workplace attitudes. We then applied a novel multi-timepoint pattern analysis (MTPA) approach to reduce timeseries dimensionality and successfully classify whether individuals were feeling overwhelmed (72.84% accuracy) or in need of a new or different challenge (79.13% accuracy) in their careers using the TPJ and dmPFC, respectively. The MTPA framework also allowed us to reverse-engineer specific thematic properties of the stimulus that evoked differential neural responses linked to these predicted outcomes. Emotional content in the video (e.g., reported distress) corresponded to the selected TPJ features that predicted whether someone felt overwhelmed, while socially relevant content (e.g., missing social gatherings) aligned with the selected features from the dmPFC that predicted the need for a new or different challenge. These findings demonstrate the ability of neural measures to unobtrusively identify hidden and persistent psychological states in real-world settings, enabling targeted interventions that can improve well-being and engagement.",

          "abstract": "The current study examined the effects of positive vocal transformation feedback in social anxiety-provoking situations. Previous studies have indicated that explicit feedback on internal states associated with anxiety may lead to a negative interpretation of states and then increase anxiety. Additionally, conflicting results have been reported regarding the effects of explicit positive feedback, showing anxiety reduction or anxiety maintenance. In the current literature, the role of implicit processing in positive feedback has not been fully understood. In this study, participants were asked to read aloud a text under the social anxiety-provoking situation that would be evaluated by others. During the task, real-time vocal transformation feedback was provided, incorporating acoustic features with positive emotions. The results showed that skin conductance level was reduced without being aware of the feedback in participants who received positive vocal feedback.

          "abstract": "Institutional legitimacy is essential for democratic functioning, yet public trust and confidence in the United States Congress is at an all-time low. A significant predictor of attitudes toward Congress is perceptions of corruption, with greater perceptions of corruption in government linked to less trust. This study tests whether knowledge of Congressional stock trading affects trust, legitimacy, and compliance with Congressional authority. In a preregistered survey experiment with U.S. citizens (n = 506), participants who read a nonpartisan report detailing how Congress members made higher than expected profits from stock trading in 2024 reported decreased trust and increased perceptions of corruption in Congress. They also viewed laws passed by Congress as less fair and reported being less willing to comply with such laws. Mediation analyses revealed that reduced perceptions of Congressional legitimacy fully mediated the effect of stock trading knowledge on willingness to comply with congressional laws and perceptions of congressional laws being fair. A pre-registered follow-up experiment (n = 664) shows these effects are not driven by the amount that Congress members profit but by how profits negatively affect broader perceptions of legitimacy. These findings highlight the detrimental effects of Congressional stock trading on public perceptions of legitimacy and respect for the rule of law.",

Here, we holistically examine perceived causal interdependence among 15 moral virtues and 13 moral vices.

We find people generally believe in facilitation effects, where improving one trait improves other traits and worsening one trait worsens other traits. Specifically, people believe that increasing one virtue tends to increase other virtues (Study 1) and decrease other vices (Studies 3–4). Similarly, people believe that increasing one vice tends to increase other vices (Study 2) and decrease other virtues (Studies 3–4). Perceived tradeoffs were rare and involved laziness and cowardice decreasing or being decreased by other vices.

          "abstract": "Non-nutritive sucking (NNS), including pacifier use and thumb sucking, is common in infants and has been associated with both positive and negative developmental outcomes. While NNS is known to reduce distress, sustained use has been linked to lower vocabulary scores (Muñoz et al., 2024). The present longitudinal study investigates the relationship between NNS and word comprehension in 69 Norwegian infants. Parents reported their infant’s NNS use concurrently (C-NNS) at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months old, which was used to derive measures of lifespan use (L-NNS) and relative changes in NNS. Word comprehension was measured using eye-tracking, and vocabulary size was assessed through parental reports (CDIs). Neither L-NNS nor changes over time were significantly associated with language measures. However, greater concurrent NNS (C-NNS) correlated with reduced word comprehension in older infants. These findings extend Muñoz et al. (2024) and provide additional evidence on the role of NNS in language acquisition.",

          "abstract": "A comprehensive cognitive science requires broad sampling of human behavior to justify general inferences about the mind. For example, the field of psycholinguistics relies on a rich history of comparative study, with many available resources that systematically document many languages. Surprisingly, despite a longstanding interest in questions of universality and diversity, the psychology of music has few such resources. Here, we report the Expanded Natural History of Song Discography, an open-access corpus of vocal music (n = 1007 song excerpts), with accompanying metadata detailing each song’s region of origin, language (of 413 languages represented here), and one of 10 behavioral contexts (e.g., work, storytelling, mourning, lullaby, dance). The corpus is designed to sample both broadly, with a large cross-section of societies and languages; and deeply, with many songs representing three well-studied language families (Atlantic-Congo, Austronesian, and Indo-European). This design facilitates direct comparison of musical and vocal features across cultures, principled approaches to sampling stimuli for experiments, and evaluation of models of the cultural \nevolution of song. In this paper we describe the corpus and provide two proofs of concept, demonstrating its utility. We show that (1) the acoustical forms of songs are predictive of their behavioral contexts, including in previously unstudied contexts (e.g., children’s play songs); and (2) similarities in acoustic content of songs across cultures are predictable, in part, by the relatedness of those cultures.",

          "abstract": "Compassion – defined as care and concern for others' suffering – is a core value in all world religions. Yet, extending compassion is often challenging, requiring individuals to overcome significant personal and situational barriers. Could religious practices help navigate these barriers, fostering greater compassion? Across five studies (total N = 2,210) sampling from diverse faiths (Christians, Muslims, Buddhists), we investigate whether, when, and why engaging in religious practices promotes compassionate responses. These responses were measured as the selection of compassion-inducing situations and the upregulation of state compassion when witnessing suffering in various contexts (e.g., daily life, difficult events, victims of war). Religious practices, both public (worship attendance) and private (prayer), were consistently associated with greater compassionate responses (small to moderate association), even in the face of situational challenges, whether measured (e.g. target neediness, Study 1) or manipulated (i.e., compassion collapse for many victims, Study 2). Using experience sampling, we find that within-person fluctuations in religious practice are associated with momentary increases in compassion (Study 3). We further demonstrate that participating in religious practices increased compassionate choices, as shown in a natural experiment during Easter (Study 4). Finally, we identify two mechanisms – valuing compassion and feeling closer to those who suffer (Study 5) – that explain these associations. By bridging religion, emotion, and prosociality literatures, this work highlights how engaging in religious practices motivates compassionate responses to suffering, advancing theory on motivated compassion and its situational regulation.",

A large body of work has demonstrated that expert athletes perform better than novices and non-athletes on sport-specific tasks, but the transfer of sports training to more general laboratory-based measures of perception and cognition is less clear. A number of studies have explored the relationship between sports expertise and perceptual-cognitive abilities, but some findings are contradictory, and there is a lack of clarity of effects associated with various facets of attention. This study aimed to assess whether university-level athletes demonstrate superior performance across a broad range of visual-attentional skills compared to non-athletes, while controlling for potential motivational differences between the groups. We administered a comprehensive battery of computer-based visual tasks to university hockey players and non-athlete student controls. Our tasks assessed selective attention (Eriksen Flanker Task), sustained dynamic attention (Multiple-Object Tracking), spatial distribution of attention (Useful Field of View), and basic perception (Line Comparison). We found that, compared to controls, the hockey players demonstrated enhanced performance in measures of selective attention and in identifying transient stimuli at central fixation, even after controlling for potential group differences in motivation and strategy. Our results provide novel insight into sport-specific and sport-general cognitive enhancements associated with competitive sport training and have implications for generalised enhancements in cognitive performance.",

This study aimed to examine the levels of the two factors of the Self-Compassion Scale (self-compassion and self-coldness) and their associations with cultural values at the individual level in Western and East-Asian cultural contexts, and the possible moderating role of alexithymia. Data were collected from 397 adults from the general population living in Ireland and China. Chinese participants reported more self-compassion and less self-coldness than Irish participants. In the Irish sample, greater horizontal individualism was associated with higher levels of self-compassion; moreover, vertical collectivism was associated with higher levels of self-coldness, whereas the relationships were more complicated in the Chinese sample since both individualistic and collectivistic cultural values were found to be positively correlated with self-compassion and self-coldness. Furthermore, in both samples, marginal interaction effects were found between alexithymia and specific cultural values when predicting self-compassion and self-coldness. Overall, this study highlights the dynamic nature of culture and indicates the understanding of two-factor construct of the Self-Compassion Scale may be culture-specific. Moreover, this is the first study to explore how alexithymia interacts with cultural values at the individual level to influence self-compassion and self-coldness, contributing preliminary evidence to the field of cross-cultural alexithymia.",

          "abstract": "How prevalent is autism in higher education? Research to date has not specifically addressed this seemingly straightforward question. Yet, an answer may be critical to the advancement of research, policy, and practice related to autistic students in higher education. This paper addresses three related but distinct questions about autistic students’ college enrollment within the United States: 1) What percentage of autistic high school students go on to college? 2) What percentage of students registered with their postsecondary institutions’ Disability Services Offices are autistic? 3) What percentage of enrolled undergraduates are autistic? To answer these questions, we examined more than 700 publications, reviewed more than a dozen common survey instruments used at postsecondary institutions, and pulled data from several federal datasets. We assessed each of these sources and synthesized their findings to generate a range of estimates regarding the prevalence of autism in higher education. Considering only those studies for which we held moderate or high confidence regarding the quality and generalizability of their data, the best available evidence suggests 42.9% – 47.0% of high school students with autism continue on to college and 2.8% – 4.0% of college students registered with their schools’ Disability Service Offices are autistic. Ultimately, our calculations suggest there are likely between 84,896 and 213,598 autistic undergraduates currently attending college in the United States. These estimates can be used by researchers, policymakers, and educators to highlight the importance of attending to the interests, needs, experiences, and outcomes for autistic students.",

How parents resolve this dilemma is linked to various child developmental outcomes, yet we know little about the cognitive computations that underlie parents’ decision to intervene. Here, we model parenting decisions as a Bayesian solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and qualitatively compare predictions with behavioral data from real-time parent-child interactions. Empirically, we find that parents are more likely to take over when they believe children are less skilled and when tasks are challenging, and more likely to step back when they believe their child can learn from doing the task on their own. The model captures the fine-grained ways in which these factors shape parent decision-making and, alongside the empirical data, uncovers the cognitive computations that drive parental intervention.",

          "abstract": "Background: Schizophrenia, characterized by symptoms such as auditory and visual hallucinations, imposes significant challenges on mental health care. Recent research highlights the potential of meditation to alleviate symptoms by enhancing emotional regulation and neuroplasticity. This study examines the role of meditation as an adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia, exploring its neurobiological underpinnings and practical integration into care models.\n\nMethods: A mixed-methods approach was employed. Quantitative data were analyzed from clinical trials and intervention studies assessing meditation-based therapies in schizophrenia. Metrics included changes in symptom severity, cognitive performance, and quality of life using standardized scales such as PANSS and WHO-QOL. Qualitative data were collected through structured interviews with patients and practitioners, analyzed using thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns and insights into the feasibility and cultural acceptance of meditation in schizophrenia care. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate effect sizes and correlations between meditation practices and symptom improvement.\n\nResults: Findings indicate that meditation significantly modulates neural circuits associated with stress and emotional dysregulation, reducing symptom severity and improving coping mechanisms. Quantitative analysis revealed consistent reductions in PANSS scores (p &lt; 0.05) and improved quality-of-life measures. Thematic analysis highlighted increased self-awareness and reduced distress from hallucinations as key benefits. Providers emphasized the need for personalized meditation protocols tailored to individual symptom profiles.\n\nConclusion: Meditation offers a promising complementary strategy for managing schizophrenia symptoms, supported by both quantitative and qualitative evidence. Its integration into treatment plans requires interdisciplinary collaboration and sensitivity to cultural contexts. Future research should focus on long-term efficacy and refining protocols to maximize therapeutic outcomes.",

We test whether a rank-based nudge (RBN) informing individuals how their post-tax income ranks globally increases charitable donations. Further, because people have been shown to shift their reference point for who should give to charity based on their current income, we inves- tigate whether donations can be boosted by asking how much people with different income ranks should give to charity (in- junctive distribution task, IDT) before administering the RBN. Participants (N = 1,217) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: control, RBN, IDT, or IDT+RBN. Those in the RBN conditions donated significantly more and reduced over- estimation of others’ income across all percentiles of the global income distribution. However, the addition of the IDT did not further increase donations. These findings suggest that RBNs effectively boost generosity by correcting misperceptions of relative affluence.",

It can be read as a reminder of the need for more tolerance and diversity in our approach to linguistic research. However, its central thesis is more ambitious and controversial than this: it seeks to reformulate the field by suggesting that linguistics should be centred on the problem of how our language ability evolved. It also promotes the belief that this language ability is best studied as a collection of individual skills and it suggests that the method best suited to this problem is the use of paleo-genetic evidence. This review highlights this interpretation of the monograph and offers a critique of this perspective by suggesting that the structure and cognitive properties of language should remain our focus.

          "abstract": "Background: Preliminary evidence suggests psilocybin may have therapeutic value for various mental health conditions; despite this, it is currently illegal in the UK. Less is known about how people form their attitudes towards psilocybin policies. \n\nObjectives: To explore whether beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin influence support for psilocybin policies.\n\nMethods: In an online survey experiment, 804 participants were randomised to receive one of four interventions in a 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin benefits) x 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin safety) design. Public support for four psilocybin policies and beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin were measured before and after participants were randomised to a group.\n\nResults:  In a two-way ANCOVA, the Benefits Intervention significantly increased policy support overall and for two of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately. Furthermore, the Benefits Intervention significantly strengthened beliefs that psilocybin is beneficial and safe. The Safety Intervention increased psilocybin policy support overall (d = .10, p = .003); and for three of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately. The Safety Intervention also strengthened beliefs that psilocybin is safe but not that it is beneficial.\n\nConclusions: Communicating the benefits and safety of psilocybin can increase psilocybin policy support and strengthen beliefs about psilocybin, however further research is needed to explore the longevity of these results.",

          "abstract": "Bilateral cochlear implantation is the typical intervention for children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss intended to support development of skills across language, cognitive, social, behavioural and academic domains. However, speech-perception outcomes post-implantation remain variable. This scoping review explores which contextual factors relate to speech perception and hearing outcomes following paediatric bilateral cochlear implantation based on themes aligned with Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory: 1) individual; 2) microsystem; 3) exosystem; 4) macrosystem; and 5) chronosystem. Twenty-three research articles met the criteria for inclusion, and the contextual factors identified ranged from the proximal context, such as individual cognitive and social development, cochlear implant usage and the home environment, to the distal context, such as socio-economic health determinants. Contextual factors were explored with a narrative synthesis approach, with methodological limitations discussed. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) criteria. Our results indicate that research on outcomes related to bilateral cochlear implantation should actively integrate and examine contextual factors in prospective, longitudinal designs. This approach will facilitate the development of interventions to target specific levels of the bioecological system, thereby improving outcomes for the paediatric bilateral cochlear implant recipient.",

          "abstract": "Research on dyslexia and bilingualism has largely been conducted separately (Cline, 2000). This systematic review explores the interaction between bilingualism and dyslexia by summarising and synthesising studies that include bilingual dyslexic readers (DRs). The goal is to identify aspects of dyslexia that are independent of multilingual experience and to determine the most appropriate diagnostic tests for bilingual populations. We include 40 studies, categorised into three groups: studies involving only bilingual dyslexic and typical readers (TRs), studies comparing monolingual and bilingual DRs and TRs, and studies predicting poor reading in bilingual populations. Our findings indicate that rapid naming and reading impairments remain prevalent in bilingual dyslexic populations. Phonological awareness, a common deficit in dyslexia, appears to be less impaired in bilingual readers. Notably, language experience is associated with more differences in DRs than TRs, suggesting that bilingualism may interact with relevant skills more markedly in dyslexic than in typically reading individuals. In predictive studies, the high variability across studies does not allow for evidence-based recommendations for reliable diagnostic measures. Future research should focus on clearly defining the language profiles of participants and should ensure that assessments account for linguistic experience in the language of testing. Additionally, evaluations should adopt a more comprehensive and individualised approach to accurately assess bilingual readers.",

          "authors": "Sam Verschooren; Luc Vermeylen; Sam Boeve; Gilles Pourtois",
          "abstract": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, i.e., external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, i.e., the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. While it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased CNV component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared to repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

Using a controlled environment where teenagers interact with their classmates, I examine the evolution of cooperation over repeated interactions and explore its determinants. I find that girls and altruistic pupils demonstrate higher levels of cooperation. The introduction of non-monetary rewards and punishments, serving as forms of social pressure, significantly enhances cooperation among adolescents, aligning their behavior with group's cooperation. Surprisingly, the study finds that the intensity of social pressure does not directly impact cooperation, suggesting that adolescents adapt their pro-social behavior in response to social pressure awareness. This study demonstrates that peer-enforced norms sustain cooperation among adolescents, even in the absence of material incentives.",

          "authors": "Helmut Appel; Alexander L. Gerlach",
          "abstract": "Background: Many decisions involve uncertainty. Consequently, intolerance of uncertainty (IU)—a dispositional aversion to uncertainty—may interfere with decision making and cause indecisiveness—a chronic inability to make decisions. Problematic decision-related safety behaviors may play a role in this. However, previous studies have not conclusively established this link. Therefore, this research tests whether IU is associated with safety behavior, operationalized with a novel measure, and whether indecisiveness mediates this relationship.\nMethods: Across four studies (total N = 944), participants reported their IU and imagined a decision scenario. They rated the extent to which their response to this decision aligned with features of safety behaviors. Study 1 examined the validity of these safety behavior ratings by comparing ratings of a maladaptive “safety behavior-like” response to a decision vs an adaptive response. In Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, indecisiveness was also assessed. Additionally, decision importance was experimentally varied to evaluate whether more important decisions would amplify the IU-safety behavior association.\nResults: Study 1 confirmed the validity of the safety behavior measurement, showing that a maladaptive behavior was rated higher than an adaptive behavior. Most importantly, across all studies, higher IU predicted more safety behavior in response to decisions, irrespective of decision importance. Studies 2a-3 additionally showed that this relationship was partially mediated by indecisiveness. \nConclusions: Our findings add an important insight to the literature, using an unequivocal safety behavior measure to demonstrate its association with IU across decision-making contexts. The results are consistent with IU as a transdiagnostic mental health risk factor, with significant implications for understanding and intervening in maladaptive decision-making processes.",

          "authors": "Nilsu Atilgan; Nazbanou Nozari",
          "abstract": "Possible spoken and written sequences of a language are determined by phonotactic and orthotactic rules, respectively. Adult speakers quickly learn simple new phonotactic rules (e.g., “/k/ is always an onset in a syllable), but they only learn the more complex second-order rules (e.g., “/k/ is an onset only if the vowel is /æ/, but a coda if the vowel is /ɪ/”) after the first day of training. However, the learning timeline for more complex rules is less consistent across populations and languages. In the current paper, we first show that, in Experiment 1, adults quickly learn new first-order constraints in typing, similar to those in speaking. Next, in Experiment 2, we show that, despite a much higher error rate and opportunities for error-based learning, learning the second-order rules in typing only occurs in the second day, replicating the results of most studies in spoken production. We further discuss that the second-order constraint was learned for the coda, but not the onset, suggesting that learning new rules of sequencing is carried out by a chaining-type mechanism.  Lastly, in Experiment 3, we demonstrate that learning new orthotactic constraints in typing is not mediated by phonology, instead, the learning effect is truly orthotactic in nature. Collectively, these data support strong parallels between the statistical learning of orthotactic and phonotactic constraints in language production, despite the differences between spoken and typed modalities of production.",

This study explored the lived experiences of ten trans, non-binary, and genderqueer menstruators regarding internalized, anticipated, and enacted menstrual stigma. Findings reveal varied levels of internalized stigma, with some participants feeling ashamed or uncomfortable, while others perceived menstruation neutrally. Anticipated stigma, stemming from societal views linking menstruation to femininity, led to fears of misgendering and medical discrimination. Enacted stigma included negative reactions and limited access to menstrual products and suitable restroom infrastructure. Some participants resisted stigma by reframing menstruation positively or neutrally. To promote inclusivity, participants recommended gender-neutral language, menstrual products and disposal bins in all restrooms, and increased representation in period advertising. This study underscores the need for an intersectional approach to address menstrual stigma, acknowledging the diverse experiences of trans communities.",

Using multilevel response surface analysis and ecological momentary assessment, we investigated relations between affective congruence and empathy during social interactions in a large sample of adults (N=526; total interactions=21,521; median=38 interactions per person). We found that while empathy is generally higher when there is affective congruence, empathy is highest when there is congruence in high positive affect.

          "abstract": "The visual system takes advantage of redundancy in the world by extracting summary statistics, a phenomenon known as ensemble perception. Ensemble representations are formed for low-level features like orientation and size and high-level features such as facial identity and expression. While recent research has shown that the visual system forms intact ensemble representations even when faces are partially occluded via solid bars, how ensemble perception is impacted with the addition of naturalistic objects such as face masks or sunglasses is largely unknown. To investigate this, we conducted a series of experiments using continuous report tasks in which faces (either varying in identity or expression) were partially occluded with a surgical mask or sunglasses and participants had to report the average face using a face wheel. We found evidence that participants could still accurately extract the average even when a significant portion of it was occluded with either face masks or sunglasses. In a second experiment, however, we found performance was worse when the face wheel was variable trial to trial. Thus, part of the preservation of performance in occlusion arises from the visual system learning the features of the particular face wheel being used. Overall, our results suggest that the visual system is able to establish robust ensemble representations for faces with naturalistic occlusions, but that robustness appears to be supported at least partially by learning information about the particular features that are informative for a given set of faces.",

          "authors": "Amanda J Haskins; Katherine O. Packard; Caroline Elizabeth Robertson",
          "abstract": "Our visual landscape consists of not only people, places, and objects (e.g., “soldier”, “stadium”, “flag”), but also the conceptual relationships that unite them (e.g., “patriotism”). Do individuals’ gaze patterns reflect, in part, their conceptual-level attentional priorities? Here, we show that latent conceptual priorities drive an individual’s idiosyncratic gaze patterns across different real-world environments. Participants (N=61) naturally explored a diverse set of immersive real-world photospheres (N=100) in head-mounted VR while their gaze was continuously monitored using in-headset eye-tracking. We leveraged the embedding spaces of large vision and language models to uncover the latent priorities guiding individuals’ unique patterns of selective attention across environments.  We found that different individuals exhibit stable and idiosyncratic gaze patterns across diverse real-world scenes, akin to an “attentional fingerprint”. These patterns can be accurately modeled in the embedding space of a large language model (LLM), which encodes the abstract relationships between scene content (e.g., “patriotism”, linking “flag” and “jet”) – in contrast with vision models that capture only visual similarity. LLM gaze models specifically leveraged conceptual information to predict participants’ attentional priorities, and these predictions were stable over time (i.e., across test-retest sessions), suggesting that they reflect enduring conceptual priorities of an individual mind. Together, these findings show that the eyes are not simply a “window into the mind”, but a window into an individual mind, and its unique cognitive priority map across diverse visual landscapes.",

          "authors": "Daoxin Li; Kathryn Schuler",
          "abstract": "This work investigates the mechanism of learning recursive structures. The ability of recursion is considered crucial for language and universally available, but there are considerable with- and cross-linguistic differences regarding the rules for recursive embedding, which poses a learnability problem. Previous research has shown that adults can learn the recursivity of linear structures in an artificial language from distributional cues in non-recursively embedded data. However, an important open question is participants’ structural representation of the grammar, which is considered crucial for linguistic recursion. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that representation of the structural head is necessary for the distributional learning of recursive structures. Adult participants were exposed to one of the two artificial languages which had identical linear orders but different heads. At test, participants were asked to rate test strings which examined their knowledge of the head and recursion. As predicted, we found that the learning mechanism is constrained: participants who learned the language with the correct head were more likely to allow recursive embedding. The findings suggest that human learners need structural representations beyond surface-level distributional cues to acquire recursive structures.",

          "authors": "Michael J Kleiman",
          "abstract": "Background: Picture description tasks, such as the Cookie Theft task, are widely used in neuropsychological assessments to detect cognitive impairment. However, manual scoring is time-consuming, requires specialized training, and is subject to interrater variability. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a promising solution to automate and standardize the scoring process.\n\nMethods: This study evaluated the performance and reliability of five LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Llama 3 70b) in scoring the Cookie Theft picture description task. A subset of 25 participants were selected from the DementiaBank corpus. The LLMs were tasked with scoring 22 content units in the participants’ responses using various prompt strategies, including few-shot learning, prompt chaining, and self-consistency. LLM performance was compared to the consensus score of three human raters.\n\nResults: LLMs demonstrated comparable accuracy to human raters in scoring the Cookie Theft task, with no significant differences in mean absolute error (MAE) between the best performing models and human raters. Few-shot learning significantly improved LLM performance, while prompt chaining and self-consistency showed limited benefits. Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o exhibited the highest accuracy and reliability. Notably, LLMs showed significantly higher interrater reliability compared to human raters.\n\nConclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to accurately and reliably score picture description tasks, offering a promising approach to streamline and standardize neuropsychological assessments. By automating the scoring process, clinicians and researchers can benefit from increased efficiency, reduced subjectivity, and improved scalability in evaluating cognitive functions.",

Study 1 replicated virtue discounting but found no evidence of a BTAE in moral goodness ratings. Study 2 showed that while people discounted others’ public virtue, they expected their own to be judged as more principled. Study 3 extended this pattern—participants judged their own public virtue more favorably than others’ and expected observers to discount third-party actors more than they would discount the participants themselves. These findings reveal a fundamental asymmetry: people anticipate leniency for their own public virtue while expecting and applying greater skepticism toward others’.",

Less is known about how people form their attitudes towards psilocybin policies. \n\nObjectives: To explore whether beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin influence support for psilocybin policies.\n\nMethods: In an online survey experiment, 804 participants were randomised to receive one of four interventions in a 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin benefits) x 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin safety) design. Public support for four psilocybin policies and beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin were measured before and after participants were randomised to a group.\n\nResults:  In a two-way ANCOVA, the Benefits Intervention significantly increased policy support overall (d = .11, p&lt; .001); and for two of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately. Furthermore, the Benefits Intervention significantly strengthened beliefs that psilocybin is beneficial (d = .44, p&lt; .001) and safe (d = .26,  p&lt; .001). The Safety Intervention increased psilocybin policy support overall (d = .10, p = .003); and for three of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately.

While efficacy studies of Tier 2 interventions often generalize their findings to struggling readers, the eligibility criteria for selecting study samples can vary across studies. In our simulation study, we compared effect size estimates from different samples, each screened using commonly used eligibility criteria. Despite each method accurately recovering the true effect on average across 500 iterations, the range of estimates showed substantial variation, with significant under- and overestimation in individual iterations. We concluded that the perceived effectiveness of Tier 2 interventions may fluctuate based on how the sample is screened for eligibility. We propose future research to address this methodological challenge while balancing the practical demands of Tier 2 intervention studies.",

          "abstract": "Voice identification across and between utterances are distinguishable tasks.  To test how accent affects voice identification, we used voice-cloning to isolate and extract speech patterns from English-language recordings of people from the UK, Poland, and China. These speech patterns were applied to a different set of cloned voices. The result is a set of voices that have the same or different identity or accent and speak the same or different phrases. Participant accuracy in distinguishing voices was tested using varied voice pairs. Different accents applied to the same identity and the same accent to different identities increased errors by ~10% in telling whether people were the “same” or “different”.  Using different sentences diminished error rates only when different identities had the same accent.  Collectively, these findings reveal that expectations about accent use affect our ability to identify people as same or different, in addition to familiarity and other language-related cognitive processes. Our research supports the view suggesting that voice identification is a complex task that humans employ several different cognitive strategies to solve, depending on the context.",

Consequently, prior work primarily examined stereotype content as a function of group labels, overlooking how stereotypes vary across perceivers, situations, and intersecting categories. To address this gap, we conducted two pre-registered studies with U.S. representative participants (N = 1,721) who freely wrote stories about how other people generally view 9 groups across 6 representative situations and 30 intersectional categories. We analyzed these stories using large language models. We found that although stereotypes are considered products of social learning about groups, they varied considerably across perceivers and situations. Intersectional stereotypes showed evidence for dominance effects of “Asian” and “unattractiveness”, potentially due to their lower representativeness in the U.S. population and uniform stereotypes across situations. These findings highlight the complex variability of stereotype content in naturalistic contexts, opening new doors to reducing intergroup biases.",

          "abstract": "Developmental stuttering, or childhood-onset fluency disorder, has been traditionally characterized by the production of speech disfluencies, such as repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. However, the manner, intensity, and overall effects of stuttering vary widely among individuals. Despite extensive scientific inquiry spanning over a century, the complex and seemingly paradoxical nature of stuttering has thwarted attempts at a unified explanation. Active inference, a predictive processing theory of sentient behavior, provides a potential account for understanding the core behaviors and diverse phenomena of stuttering. Stuttering likely arises from disruptions in perception-action cycling that facilitate the fluent sequential production of syllables. More specifically, aberrantly high sensory precision to speech-related predictions may cause the abrupt inhibition of syllable initiation, resulting in the hallmark stuttering ‘block.’ Moreover, active inference elucidates the perplexing contextual variability of stuttering behavior, such as the effects of adaptation, consistency, and distraction. Importantly, this account holds significant clinical implications for stuttering treatment, offering novel avenues for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Concerns about the negative impact of social media on wellbeing have surged, particularly for adolescents who may have heightened susceptibility to social media’s adverse effects. In response, there is a growing interest in developing social media interventions, which aim to change users’ interactions with social media to improve wellbeing. Despite the potential for interventions to advance causal knowledge of social media’s effects and mitigate potential wellbeing harms, academic research on these interventions remains scarce. In this paper we review the landscape of social media interventions, categorising them by the context in which they intervene: social media platforms, smartphones, users, families, and society. In doing so, we highlight important limitations of current research and intervention designs. To improve how we study and develop social media interventions in future, we introduce a theoretically-grounded framework to assist in choosing intervention targets and designs. Specifically, by evaluating how social media use impacts core psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness as proposed by self-determination theory, and developing interventions to specifically target such processes, we can maximise effectiveness of future interventions particularly for vulnerable populations such as adolescents. With increasing calls for interventions to be developed to improve adolescent mental health and counteract social media risks, this robust foundation will be widely relevant for future research in both academia and industry, with direct practical applications to enhance wellbeing in our increasingly digital age.",

Using a controlled environment where teenagers interact with their classmates, I examine the evolution of cooperation over repeated interactions and explore its determinants. I find that girls and altruistic pupils demonstrate higher levels of cooperation. The introduction of non-monetary rewards and punishments, serving as forms of social pressure, significantly enhances cooperation among adolescents, aligning their behavior with group's cooperation. Surprisingly, the study finds that the intensity of social pressure does not directly impact cooperation, suggesting that adolescents adapt their pro-social behavior in response to social pressure awareness. This study demonstrates that peer-enforced norms sustain cooperation among adolescents, even in the absence of material incentives.",

Across a series of artificial language learning experiments, we demonstrate that learners exhibit a robust preference for placing nominal morphology encoding gender information closest to the stem. This bias, consistent across English, Italian, and Kîîtharaka speakers, holds both for prefixing and suffixing morphology, and across different types of gender and number systems.These results provide a new source of empirical support for theories proposing a gender-first derivation and highlights cognitive constraints influencing morpheme order.",

This cycle of teacher-student interaction showcases the beneficial role of gesture in teaching and learning. But how gesture confers this benefit is unclear. Here, we propose a framework for thinking about how attention and memory might mediate the link between gesture and learning. We speculate that bottom-up and top-down processes in attention and memory, as well as the interaction between the two, play a role in fashioning the beneficial effects gesture has on learning. By bridging the gesture and cognition literatures, we hope to motivate research investigating the mechanisms underlying gesture’s impact on learning and to shed light on more effective use of gesture in natural settings, including education.",

          "abstract": "Where does political ideology come from? Early research in political neuroscience has linked stronger physiological responses to threat and disgust with conservatism, implying a neurobiological basis of ideology, beyond societal factors. However, recent replication failures challenge the idea of a direct connection between physiological reactions and political attitudes. Given the role of interoception in body-awareness and emotional regulation, we investigated whether the relationship between disgust and political ideology is moderated by interoceptive sensibility (i.e., one’s ability to be attuned to their internal bodily states). Using survey data from 632 U.S. participants (321 Democrats, 311 Republicans), we show that when people have higher interoceptive sensibility, their political ideology is not driven by their disgust sensitivity. It is only when interoceptive sensibility is low that disgust sensitivity plays a significant role in political ideology: higher disgust sensitivity increases the likelihood of identifying as Republican, while lower disgust increases the likelihood of being Democrat. We propose that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility rely more on physiological signals to process emotions like disgust. As a result, their ideological differences are less shaped by internalized cultural beliefs about what is disgusting and instead reflect their actual physiological experience. In contrast, those with lower interoception are more susceptible to socially constructed associations, relying more on ‘social priors’ to interpret their physiological states. This research highlights the importance of interoception in political cognition, offering a novel perspective on the psychophysiological underpinnings of political ideology, paving the way for replicable and causal studies.",

Importantly, during multi-item\ntasks, performance decreases but does not collapse, consistent with effective management of\ncognitive overload. This has been interpreted by positing a strategic shift from a more parallel to\na more serial processing, whereby the processing of the current item is prioritized over\nupcoming items, termed lockout scheduling. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining\nwithin-task modulations of eye-voice span (EVS) measures and articulation duration in multiitem color naming tasks with and without internal interference (i.e., incongruent and neutral\nStroop conditions). We hypothesized that lockout scheduling would manifest itself across\nmeasures and conditions as the task progresses and cognitive overload emerges. The results\nshowed dynamic changes in both EVS and articulation measures as a function of time-on-task,\nconsistent with the gradual implementation of a lockout scheduling strategy in response to\nemerging cognitive overload. The observed patterns indicate that the shift from a more parallel\nto a more serial processing is not an all-or-none phenomenon but a dynamic interplay between\ngaze, voice, and covert (i.e., parafoveal) attention, affecting online decisions about spatial\ndistance, timing, and processing resource allocation.",

One prominent perspective is that the sensory content of inner speech would correspond to the predicted sensory consequences of inhibited speech acts. Scott (2013) provided experimental evidence suggesting that inner speech indeed involves the mental simulation of speech acts, as evidenced by the attenuation of the effect of an external speech sound.

Lower decision thresholds lead people to jump to conclusions and are associated with superstitious and conspiracy-related beliefs. To shed light on the role of the decision threshold in the development of these phenomena, it is crucial to study decision thresholds at an early age. However, current measures of decision thresholds have only been administered in adult samples and are based on subjective probability estimates. The current study validates a new instrument that was adapted to measure the decision thresholds of children and is based on the objective probability values of a situation by using a signal detection analytical approach. We assessed decision thresholds in a sample of N = 299 children from an extracurricular enrichment program for talented primary school students. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the new measurement instrument has high accuracy. Furthermore, its construct validity was supported by positive associations with children’s performance in the original beads task, a measure of confirmation bias, age, grade level, and math performance. However, no associations were found with a measure of alternation bias, epistemic certainty beliefs, self-concept in data-related tasks, general self-efficacy, or gender. This study introduces a new instrument for measuring the decision threshold in children using objective probability values and gives insights into decision-making processes and their implications for cognitive biases and related constructs.",

Specifically, a theoretical model that specifies how and how much people revise their goal following goal success or failure is lacking. Therefore, we synthesized previous empirical studies on goal revision to shed light on the processes and individual differences in goal revision. The 28 studies that met the inclusion criteria revealed a clear pattern: People raised their goals after success and lowered them after failure. Results of a meta-analysis further showed that the discrepancy between goal and performance predicted the strength of upward goal revision after success and downward goal revision after failure (r = .51). Moreover, a narrative summary of previously tested moderators revealed two mechanisms by which moderators might influence the direction and strength of goal revision, namely by affecting (1) the direct link between goal-performance discrepancy and goal revision or (2) self-efficacy, which emerged as a central mediating variable between goal-performance discrepancy and goal revision. Based on these findings, we developed the Triple-A Model (Assessment, Appraisal, Adjustment) of Goal Revision, which allows deriving directional hypotheses about how much people revise their goals after goal successes and failures.",

          "authors": "Samar Husain",
          "abstract": "Syntactic prediction and syntactic priming are known to be important determinants of processing in Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) languages. In this work we investigate how they interact during sentence processing of an SOV language Bengali. In a series of sentence completion studies, we find that both prediction and priming show consistent and robust effects. Interestingly, the strength of priming induced prediction is modulated by the structural similarity between the prime structure and the structure of the predicted construction in the target -- when this similarity is high, prediction strength increases, conversely, when the similarity is low, prediction strength decreases. We additionally find that priming induced prediction reaches a saturation point when prime structure is very complex (operationalized in terms of number of verbal arguments and thematic structure). These novel findings pose a challenge to the current theories of priming such as `residual activation theory' and the `implicit learning' model. The current work suggests that syntactic priming during comprehension could be modulated by language typology (SVO vs SOV). Broadly, we find that the parser in an SOV language predominantly prefers to posit syntactically simple structures and this tendency is not overridden by priming.",

          "authors": "Daisy Fancourt",
          "abstract": "Healthcare systems around the world are demonstrating increasing engagement with social prescribing of activities such as engagement in the arts (“arts on prescription”). However, what remains unclear is how people perceive receiving a referral to the arts from a clinician (i.e. an arts prescription), and, more specifically, whether arts prescriptions are likely to be taken up by recipients. Data were taken from the Americans Speak Out About the Arts in 2023 Survey led by Americans for the Arts in the US. A sample of 3,062 adults aged 18+ from the continental U.S. were recruited and interviewed online in English, of whom 2,996 provided complete data for analyses (52.5% female, 70.1% White). Participants were asked “If your doctor wrote you a prescription to participate in the arts as a means of improving your physical or mental health (singing in a choir, taking a ceramics class, dancing, or joining a book club, etc.), how likely are you to follow their recommendation?”. Overall, 76% said they were somewhat or very likely to follow a doctor’s recommendation if they were given a prescription to engage in the arts. Multiple logistic regression models showed that the strongest predictors of positive responses were experience of past health benefits from the arts, belief in future health benefits, high educational attainment, approval of government arts funding, existing engagement in the arts, and being female. Applying behaviour change frameworks, the strongest identified predictors relate to reflective motivations, suggesting that rich programmes aimed at explaining what arts on prescription is, how it works, why patients are receiving referrals, what the evidence base is, and what benefits patients may experience could be fundamental to increasing uptake as pilot schemes of arts on prescription continue to develop in the US.",

          "abstract": "Self-compassion, which refers to compassion directed toward oneself, is associated with mental health and well-being. Traditionally, self-compassion has been measured and quantified using questionnaire scales such as the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and Compassionate Engagement and Action Scales (CEAS). In recent years, interest in quantifying psychology using text described by people and state-of-the-art natural language processing methods, such as BERT, has increased. In this study, short open-ended free texts were collected from participants asking about their thoughts (general thoughts and those about themselves and others) and behaviors in three challenging situations. Then, a regression model was developed to predict the self-compassion scores (i.e., SCS and CEAS) from free texts with BERT. The self-compassion scores quantified by free texts and BERT highly correlated with the SCS score and certain criterion-related validity. Furthermore, the results suggest that thoughts, behaviors, and levels of self-compassion differ across situations and that the SCS score is related to both cognition (thoughts) and behaviors. The method of psychological quantification using free text may be less prone to priming or bias than measurement using questionnaires. Thus, future studies are encouraged to apply this natural-language-based approach to more diverse samples and other psychological constructs.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Although Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) demonstrates clinical utility, its benefits and challenges for treatment-seeking individuals who engage in Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) are not well understood. This study evaluates self-reported benefits (i.e. increases in self-insight and self-efficacy) and challenges of EMA (i.e., beep disturbance, and negative emotional experiences) in this population.\nMethods:  Ninety-seven in-treatment patients with past-month NSSI completed baseline assessments which assessed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Following intake, they completed a 28-day EMA-protocol with six assessments each day. After this self-monitoring period,  a feedback survey was completed in which general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight and self-efficacy, compliance, beep disturbance, and negative emotional experiences related to EMA were assessed. \nResults: Average EMA compliance was 72.14% (SD=20.47) and decreased linearly over time (β=-0.50, p&lt;.001). After using EMA, 32.98% reported increased general self-insight and 9.27% reported increased general self-efficacy. In contrast, 63.91% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight and 41.24% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Additionally, 21,62% experienced negative emotional experiences due to EMA. Higher levels of negative emotional experiences were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-.297, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.383, p&lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-.286, p=.005).\nConclusion: EMA appears feasible and may promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy for most patients.",

          "abstract": "The Psychological Typhoon Eye (PTE) effect refers to the observation that those living in the epicenters of natural disasters or public emergencies exhibit lower levels of psychological distress than those living further away. The effect was first described in the aftermath of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Li et al., 2009). However, despite its potential relevance for emergency relieve, this phenomenon has received little research attention and requires further replication. Therefore, data was collected following an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 on the Richter scale that occurred in December 2020 in Petrinja, Croatia. The goals of this study were to replicate the PTE effect using the original measures used by Li et al. (2009) and to conceptually replicate the effect using the validated Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995). The sample consisted of 316 participants living in Croatia at the time of the earthquake. We found no evidence for the PTE effect in our study. Instead, we observed a ripple effect, whereby those in the epicenter showed the most psychological distress. We argue that the ripple effect, rather than the PTE effect, should be seen as the default psychological response pattern to natural disasters and emergencies.",

The integrity of this process can be compromised by sophisticated fraud attacks using manipulated face images. Therefore, in this study we examine whether human observers can detect digitally manipulated passport photos, and whether super-recognisers (SRs) outperform typical recogniser controls. Using two face manipulation detection tasks (DFMD1, DFMD2), participants were asked to decide whether a ‘suspected’ passport photo had been digitally manipulated. SRs were found to significantly outperform controls; this effect was not the result of a ‘speed-accuracy trade-off’. Individual differences on tests of face identification aptitude, self-rated ability, and response times, accounted for over 20% of the variance in manipulated image detection sensitivity. Taken together, these findings show that, despite increasing sophistication in digital face manipulation techniques, there is still utility in employing human operators, particularly SRs, to detect them.",

          "abstract": "The complex associations between child media use and development cannot be fully understood through screen time estimates alone. Parental motivations for media use are one of the factors that may shape the quality of media experiences and ultimately child development and family well-being. However, validated scales to capture parents’ motivations for their own and their children’s media use are lacking. Filling this gap, the current paper describes the development and validation of the Media Motivations for Children (MEMO-C) and Parents (MEMO-P) scales in a sample of 521 parents with young children (2-5 years old). The scales were designed to capture regulatory and relational aspects of child and parent media use. Factor analyses revealed a three-factor structure for each scale (MEMO-C: Regulate, Occupy, and Connect; MEMO-P: Regulate, Relax Alone, and Connect). These factors demonstrated strong psychometric properties including high reliability as well as convergent and incremental validity in predicting child- and parent-related constructs above and beyond screen time estimates and related demographic information. By measuring parental media motivations through a relational lens, these scales enable researchers to more closely examine how family media use is associated with child development and family members’ well-being.",

          "authors": "Massimo Lipari; Morgan Sonderegger",
          "abstract": "Quebec French is reportedly developing rhoticity, with low F3 resulting from a bunched or retroflexed tongue (like English /ɚ/), in some or all of its front mid rounded vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/. The source of this rare, understudied sound change is unclear from previous work: contact with English and contrast enhancement have been suggested, and phonologization of coarticulation is typologically plausible. We examine this issue, investigating the apparent time change in the F3 trajectories of the three vowels using generalized additive mixed models on a corpus of parliamentary speech (106 speakers from across Quebec). We observe rhoticity in /ø/ and /œ̃ /: men begin with low F3 in these vowels, and women show change in progress. Conversely, there is less clear evidence of change in /œ/. We suggest these findings are best explained by rhoticity being a two-phased change, originally due to borrowing and subsequently spreading through contrast enhancement. Rhotacization, we argue, is the combined product of intensive exposure to English (which led to frequent non-integration of bunched/retroflex segments in loanwords) and an exceptionally large vowel inventory. It thus results from the unique interplay of social and phonological factors in Quebec French, which is consistent with such changes being cross-linguistically rare.",

With its recent revision, the ipseity-disorder model of self-disorder explains a wider range of experiential phenomenon.

It suggests that this tension precludes the explanation of paranoia as an instance of exaggerated self-presence. The phenomenon of paranoia may be better characterized as diminished self-presence in the context of heightened grip or hold on a perceptual reality that includes other minds.",

          "abstract": "A wave of criticisms and replication failures is currently challenging claims about the scope of unconscious perception and cognition. Such failures to find unconscious processing effects at the population level may reflect the absence of individual-level effects, or alternatively, the averaging out of individual-level effects with opposing signs. Importantly, only the first suggests that consciousness may be necessary for the tested process to take place. To arbitrate between these two possibilities, we tested previously collected data where unconscious processing effects were not found (26 effects from 470 participants), using five frequentist and Bayesian tests that are robust to individual differences in effect signs. By and large, we found no reliable evidence for unconscious effects being masked by individual differences. In contrast, when we examined 136 non-significant effects from other domains, two novel non-parametric tests did reveal effects that were hidden by opposing individual results, though as we show, some of them might be driven by design-related factors. Taken together, five analysis approaches provide strong evidence for the restricted nature of unconscious processing effects not only across participants, but also across different trials within individuals. We provide analysis code and best-practice recommendations for testing for non-directional effects.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on conflict resolution, focusing on behavioral performance, neural activity, and subjective experience. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to anodal, cathodal, or sham HD-tDCS groups and completed a 30-minute flanker task during stimulation. Using a comprehensive methodological approach, including Drift-Diffusion Modeling (DDM), EEG analysis, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), we assessed the cognitive, neural, and phenomenological effects of stimulation. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in reaction times or accuracy across the stimulation groups. Similarly, DDM parameters showed no effect of HD-tDCS on cognitive processes. However, EEG data revealed a significant reduction in neural complexity, in the anodal group during resting-state, suggesting neural reorganization. Subjective experience analysis identified two distinct clusters of task-related feelings, though time spent in these experiential states did not differ between groups. Interestingly, sensation of stimulation was significantly higher for anodal stimulation than sham when analyzed as a single dimension. Despite null behavioral effects, this study provides important insights into the neural and subjective responses to HD-tDCS and emphasizes the value of advanced analytic techniques in examining brain stimulation effects. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about the efficacy of tDCS in cognitive enhancement.",

          "abstract": "Computational models that explain lightness/brightness illusions have been proposed. These models have been assessed using a simplistic criterion: the number of illusions each model can correctly predict from the test set. This simple method of evaluation assumes that each illusion in the set is independent; however, since lightness illusions are not independent of each other, an unbalanced test set may distort the evaluation of models. Moreover, evaluating models with a single value obscures where the model’s strength and weakness lies. We collected illusion magnitudes of various lightness illusions through two online experiments and investigated their correlations to identify underlying factors in these illusions. Experiment 1 identified three common factors reflecting assimilation, contrast, and White’s effect. Experiment 2, with a different illusion set, identified two factors reflecting assimilation and contrast, and detected high independence of an illusion caused by remote luminance gradients. We then examined three well-known models using the outcomes of the experiments. This model test showed that the redundancy in the illusion sets does not markedly skew the evaluation of the models, but the predictions by some models have a strong bias towards the contrast effect. This study clarified that correlations of illusion magnitudes provide valuable insights into both illusions and models, and highlighted the need to assess models based on processes underlying lightness perception, rather than focusing on individual illusions.",

          "abstract": "Background \nMost previous research has investigated whether performing a demanding cognitive task reduces the time a person can hold a subsequent physical effort. However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.\nMethods \nIn a pre-registered, within-participant experiment, 29 active participants performed a cognitive task until failure after either running to exhaustion at 90% maximal aerobic speed or walking for 10 minutes (control). Brain activity was recorded via EEG, brain complexity measured, and subjective experience assessed using the Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) method. \nResults\nPhysical exercise reduced maximal force capacity and increased perceived exertion compared to the control, highlighting significant workload differences. Cognitive task durations were 4755.8 s (95% CI: 3326.8–5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI: 3902.9–5481.2) for control and experimental conditions, with no significant difference (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis revealed two task-demand clusters, but time spent in these states was similar across conditions. Cognitive performance was better during phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity decreased after maximal aerobic effort, suggesting a physiological shift, though cognitive performance and subjective feelings remained unaffected.\nConclusion\nThere was no evidence that short intense physical exercise negatively affected participants' ability to sustain a cognitive effort to failure.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of outlier exclusion is to improve data quality and prevent model\nmisspecification. However, procedures to identify and exclude outliers may bring unwanted\nside effects such as an increase in the Type I error rate.

We focus on the Bayesian\nindependent samples t-test and show how outlier exclusion procedures may inflate the\nBayes factor, resulting in conclusions that are overconfident. Researchers therefore find\nthemselves on the horns of a dilemma: spurious effects and an inflation of evidence can\noccur both as a result of retaining outliers and as a result of removing extreme\nobservations. To resolve the dilemma, we propose to truncate the likelihood function and\nembed the procedure in the Bayesian model-averaged t-test. Simulations demonstrate the\nadequacy of the proposed solution.

          "authors": "Meng Chen; Rohit Batra; Emorie D Beck; Emilio Ferrer",
          "abstract": "Characterizing psychological processes as dynamical systems has become a common practice in psychology. Most often, psychological theories are expressed in verbal terms and then interpreted by researchers in their operationalization. In contrast, theories can also be expressed formally in mathematical or computational terms. However, translating verbal theories of dynamical systems into formal theories, especially those represented by differential equations (DEs), often requires knowledge of physics and mathematics beyond the standard training received by psychologists. In this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for researchers who wish to build a formal theory expressed in DEs from a verbal theory. We use a running example to illustrate the various steps and end with a discussion on caveats of formalizing using DE models. Our roadmap aims at the phase of formal theory development and refinement, before a researcher collects their data. We discuss different DE applications and provide corresponding examples for researchers interested in further reading.",

          "abstract": "Bayesian estimation approaches for item factor analyses (IFA) can provide a valuable tool to overcome difficulty in parameter estimation in frequentist approaches when the marginal response distribution is highly skewed. Highly skewed marginal response distributions are problematic in Bayesian IFA models with binary factor indicators depending on how the latent response distribution is parameterized. We provide an alternative implementation of Bayesian IFA under a DELTA, or a unit total variance, parameterization of the latent response distribution. We show that parameterizing the latent response distribution using fixed total variances improves coverage rates of credible intervals for threshold parameters. We apply our implementation of Bayesian IFA to data on psychopathology to illustrate the consistency in threshold recovery under relatively small sample sizes (n=200 sampled from the full population of N=9,282) when some indicators are highly skewed in the population (e.g., &lt;3% of the population are positive on a factor indicator).",

          "abstract": "Study Objectives: To determine the relative effectiveness and predictors of Cognitive therapy (CT), Behavioral therapy (BT), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Insomnia in older adults. Methods: In a registered clinical trial (NCT02117388), 128 older adults with Insomnia Disorder were randomized to receive CBT, BT, or CT. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score was the primary outcome. Sleep diaries, fatigue, beliefs about sleep, cognitive arousal, and stress were secondary outcomes. Split-plot linear mixed models assessed within and between subject changes in outcomes among the treatments. As a secondary analysis, we used linear regression to test predictors of insomnia symptoms improvement, including sleep diary measures, cognitive arousal, stress, beliefs about sleep, baseline ISI score, and age. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied. Results: All groups exhibited insomnia symptom reduction at post-treatment (CT: d=-2.53, p&lt;.001; BT: d=-2.39, p&lt;.001; CBT: d=-2.90, p&lt;.001) and 6FU (CT: d=-2.68, p&lt;.001; BT: d=-2.85, p&lt;.001; CBT: d=-3.14, p&lt;.001). There were no group differences in the magnitude of ISI improvement (padj=.63), response (padj&gt;.63), or remission (ISI&lt;8; padj&gt;.27). All groups exhibited significant improvements in secondary outcomes at post-treatment (padj &lt;.05) and 6FU (padj&lt;0.05). At post-treatment, the CT and CBT groups showed greater reductions in beliefs about sleep than the BT group (FInteraction(2,185)=5.99, padj=.03), and the CBT group showed a greater time in bed reduction than the CT and BT groups (FInteraction(2,185)=7.05, padj=.01). Baseline ISI was the only treatment predictor (b=1.95, padj&lt;.001).  Conclusions: CBT-I and its components each independently result in significant improvements in subjective insomnia symptoms, beliefs about sleep, worry, and fatigue in older adults.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This review aims to examine how gambling harms are measured by mapping existing self-report measures, analyzing scoring methodologies, and identifying key gaps to inform future research and practice. Study design: Scoping review. Methods: The scoping review coded data from 108 studies, analyzing harm measures, corresponding scoring methods, sample-related variables, and associated measures. Results: (1) This review identified 37 distinct instruments used to measure gambling-related harm over the past two decades, encompassing gambling harm-specific surveys, problem gambling screening tools, custom questionnaires, and questionnaires on harm to affected others. (2) The current landscape reveals that most surveys capture only a subset of harm domains, with dichotomous scoring methods being widely used. (3) Additionally, harm measurement has been largely dominated by a few well-validated instruments, with criterion variables primarily focused on problem gambling severity, gambling engagement, and health-related constructs, and mainly delivered in the global north. Conclusions: This review highlights discrepancies between conceptual frameworks and real-world practices in the measurement of gambling harm, exposing critical gaps in quantification that have implications for policy decisions, clinical assessments, and public health management. It also questions the generalizability of existing measures to non-WEIRD populations. Future research should prioritize rigorous domain selection, refinement of assessment items, and improvements in quantification methods to better serve the needs of policymakers, researchers, and clinicians. Additionally, establishing cross-cultural validity and utility of gambling harm measures outside of WEIRD contexts is also essential.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate a collaborative care program in an obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) practice for the treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective chart review from the electronic medical records of N = 185 patients enrolled in a perinatal collaborative care program delivered by a behavioral health company, Family Well Health, in partnership with a large OB/GYN practice in Massachusetts (USA). FamilyWell’s collaborative program includes telehealth sessions with a certified coach or a licensed therapist, medication management, and implementation assistance to enhance depression screening, assessment, and treatment of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs). English-speaking adults (aged ≥18 years) who screened positive for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] score ≥ 10) by their OB/GYN clinician were referred to the FamilyWell program. Enrolled patients received weekly or biweekly telehealth sessions with a certified coach (77%) or licensed therapist (23%) and completed monthly electronic symptom assessments for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale [GAD-7]) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale [PHQ-9]). Assessment scores were monitored by a behavioral care manager. We evaluated three clinical outcomes including change in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, treatment response (50% or greater decrease in GAD-7 or PHQ-9 scores), and symptom remission (follow-up PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score &lt;5). \n\nResults: Over 80% of referred patients enrolled in CoCM and more than 70% completed their intake session within one week. At baseline, 86% had a positive GAD-7 or PHQ-9 score (GAD-7 or PHQ-9 ≥  10 indicating symptoms of moderate, moderate-severe, or severe depression or anxiety). PHQ-9 scores decreased by 1.3 points per month (95% CI [-1.5, -1.2], p &lt; .001) and GAD-7 scores decreased by 1.3 points per month (95% CI [-1.5, -1.2], p &lt; .001). Forty-seven percent of patients (n = 33) demonstrated depression treatment response and 52% (n = 45) demonstrated anxiety treatment response. In addition, 30% of patients (n = 26) experienced anxiety symptom remission at least once in a mean time of 3.2 months and 31% (n = 22) experienced depression symptom remission in a mean time of 3.5 months. Patients received a mean of 8 sessions with a therapist and 9 sessions with a coach before experiencing symptom remission.\n\nConclusion: These data suggest that implementing a tech-enabled, coach-driven collaborative care program is associated with decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms. Symptom remission occurred within 8 sessions with a therapist or 9 sessions with a coach. Unlike other psychiatric collaborative care programs described in the literature, this program uniquely addresses the behavioral health workforce shortages by integrating certified coaches as a primary intervention and utilizes text-based support to enable scale. Our results suggest that this integrated behavioral health approach can be implemented outside the research setting.",

          "abstract": "Many people worldwide want to be less neurotic. As lower levels of neuroticism predict a variety of positive life outcomes, including health, success, and relationship quality, interventions that help people to become less neurotic could have wide-ranging impacts. This study protocol describes the rationale and design of the CHILL (Changing How I Live Life) Study, which aims to test and evaluate a smartphone-based intervention to reduce neuroticism in the general public. The CHILL Study comprises four survey assessments spread over 5 months, a 6-week intervention phase, and two 1-week experience sampling phases without interventions. During the intervention phase, participants motivated to become less neurotic are randomized to four core treatment groups. These treatment groups differ in their employed intervention strategies that target different aspects and levels of neuroticism. The CHILL Study moves beyond existing volitional personality change research by testing which strategies most effectively decrease neuroticism and evaluating the longevity and generalizability of intervention-induced neuroticism change via peer-reports, implicit personality assessments, and a 7-week follow-up period. The goals of the CHILL Study are to generate an effective method for decreasing neuroticism and facilitating the development of a comprehensive theory of neuroticism change.",

          "abstract": "This paper synthesizes research on temporal experience in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from a phenomenologically grounded perspective. It advocates for a closer integration of phenomenology with empirical research results, with the specific goal of bridging the gap between theoretical and evidence-based understanding of BPD temporality. Utilizing a variant of indirect phenomenology, the paper adopts phenomenological insights into temporality to integrate the existing literature from cognitive sciences, chronobiology, and psychoanalysis, which provides qualitative, quantitative, and theoretical inputs. The findings reveal a coherent picture of BPD temporality characterized by fragmentation and discontinuity. Past experience is dense yet disorganized and recreated in the presence of present affective stimuli. The present absorbs one in an immediate, immersive manner. The future is perceived as blurred and disowned, with its horizon being truncated. This contributes to the feeling of being stuck and disoriented within one's temporal landscape. One lives in disturbing cycles between a negativity-biased past and a narrow present, which hinders the process of self development.",

This meta-analysis synthesized data from 57 studies, pooling 119 effect sizes from correlational and 55 effect sizes from group comparison studies. By separate analyses, we assessed both the strength of the association and whether clinically significant insomnia symptoms exacerbate difficulty in regulating emotion. Correlational analyses revealed a significant association between insomnia symptoms and emotion dysregulation, primarily in individuals with serious health-related conditions (Fisher Zno-serious condition = 0.22, Fisher Zserious-conditions = 0.37, p &lt; 0.00001). Group comparison analyses indicated that clinically significant insomnia symptoms worsen emotion dysregulation regardless of health-related status (Hedges’ g = 0.99, p = 0.01). The reliance on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and difficulties in dispositional domains of emotion regulation, particularly impulsivity, were more strongly associated with insomnia than challenges related to adaptive strategies. Age and gender did not impact these associations in either type of study. These findings underscore a robust link between insomnia and emotion dysregulation, suggesting the potential benefits of integrating emotion regulation skills into insomnia management to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Shape processing holds a crucial role in higher-level visual functions, such as object recognition. Previous efforts to explore high-level vision, independent of shape influence, involved meticulous measurements to control for perceptual shape similarity across distinct stimulus sets. However, there is a compelling need for a more efficient approach to automatically synthesize perceptually uniform spaces of novel shapes. In this pursuit, we present an image-based method that autonomously generates numerous perceptually uniform and circular shape sets, eliminating the need for extensive psychophysical measurements. Our method employs a search for circular shape sets correlated with ShapeComp, an image-computable shape similarity metric based on over 100 descriptors, highly predictive of human shape similarity. Using multi-arrangement methods, we demonstrate that predicted human similarity arrangements of shape sets defined as circular and uniformly spaced by ShapeComp, align with human shape similarity judgments and approximate circularity. Notably, shape sets chosen for uniformity and circularity in alternative shape spaces (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks or Radial Frequency patterns), but not meeting these criteria in ShapeComp, did not necessarily register as perceptually uniform and circular. Therefore, leveraging ShapeComp, we introduce an automated method for generating extensive sets of perceptually uniform and circular shape spaces. We provide five newly validated circular shape sets derived from intricate naturalistic shapes, along with MATLAB code facilitating the creation of a limitless number of such sets. This advancement empowers cognitive scientists to construct large sets of perceptually uniform stimuli, allowing for a nuanced exploration of the impact of higher-level factors on object perception.",

          "abstract": "The current prevailing approaches to analyzing task fMRI data in developmental cognitive neuroscience are brain connectivity and mass univariate task-based analyses, used either in isolation or as part of a broader analytic framework (e.g., BWAS). While these are powerful tools, it is somewhat surprising that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is not more common in developmental cognitive neuroscience given its enhanced ability to both probe neural population codes and greater sensitivity relative to the mass univariate approach. Omitting MVPA methods might represent a missed opportunity to leverage a suite of tools that are uniquely poised to reveal mechanisms underlying brain development. The goal of this review is to spur awareness and adoption of MVPA in developmental cognitive neuroscience by providing a practical introduction to foundational MVPA concepts. We begin by defining MVPA and explain why examining multivoxel patterns of brain activity can aid in understanding the developing human brain. We then survey four different types of MVPA: Decoding, representational similarity analysis (RSA), pattern expression, and voxel-wise encoding models. Each variant of MVPA is presented with a conceptual overview of the method followed by practical considerations and subvariants thereof. We go on to highlight the types of developmental questions that can be answered by MPVA, discuss practical matters in MVPA implementation germane to developmental cognitive neuroscientists, and make recommendations for integrating MVPA with the existing analytic ecosystem in the field.",

          "abstract": "Psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain fungi, has long been used by Indigenous cultures worldwide for healing and spiritual purposes. While emerging evidence points to psychedelic agents being novel avenues for the treatment of substance use disorders, the predominantly Western medical models of psychedelic-assisted therapy being developed lack Indigenous wisdom and input, raising concerns about safety, efficacy, ownership, and continuing colonial dynamics. In Aotearoa (New Zealand), the enduring impacts of colonisation on Māori include the suppression of Indigenous wisdom, even as research affirming the knowledge and practice of traditional Māori healing is on the rise. \n\nThe Tū Wairua project will explore the integration of rongoā Māori (traditional Māori healing practices) with psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) for addressing problematic methamphetamine use (PMU) in Māori communities. This Māori-led project is driven by kaupapa Māori methodology and rongoā Māori conceptualisations of health and informed by biomedical psychedelic science. Based at Rangiwaho Marae in Te Tairāwhiti, a community with a high Māori population and a significant burden of PMU, the project aims to develop a culturally-appropriate PAT to explore the efficacy of psilocybin in treating PMU. \n\nThis research represents a shift toward health interventions that respect and extend Indigenous wisdom, addressing the unique needs of Māori communities. It also seeks to develop a skilled Māori workforce to continue these healing practices, and challenge current legislation that restricts the use of Indigenous psychedelics. In creating sustainable pathways for healing through a community-driven, culturally-resonant PAT, Tū Wairua charts new directions in Indigenous-led psychedelic science.",

We used triangulation and fitted complementary models to the simulated data and found contradicting increasing and decreasing effects of initial rumination on subsequent change in sleep problems and vice versa. These divergent findings indicated that it is premature to assume causal effects between rumination and sleep problems and the suggestions by Yang and Lei in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Yang and Lei. We recommend researchers to triangulate by fitting complementary models to their data in order to evaluate if analyzed data could be used to support contradicting conclusions, in which case the data should not be used to support any of those conclusions.",

          "abstract": "Spatial reasoning involves understanding and visualising spatial relations and the spatial properties of objects, including spatial aspects of quantities. Spatialising the mathematics curriculum by emphasising thinking and working spatially has broad benefits for mathematics, including geometry, measures, number, algebra and statistics. Research shows that teaching children to think and work spatially results in substantially improved mathematics performance, with lifelong benefits.\n\nThis trajectory of spatial reasoning development for 7- to 11-year-olds complements the trajectory of spatial reasoning development for birth to seven years developed by the Early Childhood Maths Group (see ECMG Spatial Reasoning Toolkit). These two trajectories are informed by extensive review of research in this area and together offer activities for children from birth to 11 years. This trajectory is presented in four sections, covering space (spatial relations) and shape (objects and properties) for 7- to 9-year-olds and 9- to 11-year-olds. Three columns identify the areas of spatial reasoning, the progression in children’s learning and developmentally appropriate activities. Each child develops in their own unique way: age bands are approximate and dependent on previous experience, so should be used as a guide rather than age-related expectations. Spatial reasoning is wider than traditional geometry, including aspects of space and shape such as position and direction, navigation, perspective-taking, scaling, transformations, shape properties and structure, composition and decomposition; the document could be used to substitute a geometry curriculum, with activities integrated throughout the curriculum. \n\nThis document forms part of a series of Royal Society publications on spatial reasoning which can be found at: Royal Society Curriculum and Assessment and accompanies our earlier work on the ECMG Spatial Reasoning Toolkit. \nThe series includes: \n•\tRS ACME Primary and early years expert panel perspective: Spatial reasoning - June 2024 (royalsociety.org) \n•\tProgression of Spatial Reasoning across age bands (Appendix 1 of document listed above)\n•\tThis document, An evidence-based trajectory of spatial reasoning development for 7- to 11-year-olds.\n•\tWhole-school approach case studies: Supporting Primary Children’s Spatial Reasoning in Geography and Design &amp; Technology",

Stakeholder feedback from patients and health professionals improved iterative prototypes. Subsequently, we collected normative data from community dwelling older volunteers without a neurological history. Our case series included patients with ocular conditions or a stroke. For each task of OxVPS, we determined 5th centile cut-off scores. We further explored effects of age, visual acuity, and gender on visual perception through Generalised Linear Models. \nResults: OxVPS is a 15-minute paper-and-pen assessment comprising 10 tasks including picture naming, star counting, and reading. Normative data of 107 participants demonstrated persistent high performance with most cut-offs near ceiling. Apart from the Figure Copy (p&lt;0.001) and Global Shape Perception task (p&lt;0.001) we found no evidence for an effect of visual acuity on OxVPS. An effect of age was only observed in the Face Recognition (p&lt;0.001) and Reading task (p&lt;0.001). No effects of gender were observed. A series of eight cases illustrates the interpretation of OxVPS.\nConclusion: We present the Oxford Visual Perception Screen, a standardised visual perception screening tool alongside normative data and illustrative cases.

          "abstract": "Human perception is often characterised by efficient combination of sensory signals (cues). In recent studies, people could also improve precision via newly learned cues, with applications to enhance perception in healthy and clinical groups.  However, it is unclear whether new cues can enhance manual object interactions. To study how new cues are used for object weight perception, people compared weights of containers. With haptic information plus the familiar visual cue of volume, participants showed precision improvements indicating cue combination. By contrast, a group of participants briefly trained with a novel visual cue to weight (line orientation) did not show improvements expected from combination.  We then asked whether prolonged training (12 hours) with the novel cue would promote combination, testing for significant precision gains individually in six participants. Half of participants showed combination benefits, but these were not clearly related to training, as some combined cues before training. Using an illusion analogous to the size-weight illusion, we also asked whether the novel cue would become an automatic predictor of weight: two participants were susceptible to the illusion. We conclude that weight perception is susceptible to some enhancement, but subject to training effects and individual differences that are not yet understood.",

          "abstract": "Numbers are highly relevant in our everyday lives. Besides intentionally processing number magnitude when necessary, we often automatically process it even when not required. The SNARC (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes; Dehaene et al., 1993) effect, describing faster left-/right-sided responses to smaller/larger numbers, respectively, provides evidence for this automaticity. It arises in semantic number-processing tasks both when number magnitude is task-relevant (e.g., magnitude classification) and task-irrelevant (e.g., parity judgment). However, findings on the SNARC effect in tasks requiring the processing of non-semantic number features are mixed: while it has been observed in orientation judgment tasks, it was mostly absent in color judgment tasks. Importantly, previous studies were underpowered or did not control for confounding variables. In two highly powered online experiments, we found a small but significant SNARC effect in both nominal color judgment (cyan vs. yellow; slope =  1.71 ms) and color intensity judgment (light cyan vs. dark cyan; slope =  1.13 ms) of Arabic digits from 1 to 9 excluding 5, which did not significantly differ in size. Further, we found little evidence for the MARC (Linguistic Markedness of Response Codes, i.e., faster left-/right-sided responses to odd/even numbers, respectively; Nuerk et al., 2004) effect. Moreover, the odd effect (i.e., faster responses to even than to odd numbers; Hines, 1990) was detected. Taken together, both magnitude and parity are processed automatically even if participants respond to physical non-semantic and non-spatial number features, but the spatial mapping seems more automatic for magnitude than for parity.",

          "abstract": "Effortful control (EC), defined as the ability to inhibit impulsive responses according to contextual demands, plays a key role in children’s socioemotional development. However, self-report measures of this ability are extremely scarce. The current study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the EC scale within the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ), the only available self-report measure of EC in middle childhood. Participants were 441 Italian children (53.7% girls) aged between 7.9-10 (Mage = 9.05, SD = 0.56). A series of confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor lower order structure, whereas evidence for the intended 1-factor higher order structure was not found. Structural equation modeling confirmed convergent validity of the questionnaire with theoretically related constructs such as self-worth, emotional-behavioral problems, and prosocial behavior, and confirmed inhibitory control and attentional focusing as core aspects of EC. Overall, the EC scale is a valuable tool for assessing temperament-based self-regulation in middle childhood using four separate scores, but reliability analyses suggest the need for refinement, and more research is needed to clarify its hierarchical structure in the TMCQ.",

One notable approach is the “brain age prediction” framework, which predicts biological age based on neuroimaging data and calculates the brain age gap (BAG); a marker indicating deviation from expected (chronological) age. This method has most commonly been used in adult samples, but has in recent years increasingly been applied to youth populations to assess brain maturation. However, there are a number of unique considerations that must be taken into account when applying brain age prediction in youth. In this Perspective, we briefly review the existing brain age literature in children and adolescents.

Previous studies have focused primarily on long-term environmental factors or isolated features like green space and air quality, neglecting the interaction between multiple exposures encountered in everyday life. This protocol paper describes the study design and dataset of the Day2Day Environment project, an ongoing study investigating how real-world, day-to-day environmental variability affects brain structure, function, and well-being.\nMethods: This longitudinal study collects multimodal data from 30 participants over 25 testing sessions, including neuroimaging and tracking of physiological, behavioral, and environmental variables. Using wearable devices, geographic ecological momentary assessments, and GPS-based geospatial tracking, we collect data on air quality, noise, light exposure, physical activity, stress, cognition, and affect. Neuroimaging measures include T1- and T2*-weighted images during rest and tasks, quantitative multi-parameter mapping, high-resolution proton density imaging of the hippocampus, and diffusion tensor imaging sequences.\nConclusion: The Day2Day Environment dataset offers a unique opportunity to study short-term neuroplasticity in response to the dynamic interplay between multiple environmental exposures.

          "abstract": "The Sense of Agency (SoA), the subjective feeling of controlling one’s actions and their\nconsequences, has been explained through two primary theoretical frameworks: the\ncomparator model and retrospective views. While the comparator model focuses on the\nconsistency between the sensory prediction generated through internal models and the\nactual sensory input, retrospective theories emphasize the detection of regularities\nbetween one’s own actions and sensory input and self-attribution based on this\ninformation. However, how the two types of processes contribute to the exploration of\ncontrol remains unclear. In the present study, we explored this question by examining the\neffect of updating the internal model for motor control on the SoA in a control detection\ntask. Participants first adapted to a rotation of visual feedback while controlling a dot on\nthe screen, then conducted free movements to choose the dot they felt they could control\nmost effectively among five dots with different rotation angles (i.e., the control detection\ntask). Experiment 1 used a tracking task for the motor adaptation, while Experiment 2\nused a reaching task to replicate the result of Experiment 1. The results of the two\nexperiments showed that the motor adaptation in both tasks did not have a significant\neffect on the control detection task. In other words, it is likely that the updating of the\ninternal model only has a minimal effect on the control detection. Our findings indicated\nthat the regularity detection process is likely to dominate in the exploration of the SoA,\ncompared to the predictive process, which requires the internal model to generate\npredictions for each movement. These findings provide important insights for\nunderstanding the sense of agency in the context of exploratory behaviors within the novel\nenvironments.",

The second claim is that psychological network models of attitudes with Ising-like dynamics will maximize both attitudinal consistency and accuracy when within the small-world topological regime. The first claim, one with significant application potentials, has not been sufficiently tested; the second claim, one with high theoretical novelty, has never been addressed. Using a set of analytic results and simulations, we found little support for these claims–in short, the predictions are not logically consistent with the theory.

          "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by both motor and vocal tics, with onset in childhood. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorders, and anxiety disorders. TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships and more. There are limited treatment options for TS, such as behavioral therapy or pharmacological interventions, often with unsatisfactory benefit. Neuromodulation has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS through modulation of neural pathways and networks. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized for TS, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy. The invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, in conjunction with the fact that tics often reduce in severity in early adulthood. Less invasive neuromodulation approaches have also been explored, but their efficacy remains limited. However, given its efficacy in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate pathophysiology and to search for biomarkers of treatment response. This may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation therapies. To maximize progress in the field, we suggest several strategies: multicenter data sharing is crucial due to the small number of people treated at single centers, utilization of recording capabilities on recent DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of the implanted electrodes, and the use of pre-clinical studies to better understand the mechanisms of successful neuromodulation for TS.",

A growing body of literature has examined the neural correlates of pregnancy using EEG, revealing distinct patterns in pregnant females, with these EEG metrics changing throughout gestation and postpartum.

          "abstract": "Visual stimuli can vary in multiple dimensions that affect accuracy and confidence in a perceptual decision-making task. However, previous studies have typically included just one or at most two manipulations, leaving it unclear how a wider set of manipulations may relate to each other. Here, we examine the similarities and differences between five different stimulus manipulations across two experiments. Subjects indicated whether a tilted Gabor patch was oriented clockwise or counterclockwise from 45°. In Experiment 1, we independently manipulated the size, duration, noise level, and tilt offset of the stimuli. In Experiment 2, we employed a 2x2x2x2 design jointly manipulating size, spatial frequency, noise level, and tilt offset of the stimuli. We found that manipulations of size, duration, noise level, and spatial frequency had remarkably similar effects on accuracy and confidence. In contrast, the tilt offset manipulation stood out by affecting accuracy more strongly than confidence. In addition, tilt offset exhibited supraadditive interaction with all other manipulations for both accuracy and confidence, whereas the remaining manipulations exhibited either no interactions or subadditive interactions with each other. Furthermore, tilt offset was also the only manipulation for which confidence in incorrect trials decreased with increasing difficulty, while all other manipulations exhibited the opposite trend. Overall, our results reveal a startling similarity between the effects of four very different stimulus manipulations and a prominent difference with a fifth manipulation. These results open the door for a priori predictions of how novel manipulations would affect accuracy and confidence.",

          "abstract": "The application of mindfulness practices in schools has gained significant attention as a tool for helping students develop self-regulation skills. This chapter explores the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in educational settings, while addressing key challenges such as the religious origins of mindfulness and potential concerns about its integration into diverse school environments. Additionally, it highlights opportunities for incorporating mindfulness practices that respect and center cultural contexts, as well as the origins of the practice itself. Through a case example utilizing a relational framework, the chapter demonstrates how mindfulness can be adapted and implemented in schools to promote emotional well-being and resilience among students. The discussion emphasizes the importance of aligning mindfulness interventions with both the developmental needs of students and the broader social and cultural dynamics of the school community.",

Inspired by neural models, OFP conceptualizes cognitive control as an oscillating field that perturbs a quantum system, and represents arousal as the ``gain'' induced by this field. By integrating OFP with the Multiple Particle Multiple Well (MPMW) framework, we demonstrate that OFP successfully explains how the shape of the Yerkes-Dodson law varies with task difficulty and familiarity, consistent with empirical findings. To the best of the authors' knowledge, OFP is the first model to provide a unified account of the empirical variations in the shape of the Yerkes-Dodson law.",

Study 1 (144 countries) shows that poorer, more unequal nations score lower on indices of intergenerational concern and farsighted policies. A Supplementary Study (34 countries, N = 123,502) shows that subjective SES predicts greater obligation to sacrifice for future lives, especially in nations with less inequality. In Study 2 (N = 1,264 Americans), individuals randomly assigned more resources allocate more to future generations, though not proportionately more. Replicating Study 1 and the Supplementary Study, real-world SES predicts higher donations beyond situational framings. Thus, combatting present-day societal challenges may be key to increasing concern and action for humanity’s future.",

This study explores the physiological responses to mealtime in individuals with ED and healthy controls (HC).\n\nMethods: Three studies were conducted. Study 1 assessed heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance response (SCR), and skin temperature (ST) before, during, and after lunch among hospitalised patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Studies 2 and 3 examined these measures in healthy office workers at lunchtime in a naturalistic setting. \n\nResults: Patients experienced increased subjective stress but did not show expected physiological stress responses, such as pre-meal HR increases or post-meal HR decreases. Instead, HR decreased during the meal, with no significant changes in HRV or SCR. For ST, no changes were found for individuals with AN, while individuals with BN showed the expected decrease before lunch and increase after. In HC, HR and SCR increased before meals, ST rose, HRV decreased during meals, and SCR decreased following meals. \n\nDiscussion: These findings suggest a mismatch between subjective and physiological stress in ED, possibly due to chronic stress or undernutrition. For HC, sympathetic activation before lunch may reflect biological and emotional responses unrelated to stress.",

Beginning with an intuitive pixel-experience analogy, a mathematical approach based on attractor dynamics, Lyapunov functions, and weak/strong Markov blankets is then used to describe how cognitive states continuously stabilize representations under metabolic constraints, while dynamically updating beliefs through prediction-driven attractor shifts, ensuring adaptive inference. The framework unifies perception, memory, and emotion within a non-Bayesian predictive model that formalizes the emergence of both computational and linguistic capabilities via recursive self-organization. By embedding cognition within thermodynamic and geometric principles, this work bridges neural mechanics with phenomenological experience, providing new insights into consciousness, learning, and pathological states, while suggesting testable hypotheses for theoretical neuroscience and AI.",

          "abstract": "Between three to six years of age, children become better able to detect smaller differences in non-symbolic visual quantities. This includes judging which set of objects are greater in number and area, suggesting that the underlying approximate magnitude representations facilitating the estimation of these quantities becoming more precise with age. These parallels in developmental trends raise questions about the extent to which they are observed across different non-symbolic quantities. The present study addressed this question using a novel quantity: visual fire intensity. Like number and area, fire intensity can be estimated using visual cues and has real-world implications. However, it is unclear whether young children accurately compare fire intensities and if there are age-related differences in performance. The present study investigated the developmental trend of young children's visual perception of fire intensity. Over 70 three- to six-year-olds completed a comparison task where they judged which of two train engines contained more fire. Based on non-symbolic quantity research, the ratio (relative difference) between the intensity of two simulated fires was varied across trials to be smaller versus larger. Significant ratio and age effects were observed: children were more likely to select the train with the greater intensity fire as being ‘more’ the larger the ratio and the older the child. These results suggest that young children are sensitive to differences in fire intensity using visual cues and have increasingly precise estimates by six years of age. This developmental pattern indicates that approximate magnitude representations support perceptions of fire intensity.",

According to the formal requirements of representational measurement, we argue that a measurable psychological attribute emerges, if and only if relational responses are selected such that the resulting structure is homomorphic to a numerical structure such as the real numbers. We further embed the concept of emergent psychological attributes in the theory of operant selection, where selection is understood as a multilevel process that shapes behavior with regard to its expected fitness consequences. Thus, psychological attributes are context-dependent discriminative stimuli that are generated by the individual to enable the prediction of expected changes in evolutionary fitness, given a certain action is taken in that context. The theory has wide implications for the interpretation of psychological scales, as well as for the experimental study of measurement in psychology.",

          "authors": "Sahba Saberi",
          "abstract": "Emotion science struggles to establish a unified definition of emotion, arguably largely due to differing perspectives on its constituent components. Traditional theories often conflate cognitive appraisal and interoception under the term ‘emotion.’ We propose a nomenclature shift by delineating interoception from appraisal. Acknowledging that cognition can trigger, interpret, label, or influence emotional experiences, we argue this interaction does not necessitate including cognition as a component of emotion. Instead, defining these components separately enhances understanding of their individual mechanisms and interactions. To support our framework, we examine the current literature, concluding that no strong theoretical or empirical justification exists for combining interoception and appraisal into one construct. Reserving 'emotion' for interoceptive responses alone enhances theoretical clarity, research precision, and clinical effectiveness.\n\nPublic Significance Statement: This paper proposes an approach to redefining 'emotion' as the experience of internal bodily sensations (interoception), distinct from thought processes or interpretations (cognitive appraisal). Through the delineation of these processes, this perspective aims to refine emotion theory and expand its applications in research and practice.",

Since the 1930s, pioneering studies by Penfield and subsequent advancements in visual neuroscience by Hubel and Wiesel have popularized the concept of cortical maps as representations of external and internal states. Yet, contemporary research in various sensory systems, including visual cortices in certain animals, questions the universal applicability of this model. We critique the restrictive influence of this paradigm and introduce an alternative conceptualization using the olfactory system as a model. This system's genetic diversity and dynamic neural encoding serve as a foundation for proposing a rule-based, adaptive framework for neural processing, akin to the dynamic routing in GPS technology, which moves beyond fixed spatial mappings.",

Despite citing a well-established positive reinforcement protocol in stopping chasing behavior in dogs by Bangura (2024), Johnson and Wynne’s implementation markedly diverged from empirically supported methods, resulting in methodological confounds that invalidate their claims of low efficacy for non-aversive approaches. The present critique synthesizes peer-reviewed research, professional standards, and foundational learning principles to demonstrate that the misapplication of recommended procedures, inadequate reinforcement strategies, and poorly controlled variables produced artificially inflated success rates for e-collar training. Furthermore, the analysis reveals significant concerns regarding experimental design, welfare measures, and data interpretation that cast doubt on the reliability and ethical defensibility of the study’s conclusions. References are drawn from current, high-caliber sources to reinforce that properly executed positive reinforcement techniques can effectively curb high-drive chasing behaviors without resorting to punitive measures.",

The former were to become woodland-dwellers in multifemale-multimale troops with social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal investment or interest in their offspring, which is the preserve of mothers. \n \tContrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (consisting of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had three consequences that would impinge on homininan evolution and differentiate it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans, namely: \n(1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, eaten, or carried away, within a 2-hour walk; \n(2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any time of the year, which meant that voracious social units were necessarily small; \n(3) Smallness which, in turn, demanded ingenuity and the transmissibiity of existential information in the form of active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, by virtue of the broadening of homininan \"zones of bounded surprisal\" with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan social unit and between adjoining homininan units in the landscape, which spread geographically over time as budding small-world information networks (and eventually reached Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Late (Upper) Pleistocene);\n(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sometimes collaboration between social units (maybe ca. 4.2 Ma in Australopithecus anamensis), which, together with the generation of information within each unit, favoured paternal investment in child-rearing in mixed-sex social units and by mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners with establishment of mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby (mixed-sex philopatry), which maintained not only heterozygosity but also, most important, kinship links that favoured cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units: all of that marked a major behavioural shift away from paninan social arrangements.\n                          \n\tThe vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of false dawns between ~4.2 Ma (Australopithecus anamensjs) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan palaeospecies (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving Homo sapiens alone in prehistory to roam around the world, the sole depositary of our now highly-evolved homininan hierarchically mechanistic mind conditioned by our unparallelled wide zone of bounded surprisal grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.",

          "authors": "Emma Černis; louise johns; Amy Hardy",
          "abstract": "Background\n\nDissociative experiences are common transdiagnostically, and particularly prevalent in psychosis. Such experiences have long been under-recognised in routine clinical practice, despite evidence that dissociation is related to clinical complexity and increased risk of self-harm and suicidality. Adopting a symptom-specific, targeted approach to conceptualisation and intervention of dissociation may help improve outcomes. \n\nAims\n\nThe evidence base for psychological treatments targeting dissociation is building, but training and guidance for clinicians remains sparse. This review outlines a preliminary approach to the treatment of a subtype of dissociative experience (‘felt sense of anomaly’ dissociation), based on emerging research evidence and clinical practice. The guidance is tailored to the context of first episode psychosis, and may also have broader clinical relevance.\n\nMethod\n\nFactors to consider in the assessment, formulation, and intervention of felt sense of anomaly dissociation in the context of first episode psychosis are outlined, including reflections on process issues. We present a cognitive-behavioural model, where affect-related changes are interpreted as an internal threat, driving a maintenance cycle of catastrophic appraisals and safety behaviours. Using this formulation, evidence-based therapy techniques familiar to most readers can then be applied.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt is important for clinicians to consider dissociation. As well as generating new avenues for translational intervention research, we anticipate that the novel insights and specific advice outlined here will be of use to professionals working with dissociation in psychosis (and beyond). Encouragingly, we demonstrate that widely used, evidence-based skills and techniques can be employed to address distress arising from dissociation.",

The sample included 161 adolescents aged 12-18 (M = 15.22, SD = 1.59), with 77 adolescents followed up. Latent profile analysis identified four profiles: low-risk, primary psychopathy, secondary interpersonal/behavioral, and secondary affective. The primary psychopathy subgroup exhibited the highest levels of externalizing problems at T1 and T2, while the secondary interpersonal/behavioral group reported higher levels of child maltreatment, more previous placements, and greater trauma-related symptoms. The secondary affective subgroup showed a more adaptive adjustment compared to the other high psychopathy subgroups. These results are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Background\nLoneliness is considered to be a global public health problem with significant consequences for physical and mental well-being. It is associated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety and other adverse health outcomes. Although previous research has examined the relationship between loneliness and mental health, the role of self-efficacy as a potential moderating factor remains under-researched. The aim of this study is to examine the associations between loneliness, self-efficacy, depression and anxiety in a large representative sample of the general adult population in the Czech Republic.\nMethods\nThe data (n = 1193; 50.3±15.5; 57% males) were collected in April 2021 through a cross-sectional study design, with an adult population, using an online survey. We measured anxiety (The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale; OASIS), depression (The Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale; ODSIS), loneliness (The Three-Item Loneliness Scale; TILS) and self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale; GSES). Statistical analysis was performed using binary logistic regression, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), Wilcoxon rank-sum and the Kruskal-Wallis test. \nResults\nPeople with higher loneliness were more likely to experience anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, p &lt; 0.001) and depression (OR = 1.77, p &lt; 0.001); self-efficacy was associated with lower likelihood of these symptoms by 9% (OR = 0.91, p &lt; 0.001).  The SEM analysis revealed that loneliness was significantly associated with both anxiety and depression; higher self-efficacy significantly moderated the loneliness–depression relationship (β = -0.08, p = 0.03) by weakening this association.\n\nConclusion\nLoneliness is associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, while self-efficacy is the opposite. High self-efficacy is associated with a reduction in the negative mental health impacts of loneliness, which can be used in intervention programmes for vulnerable groups. The causal relationship should be tested in future studies.\nKeywords\nloneliness, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, OASIS, ODSIS",

          "abstract": "Foraging complexity and competitive social challenges are considered key drivers of human cognition. Yet, we still have a poor understanding of the decision-making mechanisms underlying foraging behaviour, especially in social contexts. Here, we use high-resolution tracking data in combination with computational and agent-based models to uncover the mechanisms guiding the decisions where to forage and when to leave a patch. Equipping large groups of Finnish ice-fishers competing for resources with global positioning systems and headcams, and analyzing 477 foraging trips and 16,055 individual choices across different foraging ecologies, reveals that foragers use foraging success, social information and landscape features to locate resource patches. Foragers adaptively arbitrate between social and asocial information sources, relying less on social information when successful. Patch-leaving decisions are mostly driven by foraging success, with high resource abundance eliciting lower giving-up times. Guided by these findings, we construct an agent-based model capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of our field observations, showing that patch discoveries induce localized search, a process which is amplified by high social densities. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms guiding human foraging behaviour and provides a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study human cognition in the real world.",

          "abstract": "Assessing a parent's ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children is a challenging task for child welfare workers. Given the complex and indefinite nature of parenting, decision-makers often rely on subjective criteria in their evaluations. In Study 1 (N = 49), we examined the variability among child welfare professionals as they independently assessed the overall quality of care in ten vignettes, each depicting different scenarios. We found an inter-rater reliability of .50, indicating a concerning level of unwanted variability (‘noise’), with 24.7 % of the variance attributable to average differences between raters. This suggests that raters have different thresholds for what constitutes unsafe parenting. In Study 2 (N = 44), we examined whether aggregating domain-specific evaluations would reduce noise, but the resulting improvement in inter-rater reliability to .54 was not statistically significant. We found 28.7 % level noise after aggregating. We conclude that noise-reduction strategies are appropriate and necessary to improve the consistency of assessments in child welfare decisions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Tool innovation in young children is an underexplored topic, and the Gestalt and the perception-action theories offer different explanations of the process of tool innovation. Aims: We aimed to design and to validate nine new tool innovation tasks and to investigate 3- to 6-year-olds’ tool innovation process. Sample: From three kindergartens, 141 Chinese children (77 boys and 64 girls) took part in this research. Methods: Using the new tasks, children’s performance was coded as task success (whether the reward was retrieved) and ideal manipulation (whether certain manipulation was performed), and children’s exploration process was coded for fixation (the frequency of repeating the same actions) and flexibility (the frequency of shifting to novel actions). Children’s cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibitory control, divergent thinking, and general intelligence were also measured. Results: The new tasks showed varied difficulty levels and exhibited high internal consistency, and children’s individual differences in task performance were positively associated with their individual differences in age, general intelligence, and divergent thinking. Children’s behavioral fixation hinders their tool innovation; and this effect was strengthened for easier compared to harder tasks, whereas children's behavioral flexibility enhances their tool innovation; and this effect was seemingly stronger for harder compared to easier tasks. Conclusions: The new tasks were robust and suitable for studying young children’s tool innovation. Task difficulty level has a critical role in shaping children’s tool innovation process, which may serve as a mechanism to bridge the Gestalt and the perception-action theories in explaining the process of tool innovation.",

Using feature selection with elastic net regression, MTPA identifies predictive neural patterns while preserving the temporal structure and interpretability of the data. Across two experiments with distinct populations and objectives, MTPA demonstrated consistent advantages over approaches using principal component analysis (PCA), windowed averaging, and no dimension reduction. Experiment 1 predicted persistent work-related psychological states in business professionals, achieving accuracies up to 79.1%. Experiment 2 predicted cognitive load and narrative context during video viewing in undergraduates, with accuracies up to 66.5%. These findings suggest that MTPA may be a useful tool for analyzing neural data from extended naturalistic designs, enabling researchers to improve prediction accuracy across diverse outcomes and obtain new insights into the temporal dynamics of neural responses.",

However, exploratory analyses revealed anger following rumination was\nsignificantly reduced for intoxicated participants high in trait anger who received anodal\nstimulation, compared to sham stimulation.

Leveraging a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, 42 infants between 2 and 12 months of age viewed 200 images spanning 50 distinct objects, with as many repetitions as possible tailored to individual infants comfort. Our technical validation demonstrates discernible neural responses to both individual objects and categorical distinctions, affirming the dataset's robustness and utility for exploring the neural underpinnings of visual object recognition in infancy.

Through focus groups, interviews, and surveys, we collected HCW testimonials and feedback for adapting each SSI. Using an open-access, internet-based platform (i.e., Single Session Support Center website), we piloted each adapted SSI to investigate their individual and combined effects on hopelessness, agency, and subjective distress. Usage patterns were analyzed to assess engagement, effect sizes were calculated to determine SSI effectiveness, and acceptability was measured to determine real-world applicability. HCWs who completed a SSI (n = 91) reported significant improvements in agency and hopelessness, although differential effects emerged between SSIs. Acceptability results were high, across all three SSIs, indicating satisfaction with the self-guided program. Findings suggest digital, self-guided SSIs may be accessible, acceptable, and effective for providing HCWs with mental health support at any time, and from any location connected to the internet.",

There are complex philosophical questions that need to be understood, physical restrictions to consider, biological organisation that seems relevant to conscious beings, and phenomenological and psychological aspects that can not be studied under quantitative methods only. Today, however, scientific models of consciousness target a few aspects and little dialogue is found among them, even less among fields. In this article, we react to this current state of consciousness research and motivate a transdisciplinary, diverse and rigorous approach. We first introduce how the primacy of experience generates an explanatory paradox for mechanistic accounts and how to avoid it with a broader perspective. We follow by presenting tools such as mereological distinctions (constitution and causation), constraint-types of explanations and a sound axiomatic strategy for empirical and theoretical research. This critical and constructive reading motivates open dialogue and intellectual humility. We end our contribution by offering collaborative paths beyond neuroscience and calling for a fruitful exchange between different models of consciousness. This, we argue, might be the only way to solve and/or dissolve the \"problem\" of consciousness.",

Consequently, current clinical prediction models are not actionable. To be actionable, clinical prediction models must be based on causation not association, use counterfactuals to predict the individualised treatment effect incorporating the proposed intervention into the model, and provide dynamic not static predictions which react to changes in treatment.

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a procedural trial generation approach for designing cognitive assessments and demonstrates the methodology through a novel executive functioning planning task. Drawing inspiration from Procedural Content Generation (PCG) in gaming, we created a scalable and adaptable method for generating a variety of cognitive trials. Our exemplary task, influenced by traditional cognitive measures and digital puzzle games, involves moving colored blocks to form matches and clear the screen, and assesses planning. The task development process is detailed from designing mockups through to coding, making the task accessible online, and conducting internal testing. The procedural generation technique, used to automatically generate trials for the task, followed a generate-and-test methodology. The process began with the pseudo-random generation of puzzles, then a solving algorithm (breadth-first search) explored the generated configurations and retained only the solvable puzzles. This approach automatically produced many diverse trials for our task. We discuss future directions for PCG in cognitive assessment, including the potential exploration of advanced algorithms to further optimize trial generation. We also provide guidelines for digital cognitive task development and procedural trial generation in cognitive assessment to facilitate the generation of many trials for a broad range of applications, particularly for longitudinal implementations, including cognitive intervention studies and cognitive ecological momentary assessment.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Non-suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is a highly prevalent transdiagnostic behavior among treatment-seeking individuals. The use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) shows clinical potential for engaging patients outside the therapy room, but the utility for individuals who self-injure remains unclear. This prospective study evaluates self-reported benefits (e.g., increased self-insight and self-efficacy) and challenges (e.g., beep disturbances and emotional discomfort) associated with using EMA among individuals reporting past-month NSSI at treatment intake.\nMethods:  In this cohort study, 124 treatment-seeking adolescents and adults who self-injure completed baseline assessments and participated in a 28-day EMA protocol with six daily self-monitoring assessments of emotions, cognitions, and behaviors (including self-injury). After one month, participants received an EMA feedback survey assessing general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight, self-efficacy, EMA compliance, beep disturbances, and emotional discomfort.\nResults: Of 124 participants, 98 completed the EMA survey (Response Rate = 79.03%). Average EMA compliance was 74.87% (SD = 18.78) and decreased linearly across time. Four in five patients (78.57%) reported experiencing at least one benefit. After using EMA, 32.65% reported increased general self-insight, 64.58% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight, 9.28% reported increased general self-efficacy, and 41.67% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Across the sample, 7.29% experienced EMA in treatment as tiring, stressful, at times overwhelming, and not enjoyable. Higher levels of emotional discomfort were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-0.29, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.37, p &lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-0.28, p=.006).\nConclusion: Although the use of EMA in treatment may evoke emotional discomfort in patients, it may help promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy outside the therapy room in patients who self-injure.",

          "abstract": "Genetically informed research on the association between father absence and age at menarche (AAM) has generally proceeded by determining if the unique effect of father absence persists while accounting for genetic controls. This approach has proven important for discerning potentially causal environmental effects (i.e., father absence) from genetic confounds, but suffers from a methodological asymmetry that can undermine conclusions about the relative importance of genes and environments. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative importance of a set of 10 commonly examined, ostensibly environmental predictors of AAM in comparison to genetic variation captured by a polygenic score (PGS). Dominance analysis that included 2,048 regression models was applied to longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = 3,645 Caucasian female participants) to determine the relative importance of these 11 predictors for explaining variance in AAM. Results showed that the PGS explained more variance in AAM in than any of the environmental predictors in every model and more than double the variance of all the environmental predictors combined. Notably, father absence explained the third-most variance, falling behind BMI and prenatal smoking. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of genetically informed research on father absence/AAM and how the asymmetry between methods of measuring genes and environment in these studies can impact the conclusions drawn.",

          "abstract": "Over the last 20 years, personality development has become one of the most widely studied topics in personality science. However, evidence on normative and event-related personality development stems almost exclusively from Western countries, providing limited insight into the cross-cultural generalizability of personality trait changes. To address this limitation, we used data from the Africa Long Life Study to examine personality development in young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa over 1 to 2 years (N = 2,382). We found that the cross-cultural Big Two personality traits – Agency and Communion – were moderately rank-order stable over 1 year, with test-retest correlations of r = .38 to r = .55. In contrast to our expectations, Agency and Communion significantly decreased across the study period. Finally, using open-ended questions, we investigated the most important life changes of our participants and examined their associations with personality trait changes. We found that personality trait levels predicted the occurrence and perception of life events, while the occurrence and perception of life events, in turn, predicted personality trait changes. Overall, our findings were partly in line with but also partly diverging from findings on personality development from Western countries. This suggests that insights into personality development cannot automatically be generalized across cultural contexts but that a careful examination of which personality development phenomena are universal and which are culture-specific is warranted. Our study provides initial indications that environment-driven personality trait changes may be a mechanism of personality development that generalizes across cultural contexts.",

In this commentary, we point out that there are scenarios where people can opt to replicate studies with a lower RV compared to those with a higher RV. Methodologically, we highlight that the differences in the RV become very small when comparing studies with different large (e.g., over 500) samples. To adjust for this, we demonstrate that a modification to the RV-equation – by log transforming the sample size – leads to a RV that discriminates between studies with large sample sizes with greater precision.",

          "abstract": "Learning multiple tasks in succession is a challenge for artificial and biological agents alike. However, it is often claimed that artificial agents fail to learn new tasks without overwriting previous ones, while humans succeed. Here, using a canonical sequential rule-learning task in which learners acquire Task~A, then learn Task~B, and are finally re-tested on Task~A, we see conserved patterns of transfer and interference in humans and neural networks. When successive tasks are similar (compared to dissimilar), both types of learner benefit more from transferring prior knowledge to Task~B, but demonstrate greater interference when retested on Task~A. Examining the hidden representations in neural networks, we observe this interference arises because networks utilise their existing solutions to accelerate learning of similar tasks, whilst corrupting those solutions for their previous use. In humans, we also observe striking individual differences where some participants (`lumpers') show interference after sequentially learning two similar tasks, while others (`splitters') avoid interference. These two strategies are associated with opposite patterns of performance benefits: `lumpers' are better at learning shared structure across stimuli and generalising to new settings, while `splitters' are better at remembering unique features of the stimuli. By varying the training regime for neural networks (`rich' versus `lazy'), we can recreate these differences, pushing networks towards low-dimensional representations which capitalise on shared structure, or high-dimensional representations maximising discrimination between inputs. Overall, our findings reveal shared computational principles relating transfer and interference in both systems, governed by global factors like task similarity and individual differences in structuring knowledge.",

The constant rise in applications of these methods in diverse scientific disciplines spurred developments in all their aspects. Inconsistencies could be found in terminology and, analysis and reporting of results of multiverse-style methods.

Existing programs face scalability limitations, restricting their capacity to reach larger audiences and achieve a widespread impact.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the Fount Prevention Framework, which provides strategies for enhancing scalability, expanding audience reach, and improving mental health outcomes in prevention and promotion programs. The Mind Wellbeing program is examined as a practical application of the framework's principles. Key features, such as the use of self-help, group-based formats and physical workbooks as potential solutions for accessibility and cost-effectiveness, are highlighted. The program's independence from experts, trained facilitators, and technology-based delivery modes is also examined, along with its transdiagnostic, universal, and group-based approach to fostering scalable mental health promotion and engagement.\n\nFindings: The Fount Prevention Framework’s principles highlight the potential for scalable preventive and mental health promotion programs with increased impact and widespread reach. Limitations and challenges are also discussed to highlight considerations for future adaptation and broader application.\n\nOriginality: This paper contributes a novel perspective by proposing a framework that promotes scalability in preventive and mental health promotion programs, addressing a critical gap in existing frameworks and strategies.\n\nPractical implications: The framework offers practical solutions for designing scalable, accessible mental health prevention initiatives, potentially benefiting policymakers, educators, and mental health practitioners.\n\nSocial implications: By promoting mental health education through scalable self-help initiatives, the framework may contribute to reducing the global burden of mental illness and fostering community resilience.",

          "abstract": "Authors from low- and middle-income countries often have lower acceptance rates in academic journals, leading to their ideas receiving less attention. One hypothesized contributor to this disparity is the limited geographical diversity of peer reviewers. If reviewers favor submissions from their own country (i.e. homophily), and authors from certain countries are disproportionately reviewed by same-country reviewers, this creates a “geographical representation bias” favoring those authors. Using administrative data from the Institute of Physics Publishing (IOP), encompassing metadata on 204,718 submissions to 60 STEM journals between 2018-2022, we find strong evidence of this bias. Comparing different reviewers of the same manuscript, we find that those from the same country as the corresponding author are 4.78 percentage points more likely to review positively, and authors from countries well-represented in the reviewer pool (e.g., USA, China, India) are 8-9 times more likely to be evaluated by same-country reviewers. An instrumental variables analysis using an exogenous policy change that created variation in which submissions were anonymized shows that anonymizing submissions does not significantly reduce homophily.  These findings provide support for efforts to diversify reviewer pools, and suggest that there are no “quick fixes” for geographical representation bias.",

Our study explores the relationship between distributive social justice and environmental attitudes among young people in the context of climate change. Using a natural experimental design, we examine how the 2021 European Floods influenced social justice and environmental attitudes. Our results indicate significant shifts in attitudes, particularly regarding social justice, following the flooding. We found a strong and robust relationship between social justice and environmental attitudes. A causal mediation analysis revealed that floods affected environmental attitudes indirectly through social justice attitudes beyond direct effects. Our results emphasise the importance of integrating the principles of justice in addressing climate change and suggest that young people’s perspectives on social justice play a crucial role in shaping environmental policies and responses to climate crises.",

          "authors": "Andrei Boutyline; Ethan Johnston",
          "abstract": "Word embeddings are a powerful tool for measuring cultural meaning using large text corpora. In sociology, common applications estimate the meanings of concepts by projecting keywords onto latent semantic axes constructed from pairs of opposing anchor terms. This task requires researchers to identify anchor pairs that reliably operationalize the semantic dimension. However, the methodological toolkit for doing this remains underdeveloped—there are no established metrics for assessing anchor set reliability from embedding data, and indeed no clear theoretical understanding of what this reliability entails. We address this gap by investigating three forms of reliability potentially relevant to anchor sets: parallelism between offset vectors, synonymy between anchors at the same endpoint, and antonymy between opposed anchors. Using an original N=1750 survey dataset of respondents’ ratings of several hundred terms along 36 semantic dimensions, plus existing ratings for 3 additional dimensions, we evaluate how well these reliability metrics predict the accuracy of 39,000 axes that operationalize these dimensions in embedding space. We find that parallelism robustly outperforms the other metrics in predicting accuracy. We demonstrate several ways researchers can use parallelism to improve their anchor sets, including identifying problematic anchors and suggesting promising antonyms. We conclude with broader recommendations for semantic axis construction.",

BrainWaves provides a framework for relevant and diverse research programmes into adolescent mental health and wellbeing that can translate into practice and policy. The research programme is a partnership with schools centred on establishing a large (n&gt;50,000) cohort and trials platform. Reported here is the BrainWaves cohort pilot study. This was designed as proof-of-concept for our recruitment and data capture pipelines, and for cost-modelling. A network of research schools was recruited and a computer-driven questionnaire administered. The eligible population was 16+ year olds who were attending the research schools. Of 41 research schools, 36 (88%) participated over one three-week and one four-week data collection period. From an eligible population of 33,531 young people, 16,010 (48%) attended the study lesson and created an account. Of the 16,010 (100%) who created an account, 15,444 (96%) consented to participate, 9,321 (60%) consented to linkage of research data with educational records, and 6,069 (39%) consented to linkage of research with school/college attendance data. Participants were aged 16-19 years, 59% female, and 76% White. Higher levels of anxiety and depression were found in girls than boys. Higher levels of media-based social networking were found in girls, whereas higher levels of media-based gaming were found in boys. Girls were more likely to report insufficient sleep whilst boys were more likely to report high levels of exercise. This study confirmed an ability to recruit at pace and scale. Whilst the response-rate does not indicate a representative sample, the demographics describe an inclusive and diverse sample. Data collected confirmed findings from previous studies indicating that the electronic data collection methods did not materially bias the findings. Initial cost-modelling suggests these data were collected for around £20 per participant.",

          "abstract": "The scientific community is facing a critical juncture. The growing backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM is not merely a shift in discourse—it is a targeted effort to redefine the boundaries of scientific participation and knowledge production. This paper examines how the removal of DEI language from policies, funding frameworks, and academic institutions serves as a mechanism for reinforcing exclusionary structures that have long marginalized underrepresented groups in science. Through a historical and policy-based analysis, this paper demonstrates how previous waves of ideological resistance to inclusivity in academia have led to detrimental outcomes for scientific progress. The perspective argues that the erasure of DEI is not just a rhetorical shift but a fundamental restructuring of power in STEM, one that threatens the very foundation of scientific inquiry.",

          "abstract": "Organizational theory has developed in numerous directions that have been difficult to integrate. This review synthesizes them into seven perspectives, with theories focused within and beyond the organization (i.e., intra- and extra-organizational dynamics). It proposes the acronym SCRIPTS: structure, culture, relations, institutions, professions, transformation, and social conflict. Within organizations, structure focuses on theories of bureaucracy, management, decision-making, and routines while culture focuses on shared values, identity, climate, and sensemaking. Relations involve studies of interpersonal and interorganizational networks. Institutions focus on the macro-dynamics of fields and isomorphism, and micro-dynamics of entrepreneurship and inhabited institutions. Professions refer to psychological factors shaping individual performance and sociological factors shaping work and occupations. Transformation involves episodic and gradual changes within organizations and across society. Social conflict involves power and competition, with key theories focused on gendered, racialized, and global inequalities. This paper introduces theories and concepts in the study of organizations by grouping similar perspectives, highlighting their domains within or beyond the organization, and underscoring their utility for researchers and leaders.",

Using an experimental survey design of 369 factorial vignettes, I tested for racial and gender differences in 276 teachers’ ratings of referral to begin disability evaluations—what I call the deployment of disability—across 115 Wisconsin schools with varying racial compositions. Findings show that teachers in schools with low proportions of White students were less likely to deploy disability for White girls than all other students; these disparities closed or reversed as teachers’ schools increased in proportion White. Results also suggest that White boys with academic difficulties were perceived as more likely disabled than their male peers of color – only in schools with more Black students. These results provide mixed evidence that \"racial distinctiveness\" triggers teachers' racialized and gendered deployment of disability. School composition effects provide empirical evidence of the social construction of disability, its intersection with race and gender, and that this construction emerges as an aspect of context as well as through individual teachers’ behaviors.",

          "authors": "Giacomo Melli",
          "abstract": "Inspired by Weber’s distinction between class and status, the paper explores the independent and joint role of social class and subjective social status in shaping electoral participation in contemporary European democracies. While social class has long been established as a predictor of political behaviour, less attention has been paid to the influence of subjective status, an individual’s self-assessed position within the social hierarchy. Drawing on nineteen waves of data from the International Social Survey Program from 2002 to 2021 across twenty-five European countries, this paper examines how social class and subjective status independently and jointly influence voter turnout. The findings indicate that while social class remains a significant determinant of voting behaviour, subjective status introduces additional complexity. Individuals with higher subjective status are more likely to vote, regardless of their social class. Moreover, within social classes, particularly the working class, participation rates are stratified by subjective status, with a notable gap between individuals with high and low subjective status. By employing Linear Probability Models with Country-Year Fixed Effects, the study accounts for cross-national differences and provides a robust analysis of electoral participation trends. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of political inequality, suggesting that subjective aspects of social stratification should be considered alongside traditional class-based analyses to fully grasp the factors influencing voter turnout in European democracies.",

          "abstract": "Academic research on Black protests often relies on elite mainstream White-centric news sources and neglects events between the 1960s and the 2010s. We compare the coverage by the New York Times and two Black newspapers of four episodes of protests about police violence in New York in the late 1990s: the killing of Amadou Diallo in 1999, which led to many protests over two years and was discussed in hundreds of news articles, and three overlapping episodes about the torture of Abner Louima in 1997 and the killings of Malcolm Ferguson and Patrick Dorismond in 2000. We find that the New York Times emphasized partisan politics as protest motivations, quoted police extensively and often printed material sympathetic to police, and typically portrayed protesters as angry or motivated by politics. Black newspapers emphasized long-term systemic problems with police, moral condemnation of police violence, the connection of current protests with past oppression and struggles, the involvement of youth, and Black immigrants’ growing awareness of anti-Blackness. Our findings elucidate that centering a “Black gaze” provides an important balance to White-centric sources and demonstrates the continuity of the Black movement in its opposition to police violence.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate if people who show prosocial behavior (volunteers who are engaged in palliative care) differ in their personality traits from those who do not express such a behavior. Psychological gender roles, social competences and temperament features were measured with the questionnaires. Sixty eight individuals took part in this study (35 palliative volunteers and 33 controls). Volunteers were expected to be more androgynous, have more feminine stereotype characteristics, have a higher social competences and a lower level of emotional reactiveness than participants from the control group.  Results: The study results have showed that the volunteers scored higher on feminine scale than participants from the control group. This was valid for both women and men, and resulted in higher number of androgynous individuals among men and a higher number of feminine gender typed individuals among women. Additionally it was also found that emotional reactiveness in volunteers depends on the biological sex: the volunteer women have lower level of this characteristic than the volunteer man and also than the control men. No difference in social competences between the volunteers and the control group was found. In summary this study shows that decision about engagement in palliative care depends on the level of stereotypical feminine characteristics, the level of emotional reactiveness and the level of endurance.",

          "abstract": "Social norms, understood as shared expectations of appropriate behavior, can help resolve collective action problems by making salient collectively beneficial equilibria. However, achieving long-lasting behavior of this type has so far challenged policymakers. To make progress, we need a deeper understanding of the dynamics of people’s normative expectations regarding collectively beneficial behaviors. This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment to collect panel data on individuals’ normative expectations regarding contributions in a public goods (PG) game. Using the Krupka &amp; Weber’s 2013 method, we elicit participants’ normative expectations at three stages: before playing a repeated standard PG game, after completing the repeated PG game, and after playing a repeated PG game with social incentives activated through the threat of exclusion from non-financial group activities. By comparing these stages, we examine whether and how experienced group behavior in PG games within two distinct structured social contexts—one without and one with social incentives—shapes individuals’ normative expectations. Our findings indicate heterogeneity in how social norms are perceived and how normative expectations change in response to experienced group behaviors in the PG games. Normative expectations for socially beneficial actions tend to emerge when such group behavior conveys a normative signal (i.e., when non-financial social incentives lead to increased and sustained contributions), particularly when the social norm is initially perceived as being loose. This work contributes to the growing body of research on social norms by offering experimental evidence that advances our understanding of the factors that determine beneficial normative change.",

          "abstract": "The digital revolution has ushered in many societal and economic benefits. Yet access to digital technologies such as mobile phones and internet remains highly unequal, especially by gender in the context of low- and middle-income countries. While national-level estimates are increasingly available for many countries, reliable, quantitative estimates of digital gender inequalities at the subnational level are lacking. These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,158 regions in 118 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large. We construct these estimates by applying machine-learning algorithms to Facebook user counts, geospatial data, development indicators, and population composition data. We calibrate and assess the performance of these algorithms using ground-truth data from subnationally-representative household survey data from 31 LMICs. Our results reveal striking disparities in access to mobile and internet technologies between and within LMICs, with implications for policy formulation and infrastructure investment. These disparities contribute to a global context where women are 21% less likely to use the internet and 17% less likely to own mobile phones than men, corresponding to over 385 million more men than women owning a mobile phone and over 360 million more men than women using the internet.",

          "authors": "Lucy C Burke; Colin Angus; Jamie Brown; Inge Kersbergen",
          "abstract": "Introduction\nThe UK has promoted increasing the availability of alcohol-free and low-alcohol  drinks (no/lo, ≤1.2% ABV) as a public health strategy. To be effective, no/lo beverages must replace, and not supplement, standard alcoholic drinks. Emerging qualitative evidence suggests the reasons people drink alcohol may be important when investigating the potential public health impact of these drinks. This has not yet been explored quantitatively. \nThis study aimed to determine whether alcohol drinking motives were associated with no/lo consumption after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and alcohol consumption.\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional sample of adults residing in Great Britain (aged 16-93) who had drunk alcohol in the past year were recruited via the Alcohol Toolkit Study (N = 2555; 49.0% female). The dependent variable was frequency of no/lo consumption (less than/ at least monthly). Five questions captured respondents’ alcohol drinking motives (enhancement, social, conformity, coping-anxiety, coping-depression). Sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, social grade, education, index of deprivation) and hazardous alcohol use (AUDIT-C) were included in the analyses. \nThe proportion of respondents who reported drinking no/lo at high and low levels of endorsement of each drinking motive is presented. Quasibinomial regression modelling explored relationships between alcohol drinking motives and no/lo consumption, accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and hazardous drinking. \n\nResults\nDrinking alcohol to conform was the only drinking motive associated with no/lo consumption after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and hazardous drinking (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.21, p=0.041). A higher frequency of drinking alcohol to conform was associated with an increased probability of drinking no/lo at least monthly. \n\nConclusions \nNo/lo drinks may be a useful substitute for those wishing to reduce their alcohol consumption whilst avoiding pressure to conform to social norms.  Those drinking alcohol to conform were not typically higher-risk drinkers, which may limit the public health benefit of no/lo drinks.",

          "abstract": "Sociology has long wrestled with theoretical fragmentation, hindering a unified understanding of social life. This paper unveils the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a bold framework that reimagines social phenomena through the lens of promises and their reciprocal arrangements, termed compromises. G-STOC posits that all social interactions — whether mundane exchanges or transformative societal shifts — hinge on promises, broadly defined to include not just explicit pledges but also tacit expectations, norms, and imposed duties. These promises knit together into compromises, forming the essential fabric of social relationships. The theory advances several key insights: (1) social behavior springs from actual and virtual agency, with virtual agency rooted in anticipated promises; (2) emotions like anger and disappointment reveal breaches of these promises, highlighting their omnipresence; (3) compromises unify individual actions with broader social influences; and (4) sociological insight arises from tracing these compromises across time. Emphasizing the future-oriented nature of social action, G-STOC sidesteps perennial debates like agency versus structure, offering a potent, streamlined tool to decode human interactions. This paper urges scholars to engage with G-STOC, testing its potential to revitalize social science and deepen our grasp of society’s complexities.",

          "abstract": "Organizational theory has developed in numerous directions that have been difficult to integrate. This review synthesizes them into seven perspectives, with theories focused within and beyond the organization (i.e., intra- and extra-organizational dynamics). It proposes the acronym SCRIPTS: structure, culture, relations, institutions, professions, transformation, and social conflict. Within organizations, structure focuses on theories of bureaucracy, management, decision-making, and routines while culture focuses on shared values, identity, climate, and sensemaking. Relations involve studies of interpersonal and interorganizational networks. Institutions focus on the macro-dynamics of fields and isomorphism, and micro-dynamics of entrepreneurship and inhabited institutions. Professions refer to psychological factors shaping individual performance and sociological factors shaping work and occupations. Transformation involves episodic and gradual changes within organizations and across society. Social conflict involves power and competition, with key theories focused on gendered, racialized, and global inequalities. This paper introduces theories and concepts in the study of organizations by grouping similar perspectives, highlighting their domains within or beyond the organization, and underscoring their utility for researchers and leaders.",

          "abstract": "At similar performance levels, socio-economically advantaged students typically choose more demanding and prestigious educational paths than their less advantaged peers. Such secondary effects are often studied in school continuation decisions or track choice but may also manifest in school choice, offering an alternative avenue for parental influence in education. This study\nexamines secondary effects in school choice, and the role of social capital – resources embedded in peer and parental networks in primary school – in these patterns within the context of the Netherlands. I rely on linked sociometric and full-population register data for Dutch students who have recently transitioned to secondary school. Hypotheses are tested using fixed effects regression\nmodels to account for (self-)selection into primary school. Results indicate that secondary school choice is socially stratified: Students from higher socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds tend to avoid pre-vocational schools, prefer pre-university schools, and opt for heterogeneous classes at intermediate performance levels. There is limited evidence for the relation between social\ncapital and the type of school chosen. A notable exception is that lower SES students are less likely to enroll in pre-vocational schools if their parents are integrated into resource-rich networks in primary school, suggesting that such networks may play a compensatory role by discouraging decisions that hinder upward-track mobility.",

Through qualitative content analysis of eighty-nine public comments pertaining to offshore wind projects planned off the North Carolina coast, we argue that objections to wind projects reflect an understanding of the infrastructure’s environmental burden and, importantly, a desire to protect environmental privilege. Findings suggest a need for expanded research on the dimensions of privilege that may be at play across wind farm sites and that any consideration of a just transition must consider how expressions of privilege inform environmental political discourse.",

          "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini; Ricardo Junior de Assis Fernandes Gonçalves",
          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has expanded significantly in recent years, permeating various sectors of the economy and the daily lives of over 5.5 billion active internet users worldwide. However, this rapid adoption necessitates an analysis of the trade-offs inherent to its operation, many of which remain largely unknown to the public. Drawing on data from academic articles, technical reports, data repositories, and government documents, this article examines the physical, energy, and geopolitical dimensions underpinning AI. Although often perceived as immaterial, AI depends on a vast and complex physical infrastructure, sustained by data centers that house thousands of devices composed of a diverse array of minerals and metals, many classified as critical. Currently, approximately 12,000 data centers are in operation globally, including 992 hyperscale facilities spanning thousands of square meters. The short lifecycle of equipment in these centers, combined with inadequate disposal practices, leads to the loss of valuable metals from the supply chain, further intensifying mineral extraction and exacerbating socio-environmental impacts. Simultaneously, the rivalry between the United States and China over control of critical minerals and dominance in AI technologies has escalated geopolitical tensions, resulting in mutual restrictions on the export of advanced technologies and essential minerals. Another critical factor is AI’s substantial energy consumption: in the United States, data centers already account for approximately 4% of national electricity consumption, with projections reaching 9.1% by 2030. While major technology companies invest in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind to meet this growing demand, these sources also require significant volumes of critical minerals. These interrelated factors underscore the intricate connections between Artificial Intelligence, Data Centers, Critical Minerals, Energy, and Geopolitics.",

          "authors": "Laurens Naudts; Natali Helberger; Michael Veale; Marijn Sax",
          "abstract": "The technological promise of recommender systems should not be misused by those with decisional power over the infrastructural, data and knowledge resources needed for their design. The ideal of personalisation should not mask self-serving optimisation. Instead, we propose that people, not only in their capacity as consumers but, more generally, as democratic citizens, have a legitimate claim to ensure that very large online platforms (or VLOPS) respect their interests within optimisation processes through the content policy strategies and recommendation technologies they employ. To this end, this paper argues for, and develops, a right to constructive optimisation that promotes people’s effective enjoyment of fundamental rights and civic values in digital settings. The argument is structured as follows. First, the paper strengthens the claim that the largest online platforms perform a public function (although this is not the only way such functions can be performed). Second, drawing from the philosophy of Iris Marion Young, the paper identifies self-determination and self-development as key values recommenders should promote as part of this crucial function under conditions of inclusivity, political equality, reasonableness and publicity. After having critiqued the EU Digital Services Act’s approach toward regulating the function recommenders hold, the right to constructive optimisation is concretised as an alternative normative benchmark and used as an interpretative lens to enrich ongoing legal initiatives.",

BrainWaves provides a framework for relevant and diverse research programmes into adolescent mental health and wellbeing that can translate into practice and policy. The research programme is a partnership with schools centred on establishing a large (n&gt;50,000) cohort and trials platform. Reported here is the BrainWaves cohort pilot study. This was designed as proof-of-concept for our recruitment and data capture pipelines, and for cost-modelling. A network of research schools was recruited and a computer-driven questionnaire administered. The eligible population was 16+ year olds who were attending the research schools. Of 41 research schools, 36 (88%) participated over one three-week and one four-week data collection period. From an eligible population of 33,531 young people, 16,010 (48%) attended the study lesson and created an account. Of the 16,010 (100%) who created an account, 15,444 (96%) consented to participate, 9,321 (60%) consented to linkage of research data with educational records, and 6,069 (39%) consented to linkage of research with school/college attendance data. Participants were aged 16-19 years, 59% female, and 76% White. Higher levels of anxiety and depression were found in girls than boys. Higher levels of media-based social networking were found in girls, whereas higher levels of media-based gaming were found in boys. Girls were more likely to report insufficient sleep whilst boys were more likely to report high levels of exercise. This study confirmed an ability to recruit at pace and scale. Whilst the response-rate does not indicate a representative sample, the demographics describe an inclusive and diverse sample. Data collected confirmed findings from previous studies indicating that the electronic data collection methods did not materially bias the findings. Initial cost-modelling suggests these data were collected for around £20 per participant.",

Study 2, an experience sampling study (N = 233) analyzed 2005 real-life behaviors to examine the relationship between experienced emotions and environmental attitudes. Results showed that pro-environmental individuals anticipated and experienced stronger negative emotions (guilt, shame) towards harmful actions than positive emotions (pride, elation) for eco-friendly behaviors. In contrast, less environmentally conscious individuals experienced (relatively) positive emotions towards harmful actions and weaker negative emotions for eco-friendly behaviors. Crucially, anticipated emotions regarding harmful actions significantly influenced behavioral decisions more than those related to pro-environmental actions, mediating the relationship between pro-environmental attitudes and eventual behavioral decisions. In summary, individuals, regardless of their environmental attitudes, reported stronger emotional responses to environmentally harmful behaviors, supporting the \"bad is stronger than good\" principle, independent of the valence of emotions.",

This paper contributes to the research on the politics of expertise by presenting the results of an innovative multi-level mini-public approach, in which citizens from five European countries – France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland – were asked to discuss and deliberate on questions relating to the place and role of experts in policymaking, scientific information, and communication. The results of these discus- sions not only yield more fine-grained and nuanced evidence on citizens’ attitudes on these topics than currently available via survey research but also allow for the formulation of actionable advice that will be of interest to policymakers at the national as well as EU level.",

This paper compares results obtained by LDA and BERTopic applied to the same dataset composed of all scientific articles (n=34,797) authored by all biology professors in Switzerland between 2008 and 2020. We propose a step-by-step demonstration from data pre-processing to the results. Hence we emphasize that understanding their underlying functioning is essential for effectively interpreting the outcomes and balance between the strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques. Although they differ in their operationalization, LDA and BERTopic produce topic spaces with a similar global configuration. However, major differences are observed when focusing on specific multidimensional concepts, such as gene. With evidence from our empirical demonstration, we overall stress that topic modeling offers a highly valuable ground for understanding the semantic structure of scientific fields when combined with in-depth knowledge of the object under scrutiny.",

          "abstract": "In the context of scientific policy and science management, this study examines the system of nonuniform wage distribution for researchers. A nonlinear mathematical model of optimal remuneration for scientific workers has been developed, considering key and additive aspects of scientific activity: basic qualifications, research productivity, collaborative projects, skill enhancement, distinctions, and international collaborations. Unlike traditional linear schemes, the proposed approach is based on exponential and logarithmic dependencies, allowing for the consideration of saturation effects and preventing artificial wage growth due to mechanical increases in scientific productivity indicators.\n\tThe study includes detailed calculations of optimal, minimum, and maximum wages, demonstrating a fair distribution of remuneration on the basis of researcher productivity. A linear increase in publication activity or grant funding should not lead to uncontrolled salary growth, thus avoiding distortions in the motivational system.\nThe results of this study can be used to reform and modernize the wage system for researchers in Kazakhstan and other countries, as well as to optimize grant-based science funding mechanisms. The proposed methodology fosters scientific motivation, long-term productivity, and the internationalization of research while also promoting self-actualization and ultimately forming an adequate and authentic reward system for the research community.\n\tSpecifically, in resource-limited scientific systems, science policy should focus on the qualitative development of individual researchers rather than quantitative expansion (e.g., increasing the number of scientists). This can be achieved through the productive progress of their motivation and self-actualization.",

Drawing on theories of labour market segmentation, time availability and gender roles, this study examines gender differences in pandemic-related changes in job-related training. Using panel data from the German National Educational Panel Study (2018–2022, N=7,857), results from fixed-effects regressions indicate an overall decline in training participation. Contrary to the expectations, mothers’ participation did not decline more than that of fathers and childless women and men. For all groups, declines in training were partly attributed to work-related changes and the regional severity of COVID-19, but for parents these declines were more closely linked to changes in private and family life. The findings highlight the complex impact of demand- and supply-side factors influencing job-related training and show that gender disparities in unpaid work did not translate into wider training gaps.",

          "authors": "Yassine Khoudja; Marcel Lubbers; Ines Schäfer",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the evolving relationship between attitudes toward immigration and redistribution in Europe. While much of the existing literature suggests a positive correlation between support for immigration and redistribution, recent developments—such as the rise of political parties combining anti-immigration rhetoric with pro-redistribution platforms—challenge this assumption. Moreover, little is known about how these attitudinal combinations have changed over time and how they relate to individuals’ social structural positions. Using data from the European Social Survey (2002–2020), we investigate how the relationship between attitudes toward immigration and redistribution has shifted across European countries, and the extent to which these shifts are anchored in the changing social stratification of political attitudes. Our results show that, in 2002, the correlation between pro-immigration and pro-redistribution attitudes was negative, but by 2020, it had shifted to near zero. This shift is mainly driven by an increase in the share of individuals who support both immigration and redistribution, especially in Northern and Western European countries since 2012. In contrast, groups rejecting both immigration and redistribution, or rejecting immigration while supporting redistribution have not substantially expanded. We further show that these changes are partly due to changing educational and occupational divides. These findings highlight the shifting relationship between the cultural and economic dimension of political conflict in Europe, and underline the importance of social structural transformations, particularly the educational expansion, in re-shaping the demand-side of political dynamics. More generally, the study calls for a stronger focus on analyzing the intersection of attitudes across different domains and on understanding how social-structural transformations shape attitudes towards immigration and support for the welfare state.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the ethical dimensions of health communication during the 2022 mpox outbreak, focusing on the interplay between social media and public health officials in shaping stakeholder responses. Based on semi-structured interviews, findings reveal that social media played a crucial role in information dissemination for months during the crisis, while public health officials were slow to offer clear guidance. While social media empowers advocacy and the sharing of personal stories, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding how vulnerable communities may become entangled in an economy of suffering, where their experiences of pain are validated and interpreted by stakeholders through a selective mechanism rooted in cultural codes and power dynamics. Moreover, systemic inequities render the suffering of marginalized groups, particularly those with intersecting identities, less visible and intensify the consequences of inadequate outreach. This creates a disparity where the suffering of those in more privileged positions is more readily recognized and addressed. The theoretical advancement lies in reconceptualizing the platformization of pain to include narrative resistance, highlighting that marginalized groups actively contest and reshape suffering narratives rather than passively experience them. This expanded framework also deepens the concept of an economy of suffering by integrating hermeneutical injustice, which emphasizes how power dynamics shape not only the visibility of suffering but also the interpretive frameworks that validate certain narratives while marginalizing others.",

Simulations comparing human-written responses from three pre-ChatGPT studies with LLM-generated text reveal that LLM responses are more homogeneous and positive, particularly when they describe social groups in sensitive questions.

It is found that the first democracy was born in China more than 4,000 years ago. As a result of the discovery, a practical framework called Yao-Shunism is formulated and presented. Yao-Shunism offers non-partisan politics and participatory governance. It is backed by major Chinese philosophies and provides a viable alternative to existing political practice.

          "abstract": "Estimation of relationships between a dependent variable constructed by the aggregation of individual behaviour and aggregate independent variables such as mean income is common.  The aim and contribution of the paper is to clarify when and how parameter estimates based on aggregates leads to bias and the likely degree of such bias.  It demonstrates that use of aggregate data to estimate parameters associated with a model of individual behaviour when the outcome variable is binary (e.g. a birth) is not advisable. It only ‘works’ when the independent variables do not vary at the individual level (e.g. prices or the unemployment rate).  Even then it requires prior distributional knowledge or assumptions.  When the individual model also contains variables that vary across individuals, then the analysis in the paper suggests that all parameter estimates based solely on variation in the aggregates usually understate the size of their true value, even ones associated with variables which do not vary over individuals.  Indeed, it is often the case that the 95% confidence interval of these latter parameter estimates never contains the parameter’s true value.",

          "authors": "Hamid Bulut; Robin Samuel",
          "abstract": "An increasing number of countries are considering implementing domestic carbon taxes to achieve the carbon-reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement. However, introducing such taxes presents significant challenges for policymakers worldwide. Despite their effectiveness, carbon taxes remain the least popular policy instrument. Furthermore, few studies focus on public support for carbon taxation in low- and middle-income countries, a crucial area of research given the global significance of their emissions. Therefore, we conducted a pre-registered full factorial survey experiment involving more than 13,000 evaluations of policy designs in China, Germany, India, and the UK to address the most prevalent barriers to the popularity of carbon taxes, as discussed in academic research, policy analysis, and public discourse: perceived effectiveness, average household costs, the types of revenue recycling schemes implemented, and the extent of international cooperation. Our findings revealed striking differences in how the countries responded to carbon tax policies. The key findings included the following: cost transparency unexpectedly reduced support, whereas communicating the effectiveness of the policy increased \nit; preferences for revenue recycling schemes varied significantly across the four countries, highlighting the need for tailored approaches; and, surprisingly, international cooperation increased support only in Germany, challenging assumptions about global climate policy. These findings have profound implications for policymakers, suggesting that an effective carbon tax design must be carefully calibrated in the national context. This study provides a roadmap for designing carbon tax policies that are environmentally effective and politically viable for diverse global economies.",

          "abstract": "We argue that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. We employ two factors to model the expected risk-free rate that the market expects the current monetary policy to move towards the neutral rate over a certain period. Expecting that the T-bill risk (i.e., the macrorisk) largely reflects a country’s inflation risk, we measure the risk as a 5-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors. Our models thus split US and Canada T-bill yields into the risk and risk-free rate, on average explaining 98.7% of the returns. The models assuming independence of the two returns show similar power in predicting T-bill returns, which can significantly simplify the formulas. We also find that the inclusion of a risk constant over maturity, which has a small value of several basis points, significantly reduces the prediction errors. The risk and the risk-free rate is the gateway to corporate the risk of various assets in the country.",

Can democratically-elected legislators from nationally-dominant parties reduce violence in such conflicts? Existing theory remains unclear.  Legislators from national parties might lack credibility among separatist insurgent sympathizers, limiting their ability to mitigate insurgent violence in their constituencies. Their symbolic affiliation with ``outsiders'' could also incite more violence. Alternatively, representatives from parties with a pan-national presence may benefit from superior influence over the security bureaucracy, rendering them more effective against insurgents than legislators from other parties. We test these competing explanations using a regression discontinuity design and granular conflict data from a decades-long separatist insurgency in Punjab, India.  The findings suggest that legislators from the nationally-dominant party durably reduced insurgent violence within their constituencies.  Mechanism analyses indicate that these reductions occurred through relatively stronger influence over security forces and in constituencies with above-average access to information and communication technology enabling selective counterinsurgency operations.",

Empirical investigations of individual mobility effects, however, have been hindered by one fundamental limitation, the unidentifiability of mobility effects when origin and destination are held constant. Given this fundamental limitation, we propose to reconceptualize  mobility effects from the micro to the macro level. Instead of micro-level mobility effects, the primary focus of the past literature, we ask alternative research questions about macro-level mobility effects: what happens to the population distribution of an outcome if we manipulate the mobility regime, that is, if we alter the observed association between social origin and social destination? The proposed method bridges the macro and micro agendas in social stratification research, and has wider applications in social stratification beyond the study of mobility effects. We illustrate the method with two analyses that evaluate the impact of social mobility on average fertility and income inequality in the United States respectively.",

          "abstract": "Faced with unprecedented economic, technological and geopolitical challenges, the European Union (EU) must strengthen its resilience and influence to remain competitive in a rapidly changing world. This focus paper analyses the main economic risks that could affect the EU between now and 2035. The EU faces a combination of internal and external risks, including low productivity, an ageing population and technological backwardness, which are holding back its competitiveness. Its energy dependence, increasing geopolitical tensions and fragmented globalisation compound these vulnerabilities, affecting its economic security, consumer confidence and business value chains. These factors, exacerbated by climate and digital challenges, threaten economic growth and long-term stability. To summarise these risks, this focus paper identifies five drivers: (1) geopolitical instabilities, (2) globalisation dynamics, (3) environmental pressures and climate change, (4) social risks and human insecurities, and (5) technological and digital transformations.",

          "abstract": "With the rise of neoliberal globalised markets and large-scale irregular migration, temporary migrant labour has ensured the economic development of the global North as a node of growth in a changing global economy. However, the restructuring of national and regional economies has also brought about the informalisation of labour markets and the fragmentation of labour processes, with migrants being more exposed than other workers to the detrimental risks of wage squeezes and uncertainty associated with securing permanent jobs. Within this context, this review takes a critical look to explore the challenges migrant workers experience while using various digital labour platforms such as Uber, Uber Eats, DoorDash and Hungry Panda, to earn an income. After reviewing existing literature on migration, citizenship, precarious work and digital labour platforms, in this paper, I introduce ‘twin precarities’ as a concept to explore migrant workers’ vulnerabilities due to their non-citizenship status and their involvement in the platform economy where they often experience algorithmic management but they do not understand how an algorithm works. ‘Twin precarities’ is a new analytical frame for understanding the lived experience of migrant platform workers as well as for exploring the various and complex entanglements between precarious migrants’ emancipatory practices enabled by digital labour platforms and the constraints created by these platforms.",

          "abstract": "I study the impacts of industrial policy on innovation and industrial development by deciphering the landmark Chinese industrial policy - the Strategic and Emerging Industries initiative (SEI), from 2010 to 2018.  Using differences-in-differences methods with staggered adoption and city-industry level data, I find that the policy significantly boosts patent counts, firm turnover, and output in targeted sectors, though gains in innovation quality and employment remain subdued. Additionally, I identify inefficiency in China’s top-down approach, where local governments prioritize alignment with national priorities over local comparative advantages. Sectors targeted with a pre-existing innovation advantage see at least double the gains in innovation and output compared to those without, underscoring the path-dependent nature of innovation. These findings emphasize the importance of aligning industrial policy with local strengths to foster quality-based growth. While the SEI initiative demonstrates China's ability to drive numerical growth, it also reveals the challenge of fostering widespread, quality-driven upgrading. These insights offer broader lessons for other developing economies navigating similar transitions.",

Esse bairro é uma área de grande relevância cultural e ambiental, abrangendo a Área de Proteção Ambiental (APA) São Bento e o complexo da Fazenda do Iguaçu. No entanto enfrenta sérios desafios devido ao zoneamento urbano que favorece interesses imobiliários em detrimento da preservação do patrimônio histórico e natural. A degradação ambiental, os loteamentos irregulares e a redução da área de inundação para investimentos imobiliários colocam em risco sítios arqueológicos e bens tombados, refletindo um desinteresse da gestão municipal em proteger o patrimônio e garantir a segurança da população local. O artigo também destaca as ações de preservação conduzidas por instituições e coletivos locais, como o Museu Vivo do São Bento, e as propostas de resistência cultural frente às intervenções previstas para a região, refletindo sobre os desafios e as implicações ambientais e sociais dessas dinâmicas.

Even the application of sophisticated statistical methods has not led to a clear identification of the language the text is written in and leaves some chance that it is perhaps an elaborate hoax [1]. Here we partially decode the Voynich alphabet and provide an identification of the Voynich language as vernacular Italian (lingua volgare) written in shorthand. We are able to show that the words we read make sense in the context of the illustrations. We provide a lexical list of 400+ words that can be consistently read throughout the text in vernacular Italian with our decipherment and show that the text displays morphological and grammatical features consistent with the language identification. While there is more work to be done in translating the text, the key to the manuscript’s decipherment is now available.",

Yet, without legal backing, elites have incentives to violate norms for political gain. Under what conditions do constraining executive norms persist and when are they abandoned? We address this question by using an infinite horizon formal model to analyze the maintenance of executive norms. We identify intra-party accountability and variation in patience among actors within the same party as significant for norm maintenance. We also detail how expectations about the expected behavior of out-of-power parties shape the willingness to violate norms while in office. The insights from the model enable us to classify a number of executive norms according to their fragility and to examine the trajectory of one norm in-depth: the two-term tradition of the American presidency. Our findings shed light on how informal institutions regulate executive behavior and advance our understanding of institutional stability and erosion.",

          "authors": "Anna Pagani; Alex Macmillan; Federico Savini; Michael Davies; Nici Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "The shortage of social housing is a crucial element of the UK housing crisis. In England, social rented housing provision significantly relies on market homes construction, with detrimental impacts on residents and the environment. Moratoria are often cited in the degrowth literature as policy tools supporting strategies to break free from growth-driven mechanisms and achieve high levels of well-being while reducing environmental pressures. However, the systemic effects of such a policy on housing and its potential drawbacks are at present understudied. This study explores the extent to which a moratorium on new construction in the housing sector would be an effective, desirable, and feasible policy to address the shortage of good quality social housing. We used existing causal loop diagrams (CLDs) to formulate qualitative hypotheses on the effects of a moratorium on the structures underpinning the construction and demolition of social housing estates. We then explored perceived obstacles or opportunities to its uptake in a workshop with four housing associations, the largest providers of social housing in England. Our CLDs suggest that a moratorium could help to address the growth-dependent mechanisms of social housing provision, with systemic benefits for both social tenants and housing associations. However, the workshop revealed that its adoption would depend on whether the maintenance, repair, and retrofit of the existing stock could offset the perceived advantages of new construction (e.g., quality, quantity, adequacy). Through the use of systems thinking tools, our findings support dialogue around alternatives to the growth-dependent paradigm undermining housing provision within planetary boundaries.",

Using agent-based simulation, we test adoption feasibility under various scenarios. The scheme consistently succeeds across diverse conditions, demonstrating its potential as a sustainable and voluntary alternative to conventional UBI frameworks.",

          "abstract": "The ancient city of Akkad, founded by King Sargon around 2300 BCE, served as the capital of the Akkadian Empire, the first known empire in history. Despite its immense historical significance, its precise location remains unknown, and scholars have debated its whereabouts for over 140 years. This study examines historical records, archaeological evidence, and geographical data to refine the search for Akkad. Utilizing textual sources such as the royal inscriptions, and references in the Curse of Agade the research establishes Akkad as a city distinct from Babylon but closely connected through a network of canals.\nThe study explores Akkad’s role as a strategic political, economic, and religious center, examining its connections to nearby cities such as Sippar, Kish, Kutha, Adab and Nippur. The analysis of trade records and reconstructed inscriptions suggests that Akkad was a major commercial hub, possibly located at the junction of multiple canals rather than directly on the Tigris or Euphrates rivers. Additionally, references to Akkad’s quay indicate a sophisticated water management system that facilitated trade and transportation.\nUsing Google Earth satellite imagery, the study identifies potential remnants of ancient canal networks and structures. The A suggests that Akkad was likely located east of Babylon, beyond the ruins of Kish, near 32°32’21” N, 45°13’02” E, where traces of the Kish-Akkad Canal and other artificial waterways are visible. This evidence aligns with historical descriptions of Akkad’s role in Mesopotamian trade, military strategy, and religious influence.\nThis research contributes new insights into Akkad’s potential location and urban infrastructure, offering a basis for future archaeological investigations. Ground surveys and excavation at the identified site could provide definitive confirmation of Akkad’s long-lost ruins, shedding light on one of the most significant cities in ancient history.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter, I survey the football fandom ecosystem in Egypt. I first describe the media environment around the sport and chart out the geographic structure of fan support for teams in the Egyptian Premier League. I then examine how fandom intersects with politics, both as Egyptian leaders have sought to use support around Egyptian football to build legitimacy, but also how Egyptian football fans have often been a significant political force acting independently of the ruling regime. I argue that different groups in Egypt have sought to use the intense interest in Egyptian football to pursue external goals, a dynamic that sometimes generates conflict when these goals are at odds. I conclude by outlining the social organization of football fandom. I illustrate how the most committed fans are young single men living in urban areas and who are more engaged in religion than the average citizen, after which I describe the role of women and the Coptic Christian minority in Egyptian football.\n\nNB -- Uncorrected proofs for: \n\nJerzak, Connor T. ``Football Fandom in Egypt.''

          "abstract": "Do more years of schooling cause higher lifetime earnings? Social scientists have long sought to determine the economic returns to schooling given its central importance to individual educational choices and public policy. Prior estimates are limited due to unobserved confounding in observational studies and the restriction of popular school-reform-based quasi-experimental estimates to schooling increases at one specific age only. Genotyped data offers a new opportunity to address unobserved confounding and estimate the returns to one general additional year of schooling by using genetic variants related to education, randomly assigned within families at conception, as instrumental variables (Mendelian randomization (MR)). We combine this design with comprehensive Norwegian population-wide registry data and genotyped data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. We employ three identification strategies for triangulation. MR implies returns to schooling of 8.0% (95% CI=7.1-9.0; USD 5,586; N=110,049), with similar magnitude from sibling MR (6.3%, 95% CI=1.5-11.6; N=18,700), and pleiotropy-robust estimators. Sensitivity analyses support assumptions underlying MR. The MR estimates largely aligned with estimates based on ordinary least squares of 5.9% (N=1,260,514) for the full population, sibling (5.3%, 95% CI=5.2-5.4; N=970,440) and monozygotic twin (3.2%, 95% CI=1.9-4.6; N=5,852) models. All estimates exceeded opportunity costs as proxied by the market interest rate, and thus suggests that education pays off, yet only MR circumvents the threat of unobserved confounding. Our study shows that the economic returns to schooling are substantial and demonstrates how genetic data can be used to investigate hard-to-answer causal questions.",

As a result, it is unclear what inferences researchers can draw from lobbying expenditures about interest groups' strategies and their ideological alignment with policymakers. We study a model of informational lobbying with a collective decision-making body and endogenous reforms to investigate the determinants of the value of access. We show that the funds flowing to a given policymaker depend not only on this policymaker's ideology and procedural power, but also on the overall distribution of preferences and power among other policymakers. Two policymakers with the same ideology and procedural power might therefore attract different amounts of contributions, depending on the preferences of fellow policymakers. Our results help clarify empirical research linking lobbying expenditures by interest groups to politicians' ideologies and power.",

          "authors": "Milind Raskar",
          "abstract": "Due to its intricate clusters of symbols, the absence of clear connections to known ancient or modern scripts from the Indian subcontinent, and broad assumptions about the likely languages of the Indus civilization, scholars have long struggled to decipher the Indus script. This study seeks to identify Indus characters by analysing common graphemes of synonymous words across known Indian languages, using traces in the existing languages as a \"Rosetta Stone.\" It interprets the pictographic symbols on Indus seals by applying principles from the Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system.\nThe findings suggest that the Indus script follows an Abugida-style writing system, comprising nineteen consonants and three vowels, and represents a Proto-Pali language. Analysing grammatical structures, reading sequences, and linguistic parallels with Pali provides strong evidence that the Indus civilization employed a structured language integrating phonetics and symbolism. Further validation through the interpretation of anthropomorphic and some other specific seals, along with architectural and urban planning elements, establishes a direct link between the script and the cultural practices of the Indus people—particularly in meditation and spiritual traditions.\nKey urban features such as courtyards, walls, and granaries help clarify the administrative functions, Meditation universities, and social structures of Indus settlements. Identified as an early form of Proto-Pali, the deciphered script reveals linguistic traditions that suggest continuity between the Indus script and modern languages. By offering significant insights into its language, grammar, and cultural context, this study provides a deeper understanding of the historical and linguistic legacy of the Indus civilization.",
