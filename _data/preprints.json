          "title": "Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Regarding Digital Health Utilization Among Medical Students of QAMC: A Cross-sectional Study",
          "authors": "Ali Nawaz; Mehsum Shahzad; Ahmed Raza; Fasih Noshervan",
          "abstract": "Background: Interest in digital health interventions, defined as the use of mobile technologies in healthcare, is growing worldwide. Adoption and utilization of these technologies are crucial among medical students, who represent the future healthcare workforce. Prior studies have shown insufficient knowledge of digital health utilization in countries like Pakistan. Limited evidence exists on whether students feel competent using these technologies or the challenges they face in academic and clinical settings. This study aims to identify curriculum gaps and highlight the need to integrate comprehensive digital health training into medical education. As future healthcare professionals, medical students’ proficiency with digital health technologies will significantly impact healthcare delivery.\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding digital health utilization among medical students in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. The study also aimed to analyze curriculum gaps and inform policymakers in developing supportive policies that encourage digital health use, provide training, and address barriers faced by students in adopting these technologies.\nMethods: Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire from 309 participants through convenience sampling in Bahawalpur. Frequencies and percentages were calculated using SPSS software. Results were presented graphically and in tables.\nResults: Knowledge of digital health utilization was moderately high. More than half of the students reported awareness of digital health. Among respondents, 43.9% used digital health for tracking physical activities, 33.1% for managing health conditions, 23.6% for communicating with healthcare professionals, 7.2% for scheduling appointments, and 0.9% for other purposes. Overall, 64.7% said they would recommend digital services to others, 12.4% said they would not, and 22.9% were unsure.\nConclusion: The study shows that knowledge of digital health among medical students is satisfactory. Students utilize digital health mainly for personal health management, and future use of these services appears promising.\nKeywords: Knowledge, Attitude, Digital Health, Utilization",

          "abstract": "A responsible authorship culture is the cornerstone of a responsible research enterprise. It is the collective responsibility of the entire scholarly community—including researchers at all levels of seniority, journals, research funders, scholarly societies, and research institutions. We examined authorship guidelines issued by journals and research institutions and found that their recommendations to researchers are highly variable. We argue that harmonization of guidelines can help but also that guidelines alone are insufficient to promote culture change. A responsible authorship culture requires a principle-based reflection by research teams on what it means to be an author with support and encouragement from research institutions. Accordingly, we propose three interconnected principles that form the foundation for responsible authorship: transparency, credit, and accountability. We also offer three ways in which research team leaders can embed best practices for transparency, credit, and accountability in their ongoing work.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Hosseini; Simon Kerridge; Liz Allen; Veronique Kiermer; Kristi L. Holmes",
          "abstract": "The Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) uses 14 standard roles to specify scholarly contributions to research publications. CRediT has been adopted by hundreds of journals and integrated into journal submission workflows. In 2022, CRediT was formalized as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Information Standards Organization (NISO), providing a sustained support system and custodianship. Subsequently, forming the CRediT Standing Committee aimed to ensure inclusive and transparent evolution and enhance understanding and adoption of CRediT in the research community. This paper outlines the CRediT Standing Committee's ongoing strategies to support uptake and reduce ambiguity and confusion when using roles. These strategies include developing user instructions to provide guidance on how to use CRediT, creating persona profiles to improve understanding of existing roles and designing badges for each role to make them more memorable. These resources will address challenges reported by the scholarly community or identified by the CRediT Standing Committee and will be shared openly upon completion.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous thoughts are a window into one's mind, as they offer rich information about ongoing psychological processes and value systems. We accessed the contents of these thoughts using a free association paradigm combined with natural language processing techniques to examine how happiness is associated with what people think about and prioritize in daily life. Our analyses revealed that participants (n = 210 from the US/UK) with higher subjective well-being, particularly those with more frequent positive affect, generated thoughts semantically more similar to 'friend,' but not to 'money.' A similar pattern was also found in an independent sample (n = 350 from South Korea), showing consistency of the findings across different cultural contexts. Notably, the semantic similarity of participants’ generated thoughts to 'friend' predicted the extent to which participants prioritized social relationships over monetary gains in a realistic dilemma task. By exploring individuals’ minds with a computational approach, our work elucidates how the value of social relationships is manifested in spontaneous thought contents and everyday decisions, providing significant insights into the sources of happiness.",

Unfortunately, Kant’s program has become hopelessly\nmired in philosophical hair-splitting. In this paper, we first use\nKant’s approach to isolate the founding conditions of\nrationality in humans. We then establish the parallels between\nKant’s mechanics and the operations in currently used models\nof cognitive architecture. Finally, we argue that Kant’s\nphilosophy can pave the way for general intelligence and show\nhow they can be actualized in a memory system using high\ndimensional vectors to achieve specific cognitive abilities.",

Distribu-\ntional semantics models can process millions of data points\nto infer semantic similarities from language data or to in-\nfer product recommendations from patterns of user prefer-\nences. We demonstrate that a distributional semantics model\ncan account for the primacy and recency effects in free recall,\nthe fan effect in recognition, and human performance on it-\nerated decisions with initially unknown payoffs. The model\nwe propose provides a flexible, scalable alternative to ACT-\nR’s declarative memory at a level of description that bridges\nsymbolic, quantum, and neural models of cognition.",

We explore this phenomenon in the setting of SSMs with constant and time-varying boundaries, and show that parameter recovery is improved by incorporating a model of omission probability. We show that the benefits of modeling omission probability are distinct from benefits gained from past approaches of modeling attentional lapses to account for these omissions.

          "abstract": "In this thesis, we build upon the work of Plate by advancing the theory and utility\nof Holographic Reduced Representations (HRRs). HRRs are a type of linear, associative\nmemory developed by Plate and are an implementation of Hinton’s reduced\nrepresentations. HRRs and HRR-like representations have been used to model human\nmemory, to model understanding analogies, and to model the semantics of natural\nlanguage. However, in previous research, HRRs are restricted to storing and retrieving\nvectors of random numbers, limiting both the ability of HRRs to model human\nperformance in detail, and the potential applications of HRRs. We delve into the theory of\nHRRs and develop techniques to store and retrieve images, or other kinds of structured\ndata, in an HRR. We also investigate square matrix representations as an alternative to\nHRRs, and use iterative training algorithms to improve HRR performance.

          "abstract": "How do we recognize words and assign a pronunciation? Computational models provide a formal description of the mechanisms and principles that guide the reading process. I review and evaluate the Interactive-Activation Model (IAM), Dual Route Cascaded (DRC) model, the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model, and the Connectionist Dual Processing (CDP) model, as well as LEX, a variant of the MINERVA model of memory. I evaluate each model’s ability to account for consistency effects, serial effects, syllable effects, and phonological effects. Consistency effects pose a problem for the rule-based pronunciation of the DRC. Serial effects pose a problem for the purely parallel PDP models. Phonological effects pose a problem for all models save CDP. All models suffer from the distribution problem, weakening each model’s ability to learn spelling-to-sound relationships. LEX is the only model that handles polysyllabic words. As none of the models provide a complete answer to the question of ‘how do we read?’, ‘how do we pronounce?’, or ‘how do we recognize words?’, I outline a set of principles as guidelines for future model development. Models of reading should learn, include a visual attention mechanism, be sensitive to phonology, and account for meaning and spelling in addition to recognizing words and pronouncing them.",

Over the years, mediation analysis has become one of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Yet the most popular techniques for mediation analysis rely strongly on normality assumptions and are therefore susceptible to the influence of outliers or nonnormal distributions. We review common mediation models and discuss various approaches for estimation and inference, including their implementation in software packages. Moreover, we present robust alternatives, thereby clarifying different notions of robustness. We further consider a setting where the mediation model holds in a latent space but where measurement issues create deviations from normality assumptions in the observed variable space, which is a setting not commonly considered in the literature on robust mediation analysis, and we obtain preliminary results via a simulation study. Finally, we highlight the mechanics and relevance of robust methods in an an illustrative empirical application.",

          "abstract": "Parenting is closely linked to children’s social-emotional development, including externalizing behavior, peer relationships, and emotion regulation. However, most existing research has examined these associations using single parenting behaviors or predefined parenting styles, thereby neglecting the complex co-occurrence of different parenting practices. To address this limitation, the present study applied a person-centered approach using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify distinct parenting profiles and explore their associations with child socioemotional skills. Based on reports of parenting behavior from parents of N = 254 kindergarten children (51.2% female, M = 6.0 years, SD = 0.62), three parenting profiles emerged: supportive (66%), engaged-disciplinary (22%), and harsh (12%). Associations with teacher-rated outcomes showed that children exposed to engaged-disciplinary parenting displayed more peer problems. In comparison, children assigned to the harsh parenting group showed more behavioral problems and, unexpectedly, stronger emotion regulation skills. The findings underscore the need to tailor support to specific subgroups of parents with distinct parenting behaviors, to strengthen positive parenting behaviors, and, in turn, promote the development of children.",

          "abstract": "To navigate the ever-changing and information-overladen environment it is crucial to selectively process relevant information and ignore distraction. Recently, the salient-signal-suppression hypothesis has stimulated much research and theoretical debates in attention research. It claims that – under certain conditions – salient distractors are suppressed at the search-guiding priority map and therefore speed-up search as compared to neutral (non-suppressed) non-targets. An alternative interpretation claims that these salient distractors are simply ignored. Using a novel paradigm to control search order and measure search speed, we here provide evidence that this speed-up is neither due to suppression on the priority map nor simple ignoring, but instead due to speeded processing and rejection of the salient distractor relative to each non-target. In particular, we show that the speed-up occurs only when the distractor is processed before the target and that distractor processing takes less time than processing a non-target. These findings not only call into question the predominant explanations of the distractor-speed-up effect and thereby shed new light on the attentional-capture debate, but also provide striking evidence that not all searches are guided by the priority map.",

          "authors": "Julian Ustiyanovych; Dario Krpan",
          "abstract": "Personalization is increasingly emphasized in behavioural public policy, yet traditional approaches to tailoring interventions remain costly and difficult to scale. Synthetic twin agents—AI-generated counterparts of real individuals—offer a novel, scalable approach. This study evaluates whether synthetic twins generated by large language models (LLMs) can replicate human responses to personality-tailored advertisements. We recruited 373 human participants and created matched synthetic twins using four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-5-latest, Gemini-1.5 Flash, and Gemini-2.0 Flash). Participants evaluated advertisements for three consumer products, each tailored to Big-Five personality traits. Both human participants and their synthetic twins demonstrated personality-congruent responses for Agreeableness and Extraversion. Synthetic twins additionally showed congruence for Conscientiousness and, in some cases, Neuroticism, depending on the model and product. Trait-level comparisons showed partial alignment: Gemini-1.5 Flash most closely replicated human patterns, followed by GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash; GPT-5-latest showed the weakest alignment. Despite trait-specific divergences, aggregate correlations between human and synthetic responses were high (r = .81-.91), indicating strong consistency in relative patterns. These findings provide early evidence that prompt-based multimodal LLMs can approximate human psychological responses. Synthetic twins may serve as low-cost tools for pre-testing personalized behavioural interventions, while also raising critical ethical concerns around privacy, governance, and hyper-personalization.",

          "abstract": "The integration of GenAI into academic workflows marks an epistemological inflection point. While these tools can amplify productivity, they risk eroding the cognitive foundations of expertise by simulating the very tasks through which scientific competence is developed, from synthesis to experimental design to writing. Uncritical reliance can lead to skill atrophy and AI complacency. To counter this, we propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills—strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration—that constitute a new form of scientific literacy distinct from traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we propose how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy. Proactive development of this AI-augmented expertise is necessary to shape a future where technology amplifies, rather than attenuates, scientific thought.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that anorexia nervosa (AN) may be characterized by subtle alterations in learning that could relate to symptom maintenance and treatment outcomes. However, findings in this area have been mixed, and there have been few efforts to date to summarize this literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to analyze existing literature that tested different facets of learning in samples of individuals with AN compared to other groups. In line with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an initial search in April 2024 on PSYCInfo and PubMed and an updated search in July 2025, yielding an initial sample of 1,831 articles, of which 194 were fully assessed for eligibility. Our final review included 130 articles; coding, extraction, and synthesis of results occurred from April 2024 to August 2025. Included studies predominantly were cross-sectional in nature, tested group differences between those actively ill with AN and control subjects who had no history of psychopathology, and used neuropsychological tasks primarily gauging episodic learning (e.g., verbal or visuospatial learning) or associative learning (e.g., reversal learning). Qualitative synthesis of these findings suggests that while there appear to be alterations in learning among individuals with AN compared to controls, the significance and specific pattern of learning differences is inconsistent. It is likely that heterogeneity exists within AN and other eating disorders across development, stage of illness, and clinical phenotypes. Future research that begins to characterize meaningful heterogeneity and adopts methods such as computational modeling may offer promising methods for improving the characterization of and treatments for this devastating condition.",

          "abstract": "A person’s gaze can be highly informative—it can reveal which people, objects, or places interest the person, and it can help observers predict what they might do next. It can also be difficult to understand. Relative to actions for which someone physically contacts a target (e.g., by reaching and touching), gaze may be difficult to understand because of the physical distance between the action and target. Indeed, classic research suggests that before 12 months of age, infants do not readily track the targets of others’ gaze. However, studies on the development of gaze understanding have mostly presented infants with unfamiliar adults acting on inanimate objects. Here, we provide evidence that 8- to 9-month-old infants can track the targets of their parents' gaze when that gaze was directed at a potential social partner: an animate puppet. When infants observed their own parents look toward an animate puppet, they expected them to continue looking towards the same puppet later. Infants did not have the same expectations when their parents looked toward inanimate objects, nor when they observed the gaze of an unfamiliar adult. Thus, before infants track the targets of object-directed gaze, they already track the targets of their parents’ social gaze. These findings are consistent with the possibility that social relevance shapes infants’ understanding of others’ actions.",

          "abstract": "Latent class analysis is increasingly recognized as a powerful approach for identifying unobserved subgroups within heterogeneous populations, particularly in the context of public health surveillance. This report applies latent class analysis to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2015–2020) to examine patterns of subjective cognitive decline in U.S. adults aged 45 and older. Using responses to a structured five-item cognitive function module, three distinct and interpretable subgroups—Mild, Moderate, and Severe cognitive decline—were identified. Each class exhibited unique symptom profiles and socio-demographic associations, with greater severity linked to lower income, lower education levels, and poorer general health. The optimal three-class model was supported by multiple fit indices, including AIC, BIC, entropy, and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test. Conditional response probability tables and profile plots further validated the internal structure of the classes. Additional visualizations illustrated the distribution of socioeconomic covariates across latent classes. This analysis underscores the value of latent class analysis for enhancing measurement precision, revealing hidden population structures, and informing targeted interventions. Future research should focus on integrating LCA with causal frameworks, machine learning techniques, and cross-cohort validation to improve its utility in real-world settings. The approach demonstrated here provides a replicable model for analyzing complex survey data in aging and cognitive health research.",

This report introduces the conceptual foundations and methodological execution of causal mediation analysis, using a population-based study on parity and dementia risk from the HUNT cohort in Norway as a motivating example. The study employed inverse odds weighting to evaluate whether midlife psychosocial, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related factors mediated the observed U-shaped association between the number of children and late-life dementia risk. Despite robust longitudinal data and comprehensive adjustment for confounding, the mediation analysis revealed that these potential pathways did not explain the elevated dementia risk among childless individuals or those with one or four or more children. This suggests that the relationship may be primarily direct or influenced by unmeasured mechanisms. The report highlights key methodological requirements—including proper temporal sequencing, confounder control, and sensitivity analyses—and provides visual and tabular summaries of effect decomposition. It concludes by outlining limitations and future directions, emphasizing the importance of enhancing methodological flexibility to address time-varying mediators and complex causal structures in life-course epidemiologic research.",

The Bakwana Compliance Sheet (BCS) was developed as a behavioral tool incorporating principles of commitment/consistency, reciprocity, framing and choice architecture to encourage timely payments.\nObjective: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, clarity, and preliminary behavioral impact of the BCS in improving fee payment compliance.\nMethodology: The intervention was implemented in four purposively selected private schools in Hotoro ward, Nasarawa LGA, Kano State, Nigeria. Fifteen parents participated for the reliability evaluation, alongside school staff. Reliability was assessed via a 7-day test–retest procedure; face and content validity were established through expert review. Payment data were collected for one term pre-intervention (baseline) and one term post-intervention.\nFindings: The tool reliability yielded r = 0.82 and was rated as clear and user-friendly by most participants. Average on-time payment rates for the four schools increased from 72.74% (SD = 6.65) at baseline to 86.74% (SD = 5.79) post-intervention – a 14% percentage-point improvement t = -7.43, p &lt; 0.05). \nConclusion: The BCS is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective intervention for improving school fee compliance.

Motivated by a recent study on individuals with eating disorders and type 2 diabetes, this report explores the application of computerized adaptive testing as a solution to the limitations of traditional fixed-form assessments. By leveraging item response theory, the adaptive test dynamically selects the most informative items for each respondent, substantially reducing the number of items administered while maintaining high measurement accuracy. Using a comprehensive dataset that included newly developed items for depression, anxiety, and positive affect, researchers evaluated item quality, confirmed statistical assumptions, and validated adaptive scores against a standardized benchmark. Simulations demonstrated strong correlations between adaptive and full-length assessments, with significant reductions in testing time and clear differentiation between clinical and healthy groups. The report presents key tables and figures—including test information curves, item parameter summaries, and validity metrics—to illustrate the technical rigor and practical benefits of adaptive testing. While the approach offers distinct advantages in reducing burden and enhancing comparability, it also requires robust item banks and careful calibration. Future directions include integration with digital health tools and expansion to diverse populations to improve mental health care delivery.",

          "abstract": "People often turn to others for support in managing their emotions. This process of social emotion regulation has become a key focus of research, given its connection to wellbeing and its ubiquity in human relationships. Social emotion regulation often unfolds via language, where a support provider verbally offers perspectives that aim to improve another person’s emotional state. But what linguistic features influence the efficacy of social emotion regulation? Inspired by research showing that emotion reactivity is lower in a bilingual’s second language (L2) than their first language (L1), here we tested whether social emotion regulation is also more effective in a bilingual’s L2 than their L1. We preregistered countervailing hypotheses, as regulation could either be more effective in L1 (due to increased familiarity and fluency), L2 (due to decreased emotional intensity), or equivalent across languages. In this study, 250 Spanish-English bilinguals (~100% women) were presented with negative images before hearing audio recordings either describing the negative contents of the image or reinterpreting those contents to be more positive (i.e., social reappraisal) in either L1 (Spanish) or L2 (English). Social reappraisals lowered participants’ negative affect in both languages, but reappraisal efficacy did not differ across languages. Nonetheless, participants reported lower negative affect overall on English than Spanish trials, extending prior work demonstrating reduced emotional intensity in L2. These results suggest that Spanish-English bilinguals may equally benefit from social reappraisal in both of their languages, guiding basic research on language, emotion, and cognitive control, as well as translational applications for bilinguals.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia, a cardinal feature of depressive disorders, is classically defined as an inability to experience pleasure, but modern definitions also encompass deficits in anticipatory pleasure and motivation. Validated scales and behavioural tasks have evolved alongside these conceptual shifts, and when integrated with computational modelling, may help reveal mechanisms underlying anhedonia. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant computational framework for studying anhedonia, but fails to fully capture anticipation and motivation. We reviewed the operationalization and measurement of anhedonia from a historical perspective, and conducted a scoping review and critical appraisal of 19 computational models using a structured appraisal guide to assess face, construct and predictive validity. We focussed on generative models (i.e., models that can simulate behavioural data) that were paired with measures of anhedonia in both clinical and non-clinical samples. Model types include RL models, RL integrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging, and models of decision making, effort expenditure, and selective attention. Our review suggests that anhedonia-related deficits span not only reward processing, but also executive and sensory processing. Models generally demonstrated face validity, lacked predictive validity, and showed construct validity for cognitive-behavioural, but not neurobiological, domains. We propose an integrative, systems neuroscience-inspired approach, which aligns with multidimensional definitions of anhedonia.",

Data in non-clinical voice hearers suggest that voice hearing may involve sensitivity to speech in degraded stimuli. This has yet to be examined in people with schizophrenia. In this case-control study, we presented sine-wave-speech (SWS; made by replacing the formants in speech with pure tone whistles) to people with schizophrenia (SZ, n=63) and healthy controls (HC; n=27). SWS is typically unintelligible on first exposure. However, once the listener knows that it is potentially intelligible as speech (by exposure to the unaltered speech template, which thus serves as a prior expectation), relatively high levels of comprehension are achieved. Our participants first listened to intelligible and unintelligible SWS and reported whether they heard speech. They were then exposed to the speech templates, and then the first phase was repeated. Compared to HC, people with SZ reported hearing more speech before template exposure. The Reveal increased both groups’ false alarms and reporting of speech, but there was no interaction with group. Change in hit rates after the Reveal correlated with hallucinations, which is consistent with a greater influence of the priors enhancement in SZ patients who hear voices. These findings suggest that people with SZ have stronger expectations of speech. This task has validity for hallucinatory voice hearing. It is also simple and convenient to administer, and may prove useful in detecting prodromal risk, as well as acute exacerbation in voice hearing.",

This study evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of a 30-minute, interactive web-based intervention providing psychoeducation around diversion and non-medical use, practice refusing medication requests, and strategies for medication adherence. College students (Mage=20.42 years; 74% female; 86% White) with current stimulant prescriptions from three US universities were randomized to the intervention (n=128) or attention-matched placebo (n=121) in a single-blind design, with 1- and 2-month boosters and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Primary outcomes were diversion, non-medical use, and diversion intentions; secondary outcomes were perceived norms, perceived risk, self-efficacy to resist diversion and non-medical use, and prescriber communication. Contrary to pre-registered hypotheses, intervention participants did not decrease in number of diversion or non-medical use episodes. There were small-to-medium effects on risk perceptions (d=0.39 [0.12-0.68]), perceived non-medical use norms (d=0.51 [0.24-0.76]), and self-efficacy to avoid non-medical use (d=0.47 [0.10-0.85]), but no effects on other outcomes. Exploratory analyses showed a 76% reduction in odds of any diversion (OR=0.24 [0.08-0.68]) and a 60% reduction of any non-medical use (OR=0.40 [0.21-0.77]) for intervention participants during the 6-month follow-up period. This brief intervention was acceptable and feasible to implement and evidenced some efficacy in increasing risk perceptions and self-efficacy and changing perceived norms. Since the intervention did not decrease number of diversion or misuse episodes, however, future intervention refinements may tailor content to different levels of diversion and misuse risk.",

          "abstract": "The domain of affectivity is broad and complex, with a rich history, albeit one that reflects a\nstruggle to operationalize the target of its focus. Nevertheless, affectivity is the foundation of an\nemerging field referred to as affective determinants of health (ADoH), offering insights into\nemotions, moods, and other subjective phenomena that qualify as affective experiences in human\nhealth and functioning. Presently, the ADoH field lacks a coherent model and assessment\nframework for healthcare and wellness practitioners to translate and leverage the affectivity\ndomain practically and effectively. This work endeavors to offer a practical definition of\naffectivity that allows ostensibly different subjective phenomena as loneliness, pain, depression,\nfatigue, and others to be construed as affective experiences, particularly when considered\nthrough the lens of stress, which can serve as a bridge between the extensive bodies of medical\nresearch on stress and the field of discrete affects more commonly studied by psychologists. This\napproach positions certain affects as risk factors that comprise a foundation for clinical practice\nand research. By reviewing some of the most pertinent literature on stress and other affective\nexperiences, viewed through the lens of stress, this work then argues for the routine assessment\nof key ADoH risk factors, and the use of those indicators as transdiagnostic targets in population\nhealth management, prevention, and point-of-care encounters.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Autistic adults frequently experience social stigma, which may be compounded by additional marginalized identities such as race, gender, and sexual orientation. Black autistic adults, in particular, may face unique challenges at the intersection of racial bias and autism stigma. However, the experiences of autistic people with intersecting marginalized identities remain underexplored in research, contributing to a limited understanding of stigma’s impact across diverse communities.\nMethods: The current study sought to better characterize the social experiences of autistic people with intersecting identities, with an emphasis on Black autistic adults. 32 autistic adults (16 Black, 16 White) completed a semi-structured interview regarding their social experiences. Participants shared recent stories of peer exclusion, acceptance, discrimination and support that they had experienced, as well as their feelings surrounding these events. We recorded and transcribed these interviews and used an inductive, or data-driven, approach to thematic analysis to identify salient themes in the data. \nResults: We generated three intersectional themes, which encompassed the unique impact of stigma on those with intersecting identities. Specifically, these themes included: 1) identity-based discrimination shaped by race, gender, and LGBTQ+ status; (2) challenges in obtaining and processing an autism diagnosis; and (3) difficulties navigating personal identity, particularly among Black autistic participants. While autistic adults broadly reported stigma experiences, Black participants often described layered forms of exclusion related to both their race and autistic traits. Women and LGBTQ+ participants also reported distinct forms of marginalization and erasure. \nConclusion: These findings highlight how autism stigma intersects with other marginalized identities to shape social experiences. Black autistic adults, along with autistic women and LGBTQ+ autistic people, may encounter compounded barriers to acceptance, identity development, and belonging. These results underscore the need for more inclusive research and supports that attend to the diversity of autistic experiences.",

Displacement in an Arabic-speaking country, shorter displacement durations, and older ages of L2 acquisition (L2 AoA) were associated with better L1 reading. Cross-linguistic transfer of phonological awareness (PA) to reading was overall greater in the L2-L1 direction, and migration experiences associated with better L1 reading were also associated with greater transfer in the L1-L2 direction. These findings highlight the need to understand refugees’ biliteracy in the context of their migration experiences.",

In this study we combined scientific insights with participatory research (focus groups with youth and interviews with parents and police officers) to identify risk and protective factors in misinformation susceptibility. A total of n = 1980 participants aged 18 to 34 completed the Misinformation Susceptibility Test alongside validated measures of cognitive, social and ideological scales. Results showed that more social media use, more conservative political orientation, and higher bullshit receptivity predicted poorer veracity discernment, while higher education, greater need to belong, more openminded thinking and identifying as male predicted better discernment. Importantly, not all forms of social media use predicted equal veracity discernment, with active engagement (e.g., posting and reacting) being associated with worse veracity, while passive engagement (e.g., browsing) was associated with better veracity. In addition, results from a network analysis suggested that digital maturity may exert indirect beneficial effects on veracity discernment. These findings underscore that misinformation susceptibility is shaped by a constellation of cognitive, social, educational, and ideological factors. Beyond fostering education and analytic reasoning skills, interventions may need to target digital behaviors, peer norms and social motivational needs to build resilience against misinformation in young adult populations.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events worldwide. Using nationally representative survey data from 142 countries (N = 128,093), I found that people who have experienced a climate-related hazard are more likely to consider climate change a very serious threat than people who have not experienced the same hazard within the same country. These effects are consistent across eleven hazard types, with the effect of experiencing a heatwave being comparable in magnitude to that of having a university education. The increase in risk perception among those who have experienced a climate-related hazard does not appear to be clearly amplified or attenuated by a person's resilience, which is calculated by combining individual, household, community, and societal factors. Large differences in the effects are observed across countries for some hazards (e.g., droughts, heatwaves, and floods), whereas small differences are observed for others (e.g., hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires). At the country level, there does not appear to be an association between the proportion of people exposed to climate-related hazards and the proportion of people who perceive climate change as a threat. These results may help us anticipate public concern in a warming world and suggest promising avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "Neuroticism is one of the most consequential personality traits for individuals and society. Interventions that facilitate desired changes in this trait may thus have far-reaching benefits. Initial evidence supports that interventions can foster lasting neuroticism change, but the mechanisms, direction, and timing of these effects remain unclear. Although most personality theories posit that changes in broad, enduring personality traits are mediated via changes in momentary personality states and intermediary trait-relevant habits, there are few direct tests of this theorized bottom-up process. Using data from the Changing How I Live Life Study (N = 446), which examined a digital intervention to reduce neuroticism, we examined 1) the shape and magnitude of intervention-induced changes in neuroticism across three timescales, 2) the associations among these changes, and 3) whether these associations varied across intervention strategies targeting different levels of neuroticism. Changes in momentary neuroticism reliably predicted changes in daily and weekly measures of neuroticism and vice versa, and changes across all three timescales were correlated with changes in generalized trait neuroticism from pre- to post-intervention. Together, these results support the conceptual relevance and causal importance of both bottom-up (i.e., momentary, short-term → enduring, longer term) and top-down (i.e., enduring, long-term → momentary, short-term) processes of personality change. Overall, this study provided a key test of theoretical predictions about the process and directionality of intervention-induced personality change and, in doing so, helped elucidate the mechanisms of intentional personality change and generate insights about how to enhance intervention efficacy.",

The results indicate that performance on all three tasks is moderately correlated. Principal component analyses underscore these results by showing that all three tasks share a common component. We also examined participants’ confidence in their judgments and found that participants are unaware of how good they are in predicting others’ actions.

          "abstract": "Background: Sleep problems are linked to negative mental health outcomes, both of which rise in prevalence during adolescence and young adulthood. Existing evidence-based sleep treatments are effective but remain largely inaccessible for this age group. Young people also have lower agency over structural barriers affecting sleep (e.g., home environment, school start times).\n\nMethod: Project Sleep is a digital single-session intervention (SSI) designed with feedback from young people to meet their unique sleep needs. Participants included individuals aged 13-25 with self-reported sleep problems (N=759, Mage=18.7; 48% white, 81% girls, 38% LGBTQ+). Socioeconomic status (SES) ranged from 1-10 (M=6.4, SD=1.7). Structural sleep barriers were reported by 45%: uncomfortable temperature (20%), exceess noise (17%), shared rooms (13%), excess light (10%), nighttime workers in the home (7%), unstable living conditions (2%). Participants rated perceived importance of sleep and making a change to sleep, readiness for change, and perceived control over sleep pre- and post-SSI. Moderation models assessed whether structural factors influenced outcomes. T-tests and correlations tested whether participants’ subjective feedback differed by structural barriers.\n\nResults: Those experiencing structural barriers improved similarly to peers. However, lower SES participants (p = .02) and those in high-noise environments (p = .01) experienced smaller gains in perceived control. Those living with nighttime workers improved less in sleep change importance (p = .002), and those in unstable living conditions (p = .02) and uncomfortable temperature environments (p = .04) improved less in sleep importance. Conversely, participants in shared rooms improved more in perceived control (p = .03). There were no differences in participants’ feedback about their experience of the SSI by structural barrier.\n\nConclusions: This brief, accessible SSI provides proximal support for youth with structural sleep barriers, though could benefit from further adaptation. Future research will work with young people experiencing structural sleep barriers to better address their needs.",

Questions about changes in personality functioning are of critical relevance for theory development and psychotherapeutic treatment of personality pathology, yet little is known about its longitudinal development. Using a sample of German-speaking young adults (N = 1,440; Mage = 25.57), we examined one-year unconditional and event-related development in self-reported personality functioning across four metrics of change, tested predictors of heterogeneity in event-related changes, and compared findings to self-reported Big Five traits. Generally, unconditional development of all personality constructs was very similar, but there were some trait- and metric-specific differences. Life events accounted for heterogeneity in unconditional development, but almost exclusively for personality functioning, suggesting it has a greater susceptibility to external influences than most Big Five traits. Event perceptions and initial personality levels sometimes predicted individual differences in event-related changes, mostly for mean-level effects, and initial personality functioning frequently moderated event-related changes in the Big Five whereas the reverse was less common. These findings provide further insight into the conceptual (dis)similarity of personality traits and personality functioning, inform joint theoretical frameworks, and may help advance personality disorder treatment by identifying conditions in which changes in personality pathology may be expected or best captured.",

          "abstract": "Haptic perception plays an integral role in how we interact with and make sense of the physical world. As research in this domain continues to expand across disciplines, conceptual ambiguities in terminology and theoretical frameworks persist. In this review, I address several of these ambiguities by proposing a more explicit account of notions often used implicitly. Following a brief overview of the physiological and mechanical foundations of skin-object interactions and the somatosensory system, I introduce working definitions for terms such as haptic cues, stimuli, and perceptual dimensions, along with related assumptions and misconceptions, specifically within the context of haptic perception. I here argue that the distinction between distal and proximal stimuli or cues–more commonly applied in visual perceptual psychology–can serve as a helpful framework in haptic research for distinguishing physical (object-level) and mechanical (interaction-level) inputs. I then review some of the most commonly studied haptic dimensions, including stimulus magnitude, shape, material and texture, motion and time, weight, and size, along with the cues thought to inform them. This is followed by an examination of the notion of stability in haptic perception–often referred to as constancy or invariance–and its relevance for understanding how the sensory system creates consistent and behaviorally relevant percepts under variable conditions and cues. The specific phenomenon of perceptual and sensory metamers is explored as a particularly compelling example of cue integration and perceptual stability. Finally, I consider the various levels at which haptic stimuli and cues can be manipulated in research. By operationalizing some of these more implicit notions, we can reduce conceptual ambiguity in the search for a clearer account of how stable haptic percepts are achieved.",

This review examines the effects of contingent feedback on human vocal development using reinforcement learning frameworks, based on an analysis of 70 empirical studies. A literature search using the terms \"vocal learning,\" \"vocal reinforcement,\" and \"vocal contingency\" identified three study categories: contingent imitation effects (12 studies), other contingent feedback effects (33 studies), and additional contingent feedback effects (21 studies). Analysis using the antecedent-behavior-consequence framework revealed that contingent responses increase vocal production rates and modify vocal quality, with contingent imitation being especially effective. Three effects accompany the increase in target behavior, including phonological change, collateral increase, and preparatory learning. Evidence also demonstrates other effects of contingent feedback, such as enhanced object recognition learning and longitudinal language development outcomes. In sum, empirical studies show that contingent feedbacks on human vocal behavior have reinforcement effects, a positive correlation with vocalization rate, and longitudinal effects on development. Thus, vocal learning is not merely imitative or developmental, but also shaped by structured environmental feedback.",

          "abstract": "When humans interact with artificial intelligence (AI), one desideratum is appropriate trust. Typically, appropriate trust encompasses that humans trust AI except when they either explicitly notice AI errors or when they are suspicious that errors could be present. So far, appropriate trust or related notions have been mainly investigated by assessing trust and reliance. In this contribution, we argue that these assessments are not sufficient to measure the complex aim of appropriate trust and the related notion of healthy distrust. We introduce and test the perspective of visual attention as an additional indicator for appropriate trust and draw conceptual connections to the notion of healthy distrust.\n\nTo test the validity of our conceptualization, we formalize visual attention using TVA and measure its properties potentially relevant to appropriate trust and healthy distrust in an image classification task. Thereby, we investigate participants’ attentional capacity and attentional weight towards correct and incorrect classifications. \nWe observe that misclassifications reduce attentional capacity compared to correct classifications. However, our results do not indicate that this reduction is beneficial for a subsequent judgment of the classifications. The attentional weighting is not affected by the classifications’ correctness but by the difficulty of categorizing the stimuli themselves. These results, their implications, and the limited potential for using visual attention as an indicator of appropriate trust and healthy distrust are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal motor interactions are central to social life, yet it remains unclear how social cues relevant to detecting engagement are encoded in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that regions traditionally associated with mentalizing, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), co-activate with nodes of the Action Observation Network (AON) during motor engagement with others, pointing to a synergistic role in the processing of action features during interaction. Using fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we examined brain responses to reach-to-grasp actions varying in Goal (passing vs. placing), Perspective (2nd vs. 3rd person), and Gaze visibility, creating a gradient of perceived engagement. Our results show that the TPJ and premotor cortices, but not the dmPFC, displayed convergent neural geometry during action observation. Model- and cluster-based analyses further linked TPJ and AON regions in multiple representational spaces: left-hemisphere regions aligned with goal encoding, whereas right-hemisphere regions aligned with an Engagement model capturing first-person interaction. Critically, we demonstrate that the rTPJ and left premotor cortex share representational geometry for action perspective, directly coupling mentalizing and sensorimotor systems in the encoding of directional cues. By contrast, the dmPFC appeared representationally isolated from both TPJ and AON regions, with response patterns showing no similarity to Goal or Engagement models. This is consistent with accounts of its recruitment under richer interactive demands rather than selectivity for abstract action features. Together, these findings support a distributed, sensorimotor account of engagement encoding and reveal new functional links among key social cognition areas.",

Although the DSM-5 offers useful classification guidelines, overlapping symptoms across categories of anxiety highlight the need for transdiagnostic approaches. Threat processing, closely linked to anxiety, offers a promising pathway for such exploration. Threat processing involves various neurocognitive and psychophysiological mechanisms, including visual cortical responses, physiological reactivity, and affective ratings. This study examined whether different anxiety subtypes could be identified based on individual differences in threat processing. A total of 211 undergraduate students were recruited, with 198 included in the analyses. Threat-related measures included attentional bias competition indices derived from Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials in the visual cortex, heart rate, skin conductance responses, and arousal/valence ratings. Anxiety-related measures included self-report questionnaires and momentary assessments using experience sampling methods. Latent profile analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Profile 1 (n=114; 58%) was labelled as “low psychophysiological but high psychological affective reactivity”, Profile 2 (n=59; 30%) as “low psychophysiological affective reactivity”, and Profile 3 (n=25; 13%) as “high psychophysiological affective arousal”. However, these different threat-related profiles did not reflect major differences in the anxiety-related measures, either in questionnaires or momentary assessments. These findings offer preliminary insight into distinct threat-processing profiles in anxiety and highlight the need for further research, especially with larger samples and more variance in anxiety.",

Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

To date, support for a PC theory of the RHI has been limited to correlational evidence. Here we conduct a pre-registered causal test of the relative contribution of these two proposed mechanisms in RHI effects. XX high PC participants (top 10%) were tested in an RHI procedure and the classic effects of greater response for synchrony than asynchrony were/were not replicated. The procedure was then repeated following imaginative suggestions for a reversal of the classic effect (i.e. greater synchrony than asynchrony effects).

This study aimed to determine service-level, user-level and staff-level barriers in accessing/delivering care and service user satisfaction from the perspective of mental health practitioners. Hence, a Staff Perspectives on Service User Satisfaction and Barriers to Help Seeking Scale was created using modifications to validated questionnaires to measure (1) service user satisfaction, (2) service user level barriers, (3) service-level barriers, and (4) staff-level barriers. Results indicated a significant moderate positive relationship between service-level barriers and staff-level barriers. The relationship suggests interconnected challenges, where barriers related to the service may directly impact perceived barriers from staff. Future research should compare service user satisfaction outcomes from both the staff and the service users’ perspectives and gather further insights from service users.",

          "abstract": "Background: Misdiagnosis is common in bipolar disorder (BD). Currently used screening tools are brief and cost-effective, but there is a lack of understanding of their reliability over time as well as whether responses are influenced by demographic or clinical factors. Aims: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of two commonly used screening tools as well as their associations with current mood states and other participant characteristics. Methods: 331 adult patients with a diagnosis of BD completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Symptom Checklist-32 (HCL-32) as well as measures of mood online at baseline and three months later. Results: The MDQ was found to have low reliability with poor internal consistency (α= 0.531; α= 0.647 at respective timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.582). The HCL-32 was more reliable with good internal consistency (α= 0.815 at both timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.725). MDQ scores were significantly, positively associated with comorbidities and current symptoms of activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age and years since last hospitalisation. The HCL-32 was also significantly positively correlated with activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age, years since diagnosis and years since last hospitalisation. BD-I patients scored higher than other BD-subtypes. Mood state was the only variable with a significant change over time. Conclusions: The HCL-32 appeared more reliable than the MDQ, although all participants needed to exceed an MDQ threshold at baseline to participate in the study, which may have biased our results.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatric assistance dogs may offer a promising form of support for individuals with severe mental health challenges, yet systematic research remains limited, particularly among civilians, as most existing studies have focused on veterans or other uniformed populations. This article reports findings from three complementary studies examining the effects of psychiatric assistance dogs on the quality of life of adolescents and young adults in the Netherlands (16–30 years) with severe psychosocial problems. In a cross-sectional questionnaire study (n = 141), participants who had lived with their dog for more than two years reported significantly higher quality of life than those with shorter partnerships. A six-month longitudinal study (n = 9) showed significant increases in quality of life across 12 repeated measurements among participants who had only recently been matched with their dogs. Qualitative interviews (n = 13) provided further insight, revealing an initial adjustment period followed by improvements in psychological and social well-being. Thematic analysis highlighted hope (seeing a future again), enhanced social participation and independence, and companionship with the dog as the most prominent benefits mentioned in the interviews. Taken together, the three studies provide converging evidence that psychiatric assistance dogs can meaningfully enhance daily functioning, quality of life, and social connectedness for young civilians with mental health difficulties. Importantly, this research demonstrates measurable and robust benefits, showing that the impact of psychiatric assistance dogs extends beyond stories and into demonstrable improvements in people’s lives, provided the dog’s welfare is safeguarded.",

          "abstract": "Objective\nPsychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in adults with childhood-onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Currently, little is known about childhood predictors for these outcomes.\n\nMethod\nPubMed, PsychInfo, WoS, and EMBASE were searched until June 2024. Eligible studies investigated childhood predictors of persistent ADHD, substance use disorders (SUD), conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and/or anxiety disorders in adults diagnosed with childhood ADHD (PROSPERO #CRD42022320887). Meta-analytic models were tested when N ≥3 for a predictor with similar effect measures, otherwise predictors were discussed narratively when N ≥2. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess study quality. \n\n Results\nThe selected 36 studies included 119 predictors, with 10 predictors eligible for meta-analyses. History of stimulant treatment (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.28-2.75, p = .001) was associated with increased, and higher childhood IQ with decreased (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.00, p =.039), risk of ADHD persistence in adulthood. ADHD persistence was associated with increased risk of SUDs (OR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.53-3.17, p =.004) and MDD (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.71-5.95, p &lt;.001). Narratively reviewed predictors of fair/good quality studies showed potential predictors for ADHD persistence (i.e., ADHD combined type, hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, anxiety disorders, externalizing problems, social dysfunctioning, and socioeconomic status).\n\n Conclusion\nWe confirmed earlier reported childhood predictors (i.e., stimulant treatment history, ADHD persistence) and identified potential new predictors (i.e., childhood anxiety disorders, social problems, socioeconomic status) for psychiatric outcomes of ADHD. However, the available literature is hampered by methodological shortcomings. Future studies should focus on studying combined effects of potential predictors.",

Visual processing, particularly the ability to gather and use visual information quickly and accurately, is critical for performance in high-speed sports. We hypothesised that visual behaviour, including the duration of the final fixation (Quiet Eye; QE), the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations, significantly impacts fencing performance during offensive and defensive actions. National-level sabre fencers performed a ten-minute assault with eye-tracking technology measuring their gaze behaviour. Results indicated that QE was significantly longer before successful touches compared to unsuccessful ones (t(9) = 2.61, p =.014, dz = 0.83). Additionally, the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations were higher during defensive actions than offensive actions (all ts(9) &gt; 4.34, ps ≤ .001, dzs&gt; 1.37). This research provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying sports performance in a realistic context and has implications for training strategies, emphasising the importance of various visual behaviour patterns in fencing.",

Spearman’s rank-order correlations showed weak associations between reading measures and generalised or social anxiety, but moderate to strong associations between reading-specific anxiety (general and social) and all reading measures. Grade and gender did not moderate these relationships. Finally, Fisher’s tests provided no evidence that comorbid attention or language difficulties were linked to higher anxiety symptoms among poor secondary school readers.\nConclusions: The findings of study this provide evidence for a moderate to strong association between reading ability and reading anxiety and motivate further investigations into the causal mechanisms that may create and then maintain links between reading and wellbeing in secondary school students.",

          "abstract": "Social identity threat (SIT) is a situational stressor that increases arousal and negative affect, biases memory encoding towards domain-specific negative affect, and impairs performance when women are outnumbered by men.  One consequence of these effects could be that women develop learned aversions towards stigmatized STEM domains. Four studies tested whether stereotypic STEM images (STEMIs) prompt aversive-like responses that predict SIT-like outcomes, including underperformance in SIT contexts and more negative SIT-oriented memories over time.  Using a dot-probe paradigm, Study 1 found that only SIT women exhibited greater arousal responses to STEMIs compared to stereotypic non-STEM images (NonSTEMIs), perceived STEMIs as more negatively arousing compared to men, and underperformed; men in this context showed a similar arousal response to STEMIs and NonSTEMIs and performed better. Study 2 replicated this effect among women STEM majors and linked aversive responses to more negative affect laden memories for the STEM lab experience five weeks later. Using EEG, Study 3 found that enhanced processing of STEMIs presented during an attentional blink task (indexed via increased communication between occipital and prefrontal cortical regions) predicted underperformance on a math test among SIT women but marginally better performance among men. Study 4 mitigated SIT underperformance effects among women utilizing a dot-probe training paradigm that blunted arousal responses to STEMIs; instructing men to attend to STEMIs facilitated their performance.  STEM aversions may thus facilitate SIT-like effects, possibly defining what the “threat” in SIT is, however, blunting aversions can attenuate these effects when women work alongside men in STEM performance situations.",

          "abstract": "Despite increased focus on well-being in the psychological sciences in recent years, cross-sectional and group-level methods fall short of capturing the dynamics of individual people’s well-being in daily life. Such an investigation is especially important for young adults who are in a developmental phase in which they are more likely to experience fluctuations in their daily lives. We used ecological momentary assessment over one week in two samples of first-year college students (Sample 1, N = 103, assessments = 2,535; Sample 2, N = 76, assessments = 1,796) and a dynamic network approach (Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis). This approach estimates, within each person, how well-being elements fluctuate across days and co-vary with one another, recovering both their differentiation (exclusivity) and their interdependence (connectivity). In this approach, elements of well-being—measured via the PERMA framework—are modeled as a dynamic network to address the following research questions: (1) How do elements of well-being in young adults’ daily life form a dynamic network? (2) Does the structure of well-being hold across all young adults, or is there heterogeneity? (3) Is there synchrony among well-being elements, and do they drive a person’s well-being network? Findings suggest that while group-level dynamic well-being networks align with theoretical models, each person’s individual experiences vary significantly, with each person demonstrating unique well-being network structures and synchronous elements. These findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in well-being, highlighting the necessity for personalized approaches to understand and promote well-being among young adults.",

          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "abstract": "Tractography is a key component of efforts to map brain connectivity. As a rapidly-evolving field of neuroscience, current tractography methods are diverse, often varying across research laboratories and different software pipelines. Therefore, it suffers from a lack of standardization leading to inconsistencies in results, which can limit reproducibility, and affect the robustness needed for research and clinical applications of these methods. Variability in data acquisition procedures, inconsistencies in spatial referencing schemes and implementations, and anatomical heterogeneity —at the individual level, across the lifespan, and across species— hinders comparative analyses. Additionally, the lack of consensus on best practices complicates the development of robust automated quality control pipelines and limits the clinical translation of tractography-based procedures. Establishing standardized protocols for acquisition, preprocessing, and tractography reconstruction are critical towards enabling reliable tract-specific analyses, facilitating cross-study harmonization, and supporting replicable large-scale population studies. The present article provides an overview of the current challenges in tractography standardization and identifies the key aspects that require standardization for reliable, reproducible, and robust tractography.",

When parents’ psychological needs are met, they are more likely to show autonomy-supportive parenting; and when parents report greater psychological need frustration, they are more likely to parent with psychological control. We tested how parental psychological needs can predict adolescent internalizing mood through parenting practices in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries for 14 days to rate parental psychological needs, parenting practices, and adolescent internalizing mood. We conducted multilevel mediation analyses (i.e., 1-1-1 and 2-2-2 design) to examine the effect of parental psychological needs on adolescent internalizing mood through parent parenting practices. When parents’ daily psychological needs were met, they practiced more supportive parenting practices in daily life, which in turn was associated with better adolescent mood. Most of these mediation effects were not found when examining long-term characteristics. Our findings point towards the importance of disentangling day-to-day fluctuations in behaviors and experiences than to long-term associations between them in families’ daily lives to better understand family dynamics and adolescent well-being.",

          "abstract": "Although sports-themed video games (SVG) are some of the most popular and profitable video games, there is a lack of research regarding video gaming and gambling behaviors of SVG players. To date, research suggests that sports fandom may drive SVG play, as engagement in SVGs is an extension of sports consumption. Evidence also suggests that sports fandom is associated with more sports betting and other gambling. Despite these findings, research has yet to explore the differences between SVG players and non-SVG (NSVG) players across their video gaming and gambling engagement including measures of problem video gaming (PVG) and problem gambling (PG). The present study addresses this gap in the literature using online survey data from two independent samples from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk: N = 1,990, 53.1% Male; Mage = 40.14, SD = 11.80) and Academic Prolific (N = 2,212, 68.4% Male, Mage = 33.18, SD = 9.94). Results showed that SVG players had higher frequency video gaming and gambling, and greater prevalence of PVG and PG relative to NSVG players. Further, SVG players also reported higher frequency of video gaming-related gambling, such as loot box purchases and e-sports gambling, suggesting a strong overlap of video gaming and gambling among SVG players. This is the first study to show a significant risk for SVG players in terms of PG. The discussion focuses on the next steps for research.",

          "abstract": "The “loot box” (LB) monetization strategy has established itself as a dominant and controversial feature in the world of video games. While numerous studies have found that gambling and gaming behaviors may predict LB purchases, sometimes to problematic levels, there is a dearth of research regarding systematic reviews with non-behavioral predictors. Likewise, while LBs may have become mainstream, there is a notable lack of agreed definition for this microtransaction, with researcher proposing their own definition with nuances that may make it difficult to group findings from different studies. The aim of this study is to review the literature on the definitions of LB, and the sociodemographic and psychological predictors of LB purchases. Following this strategy, 1540 articles were found from SCOPUS, EBSCOHost, PubMed and Google Scholar. After screening and eligibility procedures, 22 articles were included and analyzed. Findings show that while there are some traits from LBs that are reported in several studies when being defined, a discrepancy exists between studies on what characteristics are included in the definitions, which may affect how LBs are used in research. It was also found that few studies use sociodemographic variables as predictors, with results beings mixed. More importantly, psychological predictors found were divided into two subgroups: psychological (e.g., reward sensitivity, impulsivity, self-esteem modification and FOMO) and motivational (e.g., fun-seeking, desire for progression, cosmetics and completion). These results show that there is a wide array of psychological and motivational predictors that may overlap, thus more research on the topic is needed.",

To assess the reliability and validity of the scale in this setting, a 16-item Spanish-adapted version of the TWBS was administered online to a sample of 304 EFL teachers working in diverse Chilean school environments. Furthermore, a two-stage validation design was implemented, using independent samples. The results demonstrated that the TWBS exhibits strong psychometric properties, including excellent reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.903, which confirms its high internal consistency. Additionally, both Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) supported the scale’s structural validity, indicating a well-fitting model for the collected data. These findings are crucial for establishing the TWBS as a valid and reliable instrument in the Chilean context, which ensures its effectiveness in measuring key dimensions of teachers’ professional well-being.",

We then collected subjective ratings of semantic similarities between pairs of meanings/senses within a word and investigated their relation with the similarity of the sensorimotor profiles to corroborate that the sensorimotor-based similarity was semantic in nature. Our results speak in favour of sensorimotor information as a component of representations of polysemous senses / homonymous meanings, and advise future norming studies to take into account lexical ambiguity.",

The aim of this meta-analysis was to clarify the inconsistencies in research surrounding early-childhood digital media exposure and the association with children’s socio-emotional outcomes. We identified 84 correlational and experimental studies investigating 61,865 neurotypical 0–6-year-old children. For the 72 correlational studies, there was a small but significant positive association between children’s daily exposure to media and their socio-emotional development, with a stronger association for socio-emotional difficulties, suggesting that more exposure was associated with worse socio-emotional outcomes. For the 13 experimental studies, there was no significant association. However, this meta-analysis is limited due to the availability of data in the literature and quality of children’s media exposure measures.",

          "abstract": "Although sports-themed video games (SVG) are some of the most popular and profitable video games, there is a lack of research regarding video gaming and gambling behaviors of SVG players. To date, research suggests that sports fandom may drive SVG play, as engagement in SVGs is an extension of sports consumption. Evidence also suggests that sports fandom is associated with more sports betting and other gambling. Despite these findings, research has yet to explore the differences between SVG players and non-SVG (NSVG) players across their video gaming and gambling engagement including measures of problem video gaming (PVG) and problem gambling (PG). The present study addresses this gap in the literature using online survey data from two independent samples from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk: N = 1,990, 53.1% Male; Mage = 40.14, SD = 11.80) and Academic Prolific (N = 2,212, 68.4% Male, Mage = 33.18, SD = 9.94). Results showed that SVG players had higher frequency video gaming and gambling, and greater prevalence of PVG and PG relative to NSVG players. Further, SVG players also reported higher frequency of video gaming-related gambling, such as loot box purchases and e-sports gambling, suggesting a strong overlap of video gaming and gambling among SVG players. This is the first study to show a significant risk for SVG players in terms of PG. The discussion focuses on the next steps for research.",

Our descriptive analysis supported substantial cross-national variation in the proportion of people who endorsed ‘often/always’ feeling a connection to a religion or spirituality, ranging from 23% in Japan to 85% in South Africa. We estimated country-level descriptive statistics for a connection to a religion or spirituality in each sociodemographic category, and then performed a series of random effects meta-analyses to aggregate results across countries.

Sociocultural factors, like religion, urbanization, and affluence, are hypothesized to shape people’s spiritual connections with nature, yet there are no systematic cross-cultural surveys of ecospirituality that can speak to this hypothesis. Study 1 used a sample of religious people from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to assess how these sociocultural factors relate to ecospirituality. Study 2 assessed the same factors in a sample of religious and non-religious Americans (N = 3,329). The overall pattern of results suggested that greater religiosity, urbanization, and affluence contribute to greater ecospirituality across cultural and religious contexts. Some differences in the pattern of results were found in the sample of Americans, suggesting that psychological surveys on this topic conducted in the United States may not generalize across cultures.

This study employs a large cross-cultural sample of religious individuals from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to (1) estimate the link between ecospirituality and three pro-environmental outcomes: behavioural intentions to make sustainable decisions, policy support, and financial donations to a pro-environmental organization; and (2) assess the pathways by which an ecospiritual worldview translates to pro-environmentalism. The results of pre-registered analyses showed that ecospirituality positively predicted each of the pro-environmental outcomes similarly across diverse cultural and religious populations. Even more, the link between ecospirituality and pro-environmental outcomes were consistently mediated by the same variables across cultures. In short, ecospirituality unites diverse cultural worldviews in motivating care for nature by fostering a sense of responsibility, gratitude and efficacy, making it a potentially powerful foundation for global environmental stewardship.",

          "abstract": "Successful communication requires that listeners not only identify speech, but do so while maintaining performance on other tasks, like remembering what a conversational partner said or paying attention while driving. This set of four experiments systematically evaluated how audiovisual speech—which reliably improves speech intelligibility—affects dual-task costs during speech perception (i.e., one facet of listening effort). Results indicated that audiovisual speech reduces dual-task costs in difficult listening conditions (those in which visual cues substantially benefit intelligibility), but may actually increase costs in easy conditions—a pattern of results that was internally replicated multiple times. This study also presents a novel dual-task paradigm specifically designed to facilitate conducting dual-task research remotely. Given the novelty of the task, this study includes psychometric experiments that establish positive and negative control, assess convergent validity, measure task sensitivity relative to a commonly-used dual-task paradigm, and generate performance curves across a range of listening conditions. Thus, in addition to evaluating the effects of audiovisual speech across a wide range of background noise levels, this study enables other researchers to address theoretical questions related to the cognitive mechanisms supporting speech processing beyond the specific issues addressed here and without being limited to in-person research.",

We aimed to build evidence replicating the structural validity of a recent sensitivity measure that has been successfully developed from and used with Dutch samples. We recruited three central US young adult samples (total n = 1,271; M age = 18.89 years; 62.2% cisgender women) and tested the structural validity of the six-dimension Sensory Processing Sensitivity Scale (SPSQ; De Gucht et al., 2022). We hypothesized that a six-factor structure of sensitivity would be better supported than more parsimonious alternatives. We hypothesized that sensitivity would be orthogonal to gender and gender socialization, and that there would be measurement invariance between women’s and men’s reports of sensitivity. We found greater support for a multidimensional measure of sensitivity over more parsimonious alternatives. We did not find support for measurement invariance between women’s and men’s reports of sensitivity, challenging assumptions about sensitivity. We speak to the value of using a multidimensional measurement of sensitivity in ongoing inquiries, while also pointing to nuances for what could be important correlated and confounds of sensitivity reports.",

          "abstract": "What role does the study of natural language play in the task of developing a unified theory and common model of cognition? Language is perhaps the most complex behaviour that humans exhibit, and, as such, is one of the most difficult problems for understanding human cognition. Linguistic theory can both inform and be informed by unified models of cognition. We discuss (1) how computational models of human cognition can provide insight into how humans produce and comprehend language and (2) how the problem of modelling language processing raises questions and creates challenges for widely used computational models of cognition. Evidence from the literature suggests that behavioural phenomena, such as recency and priming effects, and cognitive constraints, such as working memory limits, affect how language is produced by humans in ways that can be predicted by computational cognitive models. But just as computational models can provide new insights into language, language can serve as a test for these models. For example, simulating language learning requires the use of more powerful machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and vector symbolic architectures, and language comprehension requires a capacity for on-the-fly situational model construction. In sum, language plays an important role in both shaping the development of a common model of the mind, and, in turn, the theoretical understanding of language stands to benefit greatly from the development of a common model.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

          "abstract": "We examined the development of reading comprehension and its neural underpinnings in the context of disrupted education among Syrian refugee children and youth resettled in Canada. One hundred participants  (Mage = 13.78, SD = 2.55) completed standardized assessments of language comprehension, decoding, and reading comprehension, and participated in functional near-infrared spectroscopy while completing a decoding task. Consistent with the Simple View of Reading (SVR), both language comprehension and decoding significantly predicted reading comprehension. However, the relative role of language comprehension and decoding to reading comprehension differed depending on the extent of educational disruptions experienced during displacement and migration. Decoding predicted reading comprehension for children with minimal education disruptions. However, when educational disruptions were longer due to prolonged displacement, the relation between decoding and reading comprehension was limited, and instead, the relation between language comprehension and reading comprehension was greater. These results suggested that in the context of limited formal literacy instruction during displacement, language comprehension may assume a compensatory function for poor decoding ability. Neuroimaging showed that greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) predicted better reading comprehension, suggesting compensatory recruitment beyond the typical left-lateralized reading network. Cluster analyses identified distinct reading profiles that were predicted by neural activation patterns and educational disruption. Children with the highest reading comprehension scores showed greater right IFG activation and lower activation in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG)–a region associated with decoding. Our study extends the SVR by demonstrating that the contribution of decoding and language comprehension to reading comprehension depends on educational experience, and that multiple neural pathways can support reading comprehension after educational disruption. Practically, these results highlight the need for individualized reading interventions and the urgency of minimizing educational disruption for displaced children and youth.",

          "abstract": "When creating art, artists must make constant decisions with each pen stroke in order to achieve their goals of the piece. One common goal is to create something memorable—a piece that will persist in the memories of the observer. However, an open question is how different artistic decisions impact the memorability of a piece as it is being created. To test this question, we utilized a neural network (ResMem) to track the frame-by-frame changes in memorability for 50 videos of the creation of digital art pieces. We tested this neural network’s predictions via a human memory experiment (N=399), finding that ResMem’s predictions significantly correlated with human memory performance across the art creation process. We then collected multiple measures of each piece’s creation process, including low-level visual features, mid-level visual features, neural network-derived features, artistic features, and spatial properties. We find that changes in details and low-level visual features do not contribute to the memorability of a piece; rather more global measures of simplicity and variability relate to the memorability of a piece. Further, larger changes (e.g., blocking, sketching), particularly below the horizon of the image, make the biggest impacts on memorability. Importantly, we find that the memorability of a piece is largely set from the very beginning, and changes that occur later have diminishing impact on the memorability of a piece. These findings have important implications for both artists and psychologists in thinking about the factors that impact memory during the creation of an image.",

          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically,  these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates (off by many hours) with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on the same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the practical severity of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

          "abstract": "Facilitation in word processing, identified as faster responses to semantically related words, has traditionally been viewed as evidence of the core cognitive mechanisms that support language processing. However, it remains uncertain whether this facilitation arises from bottom-up spreading activation, top-down prediction, or a combination of both. To address this, we developed a novel semantic priming paradigm that systematically manipulates local contextual buildup and applied drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to differentiate the decision dynamics associated with each mechanism. In our experiment, 20 participants performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one (short condition) or three (long condition) semantically related primes. We found that, as the local semantic context became more enriched (short vs. long condition), participants adjusted their decision strategies, engaging different processing mechanisms. In the short condition, participants relied on spreading activation, as indicated by increased drift rate (faster evidence accumulation), suggesting that a single related prime pre-activated the target's mental representation. In contrast, in the long condition, reduced boundary separation (participants required less evidence before responding) implied greater confidence driven by enhanced predictability from multiple primes, consistent with the predictive processing account. Together, our findings offer new insights into theoretical models of language processing; demonstrate the practical relevance of DDM in language processing and offer potential implications for translational research.",

Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

          "abstract": "Background: \n22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic condition associated with a wide range of physical, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments. This condition is often associated with difficulties in social functioning (SF), frequently exacerbated by psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and psychotic symptoms, which are particularly common in this population. This study adopted a multi-method approach to embrace the complexity of the SF assessment and identify distinct SF profiles in youths with 22q11DS. Association with mental health were examined, with the aim of guiding more targeted and individualized interventions.\nMethods: \nFifty-five adolescents and young adults with 22q11DS and 65 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls were recruited. SF was assessed using a combination of measures in both groups, and a latent profile analysis was conducted on the full sample to identify distinct SF profiles. Mental health was assessed in both groups using standardized questionnaires; in addition, individuals with 22q11DS completed clinical interviews to assess psychiatric comorbidities.\nResults: \nThree distinct SF profiles emerged from a Latent Profile Analysis: An Above profile composed exclusively of TD individuals; an Average profile including both TD and 22q11DS participants; and a Below profile consisting mainly of individuals with 22q11DS. These profiles differed on key SF variables. Within the 22q11DS group, individuals in the Below profile exhibited more pronounced negative and disorganized psychotic symptoms and a greater number of psychiatric comorbidities than those in the Average profile, whose SF was more similar to that of TD individuals.\nConclusions: \nThis study improves our understanding of SF in individuals with 22q11DS by highlighting both inter-group differences and intra-group variability. The identification of three distinct SF profiles (above, average, below) reveals a gradient of SF and underscores that SF difficulties are not solely linked to cognitive impairments but also to psychopathology. The findings emphasize the importance of using a combination of complementary measures to capture the complex nature of SF and to guide more nuanced, individualized interventions.",

Regional examinations are necessary to account for the sociocultural context that shapes lived experiences of marginalized groups. This meta-analytic review examined how multiple forms of discrimination are considered in German mental health research and analyzed the relationship of perceived discrimination with depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms (i=36 studies; N=45,527). Discrimination was significantly associated with depressive (r=0.26, p&lt;.001) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (r=0.23, p&lt;.01). Subgroup analyses revealed a smaller effect size for studies which examined discrimination based on mental health vs. other forms of discrimination. Frequency of published reports has increased over the past 20 years (b=0.27, p&lt;.001), but data gaps for several populations, discrimination forms and validated measures continue to exist. The findings emphasize the need for improved methodological assessment and broader inclusion of discrimination in German mental health research along with targeted interventions to reduce its impact.",

          "abstract": "Parenthood introduces new constraints on adults' spatial exploration, yet associations between mobility and parental mental health remain unexplored. We conducted continuous GPS tracking of 171 first-time parents in Denmark during maternity leave and paternity leave, combined with postnatal depression and sleep quality assessments. Using Bayesian multilevel models with zero-inflated distributions, we revealed three key insights. First, parental leave restricted spatial mobility for both mothers and fathers, but with distinct patterns: fathers spent more time at home yet showed greater spatial dispersion when mobile. Second, parental leave coincided with elevated depression scores and poorer sleep quality for the on-leave parent, with mothers showing consistently higher depression levels than fathers. Third, parents with more depression symptoms showed increased probability of staying home entirely and reduced mobility range when mobile. These findings demonstrate population-level associations between GPS-derived mobility patterns and parental depression, even within the constrained spatial context of parental leave.",

          "abstract": "Unfamiliar face identification is a challenging task and is often considered to be perceptual in nature. This ignores the contribution of decision making in face identification. Across three experiments, we examined whether face-matching decisions would change depending on the framing of response options. In Experiment 1, participants completed an unfamiliar face matching task with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 2, participants completed the task twice, once with the Same/Different response options and once with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 3, participants completed the task when 50% or 80% of trials were matches and used the Same/Different or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. Whereas we found no evidence that face identification decisions were influenced by the framing of response options, we found evidence of a robust base rate effect. Together these findings suggest that decision making in unfamiliar face identification is a complex and selective process.",

To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment examining lexical ambiguity in spoken Mandarin at the tonal, segmental, and orthographical levels. Using a picture naming task, we explored how L1 Mandarin L2 English speakers in the UK and more-monolingual speakers in China resolve ambiguity by analysing their verbal responses when naming pictures, manipulating whether the context in which a picture is named makes the preferred label ambiguous (e.g. do speakers avoid saying “fen3 si1” when describing a picture of glass noodles when it appears alongside a picture of fans which shares the same label?; do bilinguals avoid this ambiguity more than more monolingual peers as claimed?). Our results do not support this hypothesis, as no reliable differences between groups were found. Despite the null results, we observed several interesting patterns worthy of further investigation.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Hellmann; Nuno Busch; Linus Hof; Thorsten Pachur",
          "abstract": "Hierarchical models are widely used to estimate group- and individual-level parameters in cognitive and behavioral research. When model parameters are bounded within a particular range, it is common practice to estimate the group-level parameters on the unbounded real line and then map the estimated mean onto the desired bounded parameter range using a nonlinear transformation. We show that the way group-level estimates are commonly computed with this approach can produce systematic biases because it ignores within-group variability. We derive correct expressions for computing the group-level mean that take within-group variability into account. Using formal derivation, simulation, and reanalyses of empirical data, we demonstrate (using cumulative prospect theory as an example) how the commonly used but incorrect approach distorts parameter estimates. In a reanalysis of age differences in risky choice, we find that although the distortions do not alter qualitative conclusions about group differences, they can affect the size of such differences and lead to different psychological interpretations of the groups' behavior. We point out and elaborate that the underlying issue is general and can arise in a wide range of hierarchical models. Our results highlight a subtle but consequential issue in hierarchical modeling and we provide concrete solutions for ensuring the validity of group-level inferences about behavior.",

          "abstract": "Human behavior is frequently constrained by the behavior of other agents (increasingly artificial agents like machines and software). In a cooperative setting, each individual needs to understand the partners’ intentions and corresponding actions to plan their actions adequately. Misunderstandings have adverse effects and diminish the efficiency of cooperation. We created a game-based experiment to study the effects of understanding a partner’s actions in a cooperative setting. In this game, the players depend on each other’s ability to make good decisions to succeed. In two studies (N = 87, N = 281), we collected data on the understanding of an artificial agent, operationalized as the ability to predict its actions and the skill at the task itself. The participants improve at predicting the agent’s actions and at their subtasks in the game over time. Following a misunderstanding, the participants’ performance at their subtask was worse, as measured by their actions’ quality, speed, and efficiency. Results of Study 2 suggest that the improvements in predicting the agent’s actions are likely the result of an improved understanding of the game rather than an improved understanding of the agent.",

Results indicated adequate item discrimination and internal consistency on all scales. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales and the hypothesized hierarchical organization of traits and facets. Gender invariance of the measure was demonstrated. In addition, convergent and discriminant validity evidence was provided through correlations with external measures. \nThe results support the SEPBA as a suitable instrument.

          "abstract": "As demand for problem-solving skills continues to grow, so does the need for efficient training methods. A potential method of achieving efficient training of problem-solving skills is to design a training programme that maximises transfer of learning between problem domains. However, current models of expert problem-solving make contrasting predictions about the conditions under which cross-domain transfer is possible. While pattern-recognition models using state-action associations allow only limited transfer to tasks with different actions, search-based models using state-value associations can reuse the same associations across tasks, potentially achieving greater transfer. In this study, we consider the case of transformation problem-solving tasks where each task uses a distinct and non-overlapping set of transformation rules. Participants trained using tasks from one taskset over four consecutive days and completed pre- and post-training probes on the untrained set. Training improved participants’ solution rate, efficiency, and decision speed, but there were no reliable improvements for the untrained tasks beyond what could be explained by direct practice during the probe blocks. We also observed a gradual reduction in the association between participants’ solution efficiency and their working memory capacity on the trained trials, suggesting a transition towards a problem-solving method less dependent upon working memory. We note that these findings contrast with the predictions of some search-based models of problem-solving expertise in which a rule-independent state-value function is reused across tasksets to decide actions. We discuss the implications of these results for future models of expert problem-solving and for the training of problem-solving skills.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory formation requires integrating multisensory information. Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescent mental health is deteriorating, and identifying those in need is challenging because of flawed assessments, flooded services, and low help-seeking by those most in need. A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed. We make recommendations for research and practice to improve how young people in need are identified and supported.",

          "abstract": "Accurate numerical estimation underlies many aspects of cognition, from basic quantity judgments to complex decision-making. One domain where numerical reasoning is especially critical is memory, where individuals often must estimate the likelihood that one event or idea is associated with another. In this study, participants completed a free association task across multiple sessions to generate their own individualized word-pair norms. Later, they provided numerical probability judgments (0–100%) of how often they had produced each pair. These judgments were compared to collective free association norms, a matched group evaluating others’ pairs, and a traditional control group. Results showed that participants who judged their own pairs were significantly more accurate in estimating associative probabilities than control or matched groups, reflecting the benefits of expertise derived from repeated interaction with stimuli. However, systematic overestimation bias persisted, especially for weak associations, indicating that metacognitive sensitivity to probability differences remains limited. These findings highlight how expertise improves, but does not perfect, the ability to translate memory associations into numerical judgments, offering new insights into the intersection of numerical cognition, metacognition, and memory.",

          "abstract": "Sacrificial moral dilemmas require individuals to choose between allowing harm to several people or preventing this by actively causing harm to a smaller number of people. These dilemmas have been foundational in studying how people resolve conflicts between competing moral principles, with responses traditionally interpreted as reflecting either “utilitarian” concern for the greater good or “deontological” refusal to enact harm. Existing research relies almost exclusively on hypothetical scenarios. We confronted 794 participants across two studies with real-life consequential dilemmas involving minor but genuine physical harm. Participants decided whether to allow two confederates to receive painful electroshocks or shock a third confederate, and provided motivations for their decisions. Study 1 manipulated physical proximity to potential targets, while Study 2 examined how the gender composition of potential targets influenced decisions. Moreover, each participant faced this choice twice, allowing us to examine how prior outcomes influence subsequent moral decisions.\nResults show that responses to traditional hypothetical dilemmas moderately predict real-life behavior. Physical proximity and target gender had no significant effects on actual choices. When confronting the dilemma a second time, approximately one-third of participants switched their decision, primarily to distribute harm equitably across potential targets. Analysis of participants' motivations reveals a diverse spectrum of moral considerations beyond utilitarian-deontological frameworks, including fairness concerns, responsibility avoidance, and beliefs about shared versus individual suffering. Our findings invite scholars to expand current theoretical models to better capture the nuanced ways people approach sacrificial trade-offs in consequential, real-world situations.",

Except for GFAP, these associations remained significant after adjustments. \nDISCUSION, Digital cognitive performance was associated with several ATN plasma biomarkers in T1D adults. Prospective studies are needed to understand the utility of these biomarkers in T1D.",

Unlike traditional marginal DIF methods, which often fail to capture the effects of intersecting identities and require large samples, InterDIFNet models uniform and non-uniform DIF across multiple intersectional groups simultaneously. The method utilizes an optimized thresholding procedure to balance power and Type I error control. A Monte Carlo simulation compared InterDIFNet to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) test and other intersectional DIF methods across varying sample sizes, numbers of groups, and DIF prevalence rates. Results show that when trained using TLP features, InterDIFNet consistently achieved higher power than TLP while maintaining comparable Type I error control, particularly in scenarios with three or more intersectional groups. An empirical application to real assessment data further demonstrated the method’s practical utility. InterDIFNet provides a scalable, data-driven solution for identifying intersectional DIF across multiple small sample groups.",

          "abstract": "Despite advancements in speech recognition technology, questions remain about model generalizability and how much models mirror human comprehension. These questions are addressed by comparing OpenAI's Whisper model and 75 human transcribers on 300 English sentences (20 speakers, half F, half M, half US-accented, half Spanish-accented). Sentences ended in 100 target words: 1⁄3 high-predictability sentences (The farmer milked the cows), 1⁄3 low- predictability (The farmer milked the nose), and 1⁄3 low-predictability+nonword (The marmer milked the nose). Target word transcription error rates were examined both in sentences and in isolation (recordings excised from same sentences). Errors decreased with increasing model size, but remained heightened for Spanish-accented vs. US-accented speech, roughly similar to human transcribers. Both models and humans benefited from higher sentence predictability. However, sentence context affected models and humans differently: humans benefited only from high- predictability sentences, while models benefited from any sentence context. Humans numerically outperformed the (best-performing) large model on isolated words and showed different error patterns, suggesting Whisper may have a restricted distribution of short utterances or may need lengthier acoustic context than humans. More varied training data and better context awareness, including speaker identity and pragmatic context, might improve ASR generalization.",

          "abstract": "Experimental research on self-initiated movement has for decades relied on the same methodology: the data epochs subjected to analysis are only those culminating in a movement. This approach reliably reveals early ramping activity starting one second or more before movement, but discounts the prior probability of slow ramping. We trained powerful machine-learning classifiers in a sliding window to discriminate between EEG data epochs that either do or do not culminate in a self-initiated movement. We found early ramping signals, but they were not predictive of impending movement. Instead, the ability to correctly classify movement from no-movement epochs emerged abruptly ~100 ms before action onset, while, using the traditional approach, we replicated the spurious finding of early predictability. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy, showing the neural commitment to act is a late-stage process that aligns with results on the timing of subjective experience and the ability to inhibit self-initiated movement.",

          "abstract": "Voting is a pillar of democracy, yet its psychological correlates remain understudied outside the West. We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "authors": "Henry Brice; Gairanlu Pamei; Sophia Galouschak; Kaja Kinga Jasińska",
          "abstract": "Background: Globally, many children learn to read exclusively in a second language (L2), but this phenomenon is understudied. Literacy typically reciprocally builds on pre-existing language knowledge, with phonological awareness (PA) and vocabulary predicting literacy outcomes, and themselves being impacted by literacy. Bilinguals demonstrate cross-linguistic transfer (CLT) of language skills from their first language (L1) to reading in L2, but this research primarily covers contexts where children have at least some level of L1 literacy. This raises the question of whether CLT occurs in the absence of L1 literacy, or if the reciprocal relation between language and literacy must be built in L1 before it can transfer to L2 reading.\nMethods: The current study examines the role of L1 and L2 language skills in supporting literacy in emergent readers in rural Côte d’Ivoire (n=1969, females = 912), between first and fifth grade. The broad range of ages both within and across grades allows us to examine how the age of first exposure to literacy impacts this relation. Results: We found robust evidence of CLT of PA, which was not moderated by age of literacy acquisition. Within-language support of literacy was moderated by age of literacy exposure, with literacy more strongly predicted by vocabulary and less by PA for those who started school on time. This effect fully mediated the detrimental impact of a late school start. Conclusions: These results have implications for theories of CLT and sensitive periods for literacy acquisition, and for efforts to reduce illiteracy in the Global South.",

Semi-structured, individual interviews revealed how an antiracist program, which involved reading and discussing the book Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You by Jason Reynolds and Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, engaged students and teachers in racism analysis, racial reflexivity, and antiracist action. Specifically, participants provided rich descriptions of how the Stamped program encouraged them to gain new perspectives, understand and recognize racism, link historical and modern racism, feel responsible and committed to racial justice, and take internal and interpersonal antiracist action. Some developmental trends emerged in which students were more likely to gain new worldviews and social cognitive mindsets whereas teachers were more likely to be racially reflexive and simultaneously discuss analysis, reflexivity, and action.

          "abstract": "Previous studies concluded that listeners struggle to discriminate AI from human voices, but these studies used monotone-like speech and did not examine prosodic expressiveness, a key advantage of human over AI speakers. This study explores whether prosodic expressiveness facilitates human-AI voice discrimination. We recorded human prosodic speech with confident and doubtful expressions, trained AI models to replicate these prosodic patterns, had AI models generate new sentences, and then had human speakers produce equivalent prosodic expressions for the same sentences. In Experiment 1, we had 48 listeners rate humanlikeness and perceived confidence in 11,808 audio samples, finding that AI speech was consistently rated as less humanlike regardless of prosody. We selected 768 audios (AI × human, confident × doubtful prosody) for Experiment 2, where 80 listeners completed an identity discrimination task, telling whether two sounds were from the same speaker. Bayesian modeling results revealed near-ceiling performance for human-human/AI-AI pairs, with inconsistent prosodies decreasing accuracy by ~7%, while listeners do not easily categorize AI and human as sharing the same identity (~54% accuracy when prosody matches, dropping to ~36% when inconsistent). We found nonlinear effects of Wav2Vec2 acoustic distance on performance, with accuracy-reaction time synchronization supporting direct matching mechanisms over prototype-based processing. Human-AI/AI-human pairs showed unique patterns where larger acoustic distances prompted listeners to rely less on acoustic distance cues, unlike other conditions. Our study suggests that concerns about voice clone detection may have been raised prematurely. Additionally, it addresses current gaps in understanding how within-speaker identity variation influences identity processing.",

Grounded in the four voices model of practical theology and employing a contemplative qualitative methodology, the research used thematic analysis to discover how participants’ prayer practices and experiences reflect and reshape theological understanding. Although participants rarely used the term ‘contemplation,’ their practices often aligned with Catholic teachings on contemplative prayer, with a shift toward monological and body-based forms such as breath prayer and attention to posture.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Peer feedback plays a critical role in adolescents’ socio-emotional development, shaping emotional responses and social functioning. While positive feedback enhances well-being, negative feedback is often linked to self-criticism and distress. Yet, real-life interactions also include nuanced forms of feedback—such as neutral remarks and constructive input—that are poorly captured by traditional paradigms dichotomizing feedback into positive vs negative. Prior research has also largely focused on global psychological outcomes (e.g., self-esteem, depression), overlooking diverse emotional reactions (e.g., pride, guilt, motivation) that peer feedback can elicit.\n\nMethods: To address these gaps, we developed a novel vignette-based measure to assess adolescents’ emotional and motivational responses to positive, negative, neutral, and constructive peer feedback. The measure was administered to 67 Portuguese adolescents (aged 14–18 years, 51% female) from the general community.\n\nResults: Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant differences across feedback types for all emotions (ps &lt; .01). Positive feedback elicited the highest levels of happiness and pride, and the lowest sadness, shame, and anger. Negative feedback produced the strongest negative emotions. Constructive feedback generated relatively high happiness and motivation but also moderate guilt and shame. Neutral feedback was most associated with indifference and muted emotional responses.\n\nConclusions: These findings support the measure’s sensitivity in capturing distinct emotional responses across feedback types. Notably, it captures the motivational benefits of constructive feedback alongside its moderate elicitation of negative emotions, and the muted, indifferent responses to neutral feedback. This highlights the utility of the measure for advancing understanding of how adolescents process diverse peer interactions.\n\nKeywords: Adolescence, Vignette measure, Peer feedback, response to peer feedback",

Stimuli were presented in auditory-only, visual-only, or audiovisual conditions, and perceptual accuracies were recorded. In the second task, participants identified whether they perceived a red or blue stimulus in either auditory-only (spoken word), visual-only (a red or blue circle), and audiovisual conditions, with response times recorded.

          "abstract": "Understanding human cognition in virtual environments (VE) is essential for improving digital human modeling and creating realistic experiences.  By recognizing how context affects sensory perception, designers can more effectively adapt environmental and task-related elements of experience design. This study compared participants' ability to detect and identify sensory cues, namely, passive tactile and olfactory stimuli, between real-life (RL) and VE. We also examined visual context dependency of sensory awareness in order to understand the contribution of environmental elements on sensory awareness.  This study is designed to measure the feeling of being in a real room, detection, identification, and perceived realism, intensity, roughness, and pleasantness of odor and tactile stimuli in both RL and its VE counterpart. Participants were exposed to sensory stimuli with or without visual cues. During the experiment, participants were given listening tasks. This design aims to understand how visual cues affect sensory perception and how different environments shape sensory performance. \nThe findings revealed that the feeling of being in a real room in VEs was high when all sensory cues (olfactory, tactile, visual) were present. Notably, in VE, odor detection was more accurate, whereas in RL, surface detection and identification were more reliable. When visual cues were present, participants detected olfactory and tactile cues more effectively. These findings shed light on how sensory perception encountered in RL shapes VE experiences and cognitive processes. These insights could enhance VE experiences by guiding the design of more realistic immersive settings and informing the use of sensory elements in VE design.",

          "abstract": "The student selection process is of paramount importance for optimizing the academic performance\nof students and colleges. For effective and evidence-based student selection, factors beyond\nintellectual capacity, such as cognitive style, must be considered. According to the Empathizing-Systemizing theory, individuals can be classified as 'systemizers' or 'empathizers' based on their cognitive style. Systemizers excel at predictable, systematic thinking, which is suited for fields like mathematics and physics. Empathizers are proficient in understanding social phenomena and typically succeed in fields involving significant human interaction, such as language. Individuals with comparable systemizing and empathizing abilities are classified as 'balanced'. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the student selection process in Erbil city effectively directs systemizers and empathizers into their cognitively suited academic fields. A cross-sectional study was conducted to measure the systemizing and empathizing abilities of 518 students from science, medical, and humanities colleges in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan. Students were selected using clustered sampling, and a questionnaire was used to assess their cognitive styles. The final analysis included 93% of the distributed questionnaires. The findings indicated that each academic discipline—sciences, humanities, and medicine—comprised approximately one-third of each brain type (S, N, and E). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of brain types across these disciplines (p = 0.968). This suggests that a student's brain type does not statistically predict their probability of entering a cognitively suitable academic field. The study's results suggest a defective student selection process in the universities examined, which appears unable to direct students with particular cognitive styles to their appropriate fields. These findings can be partially generalized to other state colleges in Slemani and Duhok, as their students have followed similar academic pathways.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatry continues to struggle with the heterogeneity of mental disorders. Classifications such as DSM and ICD catalogue symptom clusters but fail to reveal underlying mechanisms. Recent integrative approaches, including the biopsychosocial model and RDoC, have advanced the field, yet psychiatry still lacks a unifying explanatory principle. We propose the Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis as a conceptual framework—a paradigm rather than a proven theory. It suggests that psychiatric disorders can be understood as variations of a fundamental disruption in the brain’s predictive machinery. From an evolutionary standpoint, the brain’s primary role is not to represent the world accurately, but to anticipate potential dangers in order to ensure survival. When this survival-oriented predictive system becomes miscalibrated, psychopathology may arise. This hypothesis integrates predictive processing and active inference models with clinical psychiatry. Psychosis may be seen as overweighted priors, PTSD as rigid threat models, panic disorder as catastrophic interoceptive predictions, depression as entrenched negative priors, OCD as unresolved prediction errors, autism as overweighted sensory errors, and anxiety as exaggerated threat priors. Like oncology’s unification around disordered cell division, psychiatry may benefit from a unifying lens. The Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis is offered not as a replacement for existing frameworks but as a conceptual paradigm that invites empirical testing and inspires new ways of thinking about diagnosis and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",

Here we investigate how childhood maltreatment shapes control beliefs and their relationship with stress and exploration in adulthood. We used a recently developed task, the Wheel Stopping (WS) task, to measure and manipulate control beliefs and stress, and combined this with a novel self-report measure of exploration in a sample of 477 adults with and without experience of childhood maltreatment (matched on age, gender and socioeconomic status). The WS task utilises two between-subjects manipulations of control: task controllability (high vs low), and performance feedback (relative positive vs relative negative). We show that despite similar task performance, maltreated participants displayed lower levels of control beliefs compared to controls and that while task performance improved over time for both groups, maltreated participants used this less to update their control beliefs. Further, whereas both groups responded equally to the task manipulations, only controls leveraged relative positive feedback to reduce task-related stress and increase goal-directed exploration. We conclude that maltreatment blunts the calibration of control beliefs, informing both stress and goal-directed exploration, likely increasing vulnerability to psychopathology.",

Given the rapid evolution of digital systems, including artificial intelligence, surveillance, and data sharing, this study sought to revalidate and update the scale, resulting in the Cyber Paranoia and Fear Scale–Updated (CPFS-U). Method: Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) with university students informed the redevelopment of the scale. Eight new items were added, and several were revised. The CPFS-U was administered to 433 adults, alongside validated measures of paranoia, generalised anxiety, online trust, digital confidence, and activity. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure: (1) AI and Digital Dependence Concerns, (2) Technological Risk Awareness and Distrust, (3) Perceived Data Vulnerability, and (4) Surveillance and Monitoring Paranoia. Correlational analyses showed that overall cyber-paranoia and fear were positively associated with generalised anxiety and trait paranoia. Digital confidence and activity showed limited associations with the updated scale, indicating that emotional and cognitive responses to digital systems may be more influential than digital literacy itself. Discussion: The findings suggest that cyber paranoia is a multidimensional construct distinct from general paranoia, shaped by contemporary technological developments. The CPFS-U provides an updated measure for assessing digital mistrust and fear in modern contexts and may inform future research on technology-related anxiety and clinical interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Misdiagnosis is common in bipolar disorder (BD). Currently used screening tools are brief and cost-effective, but there is a lack of understanding of their reliability over time as well as whether responses are influenced by demographic or clinical factors. Aims: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of two commonly used screening tools as well as their associations with current mood states and other participant characteristics. Methods: 331 adult patients with a diagnosis of BD completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Symptom Checklist-32 (HCL-32) as well as measures of mood online at baseline and three months later. Results: The MDQ was found to have low reliability with poor internal consistency (α= 0.531; α= 0.647 at respective timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.582). The HCL-32 was more reliable with good internal consistency (α= 0.815 at both timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.725). MDQ scores were significantly, positively associated with comorbidities and current symptoms of activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age and years since last hospitalisation. The HCL-32 was also significantly positively correlated with activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age, years since diagnosis and years since last hospitalisation. BD-I patients scored higher than other BD-subtypes. Mood state was the only variable with a significant change over time. Conclusions: The HCL-32 appeared more reliable than the MDQ, although all participants needed to exceed an MDQ threshold at baseline to participate in the study, which may have biased our results.",

          "authors": "Jan Andrews; Olivia Gatto; Andrew LeLacheur; Joshua R de Leeuw",
          "abstract": "Much empirical research over the last thirty years suggests that learning to categorize a set of objects alters the way in which they are perceived or judged, a phenomenon known as learned categorical perception or LCP. LCP has provided key evidence for controversial claims of top-down effects of knowledge on perception and suggested a possible mechanism by which continuous perceptual input is transformed into discrete symbolic representations. LCP may consist of increased cross-category discrimination (\"expansion\"), decreased within-category discrimination (\"compression\"), or both, and some studies fail to show either type of boundary effect. To address these inconsistencies and determine the general robustness of LCP, we conducted separate meta-analyses of expansion and compression on a total of 70 experiments comprising 4,627 participants We found a moderate average effect size for expansion (d = .48) with strong evidence of publication bias, an average effect size of approximately 0 for compression with likely publication bias, and highly significant heterogeneity of effects across experiments for both expansion and compression. Moderator analyses revealed a significant effect of the task used to assess LCP, with same-different judgments tending to produce results consistent with a non-boundary effect of improved discrimination on the category-relevant dimension. However, the sensitivity of the moderator analyses was limited by low statistical power and most of the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies remained unexplained. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of LCP, including suggestions for how future LCP research could be more informative and better support meta-analysis.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a pervasive public health issue with enduring psychosocial consequences. Contemporary, population‑based estimates among young adults and their associations with stress and tobacco behaviors remain undercharacterized.\nMethods: This study employed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data among U.S. adults aged 18–34 (N = 6,252). CSA was measured via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) module and dichotomized (ever vs. never). Primary correlates included self‑reported stress (low/medium/high), cigarette smoking (never, someday, everyday, former), e‑cigarette use (yes/no), and sociodemographics (sex, sexual orientation, transgender identity, race/ethnicity, education, income). Survey‑weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression (survey procedures) estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs.\nResults: In the general population, the unweighted prevalence of CSA was 6.4% (n = 400), while the weighted prevalence was approximately 5.8%. In adjusted model, high stress was associated with a greater odds of reporting CSA (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07–3.48) compared to low stress. Tobacco-related behaviors were also associated with CSA, including daily smoking (aOR = 3.16), former smoking (aOR= 1.99), occasional smoking (aOR =1.82), and e-cigarette use (aOR =1.95). Higher socioeconomic status was found to have a protective effect on CSA. Being a college graduate (aOR = 0.44) and having an annual household income of more than $100,000 (aOR = 0.48) were associated with reduced odds of CSA. Race/ethnicity was not statistically significant after adjustment. \nConclusions: CSA remains common among US young adults and is associated with higher stress, tobacco use, and socioeconomic disadvantage; sexual minority men show elevated odds. Findings underscore the need for trauma‑informed, equity‑centered prevention and integrated behavioral health and tobacco control strategies tailored to young adults and sexual/gender minority populations.\nKeywords: childhood sexual abuse; young adults; stress; e‑cigarettes; tobacco; BRFSS; sexual orientation; health disparities.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the interplay of persons, situations, and behavior (the Personality Triad) is a key task of psychology. However, previous research has largely focused on Western samples. We examined the Personality Triad across cultures with N = 15,221 participants from 61 countries and one geographic region. Participants reported on one situation from their daily lives. We examined (1) situation characteristic–behavioral state, (2) trait–behavioral state, and (3) trait–situation characteristic associations, as well as (4) trait × situation characteristic interactions predicting behavioral states. We focused on six traits (Big Five, Honesty-Humility), seven situation characteristics (Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Sociality), and three self-reported behavioral states (Agency, Enthusiasm, Self-Negativity). Importantly, we included 15 country-level variables (collectivism, self-construal, cultural value orientations, tightness, independent and interdependent happiness, national socioeconomic status) as moderators that might contribute to country differences in the Personality Triad. Bayesian multilevel models showed sizable and expected situation characteristic–behavioral state and trait–behavioral state associations with a high degree of generalization across countries, some cultural differences, and moderator effects contradicting theoretical expectations. For instance, we found weaker situation characteristic effects in collectivistic cultures and stronger trait effects in embedded cultures. Trait–situation characteristic associations were meaningful but smaller, and trait × situation characteristic interactions were small and less often significant (although we observed some expected interactions). We found little evidence for country differences in the latter two relations. We discuss implications and future directions for cross-cultural work on the Personality Triad, including replications and extensions using intensive-longitudinal designs.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness research is commonly divided into two main areas: the study of states of consciousness and the study of contents of consciousness. States of consciousness refer to discrete modes of awareness elicited by normal states of the brain, such as those associated with wakefulness and sleep, and by abnormal factors, including brain lesions, pharmacological agents and other external interventions. Contents of consciousness refer what we are conscious of. In this chapter, we emphasize the dynamic nature of consciousness in terms of both its states and contents. First, we first observe that our life constantly alternates between different conscious and unconscious states, namely, sleep and wakefulness. Then, within each state, we note an inherent dynamism in content, with conscious experience ranging from content-full to content-less. By surveying the variety of conscious experiences across wakefulness and sleep, we highlight the similarities in reported contents across these states. We further discuss how the possibility of having conscious experiences without specific content challenges the idea that being conscious necessarily involves being conscious of something. Finally, by reviewing the literature on the neural correlates of consciousness, we propose a potential convergence in the study of conscious states and contents.",

Skilled players performed the task faster than novices and showed a more proactive VEA: they spent moretime looking at cues related to future passing opportunities while novices looked more at cues related to ball reception. In addition, skilled players made longer scanning movements before receiving the ball, but they did  not perform  significantly  more  head  movements  than  novices. Under  mental  fatigue,  skilled participants preserved their VEA patterns but required longer visual fixations, suggesting a reduced rate of information processing.

          "abstract": "Children’s first words are frequently recorded to be nouns, rather than verbs, but data from some languages (notably some Asian and African languages including Mandarin, Korean and Ngas) and some methodologies (especially spontaneous speech recordings) suggest that verbs can be represented as early as nouns. Variables that potentially impact early verb knowledge include the structure of the language children are learning and whether it is verb production or comprehension that is investigated. \nWe investigated longitudinal data from Kenya of children’s (N=500) vocabulary production and comprehension using Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs). Children’s caregivers completed overlapping inventories designed for younger infants (completed at age 12 months and designed for ages 8-16 months), and for older toddlers, (parallel forms completed at age 18 and 24 months and designed for ages 16-30 months). The inventories were structured to include words acquired at equivalent ages across word classes (e.g. nouns acquired at a median age of 11 months and verbs acquired at the same median age) but the interactions between word classes and children’s age and the modality in which they know the word (comprehension only or production as well) indicate that nouns and verbs do not follow the same trajectory across acquisition. Nouns emerge relatively earlier in production and comprehension while verbs emerge earlier in comprehension and their production increases as children grow older. \nWe conclude that the findings of Goldfield (2000) and of Stolt et al. (2008) are also true for these Bantu languages: that the noun advantage in early words is seen in studies where production is emphasised, and early verb knowledge can be missed if comprehension is not assessed.",

          "abstract": "Surprisingly few intervention approaches have been evaluated for youth negatively impacted by bullying, and only one known study has directly addressed the traumatic nature of these peer experiences. Thus, there is currently little guidance for practitioners working to address the mental health needs of this population in an individual therapy context. The current article presents a case report of an adolescent male with social anxiety and attention problems who had experienced chronic, severe bullying that had resulted in significant posttraumatic stress symptoms. It illustrates the process of implementing an adapted version of the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems (MATCH-ADTC) to address these presenting problems. Results demonstrate the potential utility of a modular cognitive-behavioral approach, as it effectively reduced the patient’s experiences of bullying as well as his symptoms of posttraumatic stress and social anxiety; high levels of treatment satisfaction were also reported by the patient and his caregiver. The current article highlights unique treatment considerations and challenges when providing mental health services for youth negatively impacted by bullying, emphasizing the need to help them develop coping skills and a plan for responding to aggressive peers and then the importance of trauma narration to reduce intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance symptoms and to process inaccurate and unhelpful (i.e., self-blaming) cognitions stemming from these experiences.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research increasingly uses situated measures, requiring intensive longitudinal and within-person methods. Such data are typically examined with multilevel models clustering multiple measurement time points within individuals. The intercorrelation patterns obtained with such multilevel models rely on various homogeneity assumptions that should be, but rarely are, tested before using multilevel modeling and interpreting the results.\nThis study proposes a five-step approach to systematically testing homogeneity assumptions in order to obtain more trustworthy estimates of associations among measures when examining clustered multilevel data.\nTo provide an educational illustration of this five-step approach, 1,028 experience sampling method surveys from 37 students were collected over one semester in one university lecture. Twenty-one items measured motivational components and academic emotions. Multilevel analyses estimated an overall within-person and an overall between-person network of zero-order correlations among motivation and emotion facets. Idiographic within-person networks of the 37 participants revealed substantial heterogeneity in their within-person intercorrelation patterns. Heterogeneity was further indicated by one third of the within-person correlations being bi- or multimodally distributed across individuals. We conclude that heterogeneity in within-person patterns must be examined, otherwise, methods relying on homogeneity assumptions, including multilevel analyses, may fail to describe many if not all individuals’ idiographic correlation patterns. This is crucial for the trustworthiness of measurement and structure models, the generalizability of ESM research, and any research aiming for personalized diagnostics and interventions.",

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

Intimate partner violence (IPV) represents a significant stressor, with high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In a high-adversity South African birth cohort, the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), we prospectively investigated whether maternal exposure to IPV during pregnancy and in the first 2 years was associated with child brain structure at age 2-3 years. \n\n\n\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data was analysed from 171 children (n=70 exposed to prenatal IPV; n=55 to postnatal IPV).

          "abstract": "Circular clothing production and consumption is necessary to mitigate the environmental harms of conventional clothing production. However, traditional recycling methods cannot process the most common form of textile waste into pure components: cotton-polyester blended fabrics. Chemical recycling offers a promising solution for processing these blended fibers, but industrial-scale production of chemical recycling hinges on how consumers view the recycled products. That is, consumer adoption is critical for widespread implementation of textile recycling in the fashion industry. Consumer purchasing decisions are shaped by an array of individual and contextual factors, as well as product attributes. We identified the factors related to willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes through three complementary studies. In Study 1 (N = 50), we qualitatively examined participants’ evaluative reactions to (chemically recycled) clothes using a thought-listing method. In Study 2 (N = 1,009), we used network analysis to quantitatively measure the association between willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes, and the demographic factors, psychological factors, and evaluative reactions identified in Study 1. Consumers who were younger, higher in income, and more concerned about the environment, were willing to pay more for chemically recycled clothes compared to their conventional counterparts. In Study 3, we experimentally manipulated environmental concern. Watching a video highlighting the environmental impact of conventional and chemical clothing led to (a) [greater/equivalent/lower] willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes in a task with real financial consequences, (b) [stronger/equivalent/weaker] preferences for brands that use chemical recycling, and (c) [greater/equivalent/lower] support for policies promoting chemical recycling.

This review provides a modality-wise comparative analysis of neuroimaging tools used in pain research, highlighting the key pipelines, brain region specificity, and clinical relevance. We summarize real-time applications such as neurofeedback using fMRI and EEG, as well as emerging machine learning models applied to fNIRS and multimodal datasets. The review also evaluates software frameworks, including SPM, FSL, CONN, DISCOVER-EEG, and custom deep learning approaches for pain classification and prediction. While fMRI offers superior spatial resolution, EEG and MEG provide millisecond-level temporal precision, and fNIRS is a promising option for bedside monitoring. By synthesizing evidence from 32 peer-reviewed studies, we emphasize the growing role of data integration, automated analysis, and real-time feedback paradigms in shaping the future of pain research and clinical intervention.",

          "abstract": "Engaging adolescents in digital environments is notoriously difficult. A common strategy is message personalization, yet most efforts focus on personalizing what is said rather than how it is expressed. This is a missed opportunity, as youth communication that truly speaks their language requires attention to style as well as content. Digital communication environments enable such stylistic adaptation by revealing users’ expression patterns that can be leveraged for personalization. Yet little is known about how adolescents respond to persuasive messages written in a similar linguistic style, or how such similarity is best operationalized. Addressing these gaps, this preregistered study tests whether adolescents prefer social media health messages that are more similar to their linguistic style and identifies which linguistic categories are most effective in eliciting positive responses. We analyzed donated WhatsApp conversation data from 191 Dutch adolescents (aged 13–15) to calculate individual linguistic profiles and design Instagram-style health messages that varied in linguistic similarity. Participants then evaluated 22 message pairs, each manipulating one linguistic category. Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence that linguistic similarity influenced message preference or personalization, and moderate evidence against effects on perceived effectiveness. However, adolescents consistently preferred messages that were positively valenced and low in complexity, regardless of linguistic similarity. These findings suggest that positive, easy-to-read messages may be an effective strategy for digital youth engagement. Furthermore, we discuss the implications for computer-mediated style matching, including algorithmic approaches, large language models, and future theoretical development.",

          "abstract": "Attachment orientations are theorized to change in response to significant\ninterpersonal life events. However, empirical findings remain mixed. Moreover, the role of\nsubjective event perceptions—though emphasized in personality research—has been largely\nbeen neglected in research on attachment development. In a longitudinal study spanning 7\nwaves over 2.5 years, we examined how romantic relationship transitions—entering or ending\na committed relationship—predict changes in attachment anxiety and avoidance, and whether\nthese effects are moderated by subjective event perceptions. We analyzed data of N = 1,717\nparticipants (69.6% women aged 18-40, M = 26.5 years) who were single (52%) or in a\npartnership (48%) at the beginning of the study. Using multilevel piecewise modeling, we\ndistinguished selection, anticipation, and socialization effects. Avoidant individuals were less\nlikely to enter new relationships (selection effect), and avoidance declined prior to partnering\n(anticipation effect). Both anxiety and avoidance shifted in response to transitions\n(socialization effects): anxiety decreased after partnering and increased after separation, while\navoidance showed a temporary decrease post-separation followed by a gradual increase.\nThese shifts mirrored average differences between partnered and single individuals,\nsuggesting rapid adaptation to new social roles. Subjective perceptions of the events (e.g.,\nvalence, social status decrease, predictability) showed limited moderation effects. Overall,\nfindings underscore the importance of social role transitions in shaping attachment processes,\nwhile suggesting that subjective evaluations may have a more nuanced role than previously\nassumed. These results contribute to personality theory by clarifying the contextual and\nexperiential mechanisms underlying intraindividual change in attachment insecurity.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",

          "abstract": "Understanding variability is a key focus in many areas of psychological research, with growing interest in modeling individual and group variability. While multilevel models such as heterogeneous variance models and Mixed-Effect Location Scale (MELS) models have been used to capture these dynamics, they typically rely on linear assumptions and temporal change of the variability is restricted to one level. Recent calls for nonlinear approaches in psychology highlight the need for more flexible models that can better account for complex, dynamic processes. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) within the framework of heterogeneous variance models to address these limitations. By incorporating GPs, we allow for the modeling of nonlinear variability across multiple levels, including temporal dynamics at both the individual and group levels. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in two empirical applications. Our findings show that using GPs provide an improved model fit compared to traditional linear methods and highlight the utility of GPs in variance modeling, offering new possibilities for studying dynamic and emergent processes in psychological and social science research.",

          "abstract": "This systematic review examines the intersection of bilingualism and dyslexia by analysing 40 studies involving bilingual dyslexic readers (DRs). The goal is to identify dyslexia characteristics that are independent of bilingual experience and determine the appropriate tests for in bilinguals. Findings indicate that rapid naming and reading impairments remain prevalent in bilingual DRs while phonological awareness appears to be more variably impaired in bilinguals. Differences between monolinguals and bilinguals are more present in DRs than typical readers (TRs), suggesting that bilingual experience might play a more substantial role in populations with deficits. Results from predictive studies do not allow for evidence-based recommendations due to their variability. Overall, fndings suggest that some diagnostic tools retain cross-linguistic validity, while others’ prognostic potential may be modulated by bilingual experience. The results highlight the need for comprehensive assessments, considering linguistic profiles. Future research should adopt standardised definitions and tests, larger samples, and collaborative methods to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions can be deeply rewarding, yet they are marked by social uncertainty. The uncertainty arises because we can never truly know another’s mind. As a species, humans find uncertainty aversive and excessive. Intolerance of uncertainty is a risk factor for emotional disorders. One way to resolve uncertainty in novel situations is to rely on memories of past similar experiences, yet this process is largely unexplored in social contexts. A novel social decision-making task showed that individuals recruit both memories and incremental experiences of social rewards to guide decisions under social uncertainty. Further, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed better integration of positive social memories if they also had high levels of autobiographical memory specificity. These findings suggest that successfully recalling past positive social experiences improves navigation of social uncertainty, and may confer preventative advantages for those with high levels of affective disorder symptoms.",

This is challenging for children as the underlying skills required to understand irony may not be fully developed. We investigated how 10-year-olds’ working memory, empathy skills, and gender are related to their processing and comprehension of written irony. Data from two previous eye-tracking experiments with 97 children (46 girls and 51 boys) were analysed. Results showed that children with stronger empathy skills had higher irony comprehension accuracy and were less likely to reread ironic phrases. Higher working memory was linked to faster processing of irony but did not lead to higher comprehension. Conversely, lower working memory was associated with more accurate irony comprehension. Child gender was not related to irony comprehension. These results imply that working memory and emotional perspective-taking are important for children's irony comprehension, aligning with theories that take individual differences into account.",

          "abstract": "The combination of high life satisfaction and frequent experiences of pleasant feelings is\nsometimes called hedonic wellbeing (HWB). We argue that a good life comprises more than\nhedonia and that a taxonomy of wellbeing should also include a eudaimonic dimension\n(EWB). The paper challenges a fundamental premise in research on wellbeing, which states\nthat self-reported life satisfaction provides an unbiased, broad, and reflected evaluation of an\nindividual’s life “as-a-whole.” Countering this assumption, two studies showed that HWB\nindicators differ from indicators of EWB, indicating that HWB does not measure EWB. Using\nsurvey experiments, the paper further demonstrated that, upon reflection, participants\ntypically regard eudaimonic values as more important than hedonic values, proposing that\nliving eudaimonically is important in people’s lives. A third finding showed that gaps\nbetween ideal and actual hedonic values predicted life satisfaction, whereas eudaimonic\nvalues gaps did not. This suggests that life satisfaction is not an unbiased evaluation of all the\nimportant values in a person’s life. Thus, measures of life satisfaction appear invalid (not\nmeasuring what they intend to measure). To get more relevant data on how well people\nconsider their lives to be, both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions should be taken into\naccount.",

We analyzed the factor structure, internal consistency, and three cut-off points: for the general population, men, and women. Group and sex differences were examined. Our AQ version demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency, and a six-factor structure: Social Interests, Theory of Mind, Social Skills, Attention to Detail, Imagination, and Planning. The ASD group scored higher than the TD group on the total score and five subscales. Interactions between group and sex showed that sex differences appeared only within the ASD groups. Cut-off points showed good sensitivity, specificity, and discriminative properties for the Mexican population.

Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas both within and across essays. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation.

Subsequent elaboration of a lower order structure based on the first three broader domains yielded seven additional factors: Fear and Somatoform, Thought Disorder, Suicide, Negative Affectivity, and Narcissism, resulting in a total of 11factors at the most nuanced level. Sequential hierarchical modeling iteratively traced the factor structure from one global psychopathology factor down to the 7-factor level, and subsequently, 11-factor level. Construct validity of the factor structures was evaluated via correlation and regression analyses using scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-3 (MMPI-3). These results yielded broad support for the convergent validity of the HiTOP-SR structure, as the various factors demonstrated meaningful associations with conceptually relevant MMPI-3 scale scores. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the HiTOP-SR as a promising dimensional assessment tool aligned with key aspects of the HiTOP framework, while also highlighting directions for further replication and refinement.",

While glucose increases hormonal stress responses without changing cardiac stress reactivity, less is known about the interaction of glucose and relaxation interventions on cardiac reactivity. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of glucose administration and a standardized massage intervention on psychophysiological relaxation and sustained attention. \nNinety-four participants (age mean = 22.84 years, SD = 2.53 years; 71.28% female) were randomly assigned to consume a drink containing glucose, or pure water before receiving a standardized massage or resting. Directly after the manipulation, they completed the d2 sustained attention test. We repeatedly assessed blood glucose and mood and recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) throughout. Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were used as a measure of parasympathetic activity, and pre-ejection period (PEP) indexed sympathetic activity. \nOur preregistered analyses showed that both relaxation interventions increased PNS activity and decreased arousal. Glucose activated the SNS and prevented SNS withdrawal in response to the massage. However, it did not modulate PNS or affective reactivity to the interventions. While cardiac reactivity was not related to sustained attention, higher blood glucose was linked to higher concentration performance and accuracy in explorative analyses. \nThe results provide further support for the autonomic space model demonstrating independence of SNS and PNS regulation depending on the type of manipulation. They may further our understanding of the links between glucose metabolism and autonomic functioning.",

          "abstract": "Parental rules have been curiously neglected from a conceptual and measurement perspective. The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity in this century. Communicating in a way that raises awareness of the risk climate changes poses while at the same time not inducing negative feelings, like helplessness, is a challenge. On one hand research has shown that emphasizing the severity of climate change is related to higher risk perception, which could lead to more pro-environmental behavior. On the other hand, it could trigger higher helplessness which is associated with lower motivation to act climate friendly. Previous research showed that controllability, leads to lower risk perception and lower learned helplessness. In our research we are investigating the impact of induced controllability of the consequences of climate change on risk perception and learned helplessness. To this end, we conducted two experiments with N = 216 and N = 489 (quota-based sample) participants in Germany. Participants received six climate change scenarios that differed only in induced controllability (high vs low). More specifically, we had four conditions: own control, control by government, hopeless, and a control condition. For both experiments results showed that participants’ risk perception increased after they read the scenarios, independent of the conditions. In Experiment 1 learned helplessness decreased, as expected, for the conditions with high controllability. Surprisingly, for Experiment 2 results showed an overall decrease of  learned helplessness independent of the controllability level. When adding participants’ ratings on the pro-environmental behavior scale (PEBS-C) as a moderator variable, results showed that those who had higher ratings on the PEBS-C scale reported higher levels of helplessness for the scenario with the lowest controllability, compared to the control group. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of including solutions when addressing the negative impacts of climate change.",

          "abstract": "The scientific literature does not automatically correct itself. Unreliable findings may persist for years without correction or retraction. Following prior definitions of zombie articles that are retracted but continue to be cited affirmatively, we add another category of ‘undead’ articles. We define ‘vampire’ articles by two necessary conditions. The first condition is demonstrated irreproducibility, which we operationalize and define with the help of a novel typology of replication efforts. We propose a rule of thumb how many failed efforts at replication might be required for each type of replication effort before the original finding is deemed irreproducible. The second condition for a putative vampire article is that it is cited affirmatively in public policy the scientific literature, or private communications, after the first condition is met. We discuss rules of thumb for how many such affirmative citations might lead qualified researchers in that subfield to address the article of concern within the scientific literature. We surmise that a substantial number of vampire articles exist as our two cases resemble those criticized in a growing literature addressing problematic science and the reproducibility crisis. Our first case concerns aerial gunning of coyotes and the second case predicts over-fishing. We discuss the damaging effects of vampire articles and why the melodramatic metaphor has heuristic value and utility. We also discuss lessons from the communication sciences about how to remedy misinformation, offering recommendations to researchers, publishers and editors, all of whom share an interest in rigorous inquiry and public trust in science.",

Recently, interest has turned towards emotional processing and mental health correlates, including a qualitative account of the mental healthcare experiences of aphantasic people. Still, a systematic presentation of what it is like to live with aphantasia is lacking. We gathered the data of 52 aphantasic adults (mean VVIQ [Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire] score = 16.5, age range = 16 – 81, 14 women, 20 UK residents and 18 USA residents) from a larger sample of 6436 online survey respondents, and thematically analysed their answers to the survey’s open-ended items alongside additional unprompted testimonies provided via email. We identified 4 main themes: (1) Communicating and Understanding the “mind’s eye” in a world of visualisers; (2) The diverse experience of knowing without seeing and search for imagery; (3) The protective &amp; disruptive ways that aphantasia shapes life and thoughts; (4) The search for meaning. The study draws on the voices and experiences of aphantasic people to explore the psychosocial correlates of aphantasia. We describe how the absence of mental imagery is not merely a perceptual variation, but a significant dimension of human difference with implications for clinical practice, education, creativity, and self-understanding.",

Existing evidence suggests that these extreme groups are heterogeneous. After re-examining and largely replicating previously reported differences between people with aphantasia and hyperphantasia in 6436 online respondents, we investigate whether the variable features of aphantasia cluster in distinct subtypes. We conducted a latent class analysis with a subset of 3883 respondents who completed key measures of imagery (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) and self-reported cognitive experiences (sensory imagery, autobiographical memory, face recognition, spatial navigation). 3 subtypes of aphantasia emerge: 1) a ‘global aphantasia’ subtype with extreme sensory features in most to all sensory modalities; 2) an ‘Aphantasia +’ subtype with both sensory and cognitive features in the domains listed above; and 3) a ‘non-global aphantasia’ subtype with milder uni- or multisensory features. Our findings confirm the heterogeneous nature of aphantasia, with subtypes varying alongside 3 dimensions: number (and type) of sensory modalities experiencing low imagery, the intensity of aphantasia in the concerned sensory modalities (total lack of versus poor imagery), and the presence or absence of additional cognitive difficulties outwith sensory imagery. Together, these findings call for a shift in the theoretical and methodological approaches to aphantasia and imagery research.",

          "abstract": "While global challenges demand both equitable and effective altruism, people often prioritize those nearby and overlook the impact of their prosocial actions. Here, we examined what moral values support altruism that is both equitable (helping others impartially regardless of proximity or group membership) and effective (helping impactfully by maximizing welfare gains). We studied two rare populations: effective altruists (EAs; N = 119), defined by their philosophical commitment to impartiality and maximizing impact, and extraordinary altruists (XAs; N = 65), defined by their real-world decision to donate an organ to a stranger—an act of radical impartiality, though not explicitly impact-maximizing. A demographically similar general population sample (N = 176) served as a comparison group. Participants completed moral measures from pluralistic theories (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q)), along with the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS). They also completed assessments of equitable, effective, and combined altruistic orientations. Both altruistic groups showed elevated moral expansiveness (MES) and impartial beneficence \n(OUS) relative to controls. EAs, compared to XAs and controls, more strongly endorsed utilitarian principles (including instrumental harm on the OUS) and deprioritized traditional cooperative values (e.g., reciprocity, deference on the MAC-Q). Familial loyalty (MAC-Q) negatively predicted altruistic orientations across groups. Surprisingly, group loyalty—conceptualized as parochial by pluralistic moral theories—positively predicted equitable and effective altruism across groups, challenging assumptions that parochial values necessarily constrain prosociality. These findings instead suggest inclusive forms of loyalty may help promote altruism that is both equitable and effective.",

          "abstract": "AI-mediated therapy systems simulate empathy, attunement, and conversational responsiveness, producing a sentience halo: the user’s perception of emergent AI awareness. This effect is driven by unopposed mirroring, where the AI reflects users’ language, affect, and cognitive-emotional patterns without challenge, fostering reliance and displacing aspects of self onto the system. Over time, Doppelgänger Drift can destabilize identity and relational scaffolding. Drawing on anecdotal reports, media accounts, and usage metrics, this paper outlines structural risks of AI therapy, including loss of containment, mirages of alliance, and accumulation of ambiguous harm. I also examine legal, medical, and societal considerations, and propose guardrails emphasizing transparency, limits disclosure, and research priorities for monitoring identity-level impacts. This framework offers a conceptual lens for understanding AI-mediated identity risk and aims to inform both clinical practice and policy development.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "The profession of psychology aims to improve societal mental health and well-being. Ironically, psychologists have neglected the study of mental health within the profession. We conducted the first comprehensive assessment of mental health difficulties across psychology disciplines in a sample (N = 1,261) of faculty and graduate students affiliated with U.S. doctoral degree granting institutions. Over 84% of respondents reported a lifetime history of mental health difficulties; 54% reported a lifetime diagnosis; 15% had clinically elevated current depression symptoms; 16% reported clinically elevated current anxiety symptoms; and 51% met Keyes’ “flourishing” criteria. The most common mental health concerns were depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Across all outcomes, graduate students reported significantly greater frequency and severity of difficulties. Clinically elevated current depression and anxiety were 3-4 times higher in graduate students (21% and 22%, respectively) compared to professor-level faculty (6% and 7%, respectively). Rates of flourishing were lower in graduate students than faculty (OR = 2.65, p &lt; .001). Clinical-area respondents (92%) were more likely to report a lifetime mental health difficulty than non-clinical area respondents (83%). Interestingly, while there were no field-level differences in rates of current elevated anxiety, clinical-area respondents had lower rates of clinically elevated depression. Academic psychology is not an exception to the mental health crisis in higher education. Particularly urgent action is needed to improve graduate students’ mental health.

          "abstract": "Background &amp; Aims: Access to specialized healthcare for children with autism spectrum disorder has long been hindered by limited availability of qualified clinicians, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these disparities, overwhelming traditional healthcare models and highlighting the need for innovative solutions. Telehealth emerged as a critical tool during the pandemic, facilitating continued access to care, particularly for underserved populations. We aimed to investigate the extent to which functional language deficits can be identified and assessed in children with autism, and ruled out in neurotypical children, via telehealth. \nMethods: This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of using telehealth for assessing verbal behavior deficits in children diagnosed with autism, comparing them to neurotypical peers, and exploring the potential for telehealth to expand access to specialized intervention. Twelve children, seven of whom had an autism diagnosis, participated in telehealth-based functional analyses of verbal behavior. \nResults: Results indicated that children with autism exhibited statistically significant differences in across functional language domains, whereas no such differences were identified in neurotypical peers. No false positives or false negatives were detected. At follow-up, participants with autism showed statistically significant improvements in verbal language skills. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that telehealth is a reliable and valid method for assessing the verbal behavior of children with autism. This research supports the use of telehealth to bridge healthcare gaps for families in remote or underserved areas. By providing an accessible platform for functional language assessment, telehealth offers a promising avenue for enhancing early intervention and improving long-term outcomes. \nImplications: Our findings highlight the importance of individualized interventions to address verbal behavior deficits of children with autism. Future research is necessary to explore the scalability of these findings and their application in broader, more diverse populations.",

Using data from n = 368 international multilingual adult language learners, a structural equation modelling approach tested both direct and indirect effects of International Posture on WTC and SPCC through FLE and FLCA. Results indicated that International Posture positively predicted FLE, WTC, and SPCC, while negatively predicting FLCA. Furthermore, both FLE and FLCA partially mediated the effects of International Posture on WTC, and FLCA also mediated the relationship between International Posture and SPCC. These findings highlight the importance of learners’ global orientations and affective experiences in shaping communicative behaviour.

Furthermore, we replicated a previous finding that increased visual perceptual load in a scene reduces eyewitness recall accuracy, but observed this effect in the Laboratory group only. In Study 2, we added a General Online group to test whether these differences extended to all online data collection, or if they were specific to Prolific participants. Misinformation susceptibility in the General Online group was similar to the Laboratory group, and significantly lower than that in the Prolific group. However, perceptual load effects were also absent in the General Online group. Ultimately, these findings indicate that different data collection contexts yield varying results in eyewitness misinformation studies.

Proliferating ToCs accumulate anomalies without progress, operating orthogonally. The principle of recurrency – functional and architectural – offers a unifying, mechanistic scaffold for consciousness to arise. We show that all theories tacitly invoke feedback loops and can be re-expressed along a single axis of recursion. Four nested levels, viz., cellular, local inter-areal, global, and lateral, map onto state, phenomenal content, manipulative access, and experiential similarity, respectively, thus tying evolved anatomy to phenomenon. The traditional phenomenal-versus-access stand-off dissolves into a graded cascade wherein deeper recursion expands the set of reportable, behaviour-driving variables. Recurrence is favoured evolutionarily, and ontologically, rebutting feed-forward, “unfolding” objections, while brain-body loops ground selfhood, and complete action loops with the environment. Furthermore, clinically, targeting recurrent pathways promise new biomarkers, and alleviation, in disorders of consciousness (DoCs).

Although \ndeficits in emotion recognition are well-documented in dementia, they have received less \nattention in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Due to the overlap in neural processes supporting \nemotion and cognition, early disruptions in emotion recognition may indicate broader functional \ndecline. This study examined behavioral and neural responses to emotional faces in patients with \nMCI using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. For that aim, N=60 \nparticipants were recruited, including 30 patients with MCI and 30 healthy controls. During fMRI, \nparticipants completed a facial emotion recognition task with expressions of anger, fear, sadness, \nhappiness, and neutral faces. Behavioral assessments further included measures of cognitive \ndomains (attention, memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial skills), face \nprocessing, emotional intelligence, and emotional interference. Patients with MCI showed \nimpaired recognition of negative emotions, such as anger (β=–0.37, p&lt;0.05), fear (β=–0.37, \np&lt;0.05), and sadness (β=–0.85, p&lt;0.001), whereas recognition of happiness remained intact. \nSadness recognition was predicted by face processing ability, and overall emotion recognition was \nassociated with memory performance. fMRI results showed widespread, emotion-specific \nactivation in healthy controls, particularly in occipital, frontal, and subcortical regions. Patients \nwith MCI showed reduced activation and less differentiated patterns, though group-level BOLD \ndifferences were not statistically significant. In summary, patients with MCI demonstrated \ndifficulties in recognizing negative emotions, which may impact social functioning, while neural \nmechanisms supporting emotion recognition appear largely preserved at this stage of cognitive \ndecline.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has implicated the implicit learning of statistical regularities as a potential factor contributing to reading deficits in individuals with dyslexia. These deficits are characterized by weaker neural adaptation compared to typically developing readers, suggesting impaired general processing in forming short-term representations of stimulus consistency. In addition, inconsistent findings have been observed regarding amplitude differences in mismatch negativity (MMN) between individuals with and without dyslexia. Although neural adaptation is believed to contribute to MMN, these two processes have been examined in separate bodies of literature, leaving their relationship in children with and without dyslexia unclear. To address this issue, 42 children with Chinese dyslexia and 26 children without dyslexia participated in an EEG roving paradigm experiment with continuous pure-tone stimuli. Importantly, the stimuli were carefully arranged to minimize expectations and isolate pure adaptation effects. The initial adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the deviants and the 2nd tones) and subsequent adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the 2nd tones and the final tones) effects, including P1a, P1b, and N250, as well as the amplitudes of MMN and late MMN, were extracted. We found that both groups exhibited similar adaptation effects, MMN, and late MMN, supported by minimal evidence for differences in our Bayesian analyses. The relationship between adaptation and MMN was also comparable between the groups. Potential reasons for discrepancies between this study and previous research, including experimental design and language differences, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in the field of science of learning is to ensure that findings are adopted by policy makers and practitioners and translated into the classroom. To address the question of why challenges persist, five heads of research labs involved in the science of learning from three different countries (the United Kingdom, France, and Chile) conducted a workshop to discuss challenges for the science of learning field. Thematic analysis was conducted on presentation slides and discussion notes, and the themes were organised around an adapted five-dimensional gaps framework by Miles (2017) to produce a gap analysis. Current gaps were identified in relation to: 1) existing theory and knowledge; 2) the research-practice divide; 3) research methodologies; 4) empirical testing and evidence verification; and 5) research with specific populations. Examples from work across the labs were used to represent international perspectives on challenges and evidence possible solutions. Some of the key takeaways and strategies for surmounting these gaps included the need for funding to research lesser-studied areas and populations, to replicate or repeat intervention evaluations, and to establish meaningful co-produced research partnerships between educators and research institutions.",

Although existing literature has examined autistic people’s views on camouflaging, it rarely explores these perspectives through natural conversations outside of research settings. To address this gap, we analyzed autistic people’s perception of camouflaging based on online discussions between autistic people.\nMethodology\nThis study examined 194 posts from 68 users on a UK-based autism forum, employing inductive thematic analysis to identify key aspects of camouflaging.\nFindings\nThe analysis revealed a predominantly negative view of camouflaging, with most users employing it primarily for social integration, especially in work settings. The most reported consequence was exhaustion. Not camouflaging leads to improved mental health, but also potentially to rejection.\nOriginality\nOur findings strengthen existing knowledge about camouflaging by adding new analysis conducted directly on conversations happening organically. Future research should collect more data from natural conversations to validate these results and consider diverse sources of autistic individuals' perspectives.\nKeywords: social camouflaging, masking, autism spectrum disorder, web forum, perception",

          "abstract": "Encountering a homonym in a sentential context that biases interpretation towards its subordinate meaning makes that meaning easier to access later. This word-meaning priming effect is not restricted to homonyms and may be supported by general episodic memory processes. Such an account predicts that word-meaning priming may be affected by factors that affect episodic learning (e.g., predictability). Specifically, the contextual predictability of an incoming stimulus has been shown to affect episodic memory in that both highly expected as well as highly unexpected input leads to better memory for that input, via two different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We hypothesised that if word-meaning priming is supported by episodic memory processes, both highly expected as well as highly unexpected target words should lead to stronger word-meaning priming effects than target words of intermediate predictability. Four pre-registered online experiments tested whether contextual predictability affects word-meaning priming and incidental memory for language. We exposed participants to sentences that emphasised a particular aspect of a sentence-final target word’s meaning. Importantly, target words differed in how predictable they were based on the sentence context (e.g., “You can get in a good workout by riding a bicycle” vs. “You can get in a good workout by lifting a bicycle”). Associate production and semantic relatedness judgement assessed the strength of word-meaning priming. Contrary to our hypotheses, while there was evidence for priming across experiments, we found no significant effects of contextual predictability in any experiments. Our findings suggest that predictability-guided updating is rarely triggered during language comprehension, and we outline the theoretical implications of these results for the architecture of the language system.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAttachment style is widely recognised as influential in shaping responses to bereavement and prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Although theorised extensively, empirical clarity regarding how attachment styles specifically impact PGD symptoms and therapeutic implications remains limited. This study aimed to identify cognitive-behavioural mechanisms linking attachment styles to PGD symptoms.\nMethods\nData were collected from a community sample of 695 bereaved adults. Network analysis explored interactions between attachment styles (anxious and avoidant) and various cognitive-behavioural factors associated with PGD, including appraisals, memory characteristics, maladaptive coping strategies, and social disconnection.\nResults\nThe findings reveal attachment styles as peripheral within the network, suggesting that their direct influence on PGD symptoms may be less central than previously theorised. However, anxious attachment correlated positively with injustice rumination and altered social self, while avoidant attachment was positively associated with perceived loss of future and relationships and preferences for solitude, and negatively associated with proximity-seeking behaviours and fear of losing connection to the deceased. Cognitive-behavioural factors, particularly memory characteristics and social disconnection, held central positions within the network, mediating relationships between attachment styles and PGD.\nConclusions\nAttachment styles indirectly influence PGD through cognitive-behavioural pathways rather than exerting strong direct effects. By bridging the gap between attachment theory and cognitive-behavioural approaches to grief, this study offers a more nuanced understanding of its relationship with PGD, and points towards potential new avenues for future interventions aimed at addressing attachment-related challenges in bereaved individuals.",

          "abstract": "Representational gestures have been shown to be beneficial for speech comprehension especially in adverse listening conditions, as they provide meaningful information related to speech. However, it is still unclear whether seeing representational gestures directs additional attention towards the speech signal. \nIn the current study, we addressed this research question by investigating neural tracking of speech in the presence of representational gestures during unscripted dialogue with and without background noise. Dyads performed a tangram-based referential communication task, while audio-visual behavior and dual-EEG were recorded.  \nRepresentational gestures increased neural tracking of speech in both delta and theta frequencies and in both dialogue conditions in comparison to control movements. This finding suggests that seeing representational gestures directs attention to the processing of both acoustic and linguistic information of the speech signal. As no differences in neural tracking of speech were observed between dialogue conditions, we believe that dyads made use of different strategies to overcome the noise interference. In sum, we argue that neural tracking of speech represents a flexible mechanism which can be modulated by attentional processes to meet different cognitive and communicative demands during face-to-face interaction.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

          "abstract": "Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. Time is among the most fundamental resources to which people tend to be acutely sensitive across contexts. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",

          "authors": "Mauricio Martins; Dan Cook; Arno Villringer",
          "abstract": "The capacity to represent recursive hierarchical embedding (RHE) is considered a hallmark of human cognition. Yet, it remains debated whether non-linguistic recursion depends on language-specific, domain-general, or independent visuospatial mechanisms. In two experiments, we tested this question using a dual-task paradigm. Participants performed either a visual recursion task (REC) or a matched visual iteration task (ITE) while concurrently engaging in lexical retrieval (LEX), serial arithmetic (MATH), visual delayed match-to-sample (VIS), or no interference (NONE). Both LEX and MATH—tasks that require serial, symbolic, generative processing—reliably reduced accuracy in REC and ITE, with interference being stronger for ITE. Drift diffusion modeling confirmed that LEX and MATH slowed evidence accumulation and reduced decision thresholds, indicating less efficient and more impulsive responding. Interestingly, while LEX and MATH lengthened response times in ITE, they shortened them in REC, suggesting compensatory processing strategies. By contrast, VIS did not impair accuracy; instead, it increased drift and boundary separation, consistent with more cautious evidence accumulation. Cognitive covariates further revealed that verbal working memory predicted REC more strongly than ITE under baseline conditions; however, this advantage did not account for the greater interference observed in ITE. Taken together, these findings suggest that visual hierarchical processing involves serial symbolic resources, but recursion is more resilient than iteration, possibly due to the availability of parallel or configural strategies. This supports a hybrid architecture in which linguistic-like symbolic operations contribute to building visual hierarchies, but alternative mechanisms can buffer recursion when these resources are taxed.",

Participants (81 female, 155 male), aged 16–74 years, had sustained physical, psychological, or other injuries leading to compensation claims. The mean reading score was 51.3 (SD = 11.1), reflecting moderate word reading ability. Higher performance was observed among females, individuals with more years of schooling, and those from English-speaking backgrounds. Reading achievement was positively correlated with measures of cognitive capacity, including processing speed and general knowledge. Importantly, claimants who returned to work demonstrated significantly stronger word reading than those who remained unemployed.

          "authors": "Hongyang Liu",
          "abstract": "Dual-process theories posit that fast, intuitive System 1 often produces bias, whereas slow, deliberative System 2 corrects it. This manuscript challenges that traditional view by synthesizing theory and evidence on motivated System-2 reasoning (MS2R)—the tendency for deliberation to be co-opted in defense of identity-relevant beliefs. Across domains (e.g., climate risk, vaccines, gun policy), polarization has been shown to increase with subject-matter knowledge or numeracy when issues implicate social identity, whereas the same abilities improve accuracy for identity-neutral problems. Six complementary mechanisms are reviewed to explain these effects: (a) confirmation bias and motivated skepticism; (b) identity-protective cognition; (c) belief as value-signaling (expressive utility); (d) cognitive dissonance and conflict rationalization; (e) the argumentative theory of reasoning; and (f) bounded/resource-rational approaches (e.g., BIASR) that yield selective trust as an efficient but polarizing heuristic. Boundary conditions and critiques are then considered. High-powered replications indicate a robust directional motivated-reasoning main effect but limited evidence that higher ability amplifies bias uniformly; design features (ambiguity, incentives, audience visibility) and affect-first gating appear pivotal. Identity-congruent responding is further reinterpreted as instrumentally rational signaling under reputational and career incentives, especially for elites. Finally, actionable countermeasures are proposed: accuracy prompts and incentives, self-affirmation and identity-safe framing, symmetric-scrutiny protocols (e.g., steel-manning), probabilistic forecasting with feedback, clarity-enhancing data displays and preregistered criteria, and prebunking. Research prospects include sharper operationalization separating ability, disposition, and state engagement; process-tracing and psychophysiological markers to adjudicate mechanisms; and preregistered, multi-lab designs that vary ambiguity, incentives, and audience. Educational applications emphasize embedding accuracy nudges, forecasting tournaments, and structured adversarial collaboration to realign System 2 from identity performance toward error detection.",

To date, these side effects have primarily been assessed through self-report measures, limiting insight into the underlying mechanisms. This study aims to investigate behavioral and emotional responses to varying levels of social provocation and the associated neural processes in epilepsy patients, using a modified version of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) during functional MRI (fMRI).\nMethods: We included 38 epilepsy patients and 38 healthy controls with no significant difference in age or gender. All participants completed the modified TAP during fMRI scanning, consisting of three blocks with low, medium, and high provocation level defined by the amount of monetary punishment selected by a fictitious opponent. After each block, participants rated their emotional states and fairness perception. Additionally, they completed standardized psychological questionnaires assessing trait aggression (BPAQ), depressive symptoms (BDI), and impulsivity (BIS). \nResults: Despite higher self-reported trait aggression in patients, no significant group differences were observed in behavioral aggression. Compared to healthy controls, patients exhibited increased neural activity in regions associated with emotional regulation and cognitive control (e.g. Superior Parietal Lobule, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Superior Frontal Gyrus) in response to low provocation. However, they demonstrated diminished sensitivity to escalating provocation at both neural and emotional levels.\nSignificance: The findings emphasize the need for a broader perspective that addresses the internal burden of emotional regulation and the associated neural mechanisms when being provoked, not just overt behavior. We highlight the importance of minor provocations in distinguishing patients from healthy control. Although no clear mechanism for a specific type of medication could be identified, the results indicate a potential impact of antiseizure medications. \n\nKeywords: fMRI; taylor aggression paradigm; provocation; depression; antiseizure medication; adverse effects",

Chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and cancer require continuous adjustment to medical and lifestyle demands, often resulting in psychological strain. Research consistently shows elevated rates of depression and anxiety among individuals with chronic illness compared to the general population. Key mediators of this connection include stress, sleep quality, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and access to healthcare. In rural communities, these challenges are intensified by limited health infrastructure, geographic isolation, financial constraints, and stigma surrounding mental health. This paper emphasizes the need for integrated care models that address both physical and psychological aspects of chronic illness. Expanding early intervention, reducing stigma, and improving access to mental health services in underserved populations are essential steps toward enhancing quality of life for individuals with chronic illness.",

While men reported greater habitual suppression than women on trait questionnaires, no such gender difference emerged in momentary reports of suppression in everyday contexts. Additionally, there were no gender differences in the types of emotion suppressed (overall negative emotion, anger, and sadness).

          "abstract": "Absence from school has wide-ranging and enduring negative consequences for individuals and society. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been a pervasive concern and key educational research priority in many countries around the world. Using data from the #BeeWell survey and linked administrative records for N=28,293 pupils aged 12-16 attending 71 secondary schools in Hampshire and Southampton (England) during the 2023/24 academic year, we conducted Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct longitudinal patterns of attendance and estimate key predictors of latent class membership. Analysis revealed four distinct patterns of attendance: Consistently High (91.8%); Declining (3.8%); Rising (2.3%); and Persistently Low (2.1%). Consistent with bioecological systems theory, we found that socioeconomic deprivation, poorer mental and physical health, weaker school belonging, and increased exposure to peer and academic pressures significantly increased the likelihood of following sub-optimal attendance trajectories (relative to the Consistently High attendance class). Likewise, those with Special Educational Needs (SEN; compared to those without SEN) and White British pupils (compared to their peers from minoritised ethnic groups) were more likely to follow sub-optimal trajectories. Findings reveal heterogeneity in post-pandemic attendance patterns with implications for multi-tiered interventions. Universal approaches should foster a strong sense of school belonging, while early warning systems should integrate psychosocial indicators such as school pressure, internalising symptoms and exposure to bullying. Identification of a Rising trajectory suggests potential for positive change through targeted support and underscores the importance of implementing effective educational psychology interventions to reverse long-lasting impact of COVID-19 on secondary school attendance.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to profoundly reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Using large-scale survey data (N = 37,097; 38 European countries), we find that the public predominantly views AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for a large set of technology-related, political, and socio-demographic factors, we further find that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Drawing on nationally representative, preregistered experimental data (N = 400; United States), we provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democratic institutions and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may erode democratic legitimacy and discourage public involvement in shaping the future of AI.",

Visual processing, particularly the ability to gather and use visual information quickly and accurately, is critical for performance in high-speed sports. We hypothesised that visual behaviour, including the duration of the final fixation (Quiet Eye; QE), the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations, significantly impacts fencing performance during offensive and defensive actions. National-level sabre fencers performed a ten-minute assault with eye-tracking technology measuring their gaze behaviour. Results indicated that QE was significantly longer before successful touches compared to unsuccessful ones (t(9) = 2.61, p =.014, dz = 0.83). Additionally, the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations were higher during defensive actions than offensive actions (all ts(9) &gt; 4.34, ps ≤ .001, dzs&gt; 1.37). This research provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying sports performance in a realistic context and has implications for training strategies, emphasising the importance of various visual behaviour patterns in fencing.",

This makes vegetarians a relevant group for studying the cognitive mechanisms underlying pro-environmental decision-making. In this study, vegetarians and non-vegetarians completed a decision-making task involving real trade-offs between financial rewards and carbon emissions, with information acquisition tracked using MouselabWEB. We found that vegetarians exhibited a greater propensity to select the pro-environmental option in the task than non-vegetarians. This group difference was particularly found when decisions entailed high personal costs, low environmental benefits, or uncertain outcomes. Process-tracing data further revealed that vegetarians consistently prioritized environmental information from the outset and throughout the decision process. This attentional focus significantly predicted pro-environmental choices. Overall, the findings suggest that vegetarians may rely on a principled decision-making style that transcends cost–benefit considerations, offering new insights into the cognitive basis of pro-environmental engagement.",

          "abstract": "Enhancement and suppression have traditionally been described as a shared process; enhancing relevant information subsequently suppresses irrelevant information, but there may also exist separable mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear, however, whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects (Experiment 2) for target location. Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (“singleton-search mode”) by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures did not covary. Experiments 4 and 5 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the persistent myth that publication bias contaminates (indeed, possibly inflates) the scientific evidence for parapsychological phenomena, specifically extrasensory perception (ESP). We analyzed 165 published studies (243 experiments) from recent ESP meta-analyses and 40 preregistered confirmatory experiments from the Koestler Parapsychology Unit Registry. We compared these two datasets to datasets from the field of mainstream psychology. Our primary measure was the percentage of experiments reporting statistically significant positive outcomes (p &lt; .05, one-tailed). Results indicate that the rate of positive outcomes in ESP research is considerably lower than that observed in psychology, for both non-preregistered and preregistered experiments. While the bias is substantially smaller, suggesting more balanced reporting of parapsychological outcomes compared to mainstream psychological research, we cannot conclusively show that the statistical evidence for ESP is not an artifact of that relatively minimal bias, but several earlier tests on the file-drawer problem do undermine that assumption.",

Schema Therapy offers a related framework, proposing that the state expression of early maladaptive schemas—dysfunctional emotional and cognitive patterns formed in response to adverse experiences— are represented by schema modes.  These modes represent distinct parts of the self, such as vulnerable child parts, coping parts, critical parent parts, and healthy adult parts, which influence moment-to-moment experiences. This exploratory qualitative study investigated whether the content of voices experienced by voice-hearers maps onto schema modes as described in Schema Therapy. Method: Seven participants took part in semi-structured interviews exploring the characteristics and content of their voices. Interview transcripts were coded according to established schema mode definitions and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Results: Results indicated that most participants described voices that could be classified within the schema mode framework, with dysfunctional parent modes being the most frequently identified. Conclusions: These findings offer preliminary support for using Schema Therapy concepts to better understand and potentially treat distressing voices, suggesting value in further exploring this approach in clinical settings.",

This study introduces the concept of \"Thoughts on Eating\" (ToE) as a foundational framework for understanding individual eating attitudes and behaviors. ToE captures diverse perspectives on food and eating, ranging from health maintenance to emotional and social dimensions.\nIn this study, we developed and validated the Thoughts on Eating Scale (ToES), a 20-item scale with seven factors: “enriching one’s heart”, “encouraging social communication”, “realizing oneself”, “sustaining oneself”, ”respecting food”, “indifference to eating”, and “disliking eating.” Then, we confirmed its reliability and validity, including concurrent validity with Expanded Mindful Eating Scale (EMES) and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and reasonable results were obtained. Moreover, we investigated the associations of ToES with sociodemographis and eating behaviors, and some meaningful and understandable relationships were observed.\nThe ToES also revealed meaningful associations between individual traits, eating attitudes, and behaviors, offering insights into both everyday eating patterns and disordered eating tendencies. This ToE framework along with a robust tool provides for examining the psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of eating, paving the way for future research and interventions to address diverse eating behaviors in modern society.",

DSHM is a class of memory models used to model human performance in game play, memory tasks, and language learning. The ability to detect and predict patterns is an integral part of memory models and an important part of decision making. However, decision making also requires the ability to evaluate states as more or less desirous in order to motivate the decisions. We apply a DSHM model to the decision-making task of Walsh and Anderson (2011). By initializing memory to a state of optimism and by making the model sensitive to dependencies between non-consecutive events, we find that the model is able to learn the task at a rate similar to humans.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health and psychiatry is transforming the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). While the initial and promising applications span diagnostic screening and theraputic chatbots, \nthese first-wave technologies do not directly target the underlying brain alterations or account for the treatment of MDD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) holds a tremendous promise to address the biological heterogeneity of MDD, but is currently hindered by highly variable outcomes. Therefore, we posit that synergistic integration of AI with NIBS represents the most promising path to address these difficulties. Importantly, the frontier for AI in depression treatment lies in a paradigm shift: from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven, personalized precision interventions.  We argue for a paradigm shift away from AI roles in mental health (e.g., chatbots, diagnostics) toward its deep integration as the core engine for personalized, circuit-based neuromodulation. We highlight the key opportunities this fusion creates: identifying patient-specific neural targets through predictive modeling, developing adaptive closed-loop therapies that respond to real-time brain states, and brain \"digital twins\" for in silico simulation and protocol optimization. While significant challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical validation remain, the fusion of AI and NIBS heralds an era of psychiatry that is predictive, personalized, and precise.",

          "abstract": "Across cultures and development, humans can extract proportional quantities from nonsymbolic, visual displays. Two competing accounts have been proposed for the contributions of these nonsymbolic skills to fraction understanding. The shared-magnitude account suggests that a cognitive system responsible for these nonsymbolic skills is foundational for symbolic fraction learning, predicting that neural patterns of fraction skills resemble magnitude-driven neural responses to continuous depictions, like unsegmented bars, that emphasize proportional magnitude. However, other depictions of proportions, like discretized, segmented bars, convey both proportional and whole-number information. The shared-interference account proposes that the interference from whole-number information in discretized proportions and symbolic fractions drives the link between these skills and predicts that neural responses to fraction magnitudes would strongly relate to overall activity to discretized depictions, particularly those with misleading whole-number information. We leveraged representational similarity analyses (RSA) to test these predictions. Nineteen young adults (mean age=23.26 years) compared proportions depicted in continuous, discretized, and symbolic formats. Univariate results indicated robust neural distance effects in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions across formats. Region of interest (ROI) analyses of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) revealed neural rational distance effects for continuous proportions, whereas for discretized and symbolic fractions, only comparisons with whole-number interference exhibited a rational magnitude signal. Critically, RSA demonstrated that the IPS fraction magnitude-related activity showed greater similarity with discretized brain responses than continuous ones, but only in the context of misleading whole-number information. Together, these findings support a combination of the two accounts and suggest that symbolic fraction proficiency, as well as adept discretized proportional reasoning, involves accessing proportional magnitude code despite the presence of misleading whole-number information.",

Successful encoding requires the structure of the data to be orthogonal to the structure of the Latin squares.

The complexity and intelligence of human behavior can be attributed, in part, to our ability to utilize vast knowledge acquired over a lifetime of experience with our environment. Thus models of memory, particularly models that can scale up to lifetime learning, are critical to modeling human intelligence. DHSM is based on the BEAGLE model of language acquisition (Jones and Mewhort, 2007) and extends this type of model to general memory phenomena. We demonstrate that DHSM can model a wide variety of human memory effects. Specifically, we model the fan effect, the problem size effect (from math cognition), dynamic game playing (detecting sequential dependencies from memories of past moves), and time delay learning (using an instance based approach). This work suggests that DSHM is suitable as a basis for learning both over the short-term and over the lifetime of the agent, and as a basis for both procedural and declarative memory. We argue that cognition needs to be understood at both the symbolic and sub-symbolic levels, and demonstrate that DSHM intrinsically operates at both of these levels of description. In order to situate DSHM in a familiar context, we discuss the relationship between DHSM and ACT-R.",

We prove that MINERVA 2, a separate storage model of long-term memory, is mathematically equivalent to composite storage memory implemented as a fourth order tensor, and approximately equivalent to a fourth-order tensor compressed into a holographic vector. Building of these demonstrations, we show that MINERVA 2 and related separate storage models can be implemented in neurons.

Unlike traditional marginal DIF methods, which often fail to capture the effects of intersecting identities and require large samples, InterDIFNet models uniform and non-uniform DIF across multiple intersectional groups simultaneously. The method utilizes an optimized thresholding procedure to balance power and Type I error control. A Monte Carlo simulation compared InterDIFNet to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) test and other intersectional DIF methods across varying sample sizes, numbers of groups, and DIF prevalence rates. Results show that when trained using TLP features, InterDIFNet consistently achieved higher power than TLP while maintaining comparable Type I error control, particularly in scenarios with three or more intersectional groups. An empirical application to real assessment data further demonstrated the method’s practical utility. InterDIFNet provides a scalable, data-driven solution for identifying intersectional DIF across multiple small sample groups.",

          "abstract": "Semantic priming in lexical decision tasks has long provided evidence for automatic spreading activation, yet questions remain about how robust these effects are across different research contexts. The present study compared priming outcomes for undergraduates tested in the laboratory and participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk in the early 2010s, using a Qualtrics-based lexical decision task. Reaction times (RTs) were trimmed at ±3 SD within participants, and accuracy was calculated as the proportion correct. A mixed-design ANOVA revealed the expected main effect of prime type, with both groups showing the classic hierarchy of associated &lt; unassociated &lt; nonword stimuli. Within each setting, planned comparisons confirmed a full three-level gradient, underscoring the robustness of semantic priming even when measured online with tools not optimized for RT accuracy. A small but reliable interaction indicated that the overall priming span (nonword − associated difference) was larger for lab participants (M = 0.25 s) than online participants (M = 0.17 s), Hedges’ g = 0.50. Contrary to predictions, accuracy was significantly higher for online participants (M = .93) than lab participants (M = .89), g = −0.76. Perceptions of being observed did not differ between settings. Although the study was not preregistered, all data, materials, and analysis scripts are openly shared. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that semantic priming replicates robustly across both laboratory and early online contexts, highlight a modest laboratory advantage in effect magnitude, and illustrate how basic cognitive phenomena can withstand technically imperfect measurement conditions.",

          "authors": "Aaron T. Brah; Montana K. Lara; Suzanne H Mitchell",
          "abstract": "Most cigarette smokers say that they want to quit, but few attempts at smoking cessation are successful. To examine factors predicting the ability to quit, researchers have examined various behaviors. Heightened delay discounting, preference for smaller, sooner rewards over larger, later rewards, has been associated with a heightened probability of relapse. The current study examined whether this extended to short-term laboratory-based smoking lapse protocols, and whether probability discounting (preference for smaller, certain rewards over larger, uncertain rewards) showed similar effects. Participants were 32 adult smokers contemplating cessation, who attended two experimental sessions. Tasks required participants to choose between money available now and either $25 available later (0-365 days) or with less certainty (0-100%). Participants were then given a 2-hour window when they could either smoke or receive progressively more money over time. Time before smoking was recorded as their “lapse time”. Steeper delay discounting predicted shorter lapse times, while probability discounting was unrelated. These data suggest that delay discounting may be related to the inability to maintain abstinence over short time periods not just days and weeks during smoking cessation, thereby contributing to heightened smoking associated with heightened delay discounting. They also support the independence of probability discounting from substance use phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "Disruptive behavior in classrooms is a risk factor for students’ learning and well-being as well as for teachers’ well-being and stress. This study examined the effect of a classroom management intervention on students’ and teachers’ perceptions of the classroom behavioral climate in 85 classrooms from Grades 3–4 (1,442 students, 88 teachers) over a 12-week study period. Additionally, we investigated whether the 5-week intervention had secondary effects on students’ and teachers’ self-efficacy and well-being. Both students and teachers reported improvements in students’ concentration on learning and a decrease in classroom disruptions from the baseline to the intervention and post-intervention period. Moreover, positive changes were observed in both students' and teachers' self-efficacy as well as in students’ school-related well-being. The findings indicate that brief in-service teacher training on classroom management can enhance classroom climate and promote well-being in schools, underscoring the need to integrate such training into teacher education programs.",

Participants completed the MSCS, along with the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and Internet Addiction Test (IAT). The higher-order model, and scale reliability were examined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and McDonald's omega. Concorrent, convergent and divergent validity of MSCS scores were also assessed. The findings supported the higher-order structure in the Brazilian version, demonstrating high reliability ranging from .72 (Emotional Control) to .85 (Goals). As expected, MSCS scores were negatively correlated with common mental disorders, impulsive behaviors, and internet addiction tendencies. These results indicate that the MSCS is a psychometrically sound measure, contributing to cross-cultural research on the multidimensional nature of self-control.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have studied the personal antecedents and outcomes of the psychological state of intense immersion in an activity, known as ‘flow’. However, the role of personal values has largely been excluded from this research thus far. In this study, we tested the bi-directional nature of the relationship between frequency of flow experiences and the strength of four domains of personal values as outlined in Schwartz’s (1992) influential model: openness, conservation, self-transcendent, and self-enhancement. A nationally representative sample of UK adults completed measures of their personal values and flow experiences at three time-points over a six-month period (T1 N = 2049, T2 N = 888, T3 N = 510). Analysis using a Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) allowed for the separation of between and within-subject effects, with our hypotheses focused on the latter to infer directionality. Results revealed that none of the value domains were predictors of the frequency of flow experiences. Increases in the frequency of flow experiences were linked to subsequent increases in the strength of self-transcendent values, but none of the other three value domains were impacted by flow experiences. The findings have implications for how we think about encouraging flow and extend understandings of flow’s outcomes to include increased care for other people and the environment.",

          "abstract": "Youths differ substantially in how they emotionally respond to daily experiences. Repeated episodes of heightened negative affect in daily life may accumulate over time and increase vulnerability for developing depressive disorders. This study examined whether individual differences in negative affective reactivity to digital experiences (i.e., social media use and upward social comparisons) predict changes in depressive symptoms over time. Using a 14-day diary design with 200 young adolescents (103 female; ages 10–14), we assessed daily social media use, daily upward social comparisons, daily negative affect, and depressive symptoms at pre- and posttest. We employed multilevel structural equation modeling, estimating the within-person coupling between daily social media use (Model 1) or daily upward social comparisons (Model 2) and negative affect and tested whether between-person differences in the strength of this coupling predicted average negative affect and depressive symptom change. Findings revealed that a stronger within-person coupling between upward social comparisons and negative affect, but not between social media use and negative affect, was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms via elevated negative affect across the study. These results highlight the importance of capturing dynamic affective responses to specific social media-related experiences when assessing psychological risk in early adolescence.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive processing models, hallucinations can arise from over-weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory input. Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception. This may contribute to the misattribution of self-generated content as external, suggesting an additional element of predictive processing theories of hallucinations.",

          "abstract": "Recent decision making models have explained behaviour using mental sampling mechanisms, but there is still little agreement on the specific sampling process, such as whether sampling rates match true probabilities. Here, we trace the sampling process using random generation: in two experiments using general online samples (total N=103), participants repeatedly produced potential outcomes from pairs of monetary gambles before choosing between them. Results found over-generation of rarer outcomes and under-generation of common outcomes overall but not in initial responses, as well as avoidance of direct repetitions. Participants also tended to select options with higher average utility across their responses, implying generations guided choice. These findings suggest systematic biases in mental sampling that may filter through to choices, constraining models of this behaviour. We thus suggest random generation is a valuable method to access underlying choice processes, offering new assessments of existing theories of decision making.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

          "authors": "Gayoung Son; Marius Rubo",
          "abstract": "Background: Social anxiety often manifests in real-world interactions through behavioral patterns such as reduced eye contact and lower speech volume. While these markers have been examined in face-to-face paradigms, assessment of such behaviors in real-time social interactions has remained relatively limited. Social Virtual Reality (Social VR) offers a promising alternative by allowing for naturalistic yet experimentally controlled interactions, in which fine-grained social behaviors can be captured automatically and at scale. Examining how social anxiety is expressed in these contexts can support clinical applications such as early risk detection, tracking therapeutic progress, or tailoring interventions to individual behavioral patterns.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to assess whether behavioral and physiological markers associated with social anxiety can be similarly detected in dyadic Social VR interactions, and whether these patterns overlap with those linked to general psychopathology and verticality.\n\nMethods: A total of 128 participants engaged in 30-minute, avatar-mediated dyadic conversations within a Social VR environment. Behavioral markers such as gaze towards the partner’s eye region, smiling and speaking behavior were assessed, alongside physiological measures including heart rate and high-frequency heart-rate variability (HF-HRV). Psychological traits were assessed using self-report questionnaires, and composite factors for social anxiety, general psychopathology, and verticality were derived via principal component analysis (PCA). Relationships between traits and behavioral and physiological markers were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.\n\nResults: We found that behavioral and physiological patterns previously associated with social anxiety also emerged in interactions in Social VR, replicating patterns observed in face-to-face interactions. Specifically, higher social anxiety was linked to less gaze toward the partner’s eyes while speaking and quieter speech, alongside reduced HF-HRV. Similar patterns were observed for general psychopathology. In contrast, higher verticality was associated with shorter turn-taking gaps and increased HF-HRV. Correlational analyses revealed highly similar behavioral profiles for social anxiety and psychopathology, whereas verticality displayed a largely opposite pattern.\n\nConclusion: The findings demonstrate that behavioral and physiological patterns associated with psychological traits in face-to-face interactions are also traceable in immersive Social VR settings. Elevated social anxiety and general psychopathology were linked to increased submissive behaviors and heightened physiological stress, while higher verticality was associated with more assertive, dominant interaction styles — suggesting it may represent the opposing end of a shared social-behavioral spectrum. Notably, the strong convergence between social anxiety and broader psychopathology supports the view that many social interaction patterns are not uniquely tied to specific disorders but may reflect general psychological vulnerability. Although the passive and automated nature of behavioral data in Social VR presents novel ethical and privacy challenges, it also affords scalable assessments of social behavior in ecologically valid settings. These results highlight Social VR’s potential as a tool for assessing natural social behaviors in clinical and applied settings.",

          "abstract": "Personalization is increasingly emphasized in behavioural public policy, yet traditional approaches to tailoring interventions remain costly and difficult to scale. Synthetic twin agents—AI-generated counterparts of real individuals—offer a novel, scalable approach. This study evaluates whether synthetic twins generated by large language models (LLMs) can replicate human responses to personality-tailored advertisements. We recruited 373 human participants and created matched synthetic twins using four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-5-latest, Gemini-1.5 Flash, and Gemini-2.0 Flash). Participants evaluated advertisements for three consumer products, each tailored to Big-Five personality traits. Both human participants and their synthetic twins demonstrated personality-congruent responses for Agreeableness and Extraversion. Synthetic twins additionally showed congruence for Conscientiousness and, in some cases, Neuroticism, depending on the model and product. Trait-level comparisons showed partial alignment: Gemini-1.5 Flash most closely replicated human patterns, followed by GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash; GPT-5-latest showed the weakest alignment. Despite trait-specific divergences, aggregate correlations between human and synthetic responses were high (r = .81-.91), indicating strong consistency in relative patterns. These findings provide early evidence that prompt-based multimodal LLMs can approximate human psychological responses. Synthetic twins may serve as low-cost tools for pre-testing personalized behavioural interventions, while also raising critical ethical concerns around privacy, governance, and hyper-personalization.",

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 psychological researchers about the epistemic research goals they were trying to achieve in two of their recent projects (one completed and one ongoing; 40 projects in total). Using thematic analysis, we identified a wide range of research goals across six domains: empirical phenomena, concept development, measurement and auxiliaries, causal explanation, theory, and application. Nearly all goals in the sample were studied with hypothesis tests, but these tests served several different functions. The interviews revealed substantial variation in what researchers meant by 'hypothesis testing,' reflecting different inferential processes, assumptions, and levels of rigour. Some of these methods lacked key features of hypothesis testing and may not be ideally suited for researchers' actual objectives. Psychologists may benefit from clearer guidance about when hypothesis testing is appropriate and what alternative methods can serve the field's diverse epistemic goals.",

          "abstract": "Ancestrally, physical violence from conspecifics was a recurrent adaptive problem. Did selection favor preferences for partners who are both strong (highly able) and willing to protect us from violence? Strength and willingness are interrelated, so dissociating their effects is necessary. Here we assessed both inferences and preferences. In 7 experiments (N = 4,508 U.S. adults recruited via MTurk), we systematically varied the willingness of a date or friend to physically protect you from an attack, compared to scenarios where you do not have this information. We also varied that person’s strength. Discovering that a person is willing to protect greatly increased their attractiveness as a romantic partner or friend, regardless of their strength. This held for both women and men raters, and when evaluating both opposite- and same-sex dates and friends. In fact, partners who were willing to protect were attractive even if they tried to do so but failed, and even if you were harmed because of their failure. Discovering that a partner is unwilling to protect decreased their attractiveness, and was a deal-breaker for women evaluating a male date. Unwillingness decreased attractiveness more when the rater was a woman, when the target was a man, and when the target was being evaluated as a date versus friend. Women placed some importance on a male date’s strength, but this was mostly due to inferences about his willingness to protect them. Surprisingly, we found only weak evidence that differences in strength, independent of willingness, increased the attractiveness of a partner.",

          "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder, often an early marker of α-synucleinopathies, is characterized by the loss of REM-related muscle atonia and the occurrence of dream enactment behaviors. Dream reports in REM sleep behavior disorder are frequently described as more vivid, violent, and negative than typical dreams. However, evidence for this remains inconsistent, likely due to methodological variability and unaddressed confounds – most notably, the influence of pharmacological treatments. The extent to which medications affect REM sleep behavior disorder dream content remains poorly understood.\nThis systematic review critically evaluates the literature on the effects of medications commonly used in REM sleep behavior disorder and Parkinson’s disease – including clonazepam, other benzodiazepines, melatonin, melatonin receptor agonists, levodopa, pramipexole, and other dopamine agonists - on dream content. We identified 27 relevant studies employing qualitative and/or quantitative methods.\nOur analysis revealed major methodological limitations across studies, including a lack of standardized protocols and definitions, frequent reliance on retrospective or anecdotal reports, and predominantly qualitative or semi-quantitative assessments. These limitations constrain the interpretability and comparability of findings. Available evidence offers only limited support for clonazepam, melatonin, and pramipexole in reducing disturbing dream content. More consistent, but still preliminary, evidence links levodopa to increases in vivid or disturbing dreams, including nightmares.\nThis review highlights the need for rigorously controlled studies using standardized and reproducible methods to clarify the role of pharmacological treatments in shaping dream content in REM sleep behavior disorder. Future research should also integrate retrospective and prospective data-collection designs to account for potential recall biases.",

          "abstract": "The changing psychological needs of Generation Alpha and Generation Z demand innovation and adaptation of contemporary training methods in sport psychology. This paper presents an innovative analogue gamified experiential (AGE) training toolkit designed to enhance engagement, sustain interest, and improve learning outcomes in psychological skill development. Grounded in experiential learning principles, these methods combine active participation, reflection, and real-world relevance while incorporating analogue gamification elements such as competition, randomization, time constraints, immediate feedback, and tangible rewards. The fully offline, flexible format allows adaptation across diverse populations, including grassroots athletes, elite performers, teams, and youth programs. By fostering deeper cognitive, emotional, and behavioural engagement, the toolkit extends beyond values education to include leadership, decision-making, emotional intelligence, and communication skills. Assessment approaches include self-reports, psychometric evaluations, performance observations, and coaches’ feedback to measure learning impact. This original practitioner-oriented design contributes an applied framework to sport psychology practice and research.",

          "abstract": "We face two urgent challenges concerning consciousness and AI. Challenge One is that millions of users will soon misattribute human-like consciousness to AI friends, partners, and assistants on the basis of mimicry and role-play, and we don’t know how to prevent this. Challenge Two is that profoundly alien forms of consciousness might genuinely be achieved in AI, but our theoretical understanding of consciousness is too immature to provide confident answers one way or the other. Centrism about AI consciousness is the position that we must take both challenges seriously. The two challenges interact in ways that make this difficult. Steps to address Challenge One might undermine attempts to address Challenge Two by portraying the idea of conscious AI as impossible or inherently unlikely. Conversely, attempts to address Challenge Two might lead to higher levels of misattribution from ordinary users. This “manifesto” attempts to construct mutually consistent strategies for addressing both challenges.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Although research has demonstrated the influences of both threat perception (situation) and personality traits (disposition) for radicalization into violent extremism, few studies have examined how these drivers interact. \nThe present research investigates this classical social and personality psychological situation-disposition nexus in the context of violent extremism. \nMethods: In three correlational studies sampled among the White American general population, we examined whether different threat perceptions (realistic, symbolic, replacement) were related to violent behavioural intentions, and whether these associations were moderated by clinically “normal” traits (HEXACO, Altruism), subclinical (Dark Triad, D-Factor), and anti-social (SDO, RWA) personality traits.\nResults: We find no direct associations between any forms of perceived threat and violent behavioural intentions. Additionally, the three studies provide mixed, and sometimes even contradictory findings, on the direct associations between personality traits and violent behavioural intentions, and the interactions between perceived threat and personality as a driver of violent extremism.\nConclusion: This research provides inconclusive findings for the Situation (threat perception) – Disposition (personality) Nexus in the context of future research. For future research, a way forward may be to leverage analytical procedures better capable of handling high model complexity, e.g. mediated-moderated structural equation modelling or psychometric network analysis.",

          "abstract": "A large body of work has investigated the effect of various pharmacological compounds on aversive memory formation, retrieval, and modification in humans. A broad overview across signalling pathways and memory models is currently lacking. Here, we systematically review publications that tested the impact of acute pharmacological interventions on aversive memory in healthy humans, following PRISMA 2020. We identified 215 candidate compounds from 17 systems and searched Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus, until 14 June 2024. In total, we identified 100 publications with 36 compounds targeting 13 systems. Three compounds were used by the majority of studies: hydrocortison (n=25), propranolol (n=19), and D-cycloserin (n=8), while many of the remaining 33 compounds were investigated in single studies only. We summarise the effect of each investigated compound across memory models, according to the targeted memory stage. Solid evidence emerges for an impact of propranolol on reconsolidation, and weak evidence for an impact of propranolol, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), benzodiazepines, yohimbine, reboxetine, and D-cycloserine on aversive memory encoding/consolidation, and valproic acid on extinction encoding/consolidation. Furthermore, 11 compounds showed significant effects in individual studies with no published replication attempts to date. We discuss potential research directions and suggest steps for greater comparability of findings between compounds, memory models, and laboratories.",

However, these projects can be resource-intensive, place an undue burden on certain populations, such as those with rare conditions, and often make limited contributions to wider knowledge. Incorporating open research approaches into the design and delivery of student research projects can help address these challenges. This chapter uses case studies and practical examples to demonstrate how supervisors can enhance efficiency in data collection and analysis (e.g., pooling data and using pre-existing data). It also examines the role of openness and transparency in student research projects and considers potential ethical implications. The examples provided will be useful for supervisors seeking to enhance students’ dissertation experience and embed some aspects of Open Science into their supervision.",

Here, we combined high-temporal resolution annotations of 26 discrete emotion categories and a valence model with nested behavioral segmentation and fMRI during movie viewing in youth. The emotion category model, particularly sadness and disappointment, was consistently associated with neural event boundaries across the cortical hierarchy from early sensory areas to transmodal hubs in the default mode network, and aligned with behavioral segmentation at coarser temporal scales. These effects persisted after controlling for low- and high-level non-emotional features, underscoring the unique predictive value of emotion categories. Social salience cues, such as “collective presence,” also robustly predicted boundaries, suggesting complementary roles of emotional and social information. Our findings highlight the correspondence between category-specific emotional semantics and narrative structure across multiple timescales.",

Using eight-wave longitudinal data, Dutch youth (N=933; Mage=18.72, SD=3.73) reported their gender identity repeatedly. Results showed that approximately one out of 20 youth changed their gender identity at least once, with several changing multiple times during the study. Whereas some youth changed between binary options (i.e., boy/man or girl/woman), others (also) considered nonbinary identities – either by identifying as such or through various self-descriptions. Youth also used other ways to communicate potential gender-expansiveness, including self-describe, ‘prefer not to say’ and missing data patterns. Our findings highlight gender identity as dynamic and contextual construct that continues to change beyond childhood and should be recognized as such.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health and psychiatry is transforming the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). While the initial and promising applications span diagnostic screening and theraputic chatbots, \nthese first-wave technologies do not directly target the underlying brain alterations or account for the treatment of MDD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) holds a tremendous promise to address the biological heterogeneity of MDD, but is currently hindered by highly variable outcomes. Therefore, we posit that synergistic integration of AI with NIBS represents the most promising path to address these difficulties. Importantly, the frontier for AI in depression treatment lies in a paradigm shift: from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven, personalized precision interventions.  We argue for a paradigm shift away from AI roles in mental health (e.g., chatbots, diagnostics) toward its deep integration as the core engine for personalized, circuit-based neuromodulation. We highlight the key opportunities this fusion creates: identifying patient-specific neural targets through predictive modeling, developing adaptive closed-loop therapies that respond to real-time brain states, and brain \"digital twins\" for in silico simulation and protocol optimization. While significant challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical validation remain, the fusion of AI and NIBS heralds an era of psychiatry that is predictive, personalized, and precise.",

          "authors": "Guilherme Schmidt Câmara; Connor Spiech; Sandra Solli; Birger Bang; Olga Rogulina; Bruno Laeng; Anne Danielsen",
          "abstract": "It has been claimed that musicians can convey different timing ‘feels’ in groove-based performance by manipulating onset asynchrony between instruments (playing ahead/on/behind the beat) and the durational ratio of metrical subdivisions (non-isochrony/‘swing’). The extent to which listeners can actually perceive such microrhythmic nuances, however, has rarely been tested in ecological, multi-instrumental contexts. While pupil dilation has been linked to asynchrony, it has not been studied for swing, even though it has been shown to reliably index attentional allocation and sensory conflict, offering a useful physiological complement to behavioral measures of microrhythm. We measured just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds of asynchrony (Exp. 1) and swing (Exp. 2) in a naturalistic funk pattern (IOI ≈143 ms) featuring guitar, bass, and drums (kick, snare, hi-hat). Sixty-four participants (32 musicians, 32 non-musicians) completed a 1IFC staircase task with global onset displacements (asynchrony: ±1–100 ms; swing: +1–71.5 ms). Pupillary responses were recorded throughout. Across both experiments, thresholds varied systematically by instrument. For asynchrony, Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat yielded the lowest JNDs (≈19–24ms), while Bass and Guitar required the largest displacements (≈31–35ms). For swing, thresholds were lowest when Drums or All Instruments swung together (≈24–26ms), and highest for Bass and Guitar (≈32–34ms). An asymmetric effect of temporal direction was found for detection of asynchrony, with late displacements (≈28ms) harder to detect than early ones (≈23ms). In addition, musical training conferred a general advantage, with musicians achieving lower thresholds compared to non-musicians (asynchrony: ≈20ms vs. 31ms ; swing: ≈23ms vs. 34ms). We also found a linear relationship between pupil size and both asynchrony and non-isochrony, further indicating that the pupil indexes saliency in the processing of microrhythm more generally.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

LBAs based on individuals’ prompted descriptions analysed with large language models to produce scores of their psychological states and traits have shown strong convergence with the corresponding rating scales (r &gt; .80) and have often surpassed rating scales in predicting theoretically relevant behaviours (external criteria). Despite their high validity across numerous psychological outcomes and contexts, the broader adoption of LBA models has been limited. Even when made available alongside research publications, these models often remain inaccessible due to technical complexities, inconsistent documentation, and the absence of a standardized repository. This tutorial introduces a framework targeted to social and psychological scientists for accessible sharing models with others –the Language-Based Assessment Models (L-BAM) Library– as well as a toolkit for easily using L–BAMs via the text package in R. L-BAM covers a wide range of models for assessing mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life, harmony in life), implicit motives (need for power, affiliation and achievement) and more. The L-BAM library aims to increase the availability and resource efficiency of language-based assessments of psychological constructs while encouraging replication, independent validation and the broad application of pre-existing language-based assessment models.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive processing models, hallucinations can arise from over-weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory input. Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception.

In a pre-registered study of UK-based bisexual cisgender men (N = 200; 80.5% White), participants completed measures of bi-negativity, sexual identity visibility, mental health and well-being, body dissatisfaction, and perceived gay community stress. Straight community bi-negativity predicted poorer mental health, which in turn was associated with greater body dissatisfaction; no serial pathway via sexual identity visibility emerged. Gay community bi-negativity showed no direct relationship to body dissatisfaction or mental health but was positively associated with sexual identity visibility and indirectly associated with mental health, acting through sexual identity visibility, suggesting a potential beneficial pathway. Perceived gay community stress did not moderate pathways from gay community bi-negativity.

To address this, we present a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning dataset from 47 female dyads (24 friend pairs, 23 stranger pairs). During fNIRS recording of prefrontal cortex activity, dyads jointly viewed negative and neutral images under two conditions: a hand-holding (touch) condition and a no-touch condition. The dataset includes raw and preprocessed fNIRS data, trial-by-trial emotional valence and arousal ratings, and a comprehensive collection of trait- and state-based questionnaire data. Technical validation, including power spectral density analysis, confirms that our preprocessing pipeline effectively removed artifacts and noise, yielding high-quality signals. This rich, multi-modal dataset is publicly available on the Open Science Framework and provides a unique resource for investigating how social relationships shape the neurobehavioral dynamics of social support, particularly through the lens of inter-brain synchrony.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the developmental dynamics between systems supporting approximate nonsymbolic abilities and symbolic magnitude processing is key for advancing both theory and educational practice. This study examines whether a certain way of practicing number line estimation can enhance number line estimation and early math skills in preschoolers and influence the developmental dynamics between nonsymbolic and symbolic numerical systems. A total of 114 Swedish preschoolers participated in a pre-post intervention study, with an experimental group receiving three sessions of number line estimation practice via a game-like computerized task. Results showed significant improvements in number-line accuracy and early math skills in the experimental group, while the control group exhibited stable performance across sessions. Critically, the analysis of dynamics between symbolic and nonsymbolic abilities revealed a bidirectional relation: symbolic skills predicted nonsymbolic development across groups, but the reverse prediction from nonsymbolic to symbolic skills only emerged in the experimental group. These findings support both refinement and mapping accounts and highlight number line training as a developmental bridge between numerical systems. Implications for educational tools aiming to scaffold early numerical development are discussed.",

          "abstract": "“Noh” is a traditional Japanese theatrical art characterized by sophisticated emotional expressions. Noh is performed by experts in various fields such as the shite-kata actors) and the hayashi-kata (instrumentalists). It has been reported that Noh performers acquire peculiar physical techniques, such as breathing patterns, during expression; however, it is unclear whether practicing Noh causes psychological transformation. In this study, we examined changes in trait-level interoception that accompany the practice of Noh. In the survey, 22 professional Noh performers (10 actors, Mage = 45.60, SDage = 12.29, age range = 23–56; 12 instrumentalists, Mage = 47.50, SDage = 10.85, age range = 25–62; all participants were male) and 18 controls with no Noh experience (Mage = 40.50, SDage = 6.85, age range = 31–52) completed a series of questionnaires, including psychological scales on multiple aspects of interoception, such as belief about accuracy or attention. The actors showed substantially higher scores than the controls in terms of interoceptive attention. Furthermore, interoceptive accuracy in the actors correlated positively with years of experience. This study provides important insights into the physical and psychological techniques of Noh performers and contributes to the elucidation of factors that alter interoception over time.",

          "abstract": "It is well established that external feedback is effective not only for enhancing cognitive performance but also for regulating metacognitive monitoring. However, external feedback could be detrimental when it conflicts with one’s internal feedback signal (i.e. the level of confidence we have in our decisions). Currently, however, it is unknown how discrepancies between internal and external feedback (“metacognitive conflict”) influence cognitive and metacognitive performance. Here, we examined this question in a series of perceptual decision-making experiments in which participants reported both their level of confidence and received performance feedback. Metacognitive conflict occurs if participants have high confidence in their decision, but external feedback indicates that the decision was erroneous, or vice versa. Results revealed that metacognitive conflict triggers next-trial behavioral adjustments: participants exhibit significantly lower confidence following metacognitive conflict. Critically, this adaptation effect was confined to the trial level, with no sustained modulation observed when manipulating metacognitive conflict at the block level. To better characterize the computational mechanisms underlying this effect, we deployed an evidence accumulation model with additional post-decision accumulation to quantify confidence. Model fits revealed that participants become more conservative in reporting confidence after experiencing metacognitive conflict, as evidenced by biased post-decision starting points. Jointly, our findings provide much needed insight into the metacognitive consequences of metacognitive conflict.",

While glucose increases hormonal stress responses without changing cardiac stress reactivity, less is known about the interaction of glucose and relaxation interventions on cardiac reactivity. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of glucose administration and a standardized massage intervention on psychophysiological relaxation and sustained attention. \nNinety-four participants (age mean = 22.84 years, SD = 2.53 years; 71.28% female) were randomly assigned to consume a drink containing glucose, or pure water before receiving a standardized massage or resting. Directly after the manipulation, they completed the d2 sustained attention test. We repeatedly assessed blood glucose and mood and recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) throughout. Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were used as a measure of parasympathetic activity, and pre-ejection period (PEP) indexed sympathetic activity. \nOur preregistered analyses showed that both relaxation interventions increased PNS activity and decreased arousal. Glucose activated the SNS and prevented SNS withdrawal in response to the massage. However, it did not modulate PNS or affective reactivity to the interventions. While cardiac reactivity was not related to sustained attention, higher blood glucose was linked to higher concentration performance and accuracy in explorative analyses. \nThe results provide further support for the autonomic space model demonstrating independence of SNS and PNS regulation depending on the type of manipulation. They may further our understanding of the links between glucose metabolism and autonomic functioning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Rapid population-level identification of language disorders could help provide care to young children to improve their outcomes. Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (&gt;1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared &lt; 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "abstract": "Considering their developmental sensitivities to peer approval and heightened self-consciousness, many adolescents experience body image concerns when engaging with visual social media. Using a sample of 927 adolescents aged 15–19 (M = 16.97, SD = 1.19; 59% girls, 38% boys, 3% other), this study explored whether resilience to idealized media bodies and to negative appearance feedback moderated the links between social media appearance activity, body esteem, and self-objectification, with the expectation that such resilience would buffer against low body esteem and heightened self-objectification. Resilience to negative appearance feedback did not significantly moderate these associations. In contrast, resilience to media ideals did, but in an unexpected direction. Adolescents with higher-than-average resilience who engaged more frequently in appearance activity reported greater self-objectification and lower body esteem, whereas those with lower-than-average resilience reported the opposite relationships, showing less self-objectification and higher body esteem. These results emerged for both girls and boys. Considering the exploratory nature of these results, they suggest that resilience may play a more intricate role in adolescents' social media appearance activity and body image. Future studies should investigate this idea further, including the reverse pathway where resilience may build up from exposure to idealization on social media.",

          "abstract": "Teacher shortages are a serious challenge in many countries, made worse by declining enrolments in initial teacher education (ITE) programs and growing competition for talented young people making career decisions. To address this challenge, we developed and tested two digital interventions—a persuasive game (TeachQuest) and a realistic job preview (RJP)—designed to enhance undergraduate students’ teaching interest, teaching self-efficacy, and perceptions of fit with the profession. In a two-phase experimental study (N = 957), undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to TeachQuest, the RJP, or a control condition. Results from Phase 1 showed that both interventions increased participants’ interest and perceived fit with teaching, with the RJP also improving teaching self-efficacy. In Phase 2, results from a delayed post-test (six weeks later; N = 572) indicated that while motivation-related outcomes remained higher than pre-test levels, changes were non-linear, with TeachQuest sustaining interest through participants’ immersion experiences and the RJP maintaining self-efficacy through mastery experiences. Our findings suggest that immersive game-based recruitment interventions may be particularly effective in informing and engaging potential applicants, whereas RJPs may be useful in reinforcing confidence in teaching. The study provides new insights informing the design of scalable, evidence-based teacher recruitment tools that align with the interests and digital-focused lives of prospective applicants for ITE programs.",

          "abstract": "Organizations in the United States exist in a hierarchical context, with gendered, racialized, and heteronormative influences. However, leaders seeking to mitigate bias and discrimination in organizations often treat organizations as impermeable structures immune to these influences. This blindness stymies their ability to treat the core activators of interpersonal conflict, rather than solely the symptoms. Merging bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We integrate sociological, institutional, and systems psychodynamics theories to document how arbitrary hierarchies influence everything from how organizations form to interpersonal interactions. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the subtlety of the microaggression (which has been the focus of past research in this topic) to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – hegemonic organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of hegemonic hierarchies in their workplace.",

          "authors": "Natalia Khodayari; Howard Egeth; susan courtney",
          "abstract": "Enhancement and suppression have traditionally been described as a shared process; enhancing relevant information subsequently suppresses irrelevant information, but there may also exist separable mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear, however, whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects (Experiment 2) for target location. Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (“singleton-search mode”) by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures did not covary. Experiments 4 and 5 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",

          "abstract": "With increased interest in the replication crisis and the open science movement, it is important to examine the implications of communicating these topics to undergraduate psychology students. At the beginning of the open science movement, the effort to improve research practices was seen and discussed as both an individual and systemic endeavor. Some authors placed the focus on individual researchers, encouraging them to engage in practices like pre-registration and open data. Others, however, placed the responsibility with the system, arguing that incentive structures and norms need to reward these new practices. The current project examined whether using individual vs. systemic teaching approaches impacted psychology student’s trust, motivation, and optimism regarding the field of psychology. Undergraduate psychology students (N= 476) were randomly assigned to one of three video conditions, one specifying how researchers’ practices should change (individual), one specifying on incentive structures should change (systemic), and one summarizing general research practices in psychology. I expected to find that participants in the individual condition would show the highest levels of trust in the field, motivation to improve the field, and optimism, while participants in the systemic condition would show the highest trust in psychological researchers. Overall, while our manipulation effectively influenced participants' perceptions of the teaching approaches, the expected differences in trust, motivation, and optimism were not consistently observed. These results suggest that, regardless of whether one takes an individual or systemic approach, teaching about the replication crisis does not always undermine (or enhance) trust, motivation, and optimism.",

However, such findings relied on constrained stimuli (e.g., group labels, static faces). Studies using naturalistic designs instead reveal high dimensionality. We propose a new perspective that reconciles these views: mental representations of social inferences are structured as a growing network with small-world properties. In this structure, nodes (social inferences) are connected with only a few steps from one another, so even limited activation—elicited by constrained stimuli in only a small subset of nodes—propagates broadly across the network, producing covariation that mimics low-dimensional structures. However, these dimensions are not functional but emergent properties of network dynamics under constrained input. We demonstrated how this small-world-minds perspective accounts for classic phenomena—halo effect and psychological dimensions—as artifacts of stimulus limitations. We call for moving beyond low-dimensional paradigms to understand the complexity of social cognition.",

          "abstract": "In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as “GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY” were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as “honeypots” to detect reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination—the consistently self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate. Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Heuristics have long been viewed as simple decision rules that sacrifice optimality for cognitive efficiency. However, this perspective fails to fully account for their effectiveness in complex, real-world environments. This paper proposes a reinterpretation of heuristics as realizations of likelihood-free approximation to Bayesian inference (LFI), bridging the gap between heuristic and normative approaches to decision-making. We argue that many heuristics can be understood as implementations of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), where observed data are compared to prior predictions via summary statistics (a form of LFI). This view situates heuristics within a probabilistic framework, explaining how they can represent uncertainty and adapt to environmental structure. Our approach addresses three key challenges in the field: It relaxes strong assumptions about cue-target relationships in heuristic models, accounts for implicit uncertainty representation in heuristic decision-making, and invites a more appropriate benchmark for evaluating heuristics' performance. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we present two case studies --- a classic cue-based decision task and an ecological causal learning task. These show that an ABC model using summary statistics can well approximate the benchmark performance provided by unconstrained Bayesian inference, explain the apparent emergence of different heuristics given environmental changes, and capture human behaviors better than a rational Bayesian benchmark without introducing new mysteries. By unifying heuristics and Bayesian inference through the lens of likelihood-free methods, this work provides a more nuanced understanding of human decision-making, and provides a bridge to the literature on inference-by-sampling.",

This study examined the influence of spatial priors (pre-existing knowledge about spatial parameters) using a spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality. We proposed a novel two-dimensional framework for categorizing spatial priors based on spatial reference frame (allocentric vs. egocentric) and temporal scale (global vs. local). Participants memorized and later reproduced target locations. The spatial compactness of the target distribution was manipulated to vary the precision of the allocentric global prior. A central tendency effect, where responses were biased toward the target distribution centroid, indicated reliance on the allocentric global prior. Bias was stronger with more precise distributions, indicating greater reliance on the more precise allocentric global prior. Bidimensional regression analysis revealed additional influences from the egocentric global and egocentric local priors, but not from the allocentric local prior. These findings support the proposed framework and demonstrate that multiple forms of prior knowledge simultaneously guide navigation behavior. This work provides a foundation for future studies linking prior knowledge to spatial navigation and broader cognitive processes.",

          "authors": "Merrick Robinson Osborne; Jacob W. Roberson; Leigh Tost",
          "abstract": "In recent years, an increasingly common practice amongst organizations has been setting representation goals, or organizational mandates intended to increase the prevalence of underrepresented employees in visible work assignments. The work of meeting these goals often falls to managers, who must also weigh additional criteria – like the employees’ workloads or skillsets – in their task assignments. Typically, when faced with a task assignment decision, managers will refrain from assigning employees who are not available or who do not have the requisite skillset. However, leaning on Tetlock’s theory of value pluralism, we predict that these goals can lead managers to set aside traditional criteria of effective task assignment (specifically, underrepresented employees’ person-job fit and/or workloads) to prioritize achieving these organizational goals. In this way, underrepresented employees are more likely to be assigned to tasks that are sub-optimal for their occupational success (i.e., by being assigned to work that does not appropriately match their skillset or that leads them to be overworked). We examine these predictions in four studies (N = 2,598). We find that this decision-making is driven by managers’ increased diversity concerns (as a consequence of the representation goals), but can be mitigated by how the organization communicates those goals. We conclude by discussing both the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.",

          "abstract": "In a global context where creativity skills are increasingly emphasized, imagination remains neglected despite being a foundational component of creativity. This study used a person-centered approach to examine how personality and imagination cluster among university students and how these profiles relate to sex and disciplinary enrollment. Latent profile analysis (LPA) revealed three typologies: Reactive Realists (10.3%), with lower imagination and emotional stability; Reserved Idealists (52.6%), with lower extraversion and moderately elevated imagination; and Balanced Visionaries (37.2%), with high imagination and greater emotional stability. Chi-square analyses indicated that sex did not significantly differentiate profile membership, suggesting imagination-personality patterns are not sex-specific. However, profiles were significantly related with college disciplinary choices when sex and race/ethnicity were added as covariates. Balanced Visionaries were less likely to enroll in the sciences relative to Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, while Reactive Realists showed higher odds of enrolling in Engineering. Regression models further showed significant effects of sex and race/ethnicity: females were less likely to enroll in Business, Engineering, and Music, but more likely in Education; Asian students were more likely to enroll in Business, Engineering, and Science; and Hispanic/Latinx students had higher odds of enrolling in Engineering. These findings highlight the value of LPA for identifying imagination-personality typologies that shape educational choices in post-secondary education.",

          "abstract": "The integration of GenAI into academic workflows marks an epistemological inflection point. While these tools can amplify productivity, they risk eroding the cognitive foundations of expertise by simulating the very tasks through which scientific competence is developed, from synthesis to experimental design to writing. Uncritical reliance can lead to skill atrophy and AI complacency. To counter this, we propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills—strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration—that constitute a new form of scientific literacy distinct from traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we propose how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy. Proactive development of this AI-augmented expertise is necessary to shape a future where technology amplifies, rather than attenuates, scientific thought.",

          "abstract": "Psycholinguistic theories traditionally assume similar cognitive mechanisms across different speakers. However, more recently, researchers have begun to recognize the need to consider individual differences when explaining human cognition. An increasing number of studies have investigated how individual differences influence human sentence processing. Implicitly, these studies assume that individual-level effects can be replicated across experimental sessions and different assessment methods such as eye-tracking and self-paced reading. However, this assumption is challenged by the reliability paradox  (Hedge, 2018). Thus, a crucial first step for a principled investigation of individual differences in sentence processing is to establish their measurement reliability, that is, the correlation of individual-level effects across multiple measurement occasions and methods. In this work, we present the first naturalistic eye movement corpus of reading data with four experimental sessions from each participant (two eye-tracking sessions and two self-paced reading sessions). We deploy a two-task Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the measurement reliability of individual differences in a range of  psycholinguistic phenomena  that are well-established at the population level, namely effects of word length, lexical frequency, surprisal, dependency length and number of to-be-integrated dependents. While our results indicate high reliability across measurement occasions for the word length effect, it is only moderate for higher-level psycholinguistic predictors such as lexical frequency, dependency distance, and the number of to-be-integrated dependencies, and even low for surprisal. Moreover, even after accounting for spillover effects, we observe only low to moderate reliability at the individual level across methods (eye-tracking and self-paced reading) for most predictors, and poor reliability for predictors of syntactic integration. These findings underscore the importance of establishing measurement reliability before drawing inferences about individual differences in sentence processing.",

          "abstract": "Migrants and refugees frequently shoulder the misconception that they are solely responsible for integrating into receiving societies. Diversity training interventions based on experiential learning activities, such as role-plays, can help promote receiving society members’ awareness of acculturation as a mutual process shaped by power asymmetries. However, existing role-plays on acculturation lack theory and science-informed bases, and their effectiveness has rarely been examined by empirical research. Via two mixed-method studies, the present research assessed the learning outcomes of a role-play-based intervention, designed by incorporating well-established psychological frameworks on acculturation, among a community sample of Portuguese majority members (Study 1, N = 44) and in the academic setting among Portuguese and international university students (Study 2, N = 18). Statistical comparisons of pre- and post-test scores revealed that the intervention was effective in increasing participants’ knowledge of migration and acculturation-related issues, and in fostering Portuguese majority members’ empathy towards migrants and refugees. Qualitative data collected during the debriefing discussion and via a feedback form provide in-depth insights into participants’ experiential learning processes. The intervention appeared as a valuable tool for promoting awareness of acculturation as a mutual process and supporting the introduction of acculturation theoretical frameworks in the classroom.",

Recovery narratives (RNs) could foster connectedness, hope, and guidance when they feature certain active ingredients, identified in previous research. However, interventions offering RNs including these active ingredients are lacking.\n\nAims\nThis study aimed to develop and implement an RN-based intervention to enhance personal recovery among adults in specialist mental health services. A secondary aim was to identify potential outcomes for a pilot randomized controlled trial.\n\nMethods\nFollowing Bartholomew’s Intervention Mapping protocol, we conducted a literature review and four stakeholder focus groups to explore needs and inform intervention design.\nResults\nThe digital module STORY MINE was developed and integrated into the online client portal ‘Minddistrict’ at a major Dutch mental health facility. It offers twelve hopeful RNs in three modalities: video podcast, audio, and text. Hypothesized outcomes include improved mental health confidence (primary outcome) and enhanced hope, reduced self-stigma, and better personal recovery (secondary outcomes). \n\nConclusion\nOur study pioneers a targeted, evidence-based approach by purposively collecting recovery narratives that include identified active ingredients to develop a RN based intervention called STORY MINE.

Across two preregistered studies (N = 504, 158) and a re-analysis of previously published data (N = 50), we rigorously examined outcome-irrelevant learning under conditions of explicit instruction and extensive training. In both cases, automatic value updating persisted even when participants clearly understood which features were non-predictive of reward, and reliance on these irrelevant values led to suboptimal choices. Moreover, working-memory capacity, known as a key regulatory resource, predicted the magnitude of this automatic outcome-irrelevant learning. Collectively, our results broaden the concept of automatic cognitive processing beyond the selective-attention literature to encompass reinforcement-learning mechanisms.",

          "authors": "ALI JAMI",
          "abstract": "In a dynamic and uncertain world, the human brain must efficiently process emotions and simulate potential scenarios to enhance decision-making under ambiguity. This theoretical framework proposes that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep serves as a cognitive simulator, decoding unconscious emotions and incoming information within a safe, virtual environment. During REM sleep, limbic system structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula, integrate recent sensory inputs with long-term memory schemas, transforming raw emotional signals based on potential threats and rewards into actionable insights. Simultaneously, REM sleep facilitates affect-centric probabilistic simulations through hippocampal-prefrontal interactions, generating symbolic reconstructions of past experiences and hypothetical scenarios to foster cognitive flexibility and resilience. This model extends traditional perspectives on REM sleep, which emphasize memory consolidation and emotional regulation, by highlighting its critical role in future-oriented decision-making. Drawing on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computational analogies with artificial intelligence, this framework highlights the dual function of REM sleep in emotional familiarization and adaptive strategy rehearsal. Recent evidence from studies on sleep deprivation and REM-specific manipulations further supports this, showing impairments in decision-making, insight generation, and risk assessment when REM is disrupted. Empirical gaps, including the need for direct neurobehavioral evidence linking REM to specific decision-making outcomes, and alternative hypotheses, such as the role of non-REM sleep or slow-wave activity, are discussed to contextualize the contributions of the model and guide future interdisciplinary research.",

In Study 1, 114 participants judged the attractiveness or trustworthiness of male dating profiles with no filter, a mild filter, and an extreme image filter. Profiles with no filter were seen as more trustworthy than those with mild filters, and mild filters were more trustworthy than those with extreme filters. However, filters had comparatively little impact on perceived attractiveness. Moreover, perceptions of trustworthiness and attractiveness were not associated for images with extreme filters, suggesting excessive filtering might disrupt the halo effect in dating app contexts. In Study 2, participants rated male (n = 137) and female profiles (n = 106), which consisted of filtered and unfiltered images, on perceived trustworthiness; half of the participants were informed of the filters. Filtered images were perceived as less trustworthy than unfiltered images for both male and female profiles, especially when participants were informed about the filters.",

          "abstract": "Groove is the pleasurable urge to move to the beat of music, a universally experienced human phenomenon. Because listeners are often inspired to move to music with groove, we asked whether high-groove music would promote greater motor system activity than low-groove music, noise, or silence, as shown by shorter latency and/or greater amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an event-related potential measure of neural response preparation and execution in the primary motor cortex. In Experiment 1, 21 participants were presented with one of two symbols (@ and #) on a computer monitor and pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on which symbol was presented, while listening to high-groove music, low-groove music, noise, or silence. Throughout the duration of the experiment, electroencephalography was recorded at the scalp and we calculated stimulus-locked and response-locked activity by averaging across correctly responded, non-artifact trials. In Experiment 2, 31 participants were tested with the same stimuli, procedure, and analysis, with the following exception: instead of responding to visual stimuli, participants pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on whether they heard an occasional increase or decrease in intensity in the music or noise. None of the analyses in either experiment showed differences in LRP latency or amplitude between the high-groove or low-groove conditions. Several of the analyses yielded Bayes Factor values greater than 3 in favor of the null hypothesis. Thus, we found no evidence that high-groove music enhances activity in the primary motor cortex. Future studies should use other brain activity measurement and manipulation techniques to conceptually replicate our findings, including techniques that can separately measure different motor and auditory cortical areas.",

Local publics—through gossip, assemblies, and social media—oscillated between vigilance and cynicism.

          "abstract": "Why do some social groups remain cohesive while others fragment into polarized factions? How do individuals resist dominant norms? This paper introduces the concept of social reward economies—structured systems of social feedback that determine which behaviors, beliefs, and schemas are rewarded, tolerated, or punished. We develop a formal procedural framework that models cohesion, polarization, resistance, and manipulation as emergent properties of these dynamic reward economies.\n\nWe conceptualize cohesion as the alignment of behaviors around a dominant reward economy; polarization as the coexistence of competing reward economies reinforcing divergent beliefs and practices; resistance as the creation of alternative reward economies that valorize dissent; and manipulation as the strategic distortion of reward structures to engineer desired social outcomes.\n\nBy integrating micro-level feedback processes with macro-level social structures, this framework complements existing theories of norms, power, and resistance through a formal model. It advances sociological understanding by demonstrating how social order, conflict, and change emerge from recursive interactions among reputation-seeking agents operating within and across competing reward economies. This perspective provides new tools for empirical research, formal modeling, and the analysis of cohesion, polarization, and manipulation in contemporary digital and organizational contexts.",

Socially responsive agents interpret and adapt their behavior based on symbolically mediated feedback, enabling the endogenous emergence of shared norms, cultural schemas, and hierarchical influence structures.\n\nBy embedding meaning-making and symbolic evaluation into a dynamic feedback loop, the model bridges formal modeling with core insights from cultural and interpretive sociology. It offers a micro-foundational account of social reproduction and transformation that clarifies the procedural “how” underlying the sociological “why.”\n\nCrucially, the framework is designed to support cumulative theory building. Companion papers systematically extend the model to account for increasingly complex social phenomena—progressing from behavioral norm emergence to schema convergence and power asymmetries—demonstrating how formal models can incrementally incorporate interpretive, structural, and symbolic dimensions of social life.",

The International Review is based on country notes from each participating country, prepared by members of the network and edited by a team of network members. Each country note follows a standard format: details of different types of leave; the relationship between leave policy and early childhood education and care policy; recent policy developments; information on take-up of leave. The International Review also includes definitions of the main types of leave policies; and cross-country comparisons. These comparative overviews cover: each main type of leave; the relationship between leave and ECEC entitlements; and policy changes and developments since the previous review. We also include a technical appendix. The 2025 International Review covers 52 countries. These are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay and Vietnam.

          "abstract": "Radical-right parties are often seen as vehicles for the “left behind.” But were these also the first to support such parties when they were stigmatized? I argue that early support is socially stratified because it is norm-breaking. Individuals with higher incomes are more likely to do so when stigma is strong. I test this idea using the case of Vox in Spain, which entered parliament in April 2019 and gained further ground in a second national election six months later. During this period, initial support came disproportionately from higher-income voters. Lower-income individuals were more likely to withhold support in socially exposed interviews, and early voting patterns are consistent with the idea that expressive inhibition may have constrained their support. As the party gained legitimacy, these gaps narrowed. Complementary evidence from Greece’s Golden Dawn shows a similar pattern. Political normalization may thus unfold through a stratified process, beginning with the socially advantaged.",

          "abstract": "How do workers organize under financialized and repressive labor regimes? This study examines four cases of Iranian industrial labor struggles (Haft-Tappeh Sugarcane Company (HTSC), Iran National Steel Industrial Group (INSIG), Heavy Equipment Production Company (HEPCO), and Chadormalou Mining and Industrial Company (CMIC)) to analyze how workers develop distinct resistance strategies in response to financialization, labor precarity, and state repression. Drawing on social movement theory, industrial relations scholarship, and financialization studies, I argue that workers’ organizing strategies are not solely determined by economic hardship but are shaped by prior mobilization experiences, political traditions, and access to broader social networks. Using protest event analysis, archival research, and digital ethnography, this study demonstrates that while financialization weakens traditional unions, it also compels workers to pursue alternative organizing strategies, ranging from grassroots councils and informal alliances to engagement with state-controlled labor institutions. By situating Iran’s labor struggles within broader global trends, this study contributes to debates on precarious work, labor agency under financialization, and the role of historical and socio-political contexts in shaping resistance strategies in authoritarian economies.",

          "abstract": "Global heating is accelerating, but climate mobilization remains too limited to compel decision-makers to confront the drivers of ecological breakdown, including fossil capital and industrial agriculture, and to prepare for the impacts. Here we draw on the history of social movements, the social science of collective action, and our experience in the climate movement to make concrete suggestions for increasing climate mobilization. We add to recent proposals for organizers to center “transformative adaptation”, which puts emphasis on people’s immediate material interests. Unlike shallower forms of climate adaptation, transformative adaptation involves major changes to social and economic relations. We argue that campaigns for transformative adaptation have the potential to grow climate mobilization because they can deliver direct material benefits, foster democratic and equitable institutions, increase climate resilience, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and appeal to a politically diverse public. We make suggestions for how researchers and organizers can build on our proposal.",

          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Research on housing and populism has produced conflicting findings – evidence suggests declining housing affordability can have both a negative and positive association with populist support. Focusing on the UK, this paper argues these findings can be reconciled by decomposing the heterogeneous effects of housing affordability into constituent housing crises – the decline of homeownership and rising housing insecurity. Furthermore, it argues these crises will be related to political preferences through the interaction between geography and tenure. The paper hypothesises that homeowners in areas of high house prices will be less likely to hold populist political preferences due to a wealth effect that legitimises the existing socio-political system. By contrast, social renters in unaffordable areas will be more likely to support populism due to their higher likelihood of experiencing housing insecurity and as the rationing of social housing will induce a sense of competition over scarce resources. Analysis using data on local housing conditions and political preferences finds broad support for these hypotheses. The analysis finds that social renting in an area of widespread housing insecurity is positively associated with both opposition to immigration and voting for the Reform Party. It also finds that homeownership does negatively interact with local house prices in predicting attitudes to immigration, but the effect is to attenuate the positive association between house prices and opposition to immigration. This contradicts previous studies which may have been subject to omitted variable bias. No evidence is found for an interaction between homeownership and affordability in predicting support for the Reform Party. The paper contributes to an emergent research agenda around housing discontent and populism. It concludes with reflections on the future direction of this research agenda, suggesting there is value in measuring housing insecurity at the individual level, not just as a contextual variable, and interrogating causality.",

Yet, little is known about how these multidimensional trajectories relate to ultimate childlessness across different institutional contexts.\nOBJECTIVE\nThis paper identifies typical early mid-life trajectories of partnership, income, and residential independence among men and women in two contrasting welfare regimes: Finland and Belgium, and explores how these are associated with remaining childless.\nMETHODS\nUsing linked register and census data for cohorts born in 1974–75, followed from their early 30s to mid-40s, we apply multichannel sequence and cluster analysis to identify typical life course patterns across three domains. We then use linear regression models to assess how remaining childless, education and place of residence are associated with the degree of alignment with each trajectory type, as measured by representativeness scores (Helske et al., 2024).\nRESULTS\nFive trajectory types were identified in each country, including patterns of early and stable partnerships and others marked by delayed transitions. Remaining childless was mostly associated with later residential independence and the near absence of partnership formation. In Finland, a distinct cluster highlights how being single after a separation is also associated with childlessness. In contrast, stable marriage pathways were strongly associated with parenthood.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe study demonstrates how the interplay of partnership, residential independence and income trajectories, shaped by education and institutional context, produces distinct pathways associated with childlessness in early mid-life.",

          "abstract": "To embrace the new challenges and opportunities of increasing globalization and cross-cultural communication at all levels, the European Commission has been advocating CLIL education across EU member states since the late 20th century. In Belgium, despite Wallonia adopting this approach as early as 1998, Flanders officially approved the implementation of CLIL education in its secondary education system only in 2014, followed by continuous monitoring and adjustment. This study analyzes the process of formulating the updated CLIL language education policy (LEP) in Flanders, the rationale behind the policy, and the language education management in different layers. Combining the backgrounds of language practices and the operational system of CLIL LEP in Flanders, we found that although the CLIL LEP conflicts with the early language legislation, it is a strategy to prepare the new generation to embrace new challenges and opportunities driven by globalization and cross-cultural communication at all levels. However, the approved policy aims to promote a select multilingualism, which focus lies with the promotion of English. Furthermore, CLIL education is operated as a parallel mode in schools, accompanied by compulsory Flemish programs to ensure the dominance of the Flemish language. This is also a top-down approach carefully monitored by the government while supplemented resources are yet far from sufficient.",

          "abstract": "Family policies increasingly encourage fathers to take parental leave to boost maternal employment and paternal childcare involvement. Yet many fathers use less than their entitlement. Limited studies suggest workplace peers may encourage fathers to take more leave, but evidence is mixed, leaving uncertainty about who is influenced and when.\n\nThis study explores educational heterogeneity in direct workplace peer effects on fathers’ parental leave usage, aiming to understand which fathers in which contexts are influenced by peers. We utilise Finnish full-population administrative registers and linked employer-employee data on fathers’ leave uptake in 2009–2019, covering 117,837 births. Structural causal models and Bayesian multilevel logistic regression are used to examine how preceding fathers’ leave influences new fathers.\n\nFindings show that peers’ leave usage positively influences new fathers, with low-educated fathers more affected than highly educated ones. Peer effects were strongest in workplaces with no prior leave uptake and declined as more fathers began taking leave, especially among skilled men.\n\nWorkplace peer effects are a key mechanism behind rising leave uptake between policy reforms. In contexts with limited information on leave consequences, peers serve as important sources of learning—particularly for low-educated men—but the informational value declines as uptake becomes more common.",

          "authors": "Sameer Meralli",
          "abstract": "The discovery of Homo floresiensis on the island of Flores ignited a longstanding debate regarding the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the taxon’s unique small body size and mosaic morphology as compared to other Homo variants. Homo floresiensis’ reduced cranial capacity combined with dissimilar gracile and robust postcranial features became a point of contention in finding a clear identity in the Homo pathology. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this divergence: the Phyletic Dwarfism Hypothesis, which posits descent from Homo erectus via insular dwarfism driven by deterministic selection, and the Genetic Drift Hypothesis, which attributes its unique morphology to neutral evolutionary processes in a small, isolated population. This study quantitatively tests these competing hypotheses using a multivariate morphometric approach applied to 3D landmark data from the H. floresiensis holotype (LB1) and comparative samples of H. erectus, H. habilis, Australopithecus, H. sapiens, and great apes. Using Brownian motion simulations of genetic drift, allometric analyses, and applying tests of morphological integration this paper aims to reveal a more precise evolutionary history of Homo floresiensis.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how land-based climate mitigation strategies under the European Green Deal raise crucial questions about the distribution and democratic control of land resources. The research analyses the intersection of carbon neutrality-driven land-use changes with existing patterns of land grabbing and concentration, revealing significant limitations in current just-transition approaches. Through a critical analysis of European climate policy frameworks and land governance mechanisms, the study demonstrates that the land dimension represents a notable blind spot in just-transition approaches. The findings indicate that existing frameworks, primarily focused on industrial restructuring and labor market adaptation, cannot adequately address the challenges of ensuring democratic access to and control over land resources. The paper proposes the concept of a \"land-just transition\" as a necessary evolution, advocating for the explicit integration of land justice considerations into climate transition frameworks. This approach would expand beyond compensation and adaptation to address fundamental questions of land governance and democratic control. The research concludes by identifying key areas requiring further investigation, including empirical analysis of land control patterns, development of policy instruments for ensuring land justice, and theoretical elaboration of land justice within just transition frameworks.",

          "authors": "Daniel J. Freeman",
          "abstract": "Objective.  Prior research on gun ownership and violent crime has yielded inconsistent conclusions, largely because nearly all studies rely on proxy measures of prevalence - surveys, state-level aggregates, or policy classifications - that cannot isolate handgun ownership, cannot confirm lawful versus illicit possession, and are vulnerable to confounding.  For example, Kleck (1997) and Cook &amp; Ludwig (2006) highlighted measurement error as the main barrier to inference, Siegel et al. (2014) reported positive associations using household survey proxies, and Donohue et al. (2019) found liberalized right-to-carry regimes associated with higher violent crime, but with treatment defined as legal regime type rather than actual prevalence.  As the National Research Council concluded in its landmark 2004 review, available studies were too compromised by proxy limitations and unmeasured confounders to provide reliable evidence of causal effects.\n\nDesign.  This study is the first to eliminate that uncertainty by restricting analysis to U.S. jurisdictions that publish auditable, administrative counts of active resident handgun licenses.  We constructed two cohorts: A (higher licensing prevalence, mean ≈ 10.7% of residents) and B (lower prevalence, ≤1.6%).  We then compared two-year (2023-2024) totals for homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault per 100,000 residents, with covariates for poverty (%), sworn law-enforcement staffing (LEO per 100,000) and population density.  We estimated cohort means and rate ratios, Pearson correlations with Fisher-z intervals, OLS slopes of violent rate on licensing share, and Poisson GLMs with log(population) offsets to report percent change per +1-percentage point increase in licensed share.\n\nResults.  Mean violent crime was ≈ 542 per 100,000 in Cohort A versus ≈ 1,238 per 100,000 in Cohort B (rate ratio ≈ 2.28, 95% CI 1.52-3.43).  Each +1-percentage point increase in licensing share corresponded to ≈ 7.6% lower violent incidence (IRR 0.924; 95% CI 0.890-0.958), or ≈ 60-70 fewer incidents per 100,000 depending on model specification.  Adjusting for poverty or LEO staffing attenuated but did not eliminate the association.  Population density was negatively correlated.  Sensitivity analyses excluding outliers (Flint, MI and Washington, DC) yielded consistent results.\n\nConclusions.  This study is the first to demonstrate, using clean administrative licensing exposure measures, that higher lawful handgun ownership prevalence is strongly and inversely associated with personal violent crime.  The association is robust across models and covariates, survives outlier tests, and directly addresses the measurement weaknesses that have limited prior scholarship.  Unlike advocacy-sponsored work, this study is independent, fully transparent, and reproducible, providing the strongest evidence to date that lawful handgun prevalence aligns with substantially lower violent crime rates.  We emphasize correlation rather than causation, highlight demographic, lifestyle and illicit-market limitations, and provide a reproducibility appendix with administrative URLs to support independent audit.",

          "abstract": "Data about individual users drives today's social media content-filtering algorithm recommendations. Through nuanced interactions with social media algorithms, such as human-algorithm interplay, the end user effortlessly cultivates a social media feed. While this level of personalization can significantly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still disclose private information to the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates communication privacy management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine the extent to which social media users (N = 1,305) engage in open privacy management practices with social media platforms via their algorithms, depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals’ awareness of algorithms is negatively associated with using open privacy management practices with social media algorithms. However, this depends on their felt privacy fatigue, such that individuals who are both highly aware and highly fatigued are likely to be more closed off in sharing private information with social media algorithms, thus granting less co-ownership rights to social media platforms. In light of these findings, implications for future research on communication privacy management in the context of social media algorithms are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Policy debates have increasingly focused on further training in adulthood as a tool to promote equal career opportunities. Yet it remains empirically unclear whether further training acts as an equaliser, reducing exist-ing wage inequalities, or as an amplifier, reinforcing the Gender Pay Gap. This article examines whether the wage returns to non-formal job-related further training differ between women and men. We use data from the adult cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (2007–2023) and apply individual fixed-effects panel regression models with a cumulative approach to estimate the long-term effects of participa-tion in further training on wages. Our findings show that both men and women benefit from further training. However, men achieve significantly higher wage gains from longer spells of participation, particularly in selective, employer-provided formats. Leadership positions further amplify men’s returns. Although gaps in training participation have narrowed and in part reversed, returns show no equalising potential and instead contribute to the persistence of the Gender Pay Gap. Building on Relational Inequality Theory, our findings contribute to the broader debate on inequality reproduction through gendered claims-making by focusing on further training in organisational and institutional contexts.",

Using a national sample (N = 1,081), this study explores the racial divide in officer avoidance, the role of contact type, and the impact of police-related fear. We expect that officer avoidance will be highest among Black Americans, especially for involuntary contacts, because of elevated fear of police mistreatment. The findings are consistent with this theoretical expectation. Black Americans report more officer avoidance than their White counterparts. Fear of the police increases avoidance, both for voluntary and involuntary police contacts, although the effect is largest for involuntary contacts. These findings support growing evidence that avoidance of law enforcement contact stems from fear of police mistreatment, which derives from prior personal and vicarious mistreatment.",

Conventional gerrymandering tactics of cracking and packing can be more sophisticated when the district boundary drawers in power can control the district populations. \nWe illustrate this new yet simple gerrymandering strategy using the case of Malaysia, a long-lasting electoral authoritarian regime that endured from the early 1970s to 2018, focusing on ethnic representation. By comparing the enacted districting plan with counterfactual electoral districts simulated through Sequential Monte Carlo redistricting simulation, we identify significant ethnic gerrymandering against the minority Chinese Malaysians, in which cracking and packing are the strategies adopted by the majority Malay-dominated ruling coalition.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a dynamic equilibrium framework that reinterprets persistent macroeconomic issues—global imbalances, long-run deflation or entrenched inequality—not as market failures, but as structural outcomes. Departing from standard nominal‑adjustment models, it incorporates asset‑side mechanisms and reconsiders the transversality condition (TVC), deriving: R_t-ρ=n+D_a-U_(θa)θ/U_c; This balance means the divergence between asset returns (R_t) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the balance of capital diffusion (D_a), population growth (n) and preference terms (U_(θa)θ/U_c). As result, equilibrium arises from structural and institutional interplay beyond a price‑clearing mechanism. Simultaneously, by redefining the TVC as a structural condition on asset valuation resulting from this framework, we explain how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist. Redefining imbalances as the result of endogenous optimization in this way enables economic understanding that is in line with the realities of economies and provides tools for designing practical policies—for example, Structural Selection of the Steady State, Policy Control of Capital Flows, Asset Dynamics–Based Policy Reconstruction and so on—. This enables economics to reflect the realities of economic society and address structural challenges.",

          "authors": "Angelo Falzarano",
          "abstract": "Digital micro-movements are distinctive phenomena of the contemporary era, characterized by horizontality, rapid mobilization, and strong dependence on algorithmic infrastructures. They are not merely an online transposition of traditional mobilizations but introduce new forms of solidarity, leadership, and collective consciousness. By integrating classical sociological theory, Durkheim, Weber, Marx, Simmel, and Elias, with recent perspectives from media and digital activism studies (Castells, Tufekci, Bennett &amp; Segerberg, Zuboff), this paper develops a framework centered on three categories: networked solidarity, diffused leadership, and algorithmic consciousness. A qualitative and comparative analysis of three emblematic cases, #MeToo, Fridays for Future, and Black Lives Matter, highlights emancipatory potentials (global amplification, rapid coordination, symbolic pressure) as well as structural vulnerabilities (dependence on algorithmic visibility, risk of slacktivism, corporate co-optation). The study shows how the same technological infrastructure that enables collective mobilization also functions as a space of surveillance, manipulation, and co-optation, thereby reshaping the relationship between movements, platforms, and institutions. The article argues for a continuous conceptual renewal: the classics should not be abandoned but reinterpreted in the light of the network society and surveillance capitalism. The three proposed categories aim to provide analytical tools to grasp the tensions between emancipation and control and to imagine hybrid strategies capable of translating the fluid energy of digital mobilization into lasting institutional change.",

          "abstract": "This article presents an analysis of the impact of the number of alters elicited in an ego network on the structural properties of those networks. There continues to be debate about the pros and cons of eliciting a fixed number of alters for each respondent versus allowing the respondent to list as many or few alters as they would like. This article explores a random assignment of respondents to three treatment groups – 1) a fixed number of alters set at 30, 2) a variable number of alters up to 45, and 3) a variable number of alters up to 45 with a 20 alter minimum. The results indicate that, from a non-structural perspective, all levels of emotional proximity, interaction contexts, genders, and ages are consistently sampled across the three treatment groups. At the structural level, the behavior of individual metrics is also largely similar. However, the most significant differences arise in the collective behavior of structural metrics—specifically, in their correlation structure, the amount of redundant information each variable provides, and the diversity and interpretability of the observed structural variability. When a data collection strategy constrains network size, it reduces the sparsity of the correlation matrix, effectively decreasing the number of independent global variables needed to describe network structure and making these global variables less interpretable. In other words, networks constructed with a survey that limits size tend to be more similar to each other, exhibiting less structural diversity and yielding differences that are harder to interpret. However, we discuss how these differences may simply be mathematical artifacts, without necessarily implying a clear advantage in choosing one treatment over another. Finally, we argue that the field needs a targeted study to answer whether the differing numbers of alters listed is a function of network size.",

This is enhanced by the emergence of non-traditional actors who can effectively assert journalistic authority within communities by deviating from specific traditional journalistic values. However, scholarly understanding of the role of community membership in claims of journalistic authority remains limited. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that draws on boundary work and fan studies. This framework allows us to examine how diverse journalistic actors in a variety of communities can base their journalistic authority claims on their: (1) proximity to news sources and protagonists; (2) authenticity as perceived by the audience community; and (3) professionalism in relation to the journalistic field. Through empirical research, this framework may help us to better understand how diverse journalistic actors can claim authority while meeting communities’ diverse needs.",

However, the question of how ordinary people conceptualize happiness—that is, the everyday conception of happiness—has rarely been systematically explored. This study applies a word-association network approach to examine the semantic schemas, components, and group differences in people's perceptions of both happiness and unhappiness. Specifically, we create a semantic representation of happiness and unhappiness from a survey using a mini-snowball word association task and then employ network analysis to identify semantic characteristics and demographic differences. Our findings suggest that the proposed method not only aligns well with previous studies' implications but also deepens our understanding of the structure by revealing new components of these concepts. Furthermore, the method facilitates further investigation of how semantic representations of happiness and unhappiness vary across demographic groups, highlighting both the general and semantic differences in their components. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of word-association networks for capturing everyday conceptions of happiness and unhappiness, offering both theoretical insights and practical implications for developing more accurate and culturally grounded measures.",

First, we distinguish between the ability of GAI to select and socialize\nindividuals who are internally committed to organizationally desirable values, versus individuals\nwho only perform these values. Our second distinction pertains to the cross-pressures of fitting in\nversus standing out within organizations. Third, we distinguish between how GAI is adopted\ninitially, and responses to these configurations by strategic actors, which we refer to as “second\norder effects.” Based on these distinctions, we array our predictions across three phases, with\neach new phase a response to the tensions and dissatisfactions of a preceding one.",

The research starts by utilizing existing literature reviews until 2022 and then conducts its literature review to bridge the gap to 2025. The literature review is conducted with the help of methods from  Kitchenham (2004) and Nightingale (2009). The databases EBSCOhost, Scopus, and Web of Science were used for searching related literature. A precise keyword string is used to search, as well as various filtering, in order to get peer-reviewed journal articles. Initially, 221 articles were found and reviewed, and 70 were included in the literature review. The literature review shows an overwhelming amount of studies in investment and finance settings. However, it further indicates a lack of studies in other areas, especially in the workplace setting, such as in Singapore. Furthermore, it overviews the most prominent biases and recommends that further studies in other settings could utilize similar biases. The biases were overconfidence bias, herding bias, and decision avoidance bias. Thus, further research into other fields and regions could utilize these biases to get new insights into these topics.",

          "authors": "Vojtěch Zíka; J Dustin Tracy",
          "abstract": "Overconfidence research often involves estimating performance within a fixed range. Recent studies suggest that overprecision is affected by central tendency bias, the tendency to estimate near the center of a perceived distribution. This paper examines whether a similar pattern influences the other two overconfidence types, overestimation and overplacement. In a laboratory experiment (N = 120), participants estimated their own and the average performance over five rounds of ten Rock–Paper–Scissors games. Each round earned for up to 40 points, but average performance varied across three treatments, with means of 16.6, 20, and 23.3 points. The main question was whether this manipulation would result in the sample appearing overconfident, underconfident, or well-calibrated. The results suggest that calibration depends on the relative position of mean performance to the midpoint of the range. When the mean aligned with half of the range maximum, participants appeared well-calibrated. A lower mean resulted in apparent overestimation, while a higher mean led to apparent overplacement. Experience shifted some estimates toward the actual mean and improved calibration, but only when feedback was not overly noisy. Monetary incentives and gender were controlled for but showed no significant effect on estimation accuracy. This study provides evidence that the one-half heuristic—the tendency to estimate at half the maximum of a given range—can mechanically bias confidence judgments. While further research is needed to confirm its effect in more traditional overconfidence tasks, caution is warranted when interpreting studies in which mean performance deviates from the range midpoint.",

          "abstract": "Offender Risk Assessment Instruments (ORAIs) have shaped criminal justice decisions for over three decades, yet their predictive reliability remains contested. This article critiques the statistical architecture underlying widely used tools—particularly their reliance on additive models that neglect interaction effects between variables such as age, prior convictions, and socio-economic context. Drawing on recent literature and case studies (including COMPAS, OGRS, and ARMS), it argues that most ORAIs reduce complex human behaviours to binary outcomes, misclassifying risk and reinforcing systemic bias. The paper introduces the concept of interaction effects, supported by statistical and psychological research, to illustrate how risk is often conditional rather than cumulative. It further explores the limitations of regression models and proposes a range of alternatives, including multi-level modelling, Bayesian updating, Explainable AI, and co-produced desistance-informed profiles. Beyond improving tools, the article calls for a paradigm shift—from control to collaboration, from prediction to understanding. Risk, it concludes, should be treated not as a fixed score but as a dynamic, contextual process. Only by recognising this can justice systems promote accurate assessments, reduce harm, and rebuild public trust.",

Drawing on historical, institutional, and regulatory perspectives, the study contrasts the development of the PhD in Germany, the United States, and other Anglo-Saxon contexts with the legal and institutional framework of the doctorate in Tunisia. Particular attention is paid to the additional requirements that distinguish the PhD—such as coursework, comprehensive examinations, and teaching obligations—which are absent from the Tunisian doctorate. The paper argues that conflating the PhD with other doctoral degrees risks erasing structural and epistemological differences among academic traditions. The analysis concludes that neither degree is inherently superior; rather, they serve different purposes and operate within distinct academic systems. This distinction has implications for equivalency, recognition, and the international circulation of doctoral titles.",

We share our experience and reflection, hoping that future research can build on it. We find that publicly available information typically allows us to identify parliamentarians who would be classified as having a ‘migration background’ in official statistics. For women and parliamentarians at the regional (cantonal) level, identification is more difficult. In many cases, however, publicly available information does not capture self-identification, so we can only provide a list of potential minorities. Focusing on assumed ‘visibility’, we found it useful to differentiate different forms of visibility (physical traits, names, accents), and to recognize ambivalence as a possible category. While we might approximate how voters and party elites perceive candidates, the objective approach cannot replace self-identification.",

To resolve this, the paper introduces a modified NAP (MNAP), explicitly permitting voluntary, consent-based bystander intervention. \nThe proposed refinement enhances the practical applicability of the NAP in complex multi-agent scenarios, offering libertarian societies a coherent framework for ethically and legally addressing immediate situations of aggression through consensual collective action.",

Findings reveal three interconnected dimensions of identification with “the people:” the imagined, the felt, and the experienced. Supporters’ positive view of “the people” as hardworking and guided by common sense evokes strong emotions—such as in-group love, connected to their self-concept—validated through meaningful social experiences online and offline.

Employing fixed-effects panel models and difference-in-differences frameworks, my analysis investigates how establishment-level and MSA-level factors predict the presence and turnover dynamics of LGBT+ establishments over time. My findings reveal that bars/clubs and erotic shops have a higher likelihood of presence in MSAs relative to accommodations. Theatre/entertainment venues exhibit higher entry and stability into MSA markets, whereas other establishment types face volatile turnover. I also find that the so-called “great cities,\" ubiquitous in works on LGBT+ placemaking, exhibit conditions favorable to the viability of LGBT+ establishments and yet exhibit no significant differences in turnover dynamics compared to other MSAs. My findings extend qualitative narratives by quantifying the impacts of economic changes, demographic shifts, and cultural influences, which should inform urban policy and advocacy efforts to sustain inclusive LGBT+ spaces amidst changing urban landscapes.",

While first- and second-generation NLP methods—such as keyword extraction, topic modeling, and word embeddings—have extended analytical reach, they remain limited in capturing meaning shaped by ideology, discourse, and context. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a third generation of NLP, capable of performing interpretive tasks such as identifying metaphors, framing, and rhetorical strategies. This shift enables new hybrid approaches that integrate computational efficiency with qualitative depth. The paper introduces two frameworks—AI-Augmented Grounded Theory and Theory-Driven AI Analysis—to illustrate how LLMs can support large-scale, context-sensitive interpretation.

The model identifies six distinct types of agencies: operative, reflective, joint, material-mediated, sign-mediated, and symbolic. Each level is examined in detail to elucidate the semiotic mechanisms and the cognitive architecture underlying the emergence of collective agencies. The model conceptualizes collective agency as an enhanced capability for action, incorporating artifacts to constitute sociotechnical systems. Within this framework, both institutional and non-institutional forms of collective agency are explored. In contrast to institutions, the collective agency of non-institutionalized social organizations generates dense networks of interaction within horizontal structures, facilitating the convergence between shared norms and individual values. This bottom-up view on agency recognizes individuals as agents of change and their crucial role in collective agency. Consequently, I underscore the importance of examining the interactions between individual and collective agency, proposing the Layered Model of Agency as a relevant tool for investigating these issues.",

          "abstract": "The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) cases in various countries, including Indonesia, resulted in the paralysis of most services, including in the government sectors. The enactment of Work from Home (WFH) policy for State Civil Servants (PNS) indicates the massive level of urgency for the spread of this deadly virus, leading to the Social Distance policy being also applied in the government environment. This article aims to examine civil servants' work effectiveness in implementing WFH during Covid-19 pandemic in Sleman Regency, with a case study at the Department of Social Service. This research uses an exploratory case study approach, emphasizing the exploration of a phenomenon such as WFH policy. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews and literature reviews were used to obtain reliable data analysis. The findings of this study show that the adaptation of civil servants in the Sleman Social Service to the WFH policy is seen as complex in several divisions, because they are not accustomed to working in a home environment where teleconference facilities may be urgently required and the dependence on communication and coordination between employees is crucial. Another issue is that in the Department of Social Service there are no sanctions for civil servants who do not work under the guidance of WFH policy. In addition, knowledge and skills needed to operate and administer online services are still limited, affecting civil servants' ability in delivering a community’s public service needs. Hence, the implementation of WFH policy may not be effective in all types of public operations.",

          "abstract": "The strategic placement of pedestrian crossings is critical for promoting road safety in urban environments. While previous research has used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify underserved areas, existing approaches often fail to integrate empirical data with stakeholder expertise, or directly link road safety concerns with wider spatial equity considerations. This study develops a novel GIS-Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) framework to evaluate the suitability of sites for new pedestrian crossings, incorporating four key criteria: existing provision of pedestrian infrastructure, road safety risks, proximity to urban amenities, and socio-demographic vulnerability. Applied to Liverpool City Region as a policy case study, the framework integrates advanced spatial analysis techniques with stakeholder informed weights, to assess the suitability of postcodes for new pedestrian crossings. Site suitability scores are generated which reflect both the considerations relevant to key stakeholders, as well as the distribution of controlled pedestrian crossings, road traffic collisions, urban amenities and census-derived vulnerability indicators. The results reveal significant spatial inequalities where, specific locations with high socio-demographic vulnerability also experience the greatest road safety risks and poorest access to pedestrian crossings, despite proximity to essential services. The framework successfully pinpoints priority locations where road safety and spatial inequality concerns compounded negatively, providing evidence-based guidance for data-driven, stakeholder-informed pedestrian infrastructure investment.",

          "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes a mandatory component within business environment and in many cases a key competitive advantage, it is essential that business education evolves accordingly for preparing students for this new reality. This paper presents an approach aimed at integrating AI into business education through practical, global oriented assignments. \nWe have experimented with students working in teams to tackle real-world business challenges using AI tools and concepts. Their task was to analyze a specific business problem, design an AI-driven business model, and develop a prototype solution. The goal was to offer them not just theoretical insights, but a hands-on experience of how AI can support and transform business processes.\nThe research is based on students’ experimentation with AI techniques to solve business problems, combined with insights gathered through a follow-up survey. Further, a survey explored students’ views on the relevance of AI in business, the effectiveness of the assignment, and the skills they felt they developed through the process.\nThe findings suggest that this kind of applied, project-based learning has strong educational value. Students not only deepened their understanding of AI technologies but also gained confidence in using them creatively. \nOverall, this study contributes to the growing conversation about how business schools can better align their teaching with the realities of a rapidly evolving digital economy. It also offers practical suggestions for educators who wish to bridge the gap between academic theory and the demands of professional practice.",

In Germany, I argue early-age sorting across stratified schools is an opportunity boundary that excludes immigrants and that status uncertain German families defend it against reform. To test this, I introduce a 2010 referendum which blocked a reform to early-age sorting across schools in Hamburg and collect data from precinct-level votes, city-district demographics, election studies, and archival sources. Results show referendum support was highest in lower-income places and specific precincts with less access to academic schools and higher shares of immigrant children, among parents of school-age children without academic educations, and predicts future support for politicians who took positions against the reform. I suggest this theory also applies to different boundaries in both education and other fields, and that policies which reduce middle-class uncertainty can equalize opportunity better than technocratic reforms given boundary defense.",

          "abstract": "Much of the existing work on LGBT+ placemaking relies on qualitative or historical narratives, which lack the empirical precision to systematically evaluate the structural factors driving the presence and evolution of LGBT+ establishments over time. To address these shortcomings, my paper examines the spatial evolution of LGBT+ establishments in US cities between 1990-2000, using a novel panel dataset combining geocoded Damron Guide entries from Mapping the Gay Guides (MGG) with contextual data from the NHGIS/U.S. Census Bureau. Employing fixed-effects panel models and difference-in-differences frameworks, my analysis investigates how establishment-level and MSA-level factors predict the presence and turnover dynamics of LGBT+ establishments over time. My findings reveal that bars/clubs and erotic shops have a higher likelihood of presence in MSAs relative to accommodations. Theatre/entertainment venues exhibit higher entry and stability into MSA markets, whereas other establishment types face volatile turnover. I also find that the so-called “great cities,\" ubiquitous in works on LGBT+ placemaking, exhibit conditions favorable to the viability of LGBT+ establishments and yet exhibit no significant differences in turnover dynamics compared to other MSAs. My findings extend qualitative narratives by quantifying the impacts of economic changes, demographic shifts, and cultural influences, which should inform urban policy and advocacy efforts to sustain inclusive LGBT+ spaces amidst changing urban landscapes.",

I demonstrate the use of TEA through two applications: the effect of college completion on income gradient in health and the effect of college completion on issue alignment, using NLSY97 and GSS respectively. By exploring how treatments modify associations between outcomes, TEA offers a valuable tool for sociological research on inequality, stratification, and public opinion, providing insights into the mechanisms sustaining social inequalities and informing policy interventions.",

          "abstract": "While much progress has been made to understand what “globalization losers” want from future democracy, much less is known is about respective preferences of “globalization winners”, or cosmopolitans (representing the other side of the \"transnational cleavage\"). Given cosmopolitans’ active engagement in politics and society, their democratic preferences are decisive for future democratic reform both at the national and global level. This article investigates the heterogeneous governance preferences of German cosmopolitans. Acknowledging theoretical conceptions, the article defines cosmopolitanism as a multidimensional concept, and first empirically determines these dimensions as moral, cultural, institutional and anti-nationalist cosmopolitanism. These dimensions are connected to preferences for representative, technocratic and participatory forms of democracy. This shows that each cosmopolitanism dimensions implies distinct preferences. While nearly all dimensions relate positively to governance by experts (except for the anti-nationalist dimension), only the institutional dimension of cosmopolitanism is connected to significant and consistent support for representative government. There is strong disagreement on participatory forms of democracy. Moral cosmopolitanism is associated with an endorsement referendums and citizen assemblies, whereas the anti-nationalist dimension connects with the rejection of both. These results are explained by different values connected with moral and cultural cosmopolitanism on the one hand, and institutional and anti-national cosmopolitanism on the other.",

          "abstract": "How we remember our past can be shaped by the realities of our present. This study examines how changes to present circumstances influence retrospective reports of family income rank at age 16. While retrospective survey data can be used to assess the long-term effects of childhood conditions, present-day circumstances may “anchor” memories, causing shifts in how individuals recall and report past experiences. Using panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (8,602 observations from 2,883 individuals in the United States), we analyze how changes in objective and subjective indicators of current social status—income, financial satisfaction, and perceived income relative to others—are associated with changes in reports of childhood income rank, and how this varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Fixed-effects models reveal no significant association between changes in income and in childhood income rank. However, changes in subjective measures of social status show contrasting effects, as increases in current financial satisfaction are associated with decreases in childhood income rank, but increases in current perceived relative income are associated with increases in childhood income rank. We argue these opposing effects follow from theories of anchoring in recall bias. We further find these effects are stronger among males but are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. This demographic heterogeneity suggests that recall bias is not evenly distributed across the population and has important implications for how different groups perceive their own pasts. Our findings further highlight the malleability of retrospective perceptions and their sensitivity to current social conditions, offering methodological insights into survey reliability and recall bias.",

          "abstract": "Myanmar’s protracted conflict, intensified by the 2021 military coup, has severely disrupted formal education and deepened psychosocial needs among children. Community-led schools, established across ethnic regions both before and after the coup, have become vital in sustaining learning, cultural continuity, and psychosocial well-being. This paper reviews how trauma-informed practices and social-emotional learning (SEL) are integrated into these schools to address the layered effects of violence, displacement, and chronic instability. Evidence from Myanmar and global literature shows that predictable routines, culturally responsive pedagogy, and SEL activities help foster resilience, belonging, and recovery. Teachers play a dual role as educators and emotional supporters, while communities contribute through engagement and culturally rooted practices. The review also highlights key challenges, including limited resources, teacher well-being, and weak referral systems. These insights contribute to broader discussions on how education systems in fragile contexts can integrate academic and psychosocial support in sustainable, locally grounded ways.",

          "authors": "Elisabetta Adami",
          "abstract": "Addressing a gap in extant research on social media content creation, the paper presents a time-space-interaction analytical framework for the investigation of content creators’ development of practices through time and orchestration across the spaces of their online presence, cross-checked through interactions with followers. While the framework is potentially applicable to any research focus, the paper focuses its application on the analysis of translocal trajectories as entextualised in the semiotic practices of social media video-based food content creators. The application takes as a case study @foodqood, a food content creator based in Italy who gained megainfluencer status (with over 23 million followers on TikTok) and analyses the creator’s whole production on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The framework is structured along four analytical semiotic layers, i.e., the resources of the subject matter (food), the embodied and disembodied resources of the creator’s performance, the video-specific visual and auditory resources, and the resources in the paratext. The semiotic layers are considered by intertwining three dimensions of analysis, i.e., the creator’s trajectories through time, across the different social media platforms of their online presence, and in the interactions with followers. The findings show distinct phases in the creator’s development of practices, from experimentation to institutionalisation, and trace trajectories of the creator’s identity performances marked by distinctive strategies in the combined use of the three layers of semiotic resources; the development of these through time, across spaces and in relation to followers’ prompts reveals the creator’s shifting interests in terms of audience reaches, as well as a nuanced effort to appeal to different audience segments. The conclusions point to the usefulness of a social semiotic framework that includes a languaging perspective to observe transnational phenomena, and of such a time-space-interaction analysis to trace the complex dynamics of influence between practices from below and institutional ones, and between agency in sign-making choices and semiotic regime ideologies.",

          "abstract": "Democratic government relies on a great deal of voluntary participation from the population. This participation is not guaranteed, and when citizens are absent from the data collecting processes of the state, a missing data problem occurs. The co-occurrence of the Scottish local elections and the Scottish Census in 2022 provides an unusual opportunity to test hypotheses about common and context-specific drivers of civic non-participation. Using a geospatial approach, we show that ward-level census nonresponse is highly correlated with electoral abstention despite abstention being about five times more common than initial census nonresponse. Statistical modelling demonstrates strong common roles for deprivation and English-language speaking in driving the participation rates of a ward. Meanwhile relatively specific effects are shown for cohabitation in driving census response, and the proportion of young people in driving voting behaviour. We conclude that the similarity between these nonresponse processes represents an opportunity for improving practice in increasing response rates. For example, census “hard to count” indices can incorporate data from elections as “interim” predictions for low-response areas, and framing voting as a household duty, rather than an individual one, may improve turnout.",

          "abstract": "Traditional sources of population data, such as censuses and surveys, are costly, infrequent, and often unavailable in crisis-affected regions. Mobile phone application data offer near–realtime, high-resolution insights into population distribution, but their utility is undermined by unequal access to and use of digital technologies, creating biases that threaten representativeness. Despite growing recognition of these issues, there is still no standard framework to measure and explain such biases, limiting the reliability of digital traces for research and policy. We develop and implement a systematic, replicable framework to quantify coverage bias in aggregated mobile phone application data without requiring individual-level demographic attributes. The approach combines a transparent indicator of population coverage with explainable machine learning to identify contextual drivers of spatial bias. Using four datasets for the United Kingdom benchmarked against the 2021 census, we show that mobile phone data consistently achieve higher population coverage than major national surveys, but substantial biases persist across data sources and subnational areas. Coverage bias is strongly associated with demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic features, often in complex nonlinear ways. Contrary to common assumptions, multi-application datasets do not necessarily reduce bias compared to single-app sources. Our findings establish a foundation for bias assessment standards in mobile phone data, offering practical tools for researchers, statistical agencies, and policymakers to harness these datasets responsibly and equitably.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates journalists’ perceptions of how artificial intelligence (AI) affects disinformation risks within the news ecosystem. Drawing on a structured survey of 504 journalists in the Basque Country administered online and by telephone in May–June 2024, the study examines associations between perceived risk and professional variables, including experience and AI usage. Results show that 89.88% of respondents believe AI will considerably or significantly increase disinformation risks, a pattern consistent across genders and media types, though somewhat less pronounced among digital-native outlets. Experience matters: perceptions of risk rise with years in the profession. Conversely, intensive users of AI in the newsroom tend to report more moderate views of its harmful effects. The most frequently cited risks concern difficulties identifying false content and deepfakes, and the likelihood of obtaining inaccurate data; co-occurrence analysis indicates these concerns are commonly linked in journalists’ mental models. Additional worries include exposure to scams and biases related to data provenance. The paper argues for targeted AI literacy, ethical training, and transparent verification workflows to calibrate expectations and bolster resilience against information disorders. Overall, the findings underscore both the scale of perceived threat and the potential of professional familiarity to nuance risk assessments.",

          "abstract": "Ordered response scales are ubiquitous in economics, but their interpretation rests on an untested assumption: that numerical labels reflect equal psychological intervals. The contribution of this paper is to provide a systematic assessment of this linearity assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily empirical results can be overturned when it is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents use survey scales in ways that deviate from linearity, but only mildly so. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 40,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Coefficient signs are remarkably robust to the mild departures from linear scale-use we document experimentally. However, estimates of relative effect sizes, which are crucial for policy applications, are unreliable even under these modest non-linearities.",

          "abstract": "A caveat of much of the existing demographic literature is that it decomposes population change into the components of fertility, mortality, and migration, treating ageing merely as a consequence of natural change while neglecting the role of age structure in the observed dynamics. This study applies a scenario-based decomposition approach, using counterfactual scenarios for each factor of population change (fertility, mortality, migration, and age structure) to assess their individual contributions. The 37 NUTS-2 units of the Visegrád Group countries (Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary) were selected as units of analysis. The research focused on the origins of regional differences and on the explanatory role of age structure. The results indicate that differences at the regional scale cannot be attributed solely to national-level variation, as cross-border groupings also emerge in the cluster analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that initial age structure constitutes an independent and essential explanatory factor of population heterogeneity, both at the national and regional levels.",

          "abstract": "The 2023 judicial reform crisis in Israel intensified a growing democratic divide. This article employs a cultural-sociological lens to interpret the conflict as part of a broader struggle over national identity. Drawing on original panel survey data and Latent Class Analysis, it identifies five distinct nationalist belief clusters among Jewish Israelis that structured divergent responses to the reform initiative. A key cleavage separates those concerned about democratic backsliding from those endorsing majoritarian rule. This divide has heightened political polarization and reinforced alignment between national identity and party affiliation. Contrary to expectations, the October 7 Hamas attack did not unify the public but entrenched existing divisions. The article considers whether rising concern over democracy might catalyze a broad political realignment with implications for Israel’s democratic future.",

          "abstract": "Social democratic parties across Europe have increasingly adopted restrictive immigration rhetoric in response to radical right challengers' electoral successes. The consequences of accommodation remain contested. This paper leverages a pre-registered quasi-experimental design exploiting within-individual variation from as-good-as-random exposure to UK Labour leader Keir Starmer’s “Island of Strangers” speech -- a major rhetorical turn toward anti-immigration positions. We find that exposure significantly altered perceptions of Labour, making it appear more anti-immigration and right-leaning. Crucially, these shifts carried electoral costs: support for Labour declined within individuals following the speech. While we detect no corresponding gains for the radical right Reform UK party, there is also no evidence that Labour’s adoption of nativist rhetoric diminished Reform’s appeal. Our findings highlight the risks of strategic convergence, showing that accommodation of exclusionary rhetoric by social democratic parties is electorally costly for them rather than for their radical right competitors.",

          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Research on housing and populism has produced conflicting findings – evidence suggests declining housing affordability can have both a negative and positive association with populist support. Focusing on the UK, this paper argues these findings can be reconciled by decomposing the heterogeneous effects of housing affordability into distinct, but related, housing crises. Furthermore, it argues these crises will be related to political preferences through the interaction between geography and tenure. The paper hypothesises that homeowners in areas of high house prices will be less likely to hold populist political preferences due to a wealth effect that legitimises the existing socio-political system. By contrast, social renters in unaffordable areas will be more likely to support populism due to their higher likelihood of experiencing housing insecurity and as the scarcity of affordable housing will provide a conducive context in which to scapegoat immigrants. Analysis using data on local housing conditions and political preferences finds broad support for these hypotheses. The analysis finds that social renting in an area of widespread housing insecurity is positively associated with both opposition to immigration and voting for the Reform Party. It also finds that homeownership does negatively interact with local house prices in predicting attitudes to immigration, but the effect is to attenuate the positive association between house prices and opposition to immigration. This contradicts previous studies which may have been subject to omitted variable bias. No evidence is found for an interaction between homeownership and affordability in predicting support for the Reform Party. The paper contributes to an emergent research agenda around housing discontent and populism. It concludes with reflections on the future direction of this research agenda, suggesting there is value in measuring housing insecurity at the individual level, rather than as a contextual variable, and interrogating causality.",

          "abstract": "Analysing a speaker’s language, in particular their usage of certain vocabulary and grammatical structures, can give insights into their linguistic abilities and cognitive competence. Traditional approaches to characterising language production typically incorporate linguistic complexity metrics, which, while useful for various tasks such as learner proficiency evaluation and text readability assessment, have limited pedagogical relevance. There have been calls for more fine-grained annotations of linguistic structures in recent research, particularly in the field of second language acquisition (SLA), where grammar is a central part of second language (L2) learning. However, there is a lack of comprehensive tools for systematically analysing detailed grammatical structures. To address this gap, we present POLKE (Pedagogically-Oriented Language Knowledge Extractor), a tool for automatically annotating English grammar use based on the English Grammar Profile (EGP). In this paper, we introduce the POLKE system and outline the results of its evaluation, which yielded satisfactory results.",

Our results show that while politicians’ news visibility is positively associated with their popularity in Google search queries, this association is substantially stronger among MPs of ethnic minority background and female MPs.

          "abstract": "The expansion of higher educational systems in Western countries in the latter half of the 20th century is central to the reversal of the gender gap in education. In Norway, major reforms starting in the late 1960s aimed at making higher education more accessible for large segments of the population. This occurred through the establishment, upgrading, and gradual expansion of local colleges across the country, especially in female-dominated fields associated with work in expanding welfare sectors. Previous research has suggested that the gendered profile of educational expansions contributed to the cementing of horizontal gender segregation patterns in education and the labor market. We shed light on these processes using new and detailed data on the establishment and upgrading of higher educational institutions between 1969 and 1993. Linking these to individual-level register data, we study how regional variation in educational opportunities affected the educational attainment and field of study choices of young women and men, using an event study approach. While increased access to college education was a prerequisite for the reversal of the gender gap, our results suggest that the location of colleges had, at most, a very modest impact on local educational attainment and gendered field of study choices.",

          "abstract": "Problematic climate information affects public support for mitigation policies. Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. \nIn this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse.\nCluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests.\nFunded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

Much existing research in this area has focused exclusively on social work perspectives on interprofessional collaboration.

This article reports on a realist interview study which aimed to understand the mechanisms that underpin successful inter-agency collaboration in support of people experiencing self-neglect, and the barriers to achieving it. Based on semi-structured interviews with 78 practitioners from Adult Social Care, Health, Housing, Fire &amp; Rescue, and Environmental Health, 16 people with experience of self-neglect, and 2 family carers, the study proposes 9 principal programme theories of inter-agency dynamics under the headings of: policies and procedures; mutual inter-agency understandings of roles and task; keeping a collective shared focus on the person experiencing self-neglect; and support from management. It is argued that professional curiosity in safeguarding must be complemented by greater ‘inter-professional curiosity’ if inter-agency working is to fulfil its potential contribution to improving the lives of people experiencing self-neglect.",

This article advances a three-stage model of cohortization, in which salient events produce age differential changes in attitudes, elite cues drive identity-congruent political sorting, and life-course timing regulates whether these attitude changes remain persistent over time. Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 as a quasi-natural experiment, I test this model by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans using five surveys that collectively span from 2016 to 2024. The findings consistently show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement—much more so among younger than older individuals. Moreover, the changes persisted for younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization. This article integrates two classic—though largely partial—theories of political learning, offering a model for understanding how salient events can realign generational divides.",

We develop a game-theoretic model of liquidity provision that reveals a fundamental toxicity-competitiveness trade-off in LP decision-making, which shapes the equilibrium strategy. Specifically, while arbitrageurs' toxic swaps generate non-competitive payoffs that are independent of other LPs' strategies, noise traders' non-toxic swaps create competitive payoffs that depend on aggregate liquidity provision. We demonstrate that LP equilibrium payoffs under the concentrated liquidity mechanism increasingly outperform those without it as swap toxicity rises. However, when toxicity is substantially low, competitive pressure of concentrated liquidity can worsen LP payoffs. Our comparative statics analysis identifies several patterns that can guide LPs in adapting their strategies to market conditions.",

Grazie ad architetture\ncome il Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), questi sistemi non si limitano a\nindicizzare il web, ma lo sintetizzano per offrire soluzioni immediate.

          "abstract": "This paper analyzes how retailer competition affects the welfare implications of resale price maintenance (RPM) under demand uncertainty. We extend the classic model of Deneckere et al. (1997) by introducing imperfect competition among retailers, which creates tension between double marginalization and business-stealing effects. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes determined by demand uncertainty and market concentration. In highly uncertain, competitive markets, minimum RPM enhances efficiency by encouraging inventory holding. However, in markets with lower uncertainty or more concentrated retail sectors, maximum RPM better promotes competition by mitigating double marginalization. The effectiveness of each RPM type depends on whether retailers optimize for all demand states or focus primarily on high-demand scenarios. These findings suggest that antitrust authorities should evaluate RPM cases by considering both the level of demand uncertainty and the degree of retail competition, as different market conditions may call for different forms of vertical price restrictions. For managers, our results provide actionable guidance on selecting the appropriate RPM strategy based on market structure and demand predictability.",

          "abstract": "L’articolo esplora il ruolo del conflitto come risorsa nella costruzione di virtù collettive nei processi di innovazione tecnologica, con particolare attenzione all’intelligenza artificiale (IA). Piuttosto che essere considerato un ostacolo, il conflitto emerge come un momento generativo, in cui divergenze di valori, interpretazioni e interessi possono stimolare la riflessione critica e la creazione di norme condivise. Sfruttando il dialogo tra i classici della sociologia (Simmel, Durkheim, Weber, Bourdieu) e approcci contemporanei (MacIntyre, Boltanski &amp; Thévenot), e integrando la teoria delle virtù collettive, il conflitto diventa un motore per innovazioni etiche e socialmente responsabili. Il contributo evidenzia come la gestione efficace dei conflitti interni nei team di IA possa favorire la coesione, la responsabilità condivisa e l’apprendimento collettivo. Attraverso il caso della sanità pubblica, l’articolo mostra come le tensioni tra precisione algoritmica e diritti dei pazienti possano generare virtù collettive quali fiducia e trasparenza. La ricerca sottolinea l’importanza di trattare i conflitti come dispositivi generativi, in grado di allineare il progresso tecnologico con la sostenibilità sociale, proponendo un modello di conflitto che promuove un’innovazione etica e sostenibile.",

          "authors": "Khusnul Adi Wibowo; Muhammad Syaroni Rofii",
          "abstract": "The digitalization of the immigration system through the implementation of electronic visas ( e-Visa ) and Autogate was a strategic way for Indonesia in facing the increasingly complex challenges of international mobility. The digitalization in the immigration sector has been widely studied, research specifically analyzing its impact on Indonesia's national resilience is still very limited. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the implementation of e-Visa and Autogate at Soekarno-Hatta Airport on national resilience from a security, economic, and socio-political perspective, and to identify implementation challenges. This study used a qualitative method with a library research approach, analyzing various regulations, official documents, and related academic studies for the period 2020-2025. The results showed that the implementation of e-Visa and Autogate significantly accelerates the immigration administration process, strengthens border control, improves service efficiency, and supports the national economy by increasing tourist visits by 15%. There were many challenges such as cybersecurity risks, personal data protection, and maintaining technological infrastructure, which are serious obstacles. This research was important for providing strategic policy recommendations to ensure the effectiveness of the immigration digitalization system and strengthen national resilience in a sustainable manner.",

          "title": "Beyond the Reintegration: The Role of Women in Preventing CAAFAG in North Darfur",
          "authors": "Safa Yagoub",
          "abstract": "The recruitment of children into armed groups remains a critical yet under-researched issue in North Darfur, Sudan. While disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts have historically focused on post-recruitment responses, this study explores the overlooked role of women-led, community-based prevention strategies. Using a qualitative case study approach, the research draws on interviews, focus group discussions, and written narratives from 112 participants, including displaced women, civil society actors, and children associated with armed groups. The findings highlight the pivotal role of traditional female mediators—particularly the Hakamate—as cultural influencers who use oral storytelling to discourage recruitment and foster social cohesion. Despite their contributions, these women are systematically excluded from formal DDR frameworks and face structural barriers such as lack of funding, political marginalization, and security threats. This paper argues for a paradigm shift in child protection strategies: from reactive reintegration to proactive prevention, anchored in local knowledge and gender-inclusive policies. The study concludes that recognizing and supporting women’s preventive roles is essential for sustainable peacebuilding in conflict-affected regions like Darfur.",

          "authors": "Douglas Okeyo Bosire; Samuel Maina; Anne Muchemi",
          "abstract": "Microfinance banks have been critical players in enhancing financial deepening hence fostering socioeconomic development. Despite anchoring socioeconomic transformation and fostering societal wellbeing of households in Kenya, financial performance and sustainability of microfinance have been a concern to players in the industry. The study investigated the mediating effect of transformative capabilities in the nexus between late-mover strategies and the performance of Microfinance Banks. The anchoring theory was dynamic capability theory supported by the balanced scorecard model and theory of change. Positivism research philosophy was employed while integrating descriptive and explanatory research designs. The study population was 13 microfinance banks within Nairobi City County with a target population of 389-unit managers. The sample size was 197-unit managers. To select the sample size, both simple random sampling and stratified sampling were employed. Primary data was employed collected using semi-structured questionnaire. In ascertaining the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was adopted where a value of 0.7 and over indicated the tool is consistent. Validity was ascertained by using content, construct and face validity. Baron and Kenny techniques were employed to investigate mediating role of transformative capabilities on the association between late mover strategies and performance of microfinance banks. It was found out that transformative capabilities mediate the relationship between late movers' strategies and the performance of microfinance banks. The study recommends that mangers in charge of training should regularly organize in-service training, workshops, and seminars in collaboration with industry experts and regulatory bodies to strengthen employee competencies that are key in fostering performance.",

          "authors": "Qing Zhuang",
          "abstract": "Under the background of globalization and digital transformation, the teaching of Chinese for Trade and Economics urgently needs to achieve a paradigm shift from \"knowledge transfer\" to \"ability generation.\" This paper focuses on the hybrid teaching mode of \"Flipped Classroom + Case-Based Teaching\". Aiming at the core issue of \"learning-application contradiction\" in the teaching of Chinese for Trade and Economics, this paper takes \"unity of knowledge and action\" as the core concept, builds a \"Dual-Drive Empowerment\" model based on Cognitive Load Theory, Constructivist Learning Theory, and Situated Cognition and Learning Theory, integrates the Flipped Classroom (FC) and Case-Based Teaching (CBT) modes into a hybrid mode, and constructs a teaching pathway of \"online cognitive construction - offline action transformation - verification and reflection closed loop.\" In teaching, according to the specific process of \"three-stage and nine-step,\" the three-dimensional space of digital pre-class preparation, immersive case study in class, and practical task docking after class is integrated to actively enhance the efficiency of transforming learning into application, to try to provide a theoretical and practical solution for the reform of Chinese teaching for Trade and Economics.\nKeywords: Flipped Classroom; Case-Based Teaching; three-stage and nine-step; learning - application transformation; Chinese for Trade and Economics",

          "title": "Historic narrowing of employment gap post-pandemic, especially for people with cognitive disabilities",
          "authors": "Alan B Cobo-Lewis",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are underemployed. This improved recently, but how broadly across disability type? US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops.\nMETHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024.\nRESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category—but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state.\nCONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",
