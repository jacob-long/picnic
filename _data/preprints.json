          "authors": "Malik Oyewale Salami; Corinne McCumber; Jodi Schneider",
          "abstract": "Post-retraction citation may be partly due to authors’ and publishers' challenges in systematically identifying retracted publications. To investigate retraction indexing quality, we investigate the agreement in indexing retracted publications between 11 database sources, restricting to their coverage, resulting in a union list of 85,392 unique items. We also discuss common errors in indexing retracted publications. Our results reveal low retraction indexing agreement scores, indicating that databases widely disagree on indexing retracted publications they cover, leading to a lack of consistency in what publications are identified as retracted. Our findings highlight the need for clear and standard practices in the curation and management of retracted publications, in order to reduce inadvertent post-retraction citation and draw sound conclusions.",

          "authors": "Paweł Lenartowicz",
          "abstract": "Publication bias poses a serious challenge to the integrity of scientific research and meta-analyses. There exist persistent methodological obstacles for estimating this bias, especially with heterogeneous dataset, where studies vary widely in methodologies and effect sizes. To address this gap, I propose a Likelihood Ratio Test for Publication Bias, a statistical method designed to detect and quantify publication bias in datasets of heterogeneous studies results. I also show the proof-of-concept implementation developed in Python and simulations that evaluate the performance. The results demonstrate that this new method clearly outperforms existing methods like Z-Curve 2 and the Caliper test in estimating the magnitude of publication bias, showing higher precision and reliability, with still some space for improvement due to spotted errors in the implemented algorithm. While inherent challenges in publication bias detection remain, such as the influence of different research practices and the need for large sample sizes, the Likelihood Ratio Test offers a significant advancement in addressing these issues.",

          "title": "Learning a novel number system: The role of compositional rules &amp; counting procedures",
          "authors": "Sebastian Holt; David Barner",
          "abstract": "When children learn to count, they are exposed to a finite list of words, as well as rules for combining them - e.g., that any decade label, like “seventy” can be combined with the unit labels “one” through “nine”. Additive, multiplicative, and other rules allow the creation of indefinitely large numbers, beyond those that children experience directly in their input. However, while children begin to use number words by the age of 2, they generally don’t acquire rules for combining them until much later. One possible reason for this late learning of rules is that it exceeds the cognitive capacities of younger children, or depends on information acquired at earlier stages of learning. Another possibility, however, is that these rules are hard to learn because they’re not readily available in children’s input, and that other forms of input might lead to earlier learning. Here, we simulated the problem of number word learning in adult participants by training them on a series of artificial number “languages”. We find that (1) training adults on rote counting facilitates memory for number words, but (2) may actually inhibit the acquisition of rules that govern them. We also find that whereas additive rules are relatively easy to learn (e.g., the number after “twenty” is “twenty-one”), adults struggle to acquire new multiplicative rules (e.g., “seventy” is seven tens). Finally, we find that the size of a base - e.g., base 2 vs. base 5 - has little effect on learning when learned via a rote counting procedure, despite the fact that larger bases require more memorization of words, and provide less exposure to rules.",

          "abstract": "A recent trend in computational cognitive science is to use large-scale naturalistic data to evaluate cognitive theories (Griffiths, 2015; Jones, 2017). This article extends this work by examining the connection between social feedback and language usage. Social feedback, operationalized here as the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes on comments on the social media forum Reddit, provides a unique opportunity to investigate how social approval interacts with linguistic behavior. To accomplish this, social feedback ratings from over 400 billion words of comments from the social media forum Reddit were mined. Two types of corpora were formed: 1) large (approximately 1.7 billion words) combined corpora of positive, negative, and neutral comments, and 2) individual corpora from over 1,500 high-level commenters on Reddit (following recent work by Johns, 2021a, 2023, 2024a,b using individualized language models). Both were used to examine social feedback and language usage across multiple sets of lexical organization and lexical semantic data with distributional modeling techniques. It was found that comments that receive positive social feedback tended to align more closely with normative language usage, suggesting that the acceptability of a communicative message may lie in the form of that utterance and not just the content of it. Additionally, this trend was replicated at the individual level, where commenters who had more normative usage of language generally received more positive ratings on their comments.",

          "authors": "Jeffrey Cockburn; Weilun Ding; Sarah Oh; Caroline J Charpentier; Jamie D. Feusner; Reza Tadayonnejad; John O'Doherty",
          "abstract": "The mechanisms by which humans select or arbitrate between different reinforcement-learning (RL) and decision making strategies remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the very nature of the strategies being utilized has come under recent debate. To address these questions we developed a novel variant of the standard two-step decision task and deployed it through multiple large-sample studies. We found that humans rely on at least three forms of uncertainty to drive the arbitration process: transition uncertainty, model-free reward prediction uncertainty and model-based reward-prediction uncertainty. However, these distinct arbitration mechanisms were heterogeneously deployed across individuals depending on which core strategies individuals relied on. Some individuals behaved in a manner consistent with model-free control, others were predominantly model-based, while others exhibited a mixture of the two strategies. These individuals exhibiting RL behavior can be further distinguished from another group that do not exhibit RL-like behavior at all. Each of these distinct strategy repertoires were related to behavioral trait phenotypes that are dissociable with respect to compulsivity and impulsivity, suggesting they are indexing meaningful individual differences.  Individuals differed fundamentally in the nature of the strategies that they arbitrated over depending on their core strategy repertoire: while some relied only on model-based control and arbitrated between different task models, others actively switched between model-based and model-free control. Our findings thus suggest that human reinforcement-learning varies considerably across individuals both in terms of the variables used to drive arbitration and the strategies being arbitrated over. While this complexity entails methodological challenges, it heralds new opportunities for attaining a deeper understanding of the nature of individual differences in human reinforcement-learning in both health and disease.",

          "abstract": "From at least age 6 children consider what someone could have done when judging their actions. Children are more lenient in their judgments of others’ actions if there was no other choice but to cause a bad outcome, as compared to when there was another choice available that would have avoided a bad outcome. Here we explore if children also consider knowledge of one’s options when judging actions. That is, are children equally lenient if someone makes a bad choice because they didn’t know another option was available? We tested children in China (N = 133), India (N = 133) and the USA (N = 146) aged between 5 and 10. We told children stories about three characters who either 1) had a choice and caused a bad outcome; 2) had no choice but to cause a bad outcome and 3) do not know they had a choice, and caused a bad outcome. Broadly, we find that children across all countries are more lenient of bad actions when characters in the story did not know they had another choice available. Overall, these findings provide evidence that children consider what others didn’t know, as well as what they couldn’t do, when judging their actions.",

          "abstract": "Knowing when to trust and incorporate the advice from artificially intelligent (AI) systems is of increasing importance in the modern world. Research indicates that when AI provides confidence ratings, human users often correspondingly increase their trust in such judgments, but these increases in trust can occur even when AI fails to provide accurate information on a given task. In this piece, we argue that measures of metacognitive sensitivity provided by AI systems will likely play a critical role in (1) helping individuals to calibrate their level of trust in these systems, and (2) optimally incorporate advice from AI into human-AI hybrid decision- making. We draw upon a seminal finding in the perceptual decision-making literature which demonstrates the importance of metacognitive ratings for optimal joint decisions and outline a framework to test how different types of information provided by AI systems can guide decision- making.",

          "abstract": "Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) is an evidence-based yoga intervention that has been used as an effective adjunct treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous research has focused on TCTSY offered in group settings. The present study examined experiences of individuals practicing TCTSY one-to-one (i.e., one client, one TCTSY facilitator). Study aims were to: (1) learn about participants’ experiences with and reasons for attending one-to-one TCTSY; (2) describe and compare participants’ experiences between group and one-to-one yoga settings; (3) explore participants’ perceptions of the impacts of TCTSY on their trauma healing; and (4) document participants’ intentions for continued one-to-one TCTSY use. Semistructured interviews were offered to participants at completion of a longitudinal observational study of one-to-one TCTSY; 4 of the 10 participants agreed to be interviewed. Interviewees were located in the United States and self-reported experiencing childhood trauma and a current PTSD diagnosis. Following the consensual qualitative research method, domains were initially created deductively by the team. Adjustments, as well as categories and core ideas, were created inductively. Results indicated that participants: (1) preferred one-to-one over groups because of perceived safety and comfort; (2) had positive experiences with TCTSY; (3) perceived biopsychosocial benefits from the practice and described using TCTSY principles outside of sessions; and (4) intended to practice indefinitely. This study provided insight to the lived experiences of participants who use TCTSY as complementary care. Yoga facilitators and clinical trauma care providers are recommended to collaborate to offer one-to-one somatic-based approaches to create more access options for trauma healing.",

          "authors": "Guofang Ren; Ruyi Liu; Lijing Guo; Dan Nie; Jinru Chen; Chaoxiong Ye",
          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is crucial for temporarily holding and manipulating visual information but is limited in capacity, necessitating effective distractor filtering. Previous studies indicate differential effects of distractors appearing during encoding and delay stages, but how stimulus presentation duration influences these effects remains unclear. We conducted two experiments to investigate the role of stimulus presentation duration on VWM performance under different distraction conditions. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks for memorizing three target orientations under four conditions: no-distraction, encoding-distraction, full-distraction, and delay-distraction, with short (200 ms) and long (1000 ms) presentation durations. Experiment 2 extended these findings by examining the role of distractor-target similarity, introducing both same-category (orientation) and different-category (face) distractors. In Experiment 1, high-precision tasks showed impairment from both encoding- and delay-stage distractors during short durations, while only delay-stage distractors persisted with longer durations. For low-precision tasks, delay-stage distractors consistently impaired VWM performance, whereas encoding-stage distractions had a lesser effect. Experiment 2 revealed that short-duration delay-stage distractors impaired VWM regardless of type, while long-duration same-category distractors impaired performance during delay stages, and different-category distractors had a lesser effect. The results demonstrate that stimulus presentation duration critically modulates distractor impact. Longer durations enable more stable VWM consolidation, aiding in resisting delay-stage distractions, while homogeneous distractors remain more challenging to filter compared to heterogeneous distractors. This differential effect suggests that VWM filtering mechanisms are sensitive to both presentation duration and distractor-target similarity. Our findings highlight the importance of stimulus presentation duration in VWM distractor filtering and suggest that effective resistance to distractors depends on both consolidation time and distractor similarity. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics and mechanisms underlying distractor processing in VWM.",

          "abstract": "We examined the familiarity and popularity of epistemically suspect claims (misinformation and conspiracy theories) about COVID-19 and their associations with cognitive and social factors in a representative population sample (N=1,077, Mage = 51.45, SDage = 16.58) of people living in Finland during the pandemic (September 2021-January 2022). Of cognitive factors, pseudoscientific beliefs, lower scores on the actively open-minded thinking scale, and higher preference for anecdotal information were related to increased tendency to believe in epistemically suspect claims related to COVID-19. Of social factors, lower trust in governmental institutions and science and scientists, and the use of alternative media were associated with the endorsement of epistemically suspect claims about COVID-19. Men were more likely to endorse epistemically suspect claims than women, and the support decreased with age. The present results suggest that epistemically suspect beliefs about COVID-19 are not generally common among the Finnish population. The results suggest that battling the spread of health-related misinformation, like COVID-19 conspiracy theories, may require actions that target different cognitive and social factors, such as the thinking style of individuals; trust felt towards governmental institutions, science, and mainstream media; and the content circulating in social and alternative media.",

However, it is not well understood how these patterns affect, and are affected by, brain activation for domain-general cognitively demanding tasks. Here, we employ a novel task-driven resting-state electroencephalography design including an implicit Lindenmayer grammar learning task, which tracks aperiodic and hierarchical dependencies, to determine task-related functional connectivity changes in bilinguals. Quantified bilingual experience was used as a predictor of directional effects, using Generalised Additive Models to account for non-linear patterns. Our results revealed whole-brain post-task alterations to connectivity, including increased involvement of bilateral temporal and posterior regions and reduced involvement of frontal regions. Crucially, greater bilingual experience was associated with more distributed processing, suggesting enhanced efficiency. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how domain-general processing and connectivity are shaped by linguistic experience.",

          "authors": "Pericle Raverta; Irene Sandi; Barbara Martin; Barbara Loera",
          "abstract": "The gradual emergence of cultivated meat (CM) products on the market framed as sustainable alternatives to conventional animal-source foods makes it essential to examine the psychological barriers and predisposing factors that influence consumer acceptance. Familiarity is frequently suggested as a facilitating factor, based on the premise that increased familiarity with CM enhances acceptance. However, the evidence is contradictory and poorly integrated. This review aims to examine and organize the existing literature on the role of familiarity in consumer acceptance of CM. \nA scoping review of current peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted, on June 7, 2024, following PRISMA-ScR and Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed across Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycInfo, with no restrictions on participant type, geographic location, social and cultural contexts, language, or publication time, enhancing the review's inclusivity and sensitivity. The 63 articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed to examine (i) definitions of familiarity, (ii) methodologies used to measure familiarity with CM, and (iii) evidence obtained regarding its role in the context of consumer acceptance of CM. Results indicated that current research on familiarity with CM shares limitations with the broader literature on CM acceptance, particularly concerning the non-representativeness of evidence and inconsistent approaches to constructs' operationalization. Furthermore, familiarity is often used synonymously with related yet distinct constructs of awareness and knowledge, highlighting a lack of clarity in literature. The review also identified various approaches to assess familiarity, all lacking psychometric rigor, which hinder the replicability and comparability of findings. By unfolding the methodologies and evidence surrounding familiarity with CM, this review suggests further research to better specify the theoretical and operational definition of the familiarity construct and its relation with consumer acceptance of CM.",

For politically neutral content (Study 1), the perceived truthfulness increased with a higher proportion of likes. However, for partisan content (Study 2), the perceived truthfulness remained unchanged by the proportion of likes but was higher for content aligning with the participants' political views. Strikingly, across both studies, the tendency to like and share content – whether neutral or partisan – increased with the proportion of likes and the political alignment of the endorsers.

          "abstract": "The term “afterglow“ was first used to describe the heightened mood, relaxation, and overall sense of tranquility reported by individuals hours or even days after the use of psychedelics, after their most immediate effects had dissipated. The use of the word “afterglow” was then extended to similar states achieved after other altered-state experiences. Even though the afterglow effect is widely reported anecdotally, not much quantitative research has been undertaken on it and none at all explicitly related to Floatation-REST (Reduced Environmental Stimulation Technique). In Floatation-REST an individual floats almost weightlessly on the surface of thermoneutral, supersaturated salt water in a quiet, dark tank. Using a within-subject crossover design, 34 healthy subjects were randomized to 60 min of Floatation-REST or 60 min of Bed-REST, a control condition where one lies supine on a waterbed in a dark, quiet room. We assessed the experience during the REST conditions as well as regarding the alleged afterglow effect following a 10-minute period of silence after exposure to the conditions. Floatation-REST led to weaker body boundaries, stronger time distortion, and more relaxation, as experienced during the conditions. After Floatation-REST exposure, individuals reported a stronger feeling of afterglow as measured with an afterglow inventory, more state mindfulness, and more interoceptive awareness. A mediation analysis revealed that the relaxation experienced during Floatation-REST completely mediates the afterglow effect: The feeling of afterglow follows from a specific increase in relaxation during floating. Our findings support prior research on psychedelics by showing that Floatation-REST produces qualitatively similar effects. This very first study sets the ground for future studies on the afterglow effect for longer time increments after altered-state experiences.",

We performed this analysis by applying a general additive mixed regression model (GAMM) to reveal intricate, non-linear interaction effects, especially those of the three linguistic distance measures we applied, and, more in particular, to map the changing role of morphological distance in relation to lexical and phonological distance. All three distances contributed in explaining L2 English country scores: the larger the distance is the lower L2 English proficiency. Morphological distance delivers its own, distinctive contribution, next to and in competition with the lexical and phonological distances. All three distances interact with year of testing. These changes seem to reflect the increasing presence and dominance of L2 English worldwide, but it shows at the same time that the impact of distance is dynamic. Morphological and phonological properties become more important the higher the L2 proficiency is, while the importance of lexical distance gradually decreases.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Buttlar; Anna Lambrich; Linda McCaughey; Iris K. Schneider",
          "abstract": "People regularly have to navigate decisions in which they feel ambivalent, for instance, regarding unhealthy food, recycling, or financial investments. It is assumed that people cope with such felt ambivalence by seeking information that sway their ambivalent attitudes about these topics. However, empirical evidence for this proposition is scarce because most study measure information seeking intentions instead of behavior. As such, it remains doubtful whether information seeking indeed helps people to reduce felt ambivalence while making decisions. To test this proposition, we adapted a sample-based information seeking paradigm that enabled us to measure actual information seeking behavior in financial decisions. In three pre-registered studies (total N = 365 participants; k = 10.519 decisions), we demonstrated that when people feel ambivalent about an initial set of information about a stock, they seek more information about its development to decide whether it develops positively or negatively; this information seeking, in turn, helps them to reduce felt ambivalence when making the decision. This supports a central proposition in ambivalence research, indicating that people can indeed solve their felt ambivalence through information seeking. However, our data also showed that the effect of information seeking on felt ambivalence did not depend on whether the sought information was actually able to resolve the attitudinal basis of the conflict. Future research should, therefore, examine whether and how information seeking as a problem-focused coping strategy may also impact attitude strength more generally, and whether information seeking can serve as an emotion-focused coping strategy to reduce conflict-induced discomfort.",

Using context-driven picture naming, we examined whether (a) speakers preplan lexical-semantic and phonological information at the word level in constraining sentential contexts, and (b) phonological preplanning encompasses the whole word. Analysis of naming response times (RTs) showed that constraining contexts enable preplanning of both lexical-semantic and phonological representations (Experiment 1). Using a picture-word interference version of the same task (Experiment 2), we found that speakers preplan the phonological form of the whole word, however, only the subset of constraining trials with the shortest RTs indicated preplanning. The results confirm previous findings from turn-taking, which suggested that speakers can complete later stages of lexical access in advance, but also highlight that the presence of preplanning varies from trial to trial.",

          "abstract": "Response Surface Analysis (RSA) allows researchers to study whether the degree of congruence between two predictor variables is related to a potential psychological outcome. Here, we adapt RSA to the case in which the two predictor variables whose  congruence is of interest refer to individual differences in within-person associations (WPAs) between variables that fluctuate over time. For example, a WPA-congruence hypothesis in research on romantic relationships could posit that partners are happier when they have similar social reactivities – that is, when they have similarly strong WPAs between the quantity of their social interactions and their momentary well-being. One method for testing a WPA-congruence hypothesis is a 2-step approach in which the individuals' WPAs are first estimated as random slopes in respective multilevel models, and then these estimates are used as predictors in a regular RSA. As an alternative, we suggest combining RSA with multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) by specifying the WPAs as random slopes in the structural equation and using their latent second-order terms to predict the outcome on Level 2. We introduce both approaches and provide and explain their corresponding computer code templates. We also compared the two approaches with a simulation study and found that the MSEM model – despite its complexities (e.g., nonlinear functions of latent slopes) – has advantages over the 2-step approach. We conclude that the MSEM approach should be used in practice. We demonstrate its application using data from a daily diary study and offer guidance for important decisions (e.g., about standardization).",

          "abstract": "Background: Imagery rescripting (ImRs) and imaginal exposure (IE) are both effective for treating distressing memories. ImRs is thought to promote mastery and positive memory revaluation, while emotion tolerance is seen as a key factor in exposure models. This study investigated emotional responses and PTSD analogue symptoms in an analogue design and explored mastery and emotion tolerance as potential mediators. \nMethods: 154 participants (46.8% male) selected a distressing autobiographical event and received a brief analogue of ImRs or IE, delivered via pre-recorded audio instructions, or a control condition. Emotional responses, distress, PTSD analogue symptoms, sense of mastery and emotion tolerance were assessed before and after memory reactivation and post-intervention. \nResults: Mixed-effects analysis indicated unique positive changes in self-conscious and positive emotions as well as sense of mastery following ImRs – but only in males, whereas females improved across all conditions. In contrast, IE led to significantly different increases in anger and memory distress. Changes in fear, distress, PTSD analogue symptoms and emotion tolerance did not differ across conditions. Multiple parallel mediation analyses yielded that mastery, but not tolerance, mediated positive emotional shifts in ImRs. There was no evidence to support emotion tolerance as a mechanism of change in IE. \nConclusion: Our results cautiously support the hypothesis that ImRs leads to positive memory revaluation but not that emotion tolerance mediates changes in IE. We discuss possible explanations for the gender differences and point out shortcomings in procedure and measurement that may explain the unexpected findings in IE.",

          "abstract": "We employed a modified battery of cognitive and social tests from psychological sciences intended to reflect key components of teamwork. These tests were given to five instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to examine the capabilities of LLMs to contribute to teamwork. Our results revealed concrete strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to engage in teaming behaviours. Language models performed well on action phases of teamwork, where a team engages in specific work tasks such as monitoring and coordination to meet team goals. In contrast, LLMs lacked the abstract reasoning and planning required to meet transition phases of teamwork. These moments are critical for self-reflection of past performance and planning for upcoming tasks in teams. Finally, LLMs had unique behaviours for interpersonal aspects of teamwork, predominately applying an integrating motivational style but failing to acknowledge negative emotional states of teammates. These findings reveal how ‘off-the-shelf’ LLMs may contribute to contemporary human-AI teams and highlight the utility of experimental psychology in elucidating behaviours of non-embodied agents.",

Other effects of exposure to conspiracy information were mixed. In Study 1, reading about an agricultural biotechnology conspiracy had a small significant effect on reducing intentions to eat Genetically Modified food. In Study 2, exposure to a conspiracy involving biobank scientists decreased support for biobanks, mediated by decreased trust in biobank scientists. In Study 3, this conspiracy had no effect on wider beliefs of the role of science in society (science populism), nor support of Genetically Modified food-promoting policies. Overall, we found that exposure to conspiracies involving scientific claims increased conspiracy belief endorsement and can further negative effects. However, the effects of conspiracies on science populism appears limited.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change presents an intergenerational challenge, with its most severe impacts expected to affect future generations if current society fails to take action. Intergenerational psychology–specifically how people think about and care for future generations–has emerged as a critical driver of pro-environmental engagement, transcending demographic and ideological barriers. Insights from ethical philosophy, political philosophy, and behavioral economics further underscore the importance of intergenerational approaches in addressing environmental issues. We review the recent research on psychological interventions, legacy motivations, the principles of intergenerational responsibility, and behavior in economic games in the context of pro-environmental engagement. Broadly, this research has shown promise in promoting climate action across diverse populations through intergenerational framings. Importantly, intergenerational approaches not only inspire individual responsibility but also foster collective efforts toward sustainable solutions. Despite considerable emerging research, we point towards gaps in the literature for future research to address. Namely, there is a need for more research exploring the enduring impacts of intergenerational interventions using randomized controlled trials with longitudinal designs and examining their potential in promoting resilience and justice in the face of climate change. In sum, we conclude that addressing both climate change mitigation and adaptation through an intergenerational lens could be key to protecting the environment–not only for the present generation, but for the many future generations to come.",

Second, we explore the role of the brain’s emotional and decision-making systems in motivating climate action.

          "abstract": "What characteristics make a person a formidable competitor or a threatening rival? Regardless of the realm of competition, a rival’s perceived level of competitive threat should comprise both rival willingness and ability to compete for a mutually desired outcome. We apply this logic to heterosexual women’s intrasexual mating competition, where women compete for male mates primarily in the domains of sexual accessibility and physical attractiveness—characteristics men value in female partners. Specifically, we leverage a basic task analysis to identify two central components driving perceptions of women’s mating threat: their competitive intent (i.e., willingness to compete for mates, cued by mate-seeking behavior) and their competitive capacity (i.e., ability to attract mates, cued by physical attractiveness). We predicted that a) mate-seeking behavior (e.g., flirting) would drive perceptions of women’s competitive intent, while b) physical attractiveness would drive perceptions of women’s competitive capacity. However, some behavior (e.g., wearing revealing clothing) can impact perceptions of women’s mate-seeking behavior and attractiveness, simultaneously shaping perceptions of women’s competitive intent and capacity (and thus competitive threat). As such, we further predicted that c) appearance enhancement drives perceptions of target women’s mating threat via multiple routes. We find support for these predictions across three experiments with U.S. college students (N=1169), a demographic engaged in high mating competition. Across studies, we also explored how women's perceived competitive intent and capacity affect women targets’ potential social outcomes, including being targeted for intrasexual aggression, and opportunities for intrasexual friendships. Findings provide a framework to guide future work on women’s sociality.",

          "abstract": "This study compared the size weight illusion (SWI) and object lifting kinematics between physical and virtual conditions, shedding light on the nuanced disparities in perception and action across different environmental mediums. We examined whether prior expectations about object weight based on size cues, which affect the experience of real-world object interactions, are different in virtual reality (VR). Employing a highly realistic virtual environment with precisely-matched visual size and haptic cues, we tested the hypothesis that VR, which may be experienced as uncertain, unfamiliar, or unpredictable, would induce a smaller SWI due to a diminished effect of prior expectations. Participants (N=25) reported the felt heaviness of lifted objects that varied in both volume and mass in physical reality and a VR environment. Reach and lift kinematics, and self-reported presence, were also recorded. Our findings showed no differences between how participants perceived the SWI between real and virtual environments, although there was a trend towards a smaller illusion in VR. Contrary to our predictions, participants who experienced more presence in VR did not experience a larger SWI, but the inverse relationship was observed. Notably, differences in reach velocities between physical and virtual conditions suggested a more controlled approach in VR. These findings highlight the intricate relationship between immersion and sensorimotor processes in virtual environments, emphasising the need for deeper exploration into the underlying mechanisms that shape human interactions with immersive technologies, particularly the prior expectations associated with virtual environments.",

          "abstract": "Remembering the unfolding of past episodes usually takes less time than their actual duration. Recent work measuring the time required to mentally replay videos suggests that such temporal compression emerges when continuous events become too long to be fully held in working memory. However, in this previous research, the time needed to initiate the mental replay (i.e., to mentally visualize the starting point of events) was not taken into account. In the current study, we developed a corrected measure of remembering duration that controls for this initiation time to better characterize working memory capacity in representing continuous event. Using this corrected measure, we assessed the time needed by participants to mentally replay videos depicting continuous events (e.g., turning a car jack) lasting 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 s. The results showed  that events longer that 3-s were remembered in less time than their actual duration, suggesting  that working memory is limited in its capacity to represent continuous events, leading to the emergence of temporal compression when they exceed 3 s. Exploratory analyses further revealed that faster mental replay tended to be judged less dynamic but not less clear, suggesting that the temporal compression of continuous events likely results from an incomplete remembering of event’s unfolding rather than a complete but imprecise mental replay.",

However, it remains unclear which features and attributes are driving the assignment into human and non-human categories. To explore this issue, we ran a series of five preregistered experiments wherein we presented stimuli that varied in their appearance (i.e., humans, humanoid robots, non-human primates, mannequins, hammers, musical instruments) and asked participants to complete a match-to-category task (Experiments 1-2-3), a priming task (Experiment 4), or to rate each category along four dimensions (i.e., similarity, liveliness, body association, action association; Experiment 5). Results indicate that categorising human bodies and humanoid robots requires the integration of both the analyses of their physical shape and visual texture (i.e., to identify a humanoid robot we cannot only rely on its visual shape). Further, our behavioural findings suggest that human bodies may be represented as a special living category separate from non-human animal entities (i.e., primates). Moreover, results also suggest that categorising humans and humanoid robots may rely on a network of information typically associated to human being and inanimate objects respectively (e.g., humans can play musical instruments and have a mind while robots do not play musical instruments and do have not a human mind). Overall, the paradigms introduced here offer new avenues through which to study the perception of human and artificial agents, and how experiences with humanoid robots may change the perception of humanness along a robot—human continuum.",

          "abstract": "This work examines organizational-level inclusion signals and their subsequent effects on employees. Answering the call for more research on concealable stigmatized identities, we consider the effect of such organization-level inclusion signals for sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees) while also considering the effect on non-target employees. In a time-lagged observational study (N = 1,165 ), archival data (N = 229), and a randomized experiment (N = 380), we show that organizational-level inclusion efforts lead to more positive perception of the organization’s psychological climate for sexual and gender minorities, closing the psychological safety gap between non-LGBT and LGBT employees.. Notably, these intentional inclusion efforts also benefit non-LGBT employees, which contradicts recent theoretical assertions that intentional inclusion can harm majority groups, or that organizational inclusion is a zero-sum game.These signals shaped positive behavioral intentions for all employees, leading to non-LGBT employees engaging in more individual ally work, and LGBT employees feeling more free to share their identities. Unexpectedly, inclusion signals even made non-LGBT employees less likely to conceal intimidating parts of their identity (e.g. religion, parental status) as well. In sum, we show that such signaling improves psychological safety for all employees, reducing or eliminating the deficit between target and non-target employees while also encouraging value-aligned positive behaviors.",

Although the dialogic aspects of human cognition are the most explicit in inner speech, some authors have argued that other types of mental activity can be (or always are) dialogic. In this paper, we introduce two dimensions of dialogism—strength and depth—and present a particularly deep form of dialogism of the mind. We provide one possible interpretation of deep dialogism from the developmental perspective. Further, we show how this form of dialogism has important payoffs for explaining the mechanisms and the phenomenology of human psychological experiences in general and mental health conditions in particular.",

          "abstract": "The ability to accurately perceive gaze direction is an essential social skill but is impaired across psychopathologies exhibiting social dysfunction (e.g., schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder). Disrupted sensory processing and self-referential processing may both lead to aberrant gaze perception, but their respective contributions in different psychopathologies are unclear. A general population sample of 122 participants completed an online psychophysical gaze perception task and a battery of psychopathology traits questionnaires. Participants viewed face images with 9 gaze angles, superimposed with 3 levels (no, low, high) of sensory noise and in 2 (forward, deviated) head orientations, and indicated perceived self-directed gaze (yes/no) to each face. Psychophysical properties of the gaze perception curve (width, threshold) indexed perceptual imprecision and self-referential bias, respectively. Decreased precision was associated with higher autism traits but with lower social anxiety, supporting differential contributions of sensory processing among psychopathology dimensions. Subjects showed decreased precision and increased self-referential bias, when viewing stimuli with added visual noise or incongruent gaze-head directions, resembling the performance observed in patients with schizophrenia in the literature. Additionally, higher levels of social anxiety statistically predicted a greater decrease in precision when sensory noise was added. Experimental findings are discussed in relation to the experimental psychopathology literature and in the context of self-referential gaze perception as an adaptive default in ambiguous contexts. Overall, this work enhances our basic scientific understanding of the cognitive components that contribute to gaze perception, while advancing our knowledge of how these components are disrupted as a function of subclinical psychopathology.",

However, few studies have investigated associations between state authenticity and interpersonal context. We investigated state authenticity during social interactions as rated on smartphone surveys by a large community sample of adults (N = 493; 21,299 observations). Results from multilevel structural equation models showed that higher state authenticity was associated with higher ratings of one’s own dominance, affiliation, and positive affect, and lower negative affect. Also, higher state authenticity was associated with higher ratings of others’ affiliation and positive affect, lower dominance and negative affect, and higher interpersonal complementarity. Associations between authenticity and interpersonal characteristics held when controlling for affect. Results support SDT and CIIT that state authenticity is associated with social situations in which the individual’s agency and affiliation is complemented by others’ submissive and affiliative behavior.",

          "authors": "Frances Wang; Brooke S. G. Molina; Sarah Pedersen; Deepa Thomas",
          "abstract": "Background: Pre-clinical research suggests that a propensity to more rapidly adapt to the effects of alcohol could be an important risk factor for AUD with implications for novel etiologic discoveries and intervention development. Unfortunately, research translating this work to humans is scarce. We tested whether adults’ self-perceptions of rapidly developing alcohol tolerance upon the onset of regular drinking predicted an increased risk of AUD symptoms (excluding tolerance). We controlled for several potential confounders including established measures of current alcohol tolerance, initial subjective response to alcohol, heavy drinking, sex, race, and age. Methods: Participants were heavily drinking adults who completed an online survey (N=160; M(SD)=32.24(9.30) years old; 56.3% Black, 43.8% White; 55% Female, 45% Male). Participants reported, on a 5-point scale, the extent to which “my tolerance to alcohol seemed to build up very quickly once I started drinking frequently.” Initial subjective response was measured as the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects during the first five drinking experiences and acquired tolerance as the difference between current and initial subjective response. Participants also reported on their DSM-related AUD symptoms, several indicators of past year alcohol consumption, and demographic characteristics. Results: Hierarchical linear regression revealed that perceived rapid tolerance growth uniquely predicted AUD symptoms (excluding tolerance) after controlling for initial subjective response, acquired tolerance, DSM-related tolerance, heavy drinking, race, sex, and age. Conclusions: Individuals who have a natural predisposition towards rapidly increasing alcohol tolerance may be at increased risk for AUD. In the future, prospective research on this topic could help uncover a novel AUD risk factor with neurobiological underpinnings, advancing research on the etiology, treatment, and prevention of AUD.",

          "abstract": "When pursuing personal goals, individuals may experience fluctuations in goal-related dimensions like commitment and enjoyment. We present an approach to describe, analyze, and explain such within-person variability. In Part I, we determined to which extent within-person variability over time contributes to the total variability in goal dimensions, including between-person and between-goal variability. We observed strongest variability between goals, followed by variability over time, and between persons. In Part II, we estimated the within-person variability for each goal dimension using the indices dispersion (individual standard deviation), instability (root of squared successive differences), and inertia (autoregressive parameter). Dispersion was above-average for goal facilitation and progress and below-average for external motivation, value, and demand. Instability was above-average for facilitation and progress and below-average for commitment and demand. Inertia was above-average for facilitation and below-average for progress. Highlighting the relevance of self-regulatory competencies, we found that, when excluding outliers with extremely high variability, people with higher trait self-control, higher conscientiousness, and lower neuroticism showed lower variability. Both higher levels of trait self-control and conscientiousness predicted lower instability and higher inertia of goal dimensions. Conversely, higher neuroticism predicted higher dispersion and instability. We discuss these findings in the context of the Cybernetic Big Five theory.\nKeywords: Variability, goals, self-regulation, self-control, conscientiousness",

          "abstract": "Daily, we perform activities in the presence of others (e.g., office work). While it's well-established that the mere presence of others can influence our performance, it is less clear whether others' performance, rather than just their presence, influences us. To address this, we performed a replication of Desender et al.’s (2015) study, Is mental effort contagious?, and conducted a second experiment to follow up on our failure to replicate their findings. Desender et al. used a modified joint Simon task where two participants performed side by side. The manipulated participant completed an easy (mostly congruent trials) and a difficult (mostly incongruent trials) block, while the neutral participant completed two neutral blocks (equal proportion of congruent and incongruent trials). They found that the neutral participant mirrored the manipulated participants’ mental effort, exerting more effort when the latter performed a difficult versus an easy task. In both Experiment 1 (exact replication; N = 176) and Experiment 2 (more demanding joint Simon task; N = 120), we failed to replicate this result despite the fact that the manipulated participants adjusted their mental effort as expected. We identified several methodological concerns regarding the original study, such as participants' limited visibility of each other's physiological signs, hindering their ability to infer mental effort. Moreover, the original study’s effect vanished when re-analyzed with a more robust linear mixed model, suggesting their findings may not have been as reliable as initially thought. Our findings underscore the need for rigorous experimental designs and analyses in psychological research.",

Especially with the prevalence of smartphone use as short-term, fragmented media use, a systematic approach to temporal dimensions is crucial, particularly to understand mixed effects of smartphone use on well-being. We employ a multiverse approach to assess the influence of two central temporal dimensions in short-term longitudinal research: Time frame and time lag. We combine mobile experience sampling (T1 = 2,859, T2 = 7,708) and log data (K1 = 71,807, K2 = 259,004) from N1 = 84 and N2 = 192 participants. Building on theorizing on time in media effects research, we propose four patterns of how short-term effects unfold: they may follow processes of ephemerality (fleeting effects), inertia (delayed onset), or reversal (changing directions) – or there are no changes over time. We discuss theoretical implications and give practical recommendations for future studies, especially short-term longitudinal designs.",

          "authors": "Monique Chambon; Jonas Dalege; Janneke Elberse; Frenk van Harreveld",
          "abstract": "Network psychometrics, often referred to as a psychological network approach, is a method that enables studying psychological phenomena as networks of interacting elements. This method is gaining increasing popularity in different domains of empirical psychological research such as clinical and social psychology. Simultaneously, a scientific debate emerged on the added value and application of employing such an approach. The current paper contributes to this debate by providing an applied perspective to designing empirical studies that employ a psychological network approach and does so based on best practices in previous empirical psychological research. More specifically, it provides recommendations in the format of a practical guideline for researchers who want to employ a psychological network approach. The guideline can be summarized in three iterative steps. This paper describes each step in detail, including illustrative examples and practical considerations. First, researchers are recommended to evaluate their argumentation for adopting a psychological network approach and whether this is the best approach for their research aim. This approach is suitable for aims ranging from descriptive accounts of complex survey data to testing hypotheses about the network’s structure.  Second, researchers should carefully evaluate which variables the psychological network should contain. Such decisions should be informed by previous research (e.g., theoretical frameworks). Third, researchers should consider which research design and type of data are optimal to answer their research questions as different designs provide different insights. Adopting a psychological network approach in accordance with the guideline presented in this paper can further advance empirical psychological research.",

However, this issue's exact prevalence remains unclear, as does whether this issue is getting better or worse. In this pre-registered study we sought to answer these questions by examining the discussion sections of 599 articles published across 10 psychology journals and three timepoints (2009, 2015, 2021), and coding whether a nonsignificant finding was interpreted in such a way as to suggest the effect does not exist. Our models indicate that between 76% and 85% of psychology articles published between 2009 and 2021 that discussed a nonsignificant finding misinterpreted nonsignificance as reflecting no effect. It is likely between 54% and 62% of articles over this time period claimed explicitly that this meant no effect in the population of interest. Our findings also indicate that only between 4% and 8% of articles explicitly discussed the possibility that the nonsignificant effect may exist but could not be found. Differences in prevalence rates over time were nonsignificant. Collectively, our findings indicate this interpretative error is a major problem in psychology. We call on stakeholders with an interest in improving psychological science to priorize tackling it.",

Mobile eye tracking provides the opportunity to investigate active gaze in natural contexts. \n\nResearch on expert performance indicates gaze coordination as a key feature of expertise. Sports are in many ways an ideal environment for studying how gaze strategies support skilled action: the expert can be allowed to perform the task in a natural manner, capturing authentic behavior, and still experts perform repeatably and often under extreme time constraints, allowing systematic measurement and analysis of performance.\n\nIn this study, we systematically observed the visual strategy of an expert racing driver performing a domain-representative task. Synchronized gaze (eye movement and head pose), telemetry (control actions), and localization data from a high-grade simulator were combined into an integrated data set. Different ways to parametrize the data were then employed to address different sets of research questions: Where does the expert look? How are eye and head movements coordinated? How is this coordination timed with respect to locomotor actions? Where are specific gaze behaviors performed? \nOur purpose is to demonstrate how this kind of \"cross examination\" of the data - where all four classes questions are addressed simultaneously - offers a more complete picture of on rich, naturalistic eye movement behavior, thus complementing traditional experimental designs which impose predefined task constraints and conditions.",

Scholars have extensively mapped the situational and personality factors that modulate the empathy-helping relationship, but only a few studies have examined the cognitive processes that link empathy with helping. Lockwood et al. (2016) found that individual differences in online simulation (the deliberate intention to imagine what another person is feeling) were associated with individual differences in the rates at which people learned how to benefit an anonymous other person in a two-armed bandit task (which we term prosocial learning). Across three experiments (N = 1,188), we critically tested and extended this finding by asking participants to learn on behalf of real people in need. Causal manipulations of empathy and social evaluation had no effect upon prosocial learning, and we could not replicate the finding that online simulation was associated with learning. Although each individual experiment provided only mixed evidence for the hypothesis that empathic concern is associated with prosocial learning, a mega-analysis that included data from all three experiments revealed that both state and trait empathic concern shared a small but significant association with prosocial learning. We discuss our results in light of problems with the methods that researchers commonly use to test the association between performance on prosocial learning tasks and individual differences in empathy",

Few programs target maternal mental health and parenting skills concurrently despite this being more effective. An eHealth program, Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) was developed to address this gap. A feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with BEAM with a community partner versus an existing App for adult mental health (MoodMission). Methods: Mothers of children 6-18 months old participated in a two-arm, parallel-design pragmatic RCT (April-June 2022). Mothers were randomly allocated to BEAM or MoodMission. Primary (depression, anxiety) and secondary (anger, sleep disturbance, parenting stress) outcomes were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Results: Eighty mothers (Mage = 31.61 years old) were enrolled. All feasibility metrics were met based on a priori benchmarks for success. All maternal mental health and parenting stress outcomes decreased from pre- to post-intervention and follow-up in BEAM and MoodMission. When controlling for symptom severity at time of enrollment, treatment group (BEAM, MoodMission) moderated anxiety symptom reductions such that BEAM was more effective in reducing anxiety symptoms across time versus MoodMission (b = -1.48, SE = 0.74, p = .045). Symptom severity at enrollment did not moderate symptom reductions and there was no three-way interaction between symptom severity*treatment group*time. Discussion: Feasibility and effectiveness of BEAM was demonstrated for delivery with a community partner. Findings suggest BEAM holds the potential to promote the mental well-being of mothers of young children. Results have informed a future large-scale RCT across Canada.

          "abstract": "This paper provides a reflective, methodological guide for researchers conducting inclusive interviews with autistic children and young people – a historically marginalised population. As researchers reporting on the experiences of any marginalised population, we have an ethical obligation to ensure participation is open and accessible to all. While there is a growing recognition of the need to amplify the voices of under-served populations, there is a lack of clear guidelines for researchers seeking to implement inclusive research methods in practice. Drawing upon our recent experience with a large-scale qualitative study (N = 51) exploring the school experiences of autistic students in Ireland, we offer a real-world case example with a flexible, child-centred research protocol involving photovoice and adapted interviews. We describe how we individualised our protocol for the autistic students who participated in this study, supporting a wide range of ages (5 to 19 years) and communication profiles. Reflecting on the successes and challenges of this approach from an ethical and methodological standpoint, we highlight the importance of sensitivity, flexibility, and the value of small actions. Based on learnings from our work and others, we present an actionable framework of recommendations for conducting inclusive interviews. Finally, we argue that embracing inclusivity for all, not just the neurodivergent, is needed in the wider culture of academic research",

Yet typical studies of iconic memory have used only small stimulus sets and have restricted judgments to categorical visual content like letter identities or object features, the kinds of items that are known to be subject to very restrictive bottlenecks in recognition or working memory. We wondered about the capacity of iconic memory for mere spatial information, which may be pre-recognitional, and tested the ability of observers to notice discrete illuminated positions in a yes/no partial report task. We found iconic capacity for spatial position to fall far short of “limitless”, with typical observers able to report only a fraction of a set of dozens of stimulus points. These results may be explained by crowding, an unavoidable limitation on what can be reported about what is seen. We propose that extremely simple stimuli like dots may help to illuminate our understanding the appearance of crowded stimuli, and to highlight potential discrepancies between what we see and what we can report about it.",

          "abstract": "Infant faces are an important cue for facilitating bonding and interactions with adult caregivers. Cues of poor infant health are associated with a lower degree of parental investment and facial malformations, in particular, have been shown to negatively impact early infant-caregiver interactions. Previous research has shown altered visual and neural processing for infant faces with cleft lip/palate. Although many infants with these facial malformations undergo craniofacial repair surgery, it is not yet known if/how this impacts perceptual responses to infants. The current study investigates the potential restorative effects of craniofacial repair surgery on perceptions of infant cuteness, visual attention to infant faces (eye tracking), and neural responses to infant faces (EEG). Craniofacial repair surgery is found to increase perceived cuteness, reduce visual attention to the mouth region, and influence early neural signatures of face processing (N170, P200 ERP components). As these various responses contribute to a number of important developmental aspects (e.g., joint attention) and may play a key role in the previously observed difficulties in caregiver-infant interactions, this study provides an important first step in determining the effectiveness of surgical interventions on the underlying perceptual mechanisms of infant face processing.",

          "abstract": "Efficiently allocating individuals to work on complex decision problems is a key challenge for groups, organizations, and societies. It involves a crucial trade- off: Increasing the number of individuals working on a task typically improves accuracy, but also increases costs. Research in collective intelligence has proposed a plethora of mechanisms to pool the judgments of independent decision makers in order to improve performance. However, these mechanisms are static; because they do not adjust the number of crowd members to the challenge at hand, they incur high, fixed costs for every decision problem. We develop and test three decision rules that make it possible to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd adaptively depending on a case’s difficulty. Our rules rely on decision makers’ confidence judgments to stop crowd growth. Empirical analyses in four real-world domains (cancer diagnoses, false news classification, criminology, and forecasting) using seven datasets show that our adaptive decision rules can result in equal or higher accuracy compared to widely used static crowd aggregators, while relying on fewer individuals.

          "abstract": "Network psychometric models have emerged as an alternative to latent variable frameworks for conceptualizing psychological phenotypes. Despite their growing popularity, the formalization of network models as a measurement model has been largely unexplored. Recent efforts have integrated network models within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, but no standalone framework exists to specify network models as a measurement model, particularly with consideration of dimensions. This paper introduces the Exploratory Graph Model (EGM), a mathematical framework that formalizes networks as a measurement model that includes community structures where dimensions arise from the mutual interactions between observed variables rather than caused by latent constructs. After formalizing the model, a data generation approach is parameterized and a Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to demonstrate the differences in parameter estimates between EGM and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) when data are generated from EGM and latent factor models. We further explore whether the data generating model can be determined based on traditional SEM and likelihood statistics. An empirical example is presented to showcase how EGM can be applied and compared against EFA and alternative EGM structures. EGM broadens traditional views on how psychological phenotypes can be conceptualized, providing a network-based understanding of psychological measurement.",

          "abstract": "In this study we introduce the formal theoretical conceptualization of psychology and apply it to the integration of the three components of the Self-regulated learning (SRL) experience. The Formal Theory through the analysis of the creative process identifies emotions as energetic entities and the unconscious as an energy transformation homeostatic conflict resolution mechanism, a scientifically defined, graphically portrayable, qualifiable and measurable conflict resolution entity. We identify its two components: a six emotions energetic dialectic leading predictably to four types of conflict resolution.  This entity unites cognition, emotions, and behaviors into an organic testable, measurable continuum. A three prong emotional education program addresses the three domains leading to accurate and useful self-regulating insights. The cognitive component introduces the new science, integrating psychology, morality and physics by examining art exhibits; the psychological component uses the Conflict Analysis Battery (CAB) self-assessment for self-discovery; the behavior modification component examines cultural paradigms of four alternative ways of managing  power and attitude as complementary relational modalities. In a study of the self-guided online delivery of the CAB to 47 participants, we examine the program’s emotional impact by reviewing the participants’ comments on the learning experience and their responses to a query evaluating the program’s didactic, diagnostic and therapeutic objectives. We conclude that since behavior has become a science educators should introduce Emotional Education to enhance SLR objectives.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare three different methods for assessing ear dominance and analyse the relationship between handedness and various ear dominance values. \nMethods: In a group of neurotypical, Hungarian adults including right-handed (N=38), left-handed (N=24) and ambidextrous (N=10) men and women, handedness was assessed by a short form of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, whereas ear dominance was assessed by dichotic tests and two types of degraded speech stimuli (sine-wave and vocoded speech, generated from trisyllabic Hungarian words) presented monaurally. \nResults: Although the majority of participants had a right ear advantage using each of the three methods, characteristics of ear dominance differed depending on the assessment method. The three different ear dominance indices were uncorrelated with one another. Handedness was weakly related to dominance measured by monaural sine-wave stimuli and unrelated to that measured by monaural vocoded and dichotic stimuli. Crossed dominance was observed in a substantial proportion of participants (35-46%, depending on the type of ear dominance). Analysis of the perception of degraded speech revealed a remarkable interindividual variability and a learning transfer between sine-wave and vocoded speech.\nConclusion: The use of monaural degraded speech stimuli reveals different forms of ear dominance compared with dichotic tests, which suggests that ear dominance is strongly task-dependent. Handedness is not strongly correlated with any form of ear dominance. The high prevalence of crossed hand-ear dominance suggests that this type of crossed dominance is a normal variant rather than a maladaptive trait. The observed learing transfer between the two types of degraded stimuli might be mediated by domain-general mechanisms.",

We investigated how direct performance feedback, information about task progression, and the feeling of being monitored influenced performance indices in a task used to investigate the effect of MW on executive control. Our results indicate that specific performance feedback, and not general positive feedback, consistently improved performance, while neither impacted self-reported MW. Conversely, feedback on task progression and the feeling of being monitored increased self-reported MW, possibly reflecting participant self-awareness due to contextual distractions. Intriguingly, information relaying task progression also substantially increased performance. These findings highlight the potential of performance feedback to reduce the negative effects of MW on task performance in an online setting. Additionally, the findings suggest that information about task progression, as well as the notion of being monitored during the experiment can influence task focus and should be taken into consideration when investigating fluctuations of attention during cognitive tasks.",

          "authors": "Lucie Zimmer; Hilary Richardson; Carolina Pletti; Markus Paulus; Tobias Schuwerk",
          "abstract": "Social-cognitive processes, particularly Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, appear to differ between autistic and non-autistic individuals. This has been proposed to reflect the autistic core symptomatology of communication and social interaction difficulties. According to the predictive coding theory, autistic individuals’ ToM reasoning difficulties arise from an attenuated use of prior information about others’ mental states to explain and predict their behavior. This reduced use of prior assumptions makes the social world less predictable for autistic people, causing interactive mismatch and stress. Despite strong theoretical claims, robust and replicable neural differences in ToM brain regions remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether brain regions supporting ToM reasoning anticipate a narrative during repeated exposure (i.e., the narrative anticipation effect) in non-autistic adults (Experiment 1) and tested whether this effect was attenuated in autistic adults (Experiment 2). We presented a short movie with a plot including mental states with associated actions, twice, to 61 non-autistic adults who underwent fMRI (Experiment 1: M(SD)age= 25.9(4.4) years). In Experiment 2, we used the same protocol with 30 autistic (M(SD)age= 32.4(10.7) years) and 30 non-autistic adults (M(SD)age= 33.2(10.1) years). Analyses revealed no narrative anticipation effect in the ToM network in either group. Exploratory reverse correlation analyses identified a ToM scene that evoked a smaller difference in response between movie viewings (i.e., less repetition suppression) in autistic adults, compared to non-autistic adults. In sum, our study shows that predictive processing in the ToM network during a naturalistic movie-viewing experiment was absent in adults. Subtle differences in a key scene provide preliminary neural evidence for the predictive coding theory and open a promising avenue for future research to better understand the nature of differences in social interaction in autistic adults.",

We investigated how much individuals with schizotypal traits, a subclinical expression of psychosis-proneness, use high-level priors or sensory evidence to understand noise-degraded language, potentially resulting in task-based hallucinations – perceptions that match expectations but not the inputs. In a language comprehension task, we manipulated semantic predictability, sensory degradation and surprisal to estimate prior weights using a Bayesian Belief updating model. Study 1 (n=109) shows that high-level priors were overweighted with increasing schizotypy. Study 2 (n=55) replicated this effect and revealed that an overweighting of priors was associated with increased cingulate glutamate, providing a neurobiological basis for over-reliance on top-down predictions. These results offer a mechanistic and neurobiological understanding of how predictive coding alterations contribute to symptoms along the psychosis spectrum.",

However, the precise cognitive processes involved in successful interactions are not clear. If understood these could be targeted by preventative interventions.\nMethods\nWe examined the computational basis of learning and decision-making in nulliparous (Study 1) and pregnant participants enrolled in a multigenerational cohort study (Study 2) using a two-armed bandit task adapted to simulate a playful interaction with an infant. Participants chose between two competing bandits (i.e., two toys) with different underlying nominal probabilities for three outcomes (i.e., infant sad, neutral, and happy facial expressions). In Study 1, we manipulated the baseline emotional context of the task (i.e., baby started happy or sad) to assess its influence on the processing of emotional feedback and decision-making in a sample of non-parents. In both studies, we explored whether mental health and personalities difficulties associated with learning from feedback. \nResults\nThe manipulation of the emotional context (Study 1) was associated with differences in how participants learnt from the feedback and made decisions. Both studies suggest that having greater personality difficulties and experiencing higher antenatal depressive symptoms (Study 2) associate with slower learning from infant feedback. \nConclusions\nOur findings provide novel evidence regarding the role of the emotional context in learning and decision-making processes. For parents with depressive symptoms and personality difficulties, dampened responsivity to emotional feedback and inflexibility in updating beliefs about the values of actions may underlie fewer sensitive behaviours when interacting with their infants.",

Electroencephalograms were recorded while participants read sentences containing pragmatically appropriate or inappropriate honorific or humble terms. When collapsing all participants’ data, inappropriate humble and honorific terms elicited N400 and P600 effects, respectively, which could reflect semantic processing costs and rechecking processes, respectively. More importantly, communication abilities modulated N400 and late negativity effects for appropriateness for humble but not honorific terms. In contrast, perspective-taking and emphatic concern modulated N400 and late positivity effects, respectively, for honorific but not humble terms. In addition, some commonness of the appropriateness effect modulation by individual variables was also observed. These results are discussed in terms of commonness and individuality of neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of different politeness maxims during sentence comprehension.",

Over the course of time, issues have arisen that have had an impact on the intended administration and interpretation of this common clinical tool. \nPurpose: Based on published literature, clinical experience, recent survey data, and practical considerations, and while maintaining the original purpose of the instrument, the authors developed a revised protocol, new rating form, and updated instructions for the CAPE-V, now called the CAPE-V – Revised (CAPE-Vr).\nSummary of Modifications: Revisions to the CAPE-V include the following: removal of textual labels indicating severity on the response form; modification of several of the stimuli; revised rating options for pitch, loudness, and resonance, and an added category for nasality; added space to describe inconsistencies according to task; modified options for vocal instabilities and other features; and added space for comments about overall impression. The form also includes sections for documenting recording and rating conditions. Updated instructions are provided to clarify the CAPE-Vr protocol and correspond closely to the rating form. \nConclusion. The CAPE-Vr is constructed to avoid common errors and problems identified from previous use of the original CAPE-V. This paper provides a rationale for each modification to the original CAPE-V, an updated form, and an example of a completed form. The CAPE-Vr is intended as a clear and useful assessment tool for documenting the auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice.",

Prior research showed that a more positive view on one's own mortality in wave 1 was associated with less stereotypes about sex, gender and desire in wave 2. The present online study explores whether positive death valence reduces homonegativity. Using reaction time tests and surveys, 77 out of 191 US participants continued from wave 1, assessing death attitudes, to wave 2, assessing homonegativity. Consistent with the prediction, participants who viewed death more positively exhibited significantly less homophobic prejudice. By contrast, survey measures revealed no association between death valence and homonegativity. Future research should incorporate further assesment methods, cross-cultural samples and additional dimensions of prejudice to better understand the role of positive death valence for anti-discriminatory interventions.",

          "abstract": "Long-term memory for images of natural scenes is known to be very good. However visual working memory (VWM) for natural scene stimuli is less well understood. We investigated VWM for natural scene stimuli by measuring VWM performance as a function of both encoding time and cognitive load level, employing a method that approximates everyday natural vision.  VWM performance was compared between (a) scenes containing either full chromatic and luminance information, (b) luminance-only (isochromatic) information and (c) chromatic-only (isoluminant) information.  VWM performance was also measured for scenes in which the scene’s structure had been destroyed by Fourier phase scrambling, or following removal of either the high or low spatial frequencies.  It was found that recall ability for isoluminance scenes was relatively poor, as it was also for the phase scrambled scenes with high cognitive load or short encoding time. However, recall ability was similar for the full colour (i.e., chromatic and luminance information combined) and luminance-only scenes, except for very brief presentation times where performance for the luminance-only scenes was worse.  These findings suggest that spatial scene structure is important for good VWM performance, and for very brief presentations there is a particular reliance on chromatic information.",

          "abstract": "In our digitally connected world, interpersonal interactions increasingly occur through online platforms offering varied information channels. This research investigates the unique contribution of visual cues to emotional communication, examining both cognitive and affective aspects. We categorize affective experiences into three domains and explore how visual feedback enhances each and promotes prosocial behavior. Across three ecological dyadic studies on Zoom (N = 710), findings show that while visual information does not significantly enhance emotion-assessment accuracy, it shapes the affective experience of communication. Visual cues increased perceptions of listening, togetherness, and empathy, primarily influencing storytellers' perceptions. Active engagement through body gestures and eye gaze proved crucial in fostering positive interactions, even in online settings. Visual feedback also enhanced prosocial behavior, suggesting that visual elements not only enhance the experience of “being seen,” but motivate altruistic actions as well. The results reveal a complex interplay between visual and auditory cues, with vocal responsiveness only partially compensating for absent visual feedback. These findings have significant implications for social relations in a digital world, as the absence or presence of visual cues can profoundly shape the outcomes of our social interactions.",

One possible problem is that pro-environmental behavior may require self-control given that being non-environmental is usually less effortful or otherwise less costly. In the present research, we examine whether lay beliefs about willpower (i.e., people’s beliefs about the nature of self-control) predict pro-environmental behavior. Study 1 (N = 165) tested the correlational relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and performance and effort exertion (as assessed by cardiovascular reactivity) on an environmental task. The results showed an association of a nonlimited willpower belief with better performance and more effort exertion (as measured by pre-ejection period, but not systolic blood pressure). Study 2 (N = 208) assessed the causal effect on the same outcomes by experimentally manipulating participants’ willpower beliefs. However, there was no support for a causal effect. There was only a marginally significant effect on performance, no significant difference in effort exertion as measured by pre-ejection period, and merely a trending difference in systolic blood pressure (which was exploratorily analyzed). Thus, while the results from Study 1 indicate a correlational relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and effortful exertion on pro-environmental behavior, Study 2 did not provide evidence of a causal effect. These results allow first insights into the relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and effortful pro-environmental behavior, but further research is needed to test the robustness and underlying causality of this relationship.",

To that end, the performance of speakers of Italian is contrasted with the performance of speakers of English, as these languages differ with regard to their basic color vocabulary. Unlike English, Italian is assumed to have two basic color terms for the blue color spectrum, dividing it along the lightness dimension. The results are discussed in context with results for Russian speakers from previous research. The results obtained by the present study do not provide evidence for an effect in Italian. This null-effect supports a view of weak effects of color terminology on discrimination tasks.

This study used a multi-method design to investigate the proposed mediating mechanisms of intra- and inter-personal emotion-regulation strategies. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and questionnaires, completed by 259 students (124 single, 135 in a relationship), were used to capture both trait emotion regulation tendencies and strategy utilisation on a day-to-day basis. Data were analysed using path mediation in a structural equation model. Results suggested some significant effects of emotion-regulation strategies on depression, anxiety and stress, but with   conflicting findings across methods. Findings suggest that fostering positive emotion-regulation strategies among students could be a relevant intervention target for supporting their mental health. Understanding variations in findings across methods, emotion regulation strategies, and mental health outcomes deserves further research attention.\n\nKeywords: mental health, students, romantic relationships",

          "abstract": "The proactive gain control hypothesis suggests that the global language context regulates lexical access to the bilinguals’ languages during reading. Specifically, with increasing exposure to non-target language cues, bilinguals adjust the lexical activation to allow non-target language access from the earliest word recognition stages. Using the invisible boundary paradigm, we examined the flow of lexical activation in fifty proficient Russian-English bilinguals reading in their native Russian while the language context shifted from a monolingual to a bilingual environment. We gradually introduced non-target language cues (the language of experimenter and fillers) while also manipulating the type of word previews (identical, code-switches, unrelated code-switches, pseudowords). The results revealed the facilitatory reading effects of code switches but only in the later lexical processing stages and these effects were independent of the global language context manipulation. The results are discussed from the perspective of limitations imposed by script differences on bilingual language control flexibility.",

          "authors": "Saoirse Connor Desai; Winston Tan; Alexander Burchett; Kirsten Barnes; Louise Sharpe; Ben Colagiuri",
          "abstract": "Background: Mounting research indicates that observing others experience side effects can induce negative expectations and exacerbate side effects via the nocebo effect. However, most research on these socially-induced nocebo effects has focused on model-observer dyads, which may not map on to many real world settings in which people are exposed to many different models (e.g., social media).\n\nPurpose: To address this, we tested nocebo effects following observation of many models and whether the order of observing a ‘severe’ model (i.e., highly negative experience) moderated this effect.\n\nMethod : One hundred and seventy participants observed five social models undergo a virtual reality (VR) rollercoaster in Zoom, with four reporting mild cybersickness and one reporting severe cybersickness. The position of the model reporting severe cybersickness was manipulated between groups as either first (primacy), middle, or last\n(recency).\n\nResults: Participants who observed the cybersickness modelling reported greater cybersickness when they underwent the VR rollercoaster relative to a control group who observed non-symptomatic models. This social modelling effect was mediated by the participants’ expectancy of cybersickness symptoms. However, the position of the severe model within the sequence did not impact the participants’ cybersickness levels.\n\nConclusions: These findings demonstrate that socially-induced nocebo effects can occur in response to exposure to many models but the order of exposure does not moderate this effect. The results also indicate that developing interventions that target expectancy is critical for reducing the burden of socially-induced nocebo effects.",

          "abstract": "Reading is a complex process shaped by neurobiological traits and environmental factors, with reading disabilities imposing profound impacts on educational and socioeconomic outcomes worldwide. Early intervention is key, but identifying reliable, early-age predictors of future reading development remains a significant challenge, particularly in linguistically and socioeconomically diverse populations. While language-based precursors to reading ability (e.g., phonological awareness) have excellent predictive validity in homogeneous populations (e.g., English monolinguals), performance on these measures can be biased by language and early life experience. Here, we investigate whether visual processing measures could predict reading outcomes without biases of language background and socioeconomic status as early as kindergarten. Across a large and diverse sample of children (N ~ 1400) from California public schools, we administered measures of rapid visual processing (multi-element processing and visual motion perception tasks). Measures of language proficiency, socioeconomic status, and reading ability were also collected. We show that performance on the visual-processing measures did not differ by home language (Spanish versus English) or socioeconomic factors. Visual-processing measures accounted for ~12–18% of variance in year-end reading scores. Feature importance analysis suggests that visual-processing measures are important predictors of risk in kindergarten with equivalent performance to some of the conventional screening measures. Our findings show that visual-processing measures may provide a window into reading development that is agnostic to spoken language proficiency and socioeconomics. Incorporating these visual measures into early screening batteries could enable more equitable identification of children at risk for reading difficulties across diverse populations.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) equipped with general learning algorithms, but no linguistic knowledge, can learn to associate words with objects in naturalistic scenes when trained on head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experience. Similarly, ANNs can master syntax when trained on a similar amount of linguistic data a child experiences in a few years. These findings have been taken to challenge the view that innate linguistic priors play a role in child language acquisition. Here I show that the training environments and learning resources of ANN and humans are poorly matched, and accordingly, conclusions regarding human language priors are not merited. I also review three sets of findings that strongly suggest ANNs are missing human inductive biases: (1) children (but not ANNs) create new well-structured languages when only exposed to degraded ones; (2) ANN (but not humans) learn impossible and possible human languages in similar ways with similar facility; and (3) humans (but not ANNs) show a critical period for language learning. In this last case, adding an “innate” inductive prior to the ANN results in better ANN-human alignment. Just as is the case regarding claims of ANN-human alignment in the domain of vision, conclusions regarding ANN-human alignment in the domain of language is characterized by a lack of severe testing of hypotheses.",

It is unclear, however, whether such measures are actually useful indices of on-platform sharing. To shed light on this question, we recruited N=532 users from X (formerly Twitter) who had shared links to either high- or low-quality news outlets and invited them to complete an online survey where they indicated their likelihood of sharing true and false headlines. We find that, relative to participants who shared high-quality news on X, those who shared lower-quality news on X were also more likely to say that they would share false headlines in the survey, and a greater fraction of the headlines they said they would share were false. This suggests that self-reported sharing intentions do provide useful insight into the quality of news actually shared on social media.",

          "abstract": "We examine the joint roles of type frequency and token frequency in three artificial language learning experiments involving lexicalized plural allomorphy. The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest that token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate that they are positively related, and yet others argue that token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We take up both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms as well as to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments, with type frequency playing a dominant role. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Neither of these models is designed to encode a particular relationship between token frequency, type frequency, and productivity, but we show that both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes a rigorous method for controlling visual stimulus size in online psychological experiments. Our method employs ruler-based calibration to estimate the millimeter-to-pixel ratio by applying the least squares method to participants’ repeated measurements of randomly generated line segment lengths. Importantly, the success of the calibration can be objectively verified by assessing the measurement error of a test line segment and the residual variance in a linear regression model. Our simulation demonstrated that, with the recommended calibration criteria, an upper bound of the standard deviation for estimation errors was 0.007 mm/px. Implementation results showed that the majority of 100 participants completed the calibration within a few minutes, demonstrating the method’s feasibility. Our method may facilitate rigorous studies of psychological phenomena sensitive to visual stimulus size, such as visual perception and cognition, in online environments.

          "authors": "Thomas Mangin",
          "abstract": "Fatigue is a phenomenon with implications at the individual level, causing daily perturbations for each of us. Fatigue also has societal implications, as economic costs and death have each been attributed to fatigue. To be studied accurately, it is crucial to distinguish the term fatigue from related terms such as boredom or sleepiness. The terminology “passive” fatigue is often used in the literature. However, “passive” fatigue is a broad term that is not specific to the task(s) used to induce fatigue. Indeed, the term passive fatigue is semantically incorrect as participants performing a fatiguing task are active and not passive. Moreover, the fatiguing tasks used to induce “passive” fatigue are typically monotonous, and induce boredom and sleepiness. In laboratory tasks, participants persevere in boring tasks in the presence of sleepiness, inhibiting their dominant response to disengage from the ongoing task, thus inducing cognitive fatigue or an ego-depletion effect. The boredom and sleepiness induced by the tasks used to induce “passive” fatigue likely explain the observed effects in the literature. It is therefore necessary to rely on solid theories, have accurate definitions regarding what is being studied, and have objective and subjective measures of the phenomenon of interest. In this context, we propose that researchers interested in the “passive” fatigue phenomenon systematically monitor fatigue, boredom and sleepiness; and refer to the concept of “fatigue induced by [name of task]” (e.g., fatigue induced by the Mackworth's clock) and avoid proliferating the generic and insufficiently precise term, “passive” fatigue.",

          "authors": "Sergei V. Jargin",
          "abstract": "During the anti-alcohol campaign in the former Soviet Union (1985-1989), consumption of inexpensive colognes and technical alcohol-containing liquids was widespread. Drinking of non-beverage alcohol decreased abruptly after the campaign, when vodka and beer became readily available and inexpensive. Alcohol consumption predictably increased after the campaign. The upsurge in alcohol consumption facilitated economical reforms of the early 1990s: workers did not oppose privatization of factories partly thanks to their drunkenness. Following abolition of the state alcohol monopoly in 1992, the country was flooded by beverages of poor quality, sold through legally operating shops and kiosks, which caused severe poisonings. Thereafter, the quality of beverages has improved while the consumption tended to decrease. Besides, several aspects of treatment including invasive procedures applied with questionable indications are discussed here. A concluding point is that the society should care of its weaker members, including those suffering of alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related dementia, because they can be maltreated, abused and expropriated. In regard to the future research, toxicity of some alcoholic beverages sold in Russia is of particular importance. Of note, the military and medical ethics are not the same. The comparatively short life expectancy in Russia is a strategic advantage as it necessitates less healthcare investments and pensions. Apparently, this has been a motive of the unethical attitude to persons supposed to have alcohol use disorder, discussed in this chapter.",

However, recent research revealed that most US-produced infant formulas contain added sugars. The current study examined the proportion of added sugars in US infant formulas to determine whether US formulas contain primarily added sugars, which may present a risk to infant metabolic health, or whether formulas contain primarily naturally occurring lactose (the sugar present in human breastmilk).\nMethods: Data were obtained from the Nutrition Data System for Research and represented US the infant formula market as of 2022 (N=73). Formulas were categorized into three mutually exclusive types by their marketing labels: standard (n=31), gentle (n=27), and lactose-free (n=15). The proportion of added sugars from each type of sugar were calculated, as was the percent of naturally occurring lactose. Differences across formula types were examined using Bayesian modeling. \nResults: The median percent added sugars was high in standard (M=59.7%; IQR=22.0), gentle (M=85.0%; IQR=39.5), and lactose-free formulas (M=90.0%; IQR=54.3). Gentle formulas had significantly lower proportional lactose (OR=0.22, 95% HDI=[0.11, 0.44], pd=99.3%) and had &gt;2 fold higher proportional added sugar contents compared to standard formulas (ORs=2.11 to 2.57, 95% HDI &gt; 0, pd=99.1-99.99%).

While genetic factors are important influences on mental health, few studies have used symptom-level analyses to examine how genetic liability is related to maternal mental health. A symptom-level approach can account for disorder heterogeneity and delineate key associations between genetic liabilities and mental health, improving current understanding of how genetic risk is related to the experience of specific mental health problems.\n\nObjective\nTo examine associations between genetic liabilities to depression, anxiety, neuroticism and positive affect, and maternal mental health phenotypes (i.e., symptoms of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect) across the perinatal period and first years of motherhood using a network analysis approach. \n\nDesign, setting, and participants\nThree waves of data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) were used to assess item-level associations. Sample sizes ranged from 46,537 to 59,308 mothers. Networks were separately estimated for each polygenic score (PGS) and each wave of measurement: at 30 weeks of gestation, 6 months postpartum, and 18 months postpartum. \n\nMain outcomes and measures\nSymptoms of anxiety and depression experienced in the last two weeks from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and items measuring positive and negative affect (i.e., components of emotional functioning) in daily life from the Differential Emotions Scale. Four PGSs, indexing genetic liability to depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and positive affect, were included in separate networks.\n\nResults\nPGSs exhibited both phenotype-specific associations (e.g., depression PGS linked with hopelessness, anxiety PGS linked with worry) and cross-phenotype (e.g., depression PGS linked with nervousness, positive affect PGS inversely related to anxiety and depressive symptoms) relationships, with partial correlations ranging between r = -0.025 and r = 0.024. Items measuring mental health were strongly interrelated at each wave, in particular within symptom clusters and among emotional functioning items. Some PGS-phenotype associations were consistent (e.g., depression PGS linked with feeling like screaming or banging on something across all waves) and others inconsistent (e.g., anxiety PGS linked with nervousness only at 6 months postpartum) across the perinatal and postpartum periods.\n\nConclusions and relevance\nOur findings highlight symptom-level associations between PGSs and maternal mental health, which may be obscured when global measures of mental health (e.g., overall scores) are used.

          "abstract": "Adaptive learning systems (ALS) aim to tailor the educational material to match the student's needs, ultimately improving the learning outcomes. An ALS dynamically adjust the level of practice based on the student's ability, therefore obtaining accurate ability estimates is crucial. Since the amount of responses in a timeframe is limited, high measurement precision is unattainable using only accuracies, which calls for the inclusion of other data sources into the measurement. Here, we propose algorithms that can estimate the abilities on-the-fly based on both accuracy and response times (RT). These are extensions of a rating system called the Urnings algorithm. Since the Urnings algorithm uses discrete updates, building on the difference between a single observed and simulated response, we combined accuracy and RT into a continuous score using a discretised version of the Signed Residual Time (SRT) scoring rule. Through simulation studies, we showed that by augmenting the algorithm with RT, a reliable ability measure and better ability tracking can be obtained by administering fewer items. By reanalysing data from an existing ALS we showed that the algorithms can be utilised even if the SRT scoring rule is not explicitly used during measurement, providing better ability estimates and smaller prediction errors.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in psychiatric settings. Beyond the categorical diagnosis, borderline personality traits (BPT) are common in the general population and vary along a continuum from mild to severe. While prior research has reported functional connectivity alterations in the Default Mode Network (DMN), the Salience Network (SN), and the Central-Executive Network (CEN) in patients with BPD, the compromission of these networks in subclinical BPT remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity alterations associated with BPT in a subclinical population. We expect to find abnormal connectivity inside the Default mode network, the Salience network and in regions ascribed to mentalization processes associated with BPT. We also expect these networks to be associated with psychological symptoms experienced by borderline patients such as impulsivity and anger issues, lack of self-control and neuroticism among others. An unsupervised machine learning method known as Group-ICA, was applied to the resting state fMRI images of 200 individuals to predict BPT from the temporal variability of independent macro networks. Results indicated abnormal dynamic functional connectivity inside the salience network including areas implicated in emotional reactivity and sensitivity, and in network that partially overlap with the DMN and that includes regions involved in social cognition and mind reading, were associated with borderline traits. Specifically, the higher BPT, the higher the temporal variability inside the SN, and the lower the temporal variability in a network that includes DMN and mentalization regions. Notably, the BOLD variability of the SN correlated with neuroticism, anger problems, lack of self-control, and distorted inner dialogue, all symptoms displayed by individuals with borderline personality. These findings indicate that abnormalities in resting state networks are visible in subclinical populations with varying degrees of borderline traits, with impaired mentalization and salience networks and may pave the way for designing interventions to prevent the development of the full disorder.",

          "abstract": "Our visual environment often overwhelms us with more information than we can process. We can, however, enhance our processing efficiency by leveraging inherent regularities in the environment, such as prioritizing likely target objects over unlikely ones. Although there is evidence that statistical learning improves visual working memory performance, it is unclear whether this improvement occurs through stimulus prevalence or task relevance. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we examined whether frequent appearance or frequent probing of stimuli (or both) contributes to improvements in visual working memory recall. Participants were asked to recall and replicate the orientation of one of two previously presented Gabors as precisely as possible. In two experiments, we manipulated (1) stimulus prevalence by presenting Gabors more frequently on one side (either left or right), and (2) task relevance by probing Gabors more frequently on one side (either left or right). We found comparable orientation recall performance for to-be-remembered stimuli appearing at probable versus improbable locations, which suggests that regularities in stimulus prevalence did not improve memory recall. Contrastingly, we found better recall for stimuli appearing at locations that were more versus less likely to be probed. Specifically, task relevance enhanced working memory recall, both by reducing the number of categorical errors (e.g., misremembering a vertical-oriented Gabor as a horizontal one) and by increasing fine-grained recall precision (i.e., reducing minor variances in recall for memorized items). These findings highlight that statistical learning of task relevance, but not of stimulus prevalence, enhances visual working memory recall performance.",

In a young UK adult cohort, we aimed to investigate whether harmful gambling as measured by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) would be associated with concurrent and future suicide attempts. Hierarchical models explored whether associations were robust to controls for adolescent suicidality and relevant confounders.\nDesign: A birth cohort study of the UK general population.\nSetting: Avon, UK.\nParticipants: n=2,801 (62.4% female) participants with data for suicidality at 24 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).\nMeasurements: Past-year non-fatal suicide attempt prevalence was self-reported at 24- and 25-years (in 2017-2018). PGSI was measured at 20- and 24-years. Measured confounders were sex, maternal education, economic activity (employment/education status), hyperactivity, alcohol disorder likelihood, and adolescent suicidality.\nFindings: Past-year suicide attempt prevalence was 2.57% at 24-years, and 1.86% at 25- years. Confounder-adjusted models found that PGSI predicted suicide attempts at 24-years (Odds Ratio [OR]=1.13, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05–1.21, p=.001), and predicted future suicide attempts over one-year (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.25, p=.001), and four-year timespans (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.08–1.34, p&lt;.001), but there was inconclusive evidence of this association over five-years (OR=1.14, 95% CI 0.995–1.31, p=.058). There was no clear evidence that increases in PGSI scores between 20- and 24-years predict suicide attempts at 24 years (OR=1.69, 95% CI 0.72–3.99, p=.230). \nConclusions: PGSI scores were associated with suicide attempts, however, this association may be more complex long-term, and increases in PGSI during adulthood may not be an important factor.\nKeywords: Gambling-related harm, Suicide attempts, PGSI, ALSPAC, Longitudinal",

Meta-analytic models were tested when N ≥3 for a predictor with similar effect measures, otherwise predictors were discussed narratively when N ≥2. \n\nResults\nFrom 35 studies 115 predictors were included, with 10 predictors eligible for meta-analysis.\nChildhood ADHD-related impairment (OR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.02-4.27, p = .045) and history of stimulant treatment (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35, p =.003) increased the risk of ADHD persistence in adulthood. ADHD persistence increased the risk of SUDs (OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.66-3.39, p &lt; .001) and MDD (OR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.85-5.22, p &lt; .001). Narratively reviewed predictors including fair/good quality studies showed potential predictors for ADHD persistence (i.e., childhood ADHD combined type, inattention symptoms, hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, anxiety disorders, externalizing problems, thought problems, social functioning, and socioeconomic status).\n\nConclusion\nWe confirmed earlier reported childhood predictors (i.e., ADHD-related impairment, stimulant treatment history, ADHD persistence) and identified potential new childhood predictors (i.e., childhood anxiety disorders, thought and social problems, socioeconomic status) for adult psychiatric outcomes of ADHD. However, the available literature is hampered by methodological shortcomings and future studies should focus on studying the combined effects of potential predictors.",

Participants completed the WSSQ, The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS 2.0), Emotional Eating and Restrained Eating subscales from The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 (DASS-21) and sociodemographic survey.\nThe Polish WSSQ showed good overlap with the original structure in the two-factor model (Self-devaluation and Fear of Enacted Stigma). Factor loadings were satisfactory and both subscales showed good internal consistency. Measurement invariance revealed gender differences in the WSSQ score. The construct validity was confirmed with strong correlations with emotional eating and food addiction. As expected, the WSSQ total score was moderately positively associated with depression and stress severity. The correlations were the weakest for retrained eating and body mass index.  \nThe Polish WSSQ is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of weight-related self-stigma among patients with overweight/obesity. Future studies should investigate the gender differences as well as the test-retest reliability and longitudinal invariance. Finally, the sociodemographic information should be taken into account when interpreting the WSSQ results.",

          "abstract": "By the end of the first year, infants use others' emotions to interpret events, integrate social cues and build expectations on how people should behave (e.g., through social referencing). Yet, little is known about the neural correlates of linking others' emotions to their following actions. This priming study investigates 10-month-olds' electrophysiological (EEG) responses to happy and disgusted emotional displays toward novel objects (prime) and subsequent actions (pushing away or pulling closer the objects; target). Event-related potentials from 30 infants showed distinct neural markers associated with emotional processing of the prime, such as heightened early attentional response (Nc) and greater cognitive processing (Pc) in response to happiness over disgust. The target action of pushing away an object, especially following happiness, elicited increased slow wave activity, revealing working memory updating. Additionally, a significant mu-rhythm desynchronization, indicating motor resonance, was observed for the action of pulling objects closer when preceded by happiness. These findings indicate that by 10 months, infants attend to emotional cues and use these cues to form predictions about subsequent actions. These neural correlates of bridging emotions and actions before 12 months of life reveal, for the first time, early neural specialization for processing social cues in complex contexts.",

          "abstract": "Humans use similar brain systems to both imagine and perceive. While the re-use of brain systems specialised for sensory perception for offline simulation is an efficient use of resources, it also leads to a potential for confusions between imagination and reality. It remains unknown how human observers classify perceptual signals as reflecting external reality, as opposed to internal simulation or imagination. Here we show that judgments of reality are underpinned by a latent variable that encodes the combined strength of sensory signals generated by either imagery or perception. We use functional magnetic resonance imagining to reveal that this latent variable is tracked by the activity of bilateral fusiform gyrus and predicts confusions between imagery and perception on a trial-by-trial basis. We further characterise interactions between fusiform gyrus and a network of prefrontal regions encoding binary judgments of reality, in line with higher-order theories of reality monitoring. Our results demonstrate that a key mechanism through which the brain distinguishes imagination from reality is by monitoring fluctuations in the activity of mid-level sensory cortex. These findings increase our understanding of failures of reality testing such as hallucinations and lay the foundations for characterising a generalised reality monitoring system in the human brain.",

Findings suggest good feasibility, with adequate recruitment and 18% attrition. While no differences in symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or prolonged grief were observed between intervention and control post-intervention, there was a significant small effect on well-being in favour of the intervention. For intervention participants, there was a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD at follow-up, and moved from a clinical to non-clinical range of PTSD symptoms.

Emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction were measured through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 12-Item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, and Satisfaction With Life Scale, respectively. We compared the frequency of sensory symptoms between the TBI group and control group and examined associations with demographics, injury factors, and clinical outcomes within the msTBI sample.\nResults: 75% of participants with msTBI reported experiencing at least one sensory change due to their brain injury, averaging 2.21 symptoms (SD=2.01)—significantly higher than the 43% of controls reporting sensory symptoms. Within the msTBI sample, sensory changes were more common in younger participants (light hypersensitivity), females (light and noise hypersensitivity), those with more severe TBI (overall sensory changes, affected vision, reduced smell), and individuals who were fewer years post-injury (overall sensory changes, noise hypersensitivity, reduced smell, altered taste, dizziness). Sensory changes were consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes, with medium-large effect sizes for emotional distress and functional disability and smaller effects for life satisfaction. Outcomes worsened with the number of reported sensory changes.\nConclusions: Sensory changes are a clinically significant yet often overlooked issue after msTBI, even among individuals more than a decade post-injury on average, underscoring the need for routine assessment. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind these sensory changes and develop effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "In an uncertain world, traditional decision-making models and wisdom cultivation methods fall short. Emulating exemplars or relying on mental shortcuts and habits may help in some situations but often fail with ill-defined problems and transformative decisions. We propose that cultivating metacognition—the ability to reflect on and regulate one's thoughts, goals, and emotions—is key to navigating these challenges. Metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, and open-mindedness help individuals discern complex situations, consider multiple viewpoints, and adapt their decision-making. Though not a cure-all, metacognition represents a promising frontier in cultivating wisdom. Insights from philosophy, psychology, and contemplative traditions suggest a range of interventions to foster metacognitive skills and enhance wise decision-making amid radical uncertainty. We call for a paradigm shift in how we approach judgment and decision-making, inviting researchers and practitioners to explore the untapped potential of metacognition in navigating life’s most complex challenges.",

          "abstract": "Individuals make biased and variable probability judgements. Recent models such as the Bayesian Sampler and Probability Theory Plus Noise capture these effects by assuming people randomly sample events but are biased towards indifference (i.e., 0.5). However there is a bias they do not capture: systematic violations of binary complementarity, i.e., violations of the simple constraint that judgments of P(A) and P(not A) should sum to 1. Until now, this bias was only captured by the sampling process of the Quantum Sequential Sampler. Here we develop straightforward generalisations of the Bayesian Sampler, by introducing an asymmetric prior, and Probability Theory Plus Noise, by introducing asymmetric noise, that can generate violations of binary complementarity. We next show that these three models make distinct predictions for the mean-variance relationship in repeated judgments. Finally, we investigate violations of binary complementarity in five experiments, where participants judged the probabilities of dice rolls. Participants consistently violated binary complementarity, independent of whether they were in a high or low probability environment or how the alternative options are partitioned. Crucially, participants showed the highest variability for probability judgements below 0.5, an effect captured by an asymmetric prior in the generalised Bayesian Sampler, but not by the biasing mechanisms in the other models.",

Our study leverages a methodological innovation: To measure trait overconfidence absent task-related confounds, we developed a set of novel tasks where performance is ostensibly random. When we assess confidence this way, we find robust relationships across tasks as measured by both confirmatory factor analyses and raw correlations. This indicates that some people do believe that they are able to perform relatively well on tasks even when there is little reason for that confidence.

          "abstract": "In recent years, a growing body of evidence has suggested that sensory impairment represents a modifiable risk factor for dementia. While previous reviews have considered the role of hearing impairment or visual impairment separately, no systematic review to date has considered the literature exploring the association between cognitive decline and having both visual and hearing impairment. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the published literature on the association between dual sensory impairment (DSI) and dementia by comparing individuals with DSI to those without sensory impairment and/or those with a single sensory impairment. A total of 22 papers were included in the narrative review, and 13 were included in the meta-analysis, which aimed to statistically assess whether DSI poses an additional risk of developing dementia compared to those with no sensory impairment and relative to individuals with hearing or vision impairment alone. Overall, we found a consistent link between dementia prevalence and incidence with DSI. Specifically, our results indicate that participants with DSI are at an approximately 50% greater risk of developing dementia compared to those without sensory impairments. Moreover, DSI was found to be a potentially greater risk factor for dementia than isolated hearing and visual impairment, with the risk for dementia in the DSI group exceeding the combined risk of the individual sensory impairments. While the review highlights substantial evidence supporting DSI as a significant risk factor for dementia and cognitive decline, it also acknowledges several limitations in the existing literature, including an absence of measurement validation, failure to consider sensory aids use and onset of sensory impairment, and the potential influence of sensory difficulties on cognitive test performance. We recommend that future studies should address those concerns, while also beginning to explore the effect of interventions targeting DSI on cognition.",

Proponents argue that underlying biological disturbances might be at the heart of behavioral anomalies, and psychotropics could offer remedies. There's a perspective that positions psychopharmaceuticals as means for self-creation, allowing individuals to align their identities with their aspirations. However, counter-views voice concerns about the potential erasure of one's genuine self and the looming societal push towards medicinal conformity. Additionally, worries about the adverse impacts of medication, including potential long-term detriment, persist. The inclination of society to prioritize personality traits while underestimating situational factors adds another layer of complexity. Central to the discourse is the nuanced relationship between different layers of self —from the intrinsic, embodied experience to the externally influenced narrative identity. Ethical dilemmas, rooted in discussions around personal authenticity versus societal norms and the provocative proposition of perceiving certain personality disorders as moral rather than medical deficiencies, emerge. We emphasize the importance of an individualized, ethically-balanced approach in employing psychotropics for personality disorders.",

This study sought to explore trends in self-reported psychological distress and general mental health of tertiary students compared to their community peers in Australia from 2007 to 2022— a timeframe which spans the pre-, mid-, and immediate-post-COVID time periods. \nMethods: The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey was used as a basis for this study. Focusing on participants aged 18 to 35 from survey waves spanning 2007 to 2022 (average n = 4415 per year), participants were categorised into three groups: working only, tertiary students and working, and tertiary students only. Psychological distress and general mental health were measured using the Kessler-10 scale and the Mental Health Inventory-5, respectively. Weighted regression models compared outcomes between students and non-students.\nResults: Psychological distress and poor mental health have risen among young Australians, with the sharpest increase since 2019. Tertiary students, especially those studying only, showed significantly higher distress and poorer mental health than working peers. Although adjusting for covariates attenuated the associations, the higher distress levels in students persisted post-2019. Loneliness, long-term disabilities, and poor general health were correlates of poor mental health across all groups.\nConclusions: Findings highlight the need for targeted care models for tertiary students, including enhanced campus mental health support and screening services, financial support, social connection programs, and digital health solutions.",

Poorly understood experiences of female religious leaders lead institutions and religious leaders to assume a lack of heterogeneity, along with the ongoing adoption of formative experiences that are normed after a population that does not reflect the realities of most current and/or future religious leaders. Little to no empirical studies to date have formally investigated gender differences in religious leaders in many domains, much less mental health. The present study utilized a sample of 452 emerging religious leaders (50.2%, women) and a series of t-tests on self-report measures across domains of spirituality, character, emotional and mental health, and social values. Overall, women reported significantly higher rates of character strengths, social justice values, as well as lower emotional and mental health compared to men. Results also indicated that men reported higher rates of Narcissism-Grandiosity and Spirituality, yet women reported higher rates of Narcissism-Vulnerability.

However, confirmatory methods for group network comparison are limited by practical constraints, such as the computational intractability of the Ising model in large networks. In this study, we demonstrate how to estimate causal effects on network state and strength when direct network estimation is not feasible by leveraging the mathematical equivalencies between the Ising model and item response theory (IRT) models. We demonstrate through simulation that a two-parameter logistic (2PL) explanatory IRT model can simultaneously recover causal effects on network state and strength. We first apply the method to a single empirical example of a vocabulary assessment from a content literacy intervention to demonstrate model building and interpretation strategies. We then replicate our approach with 72 empirical datasets from randomized controlled trials with item-level outcome data in education, economics, health, and related fields. Our results show that causal effects on network strength are both common and uncorrelated with effects on network state, suggesting that causal network models can provide new insight into the impact of interventions in the social sciences.",

Unlike bargaining aggression, which seeks negotiated gains, or reactive aggression, which is defensive, predatory aggression is driven by the intrinsic aim of eliminating or depowering perceived adversaries. This perspective clarifies why radicalised individuals are often viewed as “psychotic,” linking this perception to a psychological inversion of costs and benefits where harm to others becomes personally rewarding. By identifying envy and hatred as central emotions, the chapter advances a functional approach to the study of radicalisation. Through its application to ethnic violence, this perspective illuminates how predatory aggression shapes collective conflicts, offering a more precise conceptual boundary for behavioural radicalisation across different contexts.",

Proponents argue that underlying biological disturbances might be at the heart of behavioral anomalies, and psychotropics could offer remedies. There's a perspective that positions psychopharmaceuticals as means for self-creation, allowing individuals to align their identities with their aspirations. However, counter-views voice concerns about the potential erasure of one's genuine self and the looming societal push towards medicinal conformity. Additionally, worries about the adverse impacts of medication, including potential long-term detriment, persist. The inclination of society to prioritize personality traits while underestimating situational factors adds another layer of complexity. Central to the discourse is the nuanced relationship between different layers of self—from the intrinsic, embodied experience to the externally influenced narrative identity. Ethical dilemmas, rooted in discussions around personal authenticity versus societal norms and the provocative proposition of perceiving certain personality disorders as moral rather than medical deficiencies, emerge. We emphasize the importance of an individualized, ethically-balanced approach in employing psychotropics for personality disorders.",

          "abstract": "Humans are remarkably efficient at learning new tasks, in large part by relying on the integration of previously learned knowledge. However, research on task learning typically focuses on the learning of abstract task rules on minimalist stimuli, to study behavior independent of the learning history that humans come equipped with (i.e., semantic knowledge). In contrast, several theories suggest that the use of semantic knowledge and labels may help the learning of new task information. Here, we tested whether providing existing, semantically rich task rules and response labels allowed for more robust task encoding and less (catastrophic) forgetting and interference. Our results show that providing semantically rich task rules and response labels resulted in less task forgetting (Experiment 1), both when using pictorial symbols or words as labels (Experiment 2). Using artificial recurrent neural networks fitted to task behavior, we show that the semantically rich learning conditions resulted in more separated task representations during learning. Finally, using a subsequent value-based decision-making task and reinforcement learning modelling (Experiment 3), we demonstrate how the learned embedding of novel stimuli in semantically rich, separated task representations, further allowed for a more efficient, feature-specific processing when learning new task information. Together, our findings show the benefit of using semantically rich task rules and response labels during novel task learning, thereby offering important insights into why humans excel in continual learning and are less susceptible to catastrophic forgetting compared to most artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "The Hamburger Schreib-Probe (HSP) is a popular instrument in research and practice for determining spelling skills. It is characterized by the fact that, in addition to an overall score, it also provides results relating to the proficiency of spelling strategies. Using data from eleven cohorts from a secondary school in Baden-Württemberg, the psychometric quality of the instrument, in particular its characteristic strategy scores, was examined for the first time in this study using factor analytical methods. A unidimensional measurement model was established in line with the HSP's theoretical foundation. However, we did not find metric measurement invariance for the cohorts studied. We also pointed out the diagnostic value of the detailed results concerning individual spelling strategies. This showed that children with the same performance level exhibited quite heterogeneous strategy profiles. An exemplary classification of the data showed that the performance of the classes examined was consistent with the results of large-scale studies and matched the findings of the possible effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The HSP appears to be a theoretically and psychometrically sound measurement instrument with a high diagnostic information density. However, its skewed distribution should be mentioned as a psychometric weakness. We also discussed the significance of the lack of metric invariance. Studies on representative samples with relevant covariates are required to further test the HSP's suitability for widespread use in schools.",

          "authors": "Kanji Shimomura; Kenji Morita",
          "abstract": "Optimism has long been studied as a trait that can significantly affect physical and mental health. Studies using behavioral experiments have characterized optimism as an interindividual factor that interacts with learning parameters. However, recent studies revealed that optimism in fact has a state-like aspect; that is, it fluctuates within individuals depending on external events and daily experiences. This raises the possibility that optimism might act as a factor that modulates learning, depending on the current state within individuals. The present study examined this possibility by conducting behavioral tasks and questionnaire surveys pre- and post- intervention to increase optimism (n = 95 for the intervention group and n = 41 for the control group), which has been shown to be effective for trait optimism in previous meta-analyses. After demonstrating that this intervention was also effective for state optimism, the following preregistered hypotheses were tested: intraindividual changes in state optimism (1) relate to positive belief updating bias and (2) relate to prior expectation about reward likelihood. While the results did not support Hypothesis (1), Hypothesis (2) was partially supported. Specifically, intraindividual changes in prior about reward, estimated through an abstract learning task, showed a positive association with changes in state optimism, measured by questionnaire, in the intervention group, although group × time interaction on the prior about reward was not detected. This suggests that optimism fluctuating within individuals acts as a state-dependent prior, potentially across various environments.",

In this study we aimed to distinguish these two forms of memory structure, demonstrating differences in long and short term memory using similar stimuli. We confirm earlier results showing that long-term memory relies on the categorical content evoked by seeing scenes, using a standard study-and-test paradigm. With the same paradigm we show that short-term memory seems unaffected by the subtraction of high-level categorical content, implicating pre-categorical structure in memory. With the same stimuli we carry out a discrimination task, with the results suggesting that this pre-categorical structure may be explicitly spatial, the stuff of iconic memory and online vision.",

          "abstract": "The present study addresses a fundamental yet largely neglected question about personality development: To what extent are changes in parent personality traits associated with changes in their child's personality traits? Numerous developmental processes suggest that parent and child personality might have transactional associations over time, contributing to their co-development. This co-development may be homotypic (e.g., associations between changes in Parent and changes in Child Conscientiousness) and heterotypic (e.g., associations between changes in Parent Conscientiousness and changes in Child Extraversion). In addition to investigating the extent to which parent and child personality co-develops, we also investigated the extent to which parental (mother and father) personality co-develops. We tested these ideas using bivariate growth curve models of personality trait assessments from a 17-year longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin families. Intercepts of parent and child trait trajectories were generally correlated, but we did not find significant correlations between the slopes, contrary to our expectation of parent-child co-development. We found stronger evidence for co-development in mom-dad dyads, with significant slope-slope correlations for Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness. In almost all cases, these findings generalized across child gender, child nativity, and parental age. We discuss the implications of the findings for adolescent personality development.",

          "abstract": "The Bland-Altman repeated-measures correlation (rmcorr) is widely used to estimate within-person correlations between two variables in repeated-measures data. However, it assumes the same slope for all subjects, which can be misleading when slopes vary. To propose an alternative method, the weighted mean within-person correlation (wmcorr), which calculates the average of all within-person correlations, weighted by the square root of the number of observations for each person. The wmcorr method was applied to real data examples and compared to the Bland-Altman rmcorr. Simulations (5,000) were run to compare the mean significance levels (p-values) of rmcorr and wmcorr and to determine the relationship between estimated rmcorrs and wmcorrs. In most cases, rmcorr and wmcorr yielded similar results. However, in cases where subjects had at least moderately varying slopes, wmcorr provided a more visually intuitive estimate of the within-person correlation. Conflicting significance levels or opposite directions of rmcorr and wmcorr served as \"warning signs\" for potential data quality issues or the need for further data collection. The wmcorr method is proposed as an alternative to the Bland-Altman rmcorr for estimating within-person correlations in repeated-measures data. Researchers are encouraged to estimate both wmcorr and rmcorr, as discrepancies between the two can alert researchers to data patterns that warrant closer inspection before drawing conclusions about within-person relationships.",

The aim of our studies was to replicate Mueller’s methods and extend her work by evaluating whether membership in animal-focused youth programs moderate any associations between interactions, attitudes, and positive youth development. We did not find strong relationships among human-animal interaction and positive youth development, which failed to replicate Mueller’s findings. However, we did find relationships between animal attitudes and positive youth development, replicating Mueller’s findings. Membership in animal-focused youth programs did not moderate any observed effects. Thus, though animal attitudes are associated with positive youth development, membership in a youth program does not seem to enhance these relationships, and human-animal interactions do not seem to have strong associations with positive youth development.",

In the current study, young adults (N=75) and three cohorts of older adults (N=231) completed an extensive test battery assessing multiple subcomponents of cognitive control. Results showed improved response inhibition and interference control in older vs. young adults, decreased updating and shifting with age, and preserved proactive control in older adults.

          "abstract": "Background. The experience sampling method (ESM), also known as ecological momentary assessment, is gaining popularity in physical activity research. This method involves assessing participants’ behaviors and experiences repeatedly over time. One key advantage of ESM is its ability to temporally separate the dependent and independent variable of interest, reducing the risk of reverse causality. However, temporal separation alone is insufficient for establishing causality. This methodology paper illustrates the importance of the identification phase in drawing causal conclusions from ESM data. In the identification phase the causal effect of interest (or estimand) is specified and the assumptions under which a statistical association can be considered as causal are identified. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) visualize these assumptions by displaying the assumed causal structure between the independent variable, the dependent variable and other related variables. Methods. The Methods section demonstrates how to construct an estimand and develop a DAG for a specific research question in an ESM study. Results. In the Results section, we describe how confounding bias revealed by the DAG can be addressed by modifying ESM study design or data-analysis. Each step is illustrated with an example from the field of physical activity research. Conclusions. Implementing the identification phase before conducting data analysis enables ESM researchers to make more informed decisions, thereby enhancing the validity of causal inferences in studies aimed at answering causal questions.",

          "abstract": "Virtue theory is a natural approach towards the design of artificially intelligent systems, given that the design of artificial intelligence essentially aims at designing agents with excellent dispositions. This has led to a lively research programme to develop artificial virtues. However, this research programme has until now had a narrow focus on moral virtues in an Aristotelian mould. While Aristotelian moral virtue has played a foundational role for the field, it unduly constrains the possibilities of virtue theory for artificial intelligence. This paper aims to remedy this limitation. Philosophers have developed a rich tradition investigating virtues, their normative domains and their structure. Drawing on this tradition, I propose a three-dimensional classification system of possible artificial virtues: virtues can be classified according to the domain in which virtue is an excellence, norm which makes a virtue an excellence, and mode how the virtue delivers the excellence. With this framework, we can discern gaps in the current theorising about artificial virtues. Additionally, it gives us a tool to evaluate the competences of extant artificially intelligent systems.",

          "abstract": "Frameworks are widespread in developmental psychology. They offer general ideas about what to study in human development: which concepts to focus on (e.g., systems, trade-offs), which processes to test (e.g., micro-macro, bidirectional), and which methods to use (e.g., interview, equations). However, despite their prominence, there exists very little consensus or guidance on how to use them in research. As such, frameworks have an obscure role: they influence our research questions, methods, and theory, but often in ways we cannot articulate for ourselves, let alone for others. This paper presents a practical guide for leveraging frameworks to improve developmental research. We suggest that frameworks can guide us through a research project’s “map of conceptual terrain”: which questions to ask and how to study them. We first classify these considerations into topic areas (i.e., “regions”), including assumptions and ideas about timescales and processes of developmental change. We then offer a strategy for charting a “path” through these regions, creating chains of logic to make increasingly specific claims and choices, from framework to research practice. As an illustrative example, we use Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological framework to study parent-child relationships, highlighting its affordances and limitations. We also draw contrast with other prominent frameworks, showcasing how different frameworks can alter a researcher’s path. Our proposed explicit and systematic use of frameworks can serve as a powerful navigation system for building and refining research programs. Thus, our paper provides a guide for developmental scientists to more explicitly use and capitalize on frameworks in their empirical research.",

We propose future research to incorporate placebo controls to examine the efficacy of PM4M and dismantling designs to identify the specific treatment components responsible for its benefits, as well as explore the potential for digital, self-help versions of PM4M to enhance scalability. Additionally, we recommend examining the moderating effects of sociodemographic factors on intervention outcomes to better tailor PM4M for diverse populations.

Given that comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders can reach up to 65%, understanding symptom-level overlap could provide valuable insights for improving diagnostic accuracy and developing targeted transdiagnostic assessments. Methods: We conducted a content analysis of 18 widely used clinical scales, assessing both depression and anxiety domains individually and together. Using the Jaccard Index (0 = no overlap; 1 = complete overlap), we quantified overlap across individual depression scales, individual anxiety scales, and combined depression and anxiety scales to capture symptom-level intersections. Results: Our findings indicated low mean overlap within each domain (0.29 and 0.26 for depression and anxiety, respectively) and even lower mean overlap (0.13) when depression and anxiety scales were analyzed together, underscoring significant heterogeneity among scales. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRDS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) displayed the highest cross-domain overlap (0.41), suggesting these scales may assess overlapping symptom dimensions. Conclusion: Results reveal distinct symptom structures in depression and anxiety scales, with only a limited degree of shared content. This suggests that many current scales may inadequately capture the mixed symptoms often present in clinical populations. Our findings underscore the importance of developing transdiagnostic measures capable of assessing both shared and distinct symptom dimensions across affective disorders, which may ultimately enhance clinical precision in assessing comorbid presentations and inform future revisions of existing assessment tools",

          "abstract": "Post-error slowing, described as an error-corrective index of response binding during motor sequence learning, has only been demonstrated in the serial reaction time task under conditions where extrinsic error feedback is presented. The present experiment investigated whether post-error slowing is dependent on, or is influenced by, extrinsic error feedback. Thirty participants (14 females, Mage = 21.9  1.8 years) completed the serial reaction time task with or without presentation of extrinsic error feedback.  Post-error slowing was observed following response error whether feedback was presented or not. However, presentation of extrinsic error feedback increased post-error slowing across practice and extended the number of responses that were slowed following an error.  There was no evidence of feedback effects on motor sequence learning or explicit awareness.  Instead, feedback appeared to function as a performance factor that reduced response error rates relative to no feedback conditions.  These findings illustrate that post-error slowing in motor sequence learning is not reliant on or a result of presentation of extrinsic error information.  More specific to the serial reaction time task paradigm, the present findings demonstrate that the common practice of presenting error feedback is not necessary for investigating motor sequence learning unless the aim is to maintain low error rate. However, doing so might inflate reaction time in latter training blocks.",

          "authors": "John Protzko; ROBERTO COLOM; Sherif Karama",
          "abstract": "Theories of cognitive development rely on implicit or explicit causal assumptions from developmental data. While powerful in their attempt to account for within-individual developmental change, causally testing such theories is difficult. One method for enhancing our knowledge might be to look for exogenous changes affecting mainly some cognitive abilities and to observe the developmental outcomes over further abilities. Focal cortical lesions sustained in childhood represent one informative instance of such changes. Here we test the implications of theories of cognitive development by studying a sample of 464 individuals who suffered focal cortical lesion in childhood to either the right frontal or right temporal lobes. Children had follow-up cognitive assessments done 8.5 years later. The key findings showed sustained long-term deficits in fluid abilities, but no developmental cascade of a reduction in abilities over time. Suffering a lesion to the right frontal cortex, despite causing a drop in fluid or abstract intelligence, does not transfer over to crystallized or knowledge-based abilities over development. The implication is that there is no transfer between these abilities when an exogeneous change affects early fluid ability. These results can be seen as powerful for testing developmental theories of cognition against their causal assumptions.",

          "authors": "Joseph Coffey; Elizabeth Spelke",
          "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing interest in field research using randomized designs to evaluate the impacts of diverse interventions on early child development and education. Measuring these impacts requires assessments that can track development prior to school entry. We propose a novel approach using research from developmental cognitive science: targeting five areas of core knowledge—language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, mental state reasoning, and executive function—that have been found to emerge across cultures in infancy and predict later performance on related skills in adulthood. Using tasks based on experimental paradigms developed in lab settings, we tested 1256 Ghanaian children (centering on four age groups at 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5 years), whose parent previously took part in a randomized controlled field experiment on secondary education. Here we investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these tasks. We ask whether these core knowledge tasks 1) produce responses from Ghanaian children that are internally consistent and above chance, 2) relate to performance on other similar tasks within the same cognitive domain, and 3) are stable over time and predict future performance. We find that the assessment battery captures individual differences in the older tested age groups (3.5 years and above), in the domains of language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, and executive functioning, but not for infants or for tests of mental state reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that experimental methods designed to study core knowledge in infancy can be used track individual differences in children’s cognitive development.",

          "authors": "Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "The present research has delved deeper into the complex relationship of customer care calls with purchasing behavior in a WM system and has developed actionable insights to optimize operations. In this regard, the following critical factors have been considered: product attributes-cost, weight, and discount-on one hand, and delivery performance in terms of timeliness and reliability on the other, with a view to understand their impacts on customer satisfaction and interactions. Key takeaways are that high volumes of customer care calls reflect operational failure; there is a delay or expectation mismatch, and hence one needs strong process optimization. Also, heavy products, since perceived to be reliable, have fewer customer enquiries; lighter, cheap products cause more frequent queries since impulsive buying and lack of information occur. It further identifies timeliness of delivery as a main determinant of customer satisfaction while delays in delivery result in heightened discontent and rising demands for support. The study underlines the strategic relevance of advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to finally resolve the recurring inefficiencies. This may also be a good basis on which recommendations could be made concerning the use of predictive analytics for demand forecasting, effective logistical frameworks, and methods of customer service that would be in line with product-specific needs. Discounts become a two-edged factor: enhancing satisfaction but threatening brand value when used too frequently. In the end, strategies with discounts should be put into balance, proactive customer engagement should be there, with crystal clear communications with them, and the products to be more correctly described. The given study also identified how a warehouse clears the expectation from customers by applying data-driven strategies for better efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The above findings provide a comprehensive road map on how to integrate technology and customer-centric strategies in modern warehouse management.",

          "abstract": "Character patterns have been regarded as mystical mediums capable of influencing the surrounding energy fields since ancient times, often used for altering environmental energy or protecting individuals. Modern metasurfaces, on the other hand, are two-dimensional structures designed with nanometer or micrometer precision to achieve highly controlled manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This paper aims to explore the connection between character patterns and metasurfaces in aspects such as energy regulation, information encoding, and cultural symbolism, while further analyzing their multidimensional impact on technology, culture, ethics, and practical applications. By comparing the historical background, cultural significance of character patterns, and the physical principles of modern metasurfaces, the paper reveals commonalities between the two in energy resonance, information transmission, and geometric symmetry. Furthermore, the paper delves into the role of character patterns in psychology and socio-culture, as well as their inspirational significance for metasurface technology design. Finally, the paper discusses the ethical and socio-cultural adaptability of metasurface technology, providing valuable insights for future scientific research and practical applications.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the application of quantum mechanics in life sciences has given rise to quantum biology, which deeply investigates the impact of quantum effects on biological processes, such as quantum transfer in photosynthesis and quantum coherence phenomena in bird navigation. However, the connection between quantum mechanics and the social sciences, particularly linguistics, has not been widely explored. This paper draws analogies between the discrete nature, superposition states, and entanglement phenomena in quantum mechanics, and the discreteness, ambiguity, and context-dependence in linguistics, revealing interdisciplinary similarities between the two fields. This analogy provides a new perspective for understanding the uncertainty and complexity involved in human language processing, and suggests the possible existence of macroscopic quantum states. Future research may uncover the impact of quantum effects on higher cognitive functions and promote a deeper integration of quantum physics and social sciences.",

          "abstract": "The use that agents do of cultural knowledge to navigate institutions is a major explanation of inequalities. Nevertheless, the difficulties accessing culture knowledge have led sociologists of education to often rely on declarative forms of culture to gauge explanations on inequalities. Based on the case of Chile, this study contributes to educational inequality research by using factorial survey experiments to assess the stratification of evaluative principles of educational quality or what is termed \"judgments of the game.\" Different teaching and school resources features were experimentally manipulated and presented to representative and probabilistic samples of parents and primary school students to measure their evaluative principles of educational quality. Findings show that socially advantaged parents and students, and from private schools, tend to evaluate educational quality more critically and attribute stronger effects to vignette features, suggesting cultural knowledge stratification. Thus, this study contributes to cultural sociology, sociology of education, and stratification research by testing one of the central theoretical propositions on the explanations of educational inequalities.",

          "abstract": "Estimates of intergenerational educational mobility are generally computed using a combination of self- and proxy-reports of one's and one's parents' education. Such reports are easily collected, offering a cost-effective alternative to collecting multiple self-reports or register data. However, the bias that proxy-reports could introduce in the measurement of intergenerational educational mobility is rarely assessed. Our study fills this gap and assesses how reliable people are when they report their parents' or their child's educational attainment. We find that both parents and children tend to underestimate the educational distance between themselves and their family members, thus inflating estimates of educational reproduction. This trend is larger when children act as proxy-reporters. Another limitation of using children’s proxy-reported information is the number of missing answers, which is lower when parents are asked to proxy-report their child's education. In a simulation exercise, we establish that the bias introduced by proxy reports is not negligible, with self-reported intergenerational regression coefficients being 16\\% higher when a proxy-report is used.",

          "abstract": "Although high-risk research is a key concern for research policy and science studies, there is little knowledge about what funding agencies or researchers mean by risks. This paper draws on 80 grant proposals from the social sciences and humanities (SSH) and the natural sciences (NSC) that have been submitted to the Reinhart Koselleck funding program of the German Research Foundation. The qualitative analysis shows both similarities and differences in how applicants in the two fields claim risks: in both fields, the most prominent notions refer to results and methodologies. While results at risk are interpreted similarly, methodological risks differ between the two fields. The analysis also reveals a greater variety of different risks in the SSH compared to the NSC. The paper suggests that research policy and science studies should avoid treating “riskiness” as a given and consider different notions of risk across a disciplinary spectrum that includes the SSH.",

          "authors": "Niko Tsakalakis; Sophie Stalla-Bourdillon; Trung Dong Huynh; Luc Moreau",
          "abstract": "As automated decision-making permeates almost all aspects of everyday life, capabilities to generate meaningful explanations for various stakeholders (i.e., decision-makers, addressees of decisions including individuals, auditors, and regulators) should be carefully deployed. This paper presents a typology of explanations intended to support the first pillar of an explainability-by-design strategy. Its production has been achieved by pursuing a responsible innovation approach and introducing a new persona within the research and innovation process, i.e., a legal engineer, whose role is to work at the interface of two teams, the compliance and the engineering teams and to oversee the process of requirement elicitation, which is often opinionated and narrowing. Once explanation requirements have been derived from applicable regulatory requirements, compliance rules or business policies, they have been mapped to the dimensions of the typology to produce fine-grained explanation requirements, forming computable building blocks that can then be translated into system requirements during the technical design phase. The typology has been co-created with industry partners operating in two sectors: finance and education. Two pilot studies have thus been conducted to test both the feasibility of the generation and computation of explanations on the basis of the typology and the usefulness of the outputs in the light of the state of the art. The typology comprises nine hierarchical dimensions. It can be leveraged to operate a stand-alone classifier of explanations that acts as detective controls within a broader partially-automated compliance strategy. A machine-readable format of the typology is provided in the form of a light ontology.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the benefits and challenges of international mobility programs for both home and host countries is essential for evaluating them. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the Chinese government-sponsored international mobility program, the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC), by examining its effects on home and host countries across disciplines from five dimensions: research activity, collaboration patterns, funding patterns, research performance and security-sensitive research. Our findings suggest that, for the home country (China), the funding program enhances China’s research capabilities in alignment with China’s strategic development priorities. Additional evidence suggests that the funding program facilitates international collaboration and allows awardees to work with well cited researchers. For host countries, the funding program promotes collaboration with China and supports research areas where funding might be scarce. Also, the funding program places little emphasis on dual-use research and has minimal ties to the “Seven Sons of National Defense” universities. The finding may help mitigate current concerns of some host countries about the potential further threats to security. The study provides evidence for policymakers to develop strategies that maximize the benefits of international mobility programs and address associated challenges.",

          "title": "The Policy of Refugee Reception and the Policing of Public Space in Paris",
          "authors": "Marco Cremaschi; Tommaso Vitale",
          "abstract": "An examination of public space provides insights into the disconnection between regulation and reception within the Parisian context. The visibility of refugees in public spheres has been instrumental in heightening civic consciousness in Paris. Simultaneously, it serves as a subject of political apprehension and an opportunity for the display of state-inflicted violence by humanitarian NGOs, too. The governance of public open spaces extends beyond traditional command and control approaches, emphasizing delegation, integration of new knowledge and technologies, negotiation, and self-regulation. The central concern involves an evolving, albeit ambiguous and partially contradictory, process of outsourcing certain aspects of reception policies without a well-experienced governance mode (Artioli, Le Galès, 2023).\nThe first section describes the relevant social geography of Paris. Social transformations due to deindustrialization have left a lasting impact, concentrating immigrant populations in areas marked by blue-collar workers and social housing estates. While Paris actively engages in social and redistributive policies, achieving a balanced geographical distribution for diverse social groups remains a challenge.\nThe ensuing section delineates the social policy responsibilities of both central and local institutions, against the backdrop of which the handling of refugees has transformed into a separate specific policy domain. Despite ongoing collaboration in Paris, challenges endure due to the stance of the French government and the inadequate coordination within the EU.\nThe following three sections analyse the role of space in framing the reception policies of Paris, paying reference to different ways of framing the space:\n-\tThe so-called ‘Project Territories’ of the EU Structural Funds exhibit a progressive drift where coalitions of territorial actors reinterpret national rules following their competencies (and expertise). \n-\tLocally managed reception comes to a standstill in the face of state normative injunctions. \n-\tGovernment authorities and local actors consciously use space for repressive purposes, even to manage conflicts between potentially incompatible uses.\nThe conclusions deal with the evolving landscape of local reception policies driven by state and non-state actors. Despite innovative efforts, there is a lack of coherence, and central dispersion policies (Dollet, 2023) contradict local commitments, raising questions about the role of local governance. However, the cyclical coming and going between the dismantling of refugee camps and sheltering asylum seekers question the notion and scope of integration, highlighting the porous boundary between formal and informal regulations. Besides, the design of policies cannot underestimate the role of space in shaping welcoming practices.",

          "abstract": "Background: There is an internationally accepted discourse on ‘Female Genital Mutilation’ which understands it as a human rights violation, a major health concern, and an extreme form of gendered violence. Since the 1980s, African women, postcolonial feminists and anthropologists have critiqued this discourse as ethnocentric and racist. \nAims: We examine the genealogy of the hegemonic anti-FGM discourse, identify alternative perspectives and analyse the extent to which they were integrated, co-opted, disregarded or silenced. \nMaterials and methods: This genealogy draws upon a comprehensive review of the literature critiquing the dominant discourse on FGM, supplemented through analyses of British Colonial Office correspondence, documents from the (Parliamentary) ‘Committee for the Protection of Coloured Women in the Crown Colonies’, Church Missionary Society periodicals, debates in the UK Houses of Parliament, and UN (including WHO) reports and meeting minutes.\nResults: Alternative perspectives on female circumcision and critiques of the dominant narrative have been formulated throughout the history of the anti-FGM campaign. However, they have been silenced through various silencing mechanisms, and thus not permeated the hegemonic discourse. Outrage and backlash continue as silencing mechanisms around two contentious topics that embody colonial double standards: medicalised female circumcision and adult women’s right to choose female circumcision.",

Despite this substantial body of empirical research, the knowledge is fragmented across disciplines, emphasizing the need for integration to establish a cohesive framework. As laying the groundwork for a unified framework begins with identifying relevant phenomena, this systematic review analyzed 4019 research articles using text mining to detect phenomena associated with radicalization. Author keywords and abstracts were analyzed by examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflect themes commonly featured in theory, such as ideology, identity, and social networks, but also identified themes not well-developed in theory. Macro-level phenomena, including the role of the state, economy, elections, policy, and regional factors, as well as micro- and meso-level phenomena like the internet, social media, adolescence, personality, language, education, and mental health, are not sufficiently embedded in theory. The findings further provide the first empirical evidence confirming the fragmentation of research on radicalization. This review represents a crucial step toward synthesizing existing knowledge and advancing a unified understanding of radicalization.",

          "abstract": "A large body of research addresses whether and how parental partnership quality affects child wellbeing. While much of this research has focused on nuclear families, less is known about patterns in stepfamilies. This study adopts a dyadic perspective to explore how parental partnership quality relates to the wellbeing of children living with both biological parents versus those with a biological parent and a stepparent. We apply multivariable linear regression and a mediation analysis on longitudinal data from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam) to understand the relationship between family structure, step- and biological parent’s partnership quality and children’s self-reported wellbeing, operationalised over the Strength and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ-scores). The analytical sample includes children who live in heterosexual couple households (n=1,781). We differentiate two separate dimensions of parental partnership quality, namely the frequency of conflict and esteem between the (step-)parents. Results show that children living with a stepparent exhibit higher total difficulties score compared to children living with both their biological parents. However, parental conflict occurs less and esteem more frequently in stepfamilies than in nuclear families. Mediation analysis indicates that partnership quality partially mediates the impact of family structure on SDQ scores. Our analysis suggests that the negative effect of living with stepparents on children’s socio-emotional wellbeing is slightly mitigated by increased parental esteem and lower conflict in these unions.",

          "abstract": "Street names are not neutral identifiers to navigate through cities but are charged with strong symbolic connotations and reflect power relations within society. A growing body of geographic scholarship documents a strong gender bias in the urban namespace, where women only represent a small fraction of streets named after people. This article investigates whether the lack of women in political decision-making roles contributes to explaining their marginalization in urban toponyms. More specifically, we study the impact of the gender and ideology of town mayors on their decisions to commemorate women in the street map. Focusing on the universe of Spanish towns during the period 2001-2023, we find through fixed effects panel data models and regression discontinuity design that the mayor’s gender does not affect the percentage of female-named streets, while the ideology of the governing party does. Our findings thus indicate that it is ideology rather than gender what shapes politicians’ preferences regarding the commemoration of women in the street map. We argue that this is because, on the one hand, strong political parties can impose their agenda on local leaders, making irrelevant differences in their gender and, on the other, the ideological cleavage is more relevant than the gender one to account for differences in attitudes towards symbolic gender policies. A natural implication of our results is that simply having more female politicians will hardly suffice to address the gender gap in street names and in other symbolically charged policies.",

          "abstract": "Decisions made by millions of refugees about where to go, how to make a living and how to secure a future are fundamental drivers of secondary movements. While a substantial body of literature addresses factors contributing to migrants’ decision-making, a comprehensive understanding of the central role of refugees in secondary mobility decision-making, including agency and strategies employed, remains underexplored. This is partly due to the belief that refugees are constrained by external and structural factors and cannot exercise agency, which we challenge. This article provides a systematic analysis of the literature on refugees’ secondary mobility decision-making processes. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, it presents an in-depth analysis of 40 peer?reviewed, English-language research articles selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases published before September 2022. The article critically examines the drivers, prevailing dichotomies and conceptual frameworks surrounding refugee categorization, agency, and mobility. By synthesizing a wide range of literature, our paper presents emerging alternative concepts and \nframeworks that shed light on the complex dynamics of decision-making",

          "authors": "MOBILE - Center of Excellence for Global Mobility Law; Nora Stappert; Soetkin Verhaegen",
          "abstract": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) has come under challenge in recent years as some\ncountries have decided, or considered, to withdraw from it. Against this backdrop, an emerging\nliterature has begun to examine attitudes toward the court among the general public as a key\ncourt constituency. However, little is known about how domestic elites perceive the court. This\nresearch gap is particularly surprising given that domestic elites have a considerable impact on\nboth public and state support of the court. This article explains why political and societal elites\nacross world regions have confidence or lack confidence in the ICC. We present the results from\na unique survey of 722 elite respondents conducted from 2017 to 2019 across six countries:\nBrazil, Germany, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, and the United States. We furthermore\nenrich our analysis by using public opinion data to draw comparisons between elites and the\ngeneral public. The analyses reveal that the views of elites are most consistently related to\ntheir perceptions of other, more well-known international organizations and their country’s\nrelationship with the ICC. Our findings indicate both similarities and differences between how\nelite and public opinion about the ICC are formed, demonstrating the value of further research\non elite opinion on international courts.",

          "authors": "Christoph Giang Nguyen; Sabrina J. Mayer; Jörg Dollmann; Jannes Jacobsen",
          "abstract": "This study investigates factors driving attitudes towards voluntary return intentions among Ukrainian displaced people. Using a vignette experiment (N = 384; Observations = 1,102) to manipulate home country conditions, we find that, as expected, the most crucial driver for return intention is the presence of peace in the home country.  Conversely, economic and social conditions commonly outlined in the general migration literature have little to no effect on return intentions of forcibly replaced individuals. However, we also demonstrate that not all forms of peace are equally convincing; a \"punishing\" peace, associated with significant territorial loss, resembles an ongoing state of war and thus discouraging refugees from returning. Similarly, while peace itself does improve return intentions, so does greater integration into the international community. Our paper thus demonstrates that the conditions facilitating return are more nuanced than commonly discussed, and that not all forms of peace are seen as equal.",

          "authors": "Matthew J. A. Craig",
          "abstract": "Many social media platforms today are driven by content filtering algorithms that personalize their recommendations based on the individual user. Through nuanced interactions with the platform, such as human-algorithm interplay, the end user effortlessly cultivates a social media feed. While this level of personalization can greatly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users show to dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still engage in disclosure of private information with the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine to what extent social media users (N = 1,305) allow co-ownership of private information with their algorithm depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals’ algorithmic literacy significantly predicts their willingness to allow co-ownership of private information with social media algorithms. Additionally, contrary to previous literature, greater algorithmic awareness leads to less co-ownership for those most fatigued. Considering these findings, implications for future research for human-machine communication privacy management are discussed.",

          "abstract": "How do interest groups learn about and influence politicians over time? We develop a game-theoretic model where an interest group can lobby a politician while learning about their ideological alignment. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tradeoff: interest groups must balance gathering information against exerting immediate influence, while politicians strategically manage their reputations to shape future interactions. These strategic forces generate systematic dynamics: policies and transfers shift in tandem, with early-career politicians showing greater policy variance and extracting larger rents through reputation management than veterans. Uncertainty about alignment increases policy volatility as groups experiment with offers, while institutional features like committee power and revolving-door incentives systematically alter both learning incentives and influence strategies. Our results shed new light on how interest group influence evolves across political careers and varies with institutional context.",

          "abstract": "This exploratory qualitative study uses a multilevel framework, combining the Social Construction of Technology and the Cognitive-Affective-Normative model, to examine how individual perceptions, emotions, and reflections shape deepfake acceptance, particularly those featuring deceased artists. Fifty-one participants (70.37% female; Mean Age = 24.6) took part in six online focus groups, viewing two randomly selected deepfakes of deceased artists. Thematic analysis, using a phenomenological approach, identified primarily intellectual reactions, with two key layers: first-order evaluations of realism and second-order societal impact assessments. These impacts spanned micro (individuals), meso (content creators/distributors), and macro (society-wide) levels. While cognitive and ethical concerns were prominent, emotional responses were fewer, often expressing discomfort or surprise. Findings offer valuable insights for the digital media industry and regulators in understanding public reception of deepfake technology.",

          "abstract": "This research applies Uses and Gratifications theory to examine individual motivations for sharing or not sharing deepfakes. After characterizing popular deepfakes in five genres (two examples each), 1035 US participants (42% female; Age: M = 42.8, SD = 14.1, Mdn = 41, Range = 18–93) watched one of the ten deepfakes and completed a questionnaire in Prolific. Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",

Results show that in 12 of the books, the young authors had introduced protagonists, supporting characters or minor characters inspired by the environmental educators and activists they had interacted with.  These characters were adults who were different from the other adults in the storybooks. They were first and foremost, Indian, were kind &amp; caring, were experts who taught in child-friendly &amp; democratic ways and created a proto-conscientization in the other characters in the books. This proto-conscientization included an understanding of systems of power and oppression which then fuelled political or community based action by the characters in the books.

This paper outlines and discusses how the Lesson Study professional development methodology, grounded in the Constructionist, Contextualized, and Meaningful (CCM) approach, along with the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, can support teachers in promoting inclusive education. It presents the theoretical assumptions and the pathways researchers have taken to train future teachers, support educators' continuous professional development in the Brazilian context, and build inclusive education through educational actions, academic initiatives, and scientific research. The study suggests that the combined use of Lesson Study and the CCM approach, supported by the UDL framework, fosters effective inclusive teaching practices that address the diverse needs of all students within inclusive educational settings. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the intentional integration of CCM approach and UDL as facilitative conceptual frameworks, alongside using Lesson Study as an iterative process for professional development, establishes the conditions necessary for inclusive education to flourish.",

It investigates the role of inorganic accounts in amplifying political disinformation using the \"information disorder\" framework. Data were collected from her most viral posts over 54 months (January 2017 - July 2021), and users interacting with them were classified as organic or inorganic, with further subdivisions, such as: inorganic, highly suspicious, suspicious, and organic. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm and a theoretical framework jointly identified abnormal behaviour, revealing that 11.25% of users exhibited confirmed inorganic behaviour. This indicates coordinated inauthentic behaviour, a common feature of disinformation campaigns, though the study does not explore any direct connection to RT or the Russian government. Methodologically, the study advances by analysing retweets instead of hashtags and corroborating results through machine learning.

Previous work has suggested that as societies grow in scale and complexity, extreme forms of inequality  no longer provide a viable method of maintaining cohesion and cooperation. The relationship between these supposedly critical features, however, has not been subjected to large-scale systematic analysis. Here, we investigate the rise, spread, and impact of cooperation-promoting institutions and ideologies in a global sample of past societies. We find a clear divergence in the evolutionary trajectories of these traits: on one hand, certain ideological features relating to the adoption of moralizing religions, increasing complexity and professionalization of governmental administration, and maintenance of public goods clearly arise and spread alongside increases in social scale; on the other, ideologies and institutions limiting rulers’ power and authority are not uniformly characteristic of larger-scale societies. We discuss a range of possible interpretations for these patterns, noting that the forces driving these developments may operate on different scales of analysis and time-courses and suggest tentative explanations for these critical dynamics.",

          "authors": "Sara Amini; Lola Rousseau; Edgar Hertwich",
          "abstract": "As buildings become more energy efficient due to construction and technological improvements and stricter regulations, the impact of construction and maintenance materials is gaining prominence in the life cycle emissions of buildings. In high-income countries like Norway, renovation of the existing building stock is crucial for reducing overall environmental impacts. However, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Norwegian buildings, especially concerning material use and embodied emissions. Building archetypes offer a solution by providing structured background data to enhance LCA studies. This paper addresses this gap by examining the space heating demand and material use of residential building archetypes in Norway, categorized by type and construction cohort. Dynamic energy simulations were conducted using EnergyPlus, combined with the BuildME Python package for material aggregation and calculation. Our results show that structural components dominate the material intensity (MI) of most archetypes, particularly in buildings with basements. Multi-family houses (MFHs) built after 1991 outperform single-family houses (SFHs) and apartment blocks (ABs) in both MI and material per person (MpP). Renovating SFHs to accommodate more occupants could reduce their MpP while maintaining a comfortable living environment. The higher MI in ABs, driven by concrete floor decks, suggests that using wood in future constructions could significantly lower both MI and MpP, reducing resource use and embodied emissions. This work links energy performance with material efficiency, offering valuable data for improving policy and practices in the Norwegian building sector.",

There is a paucity of research that has examined how significant health, social, and environmental crises impact suicidal ideation, particularly where these events co-occur and have potentially synergistic adverse effects.

A community-based sample of 1928 Australians (aged ≥16 years) completed online surveys measuring mental health, social, and environmental risk factors, and suicidal ideation at baseline, and the suicidal ideation measure was repeated at four follow-up timepoints.\n\nResults. Analyses showed five different trajectories of suicidal ideation (one stable low ideation trajectory; four vulnerable trajectories). A different set of risk factor variables predicted each vulnerable trajectory relative to the low trajectory. A cumulative risk index representing the combined effects of the mental health, social, and environmental risk factors also predicted each vulnerable trajectory relative to the low trajectory.\n\nConclusions. While adversity resulting from exposure to health and environmental crises was associated with suicidal ideation, the heterogeneity in how patterns of mental health, social, and environmental factors related to trajectory classes suggests that people experience these events differently. A cumulative risk index may be a potentially useful indicator of risk.",

          "abstract": "Regional inequality in Peru represents one of the most significant challenges to\nachieving sustainable economic growth and social cohesion. This paper explores\nthe historical, economic, social, and institutional causes of regional disparities,\nexamining how geography and resource distribution have led to uneven development across the country. Drawing on the historical legacy of colonialism,\nthe analysis reveals how extractive economic models and centralized governance\nhave perpetuated inequality, disproportionately affecting rural and indigenous\nregions such as the Andean highlands and the Amazon basin.\nThe study assesses the economic effects of regional inequality, including its\nimpact on national growth, labor market inefficiencies, and vulnerability to external shocks. Social effects are examined in terms of reduced social cohesion,\ninternal migration, and increased social conflicts, particularly in areas rich in\nnatural resources. The paper also evaluates the implications for human development, focusing on gaps in education, healthcare, and quality of life that\nperpetuate cycles of poverty and limit opportunities for upward mobility.\nTo address these disparities, the paper proposes several strategies aimed\nat promoting inclusive development. These include investment in sustainable\ninfrastructure to improve connectivity and access to resources, economic diversification to reduce dependence on volatile extractive sectors, strengthening of\neducation and healthcare services to bridge social gaps, and enhancing regional\ngovernance to optimize decentralization and resource management.\nThe paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of reducing regional\ninequality for the sustainable development of Peru. It argues that equitable\ndevelopment is essential for fostering national unity, economic resilience, and\nsocial well-being. Future research directions are also identified, including the\nimpact of climate change on regional inequality, the role of digital technology\nin bridging gaps, and the potential for community-based approaches to resource\nmanagement. By understanding and addressing the root causes of inequality,\nPeru can lay the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous future for all\nits citizens.",

          "authors": "Rex McKenzie; Christian Koutny",
          "abstract": "This paper develops the concept of the hyper-capitalist urban node (HCUN) as a new theoretical framework for understanding how financial capitalism transforms contemporary cities. Through systematic analysis of London's economic, social, and technological changes from 1992 to 2023, we demonstrate that global financial centres have evolved beyond established models of the global city. Drawing on comprehensive longitudinal data, we identify six distinctive characteristics of HCUNs: financial sector dominance, extreme income polarisation, housing financialisation, the political-financial nexus, technological acceleration, and social-spatial transformation. London's empirical evidence demonstrates how these characteristics manifest in concrete terms through dramatic shifts in employment structure, housing markets, income distribution, and spatial organisation. We argue that HCUNs represent not merely a quantitative intensification of existing urban processes, but rather a qualitative shift in how cities function within global capitalism. The analysis reveals fundamental contradictions within the HCUN model, explaining why conventional urban policies often fail to achieve their intended outcomes. Through this research, we advance both theoretical understanding of contemporary urban transformation and methodological approaches to studying it, including the development of the HCUN Index. Our findings demonstrate the need for fundamental innovation in urban theory and governance to address the distinctive challenges posed by financial capitalism's intensifying influence over urban development.",

          "abstract": "Although research in the STEM field has extensively examined its gendered characteristics, the vast majority of the literature has concentrated on educational transitions and young adults. More limited attention has been devoted to the longer-term work-family trajectories of STEM majors, and how these are linked to gender earnings gaps. In response, we exploit Finnish register data to identify the most common work-family trajectories followed by college educated men and women with STEM majors in ages 30–40 (N=150,796). Given marked differences in gender proportions across STEM fields, we distinguish computer science and engineering majors from natural science majors. In a second step, we assess gender differences in the returns to distinct work-family trajectories and within-gender differences. We report three main findings. First, women are able to combine a career in computer science and engineering and having children. Second, across occupations, mothers earn considerably less than fathers. This suggests that even though women can combine work and family, they do not benefit in terms of earnings. Third, beyond uncovering gender gaps, we show that a major mechanism underlying parental gender gaps is that men receive notable fatherhood premiums across work trajectories. For women, findings reveal more heterogeneous patterns. Among computer science and engineering majors, women have similar earnings across trajectories. Conversely, women with natural science majors gain from working in computer science and engineering.",

          "abstract": "It is broadly accepted among political scientists, political sociologists, and social movement theorists that a unified group will have a higher probability of success than a group that experiences internal divisions or fragmentation. Similarly, it has been assumed that in a society with a relatively unified elite, the elite will experience disproportionately higher benefits relative to the larger population. We take issue with this claim. In the mid-twentieth century, large American corporations exhibited a relatively high level of unity but the relative economic benefits accruing to the elite were at historic lows. In more recent years, American big business has become increasingly fragmented, yet the economic benefits that these elites have received have reached historic highs, and the average American’s standard of living has stagnated. Drawing on Padgett and Ansell, we introduce the concept of inadvertent robust action to explain how a relatively fragmented, disorganized elite can reap benefits that exceed those that its more unified counterparts experienced in an earlier era. We conclude with a discussion of the conditions under which our formulation can be expected to hold.",

          "authors": "Allison Goldberg",
          "abstract": "This study examines the movement against “progressive” prosecutors in the United States. Prosecutors have significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system, including over charges, bail recommendations, and plea deals. Although prosecutors have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration, “progressive” prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers since 2016 on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of the criminal legal system. While scholars tie the rise of progressive prosecutors to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about the countermovements efforts – such as recalls, impeachments, and suspensions – challenging these prosecutors’ discretion and tenures. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country's 300 most-populous jurisdictions. Through archival research, I documented prosecutor demographics, state politics, and unusual opposition, which I define as organized efforts to remove prosecutors from office or constrain their power outside of regularly-scheduled elections. Findings reveal that unusual opposition disproportionately targets women of color prosecutors, disproportionately occurs in Republican-controlled states, and has nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that unusual opposition is a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to legally mobilize against racial justice efforts following BLM.",

          "authors": "Sofia Maniatakou; Pero Olsson; Peter Søgaard Jørgensen",
          "abstract": "Several transnational corporations, investors, international organizations and philanthropies have formed coalitions to respond to global social and environmental challenges. Do these coalitions, consisting of large-scale actors, have the capacities to contribute to the transformations that are needed, or do they perpetuate the same system dynamics that created the problem in the first place? We investigate this question by comparing publicly available information for five coalitions working with financial and food systems sustainability. This paper examines whether large-scale actor coalitions (LSACs) may contribute to transformations towards equitable and sustainable futures. We use a ‘rapid assessment’ 20-variable framework to collect and analyze empirical data from five food and finance coalitions to identify their roles and capacities for transformative change. Our results indicate that LSACs implement distinct strategies to reach their goals. More specifically, due to their diverse set-ups, LSACs have the ability to raise awareness of sustainability issues, utilize ties to push forward agendas, experiment with solutions and showcase promising niche initiatives. We examine strategies undertaken by LSACs that can enable other change makers working to transform the food and finance systems, contributing to systems with high and diverse capacities for transformative change. We also identify potential capacity gaps within the studied LSACs, which might hinder the creation of enabling conditions for transformative change within the food and finance sectors.",

          "abstract": "Agriculture based economy makes the rural areas important in south-east\nAsia. Lack of accessibility to certain services were observed in countries\nlike, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India etc. As a result, rural-urban migration\nbecame a regular practice. Though spatial dimension of accessibility was\nstudied, non-spatial dimension was mostly unexplored for access to\neducation, healthcare, food and modern agricultural services. So, with\nten villages of Bangladesh as study area, 452 questionnaire surveys, 22\nFGDs and 27 KIIs were conducted to understand the problems behind\nlack of access to these services. Different statistical tests, and qualitative\ncomparison suggested that non-farm activities were more sustainable for\nhouseholds, and provided more access to services than fully farmingbased\nhouseholds. Some services were available, but inaccessible to the\nlocal people due to mismanagement. Livelihood diversification through\ncollaboration of community and women empowerment could be the\nsustainable solutions for ensuring proper service accessibility in\ndeveloping countries.",

          "abstract": "Three out of five Australian renters say they expect they will never own their own home — a significant shift that requires rethinking of tax and housing systems so that governments’ support all Australians in a two tier housing market (of owners and renters) into retirement, according to new AHURI research.\n\nThe policy challenge is to make renting a good, long-term housing outcome for renters, particularly lower-income, older renters with limited superannuation. The research highlights that in the Australian Housing Aspirations (AHA) survey a large majority (78%) of private rental tenants aspired to own their own home, while the research survey found three out of five (59%) private renters don’t think they will ever be able to afford to buy a home of their own.\n\nCurrently, homeowners receive tax concessions that are not available to renters. Examples include no capital gains tax on the sale of the primary residence (which becomes a form of wealth accumulation) and no tax on the imputed rental income of owner occupied housing. Conversely, renters are required to pay rent after income tax.\n\nA fairer housing and tax system (for retirement investment) could see some lower income private renters compensated for living long-term in the sector. This support could come through the provision of non-property investment opportunities (to reduce households’ need to 'rentvest') or targeted superannuation benefits.\n\nSustained underinvestment in social housing stock has also had long-term negative implications for all Australians and additional public housing construction is needed as a priority, together with policies to support private developers increasing the supply of affordable housing. In addition, a more immediate goal for policy development is to reform legislation controlling private tenancies so as to have better protections for tenants.",

          "abstract": "Over the past ten years or so, concern has mounted about places in the Global North that have been ‘left behind’ by the growth and prosperity experienced in superstar cities and other wealthy regions. This briefing paper summarises the findings from the one of the strands of the ‘Beyond Left Behind Places’ project, which involved quantitative analysis of residential migration patterns in economically ‘left behind’ regions in the UK, France, and Germany during the immediate pre-COVID period. In addition, we conducted qualitative research with residents of economically ‘left behind’ regions in the three countries to get their perceptions. We use national administrative and census data for the three countries to examine whether economically lagging regions tend to lose or gain population through migration, and what age groups are moving in or out.  Economic theories often assume that individuals migrate from economically lagging regions to areas offering better economic conditions. But actually, economically lagging regions in the UK, France and Germany generally tend to experience net population inflows. In other words, more people are moving to these regions than are moving out. In fact, when it comes to internal migration (i.e. people moving within the same country), these lagging regions tend to attract more new residents, on average, than more economically successful regions do.",

No longer are race (American Indian/Alaska Native/Indigenous, Asian/Asian American, Black/African American/African, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, White) and Hispanic/Latina/e/o ethnicity recorded separately. Instead, they are all options from which one or more may be claimed as an ethnoracial identity, and they include an additional Middle Eastern/North African category among the list of options. It is no longer necessary to claim or reject a racial category for oneself to claim a solely Hispanic/Latina/e/o ethnic identity, which means that the current and prior schemes for ethnoracial identity are neither equivalent nor directly comparable.",

          "abstract": "International investment arbitration is inhabited by actors who theorize the law as scholars and decide on it when arbitrating, which raises critical questions concerning their normative role within the legal system. This article explores empirically the influence of legal scholars on the development of inter?national investment law through a combined legal-empirical and sociological approach designed to capture the multidirectional nature of influence. It relies on a novel database of all citations to legal scholarship in International Centre for the Settlement of Disputes (ICSID) case law, which is analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and contextualized alongside interviews with 16 leading arbitrators and lawyers. The article firstly introduces the arbitrator/academic as an agent of international law, and then details the methodology. It then turns to provide an overview of citations to legal scholarship in ICSID case law, before considering why legal actors find it useful. The following parts show how legal scholarship influenced the development of the definition of an ‘investment’ in ICSID arbitration through an analysis of legal decisions and scholarship authored by arbitrators. The final part goes into conversation with the actors to further unravel how they manage competing and complementary obligations towards theory and practice, and the article concludes by reflecting on the ethical implications of their law-making function.",

          "authors": "Lingkai Kong",
          "abstract": "Current federalism research is dominated by the successful American model, focusing on a territorialized, mono-national constitutional federalism, where individuals of different nations within a specific territorial scope are jointly subject to and protected by the state. However, this is not the only way federalism can address the coexistence of multiple nations. By reviewing historical figures and theoretical narratives, as well as incorporating contemporary federal theorists on plurality and multiracial coexistence, this study seeks to shed light on a non-territorialized alternative arrangement. Once, facing the complex national coexistence within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austrian Marxist Karl Renner proposed the personal principle and cultural autonomy, attempting to reshape the federal structure of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through a non-territorial arrangement. Renner reorganizes national communities as legal entities to act as intermediaries between individuals and the state, and to implement non-territorial economic, political, and cultural management for individuals of their own nations. This study also explores the model's non-territorial character, its treaty-based character, and its embodiment of federalism as norm. In Renner's view, this attempt could achieve a balance, avoiding both the oppression of minorities by the majority within territorial structures and the centrifugal tendencies of minority groups within specific territorial scopes. Although Renner's federalist reforms ultimately failed, they still provide valuable guidance for dealing with the political reality of multinational coexistence today, demonstrating the inherent potential of a non-territorial, pluralistic, treaty-based federalism.",

          "authors": "Leon S Robertson",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, white fundamentalist Christians became disproportionately affiliated with the Republican Party in the U.S. and some advocate Christian Nationalism. This study examines the association of religious commitment with an index of humanitarian progress and Republican vote percentage in 2012 and 2016 among U.S. states. The percentage of people who say they pray daily in a state strongly correlates with a lower humanitarian progress score and a higher percentage of votes for Trump. The correlations remained strong when other factors (gun ownership, ethnic segregation, and income per cost of living) were controlled statistically in a multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that reliance on the supernatural leads to neglect of the natural. Support of Trump whose dishonesty is legion and who employs the fascist tactic of blaming social problems on minorities seems anomalous with Christian ideology. Although many establishment Republicans warned against Trump, the strong correlation between the Trump vote in 2016 with the vote for the establishment Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 suggests that party members are enmeshed in mutually reinforcing social arrangements that are not conducive to support of humanitarian policies and resistance to fascist tactics.",

Essa però, in tempi di contagio, dove domina la paura del contatto fisico e prevalgono le regole del distanziamento sociale, rischia di venire meno. Nelle 4 aree è quindi emersa la fragilità della rete comunitaria interna, paralizzata dalla paura e incapace di offrire risposte di mutuo aiuto e di solidarietà.",

          "authors": "Christopher Blattman",
          "abstract": "International drug trafficking dominates the conversation on organized crime, but equally common and serious are urban systems of organized crime—criminal groups focused not on exports or transshipment, but on dominating local markets, neighborhoods, and politics. When policymakers do pay attention to this problem, they consistently make the same mistake—believing there are best practices. But systems of organized crime are not all alike. There is no one blueprint or general solution, and so following the latest fad is unlikely to deliver the desired result. Instead of trying to copy the quasi-mythological success of a Giuliani or Bukele, policymakers need to understand what kind of organized crime problem they have, what capabilities their city possesses, and what tools are appropriate to the circumstances. This paper looks in-depth at how organized crime is organized in three cities: Chicago, Medellín, and San Salvador. It also considers New York, Bogotá, and Port-au-Prince. I argue that the primary driver of their organization and incentives is their source of criminal revenues. A second major driver of behavior is the degree of criminal political organization, which broadly-speaking takes three forms: atomized individuals, fragmented groups, and competing confederations. These forms are not just the product of their revenues, but are also the result of decades of competition with the state and one another. What policy tools will work hinges on this diagnosis. I look at the evidence for a range of standard policies—from crackdowns to street outreach—and explain why we can expect them to have wildly different impacts depending on the context.",
