          "authors": "Tamas Krivachy",
          "abstract": "We show that citation metrics of journal articles in many of the online-only Springer Nature journals and associated ones are distorted, going back to articles from 2001. We find that most likely due to an API response error, there are many incorrect references which typically lead to Article Number 1 of a given Volume. Among others, the issue affects journals such as Scientific Reports, Nature Communications, Communications journals, Cell Death &amp; Disease, Light: Science &amp; Applications, as well as many BMC, Discovery and npj journals. Beyond the negative effect of introducing incorrect reference information, this distorts the citation statistics of articles in these journals, with a few articles being massively over-cited compared to their peers, while many lose citations; e.g. both in Scientific Reports and in Nature Communications, 5 of the 10 top cited articles have article numbers of 1. We validate the distorted statistics by assessing data from multiple scientific literature databases: Crossref, OpenCitations, Semantic Scholar, and the journals' websites. The issue primarily arises from the inconsistent transition from page-based referencing of articles to article number-based referencing, as well as the improper handling of the change in the publisher's article metadata API. It seems that the most pressing problem has been present since approximately 2011, which we estimate affects the citation count of millions of authors.",

          "title": "Designing Digital Dashboards for Business Performance: Principles and Evidence",
          "authors": "Bonginkosi Thango; Nontokozo Cynthia Msibi; Sbonelo Mkhwanazi; Siyabonga Mazibuko",
          "abstract": "Digital dashboards have become integral tools for data-driven decision-making, yet variations in design principles, user focus, and performance impact limit their standardization and strategic optimization. This systematic review examined the design principles, implementation characteristics, and performance outcomes of digital dashboards across strategic, operational, and analytical contexts, with emphasis on their influence on business performance. Following the PRISMA 2020 framework, a comprehensive search was conducted across Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. From 5 793 initial records, 75 studies (2016–2025) met inclusion criteria after duplicate removal and full-text screening. Eligible studies included journal articles, conference papers, book chapters, theses, and dissertations addressing dashboard design, usability, and organizational impact. Publication trends showed a four-phase evolution from early conceptualization (2016–2018) to an emerging peak (2024–2025) characterized by AI- enabled and predictive dashboards. Research output was globally distributed but concentrated in North America, Europe, and the Asia–Pacific, led by the United States (17.3%) and India (10.7%). Most studies were journal articles (60%), indexed across Google Scholar (34.7%), Scopus (33.3%), and Web of Science (32%). Strategic (38.7%) and operational (32%) dashboards dominated, emphasizing KPI selection (41.3%) and visual hierarchy (41.3%) as core design principles. Executives (49.3%) were the primary user group, followed by field teams and analysts. Evaluation predominantly assessed usability (65.3%) and task completion time (34.7%), indicating balanced attention to experiential and performance metrics. Periodic data updates (64%) were more common than real-time modes (36%), though the latter improved responsiveness. Web-based platforms (53.3%) prevailed, with limited exploration of mobile (18.7%) and desktop (4%) environments. Key performance outcomes included enhanced decision speed (58.7%) and productivity gains (40%), while the main challenges were user overload (46.7%) and data delays (44%). Future research directions emphasized AI and automation (13.3%), scalability, and cross-system interoperability, alongside emerging interests in policy, governance, and sustainability. Current evidence demonstrates that well-designed dashboards substantially improve cognitive efficiency, decision quality, and organizational performance. However, methodological heterogeneity, data latency, and underreported longitudinal impacts constrain generalizability. Advancing dashboard research will require standardized usability protocols, empirical validation of design frameworks, and integration of intelligent, adaptive interfaces to enhance business agility.",

          "abstract": "The Metabolic Phenotype Transfer (MPT) framework explores a potential pathway for permanent metabolic reprogramming through the coordinated adaptation of intestinal microbiota, hormonal regulation, and cellular communication. This theory suggests that the long-term stability of metabolic processes depends on the bidirectional regulation between the central nervous system and peripheral metabolic systems. By establishing a symbiotic microbiota environment capable of self-regeneration, and by transiently modulating hormonal and cellular pathways, the human body may achieve a sustained metabolic phenotype independent of external pharmacological control. The model proposes that this brain–body integration could permanently enhance metabolic efficiency, energy distribution, and behavioral stability, offering a theoretical basis for future interdisciplinary studies linking neurophysiology, microbiology, and metabolic health.",

          "title": "When do interaction/moderation effects stabilize in linear regression?",
          "authors": "Andrew J Castillo; Joshua Miller; Colin Vize; David A Baranger; Donald R Lynam",
          "abstract": "Two-way interaction effects in linear regression occur when the relation between two variables changes depending on the level of a third. Despite their frequent use, interactions are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately and test for statistical significance due to small effect sizes and low reliability. This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to establish stability thresholds for two-way interactions between continuous variables across combinations of reliability (.7–1.0), main effect size (.1–.5), collinearity (.1–.5), and interaction effect size (.05–.2). Stability was defined as the consistency of estimated effect sizes across repeated samples of the same size from the same population and operationalized using modified definitions of the Corridor of Stability (COS) and Point of Stability (POS) from Schönbrodt and Perugini (2013). Results show that the stability of interaction estimates is primarily determined by sample size and predictor reliability. The case representing a realistic psychology field study, where researchers have limited control over variables, stabilized at n = 3,800, requiring 72% statistical power. At n &lt; 100, 11%–45% of the estimates were incorrectly signed (i.e., negative when the true effect was positive). Most psychology studies enroll far fewer than 500 participants, and our results indicate many published interactions may be unstable. It should be noted that analyses involving highly reliable predictors, such as group assignment in experimental designs, may stabilize at lower sample sizes as they attenuate the expected effect size less than variables with more measurement error. Researchers are encouraged to avoid routine tests of two-way interactions unless sample size and reliability are adequate and hypotheses are specified a priori.",

At this point, it is clear that inaction is not due to lack of knowledge, convincing arguments, or clever acronyms.

          "authors": "NA; Amanda Kay Montoya; Samantha F. Anderson",
          "abstract": "Moderated mediation models are commonly used in psychological research and other academic fields to model when and how effects occur. Researchers must choose which paths in the mediation model are moderated when specifying this type of model. While the ultimate goal is to specify the model correctly, researchers may struggle to determine whether to err on the side of including too many moderated paths (maximalist approach) or including too few moderated paths (minimalist approach). This registered report examines how the specification of moderation impacts statistical power, type I error rate, and parameter bias for the index of moderated mediation. In a systematic review of papers published using moderated mediation over the course of one year, we found that six model specifications account for 85\\% of published moderated mediation analyses and the median sample size was 285. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impacts of model specification on power and type I error rate, and results were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression. In reference to the data-generating process, the data analysis model can either be correctly specified, over-specified, under-specified, or completely misspecified. Over-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power to detect a significant index of moderated mediation compared to correctly specified models and relatively low parameter bias. Under-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power than correctly specified models but unacceptably high parameter bias. Completely misspecified models were hypothesized to have inflated type I error rates and unacceptable parameter bias. Based on these results we recommend researchers lean more toward maximalist approaches to avoid parameter bias, but acknowledge that this comes with a cost in statistical power.",

          "authors": "Juan José Pérez-Díaz; Daniel Sanabria; José-Antonio Salas-Montoro; Mikel Zabala",
          "abstract": "The perception of voluntariness in task failure during extreme physical effort is debated in endurance sports. This study tested whether power meter data availability affects perceived voluntariness and performance in cyclists accustomed to power meters. Forty trained cyclists completed two counterbalanced maximal incremental tests: one without feedback and one with real-time power visualization. Confirmatory analyses showed that power visualization increased maximal aerobic power (MAP) without affecting VO2MAX, maximal heart rate, RPE, or perceived voluntariness. Exploratory analyses revealed an order effect: participants who first performed the test with power data perceived their decision to stop as more voluntary in that condition compared to the subsequent no-feedback test. This effect was absent in the reverse order group. No order effects were found for other variables. Cyclists’ performance judgments aligned with actual MAP differences. These findings show that access to power data enhances MAP. Although the main analysis pointed to a null effect on perceived voluntariness of the decision to stop, an exploratory order effect suggested that removing power data after prior exposure reduces perceived control over task failure decisions, warranting further investigation. This study highlights the role of performance feedback in shaping objective and subjective performance in cycling.",

          "abstract": "Faces serve as gateways of impression formation during human interactions and are widely used in psychological research. To test these questions, researchers often rely on databases of photographs of adults’ and children’s faces for stimuli. Although the value of these resources is clear, there are some limitations, especially for research using children’s images as stimuli. This manuscript introduces a novel alternative to those databases: AI-Faces by Illinois, a fully open-access (CC-BY-NC-4.0) database of 1,152 photorealistic, AI-generated images depicting child faces. All images, norming data, and Online Supplemental Material are freely available on OSF (https://osf.io/vurm5/). These images vary systematically by perceived age (3, 6, 10, 15 years), gender (boy, girl), race/ethnicity (Black, East Asian, Latine, Middle Eastern/North African, Native American, Pacific Islander, South Asian, White), and emotional expression (10 smiling, 4 angry, 4 frowning per group). A norming study assessing 1,261 adults’ ratings of the images indicates that faces across race and gender groups are perceived as equally real and align with the gender and racial identities they were prompted to represent. Many well-documented perceptual biases observed with real faces—such as the Own-Race Bias—also generalized to the AI-Faces by Illinois images, providing evidence that similar processes are at play when adults evaluate AI-generated images of children. This manuscript highlights the methodological advantages, and new ethical considerations, of using AI-generated faces of children in psychological research.",

          "abstract": "Can learning too much information at once impair long-term retention of its meaning? Emerging evidence suggests that encoding too many items into working memory (WM) limits subsequent long-term memory (LTM) retrieval of their details and gist. These findings highlight a boundary condition for theories positing relatively automatic gist encoding. But how expansive is this boundary? Experiment 1 shows that it extends to older adults, despite their generally enhanced reliance on gist memory. In two older adult samples (n = 40 each), LTM gist retrieval was reduced for objects encoded in sets exceeding WM capacity. Experiment 2 shows that this boundary holds even when retaining items in LTM is essential. Under intentional long-term learning, young (n = 81) and older (n = 40) adults’ LTM gist retrieval remained affected by overloading WM at encoding. Results invite leading memory theories to reconsider the universality of relatively automatic gist encoding.",

          "abstract": "Publicly available data on characteristics of geographical areas in the United States is vast yet challenging to use effectively. This study aimed to generate a set of summary scores at the block-group level across the United States and validate them using existing area-based measures, demographics, noise estimates, and maps of well-known metropolitan areas. Data included American Community Survey and Environmental Justice Screen data for 288,918 census block-groups collected yearly from 2013 to 2022. Exploratory structural equation modeling with bifactor rotation was used to extract five orthogonal factors. The scores were validated using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), Child Opportunity Index (COI), data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ambient noise data from the U.S. National Parks Service, and color-coded maps of metropolitan areas. The five scores captured urbanicity, socioeconomic prosperity, university influence, retirement appeal, and pollution levels. Validation showed expected relationships between urbanicity and ambient noise; socioeconomic status and ADI, COI, and mother's education; and score levels corresponding to known characteristics of metropolitan areas. These scores provide a significant advancement in the accessibility and usability of large-scale socioenvironmental data. The public availability brings numerous opportunities for further research and application, potentially uncovering new insights and informing evidence-based decision-making across various domains.",

          "authors": "François Guérit; Robert P. Carlyon",
          "abstract": "Cochlear-Implant (CI) users struggle to understand speech under noisy conditions. This has long been attributed to channel interactions: a given neuron not only responds to electrical stimulation from the closest electrode but is also sensitive to stimulation from electrodes located further away. Shaping the stimulation voltage into a very sharp profile (e.g. using tripolar as opposed to the more-common monopolar stimulation) has been proposed as a solution, but with only limited success. We argue that this is due to a combination of factors, including the fact that envelopes of adjacent CI channels are highly correlated in response to many sounds including speech, that some neural spread of excitation is necessary for sufficient loudness, and that, at comfortably loud levels, monopolar and sharp stimulation modes can yield very similar output voltage at cochlear locations that are at least 3-4 electrodes away from a given stimulation electrode. We describe a “Hilltop” method to effectively reduce the voltage more than 3-4 electrodes away from a given electrode, while keeping the same percept of place pitch as with monopolar stimulation. Based on computational modelling and on psychophysical measures of charge summation, we show that the difference between monopolar and Hilltop stimulation persists at the level of the spiral ganglion neurons, and therefore warrants investigations with more complex, multi-channel stimuli. We also describe possible limitations of this strategy, including the presence of sidelobes of opposite effective polarity in some participants, and suggest ways to mitigate their effects.",

          "authors": "Trent N. Cash; Daniel Oppenheimer",
          "abstract": "Users have become increasingly reliant on Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, to complete a wide range of reasoning tasks, from managing workplace projects to giving personal advice. However, LLMs function as black boxes, leaving users with minimal insight into how they generate the responses that they do. One way that users can attempt to peek into these black boxes is by asking LLMs to explain their reasoning processes. The nascent literature on LLM faithfulness suggests that LLMs – like humans – often fail to accurately identify the information they use to inform their reasoning, suggesting a lack of metacognitive knowledge. Across two studies, we extend this research to the context of multi-attribute choice, tasking both LLMs and human participants (n = 436) with completing the Knowledge of Weights paradigm. Participants first completed a series of choice tasks in which they picked between homes that varied on six attributes, then self-reported the decision weight they believed they placed on each attribute in two different formats. In Study 1, we found that ChatGPT4o self-reported weights that were significantly less reflective of their choice behavior than humans. In Study 2, we found that three more-advanced LLMs (ChatGPT5, Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Flash) self-reported weights that were as accurate or more accurate than those provided by humans. These results suggest that LLMs can generate and maintain accurate metacognitive knowledge of their own decision-making processes as well or better than humans, but that this is a relatively new ability. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.",

          "authors": "Owen W. Friend; Mira Bhakta; Eesha Gowda; Alison Preston",
          "abstract": "Autobiographical memory enables individuals to communicate not only what happened but when, drawing on both local event sequences and global temporal frameworks like recurring routines and conventional time systems (e.g., calendars, clocks). Developmental research has demonstrated gains in the ability to describe past events in sequence through childhood, yet little is known about how children embed experiences within global temporal structures. Moreover, existing studies of autobiographical organization often treat age as the primary driver of developmental change, which may overlook how differences in experience contribute to temporal organization as well. We hypothesized that, with age, children’s autobiographical narratives would shift from being organized in sequences of local events towards being embedded in global, relational structures. Moreover, we predicted that children’s experience navigating time independently in everyday life would relate to their tendency to describe experiences relative to temporal patterns. To that end, 92 participants aged 7-25 years, a key age range during which episodic memory abilities and independence increase, described a typical day, and their narratives were coded with a scheme which distinguished local from global temporal organization. We also measured conventional time knowledge and developed a questionnaire to quantify the independence with which children navigate time in daily life. Results supported our hypothesized developmental shift; with age, participants referenced local sequences less and global time structures more. Furthermore, individual differences in experience were linked to distinct organizational properties, as conventional time knowledge predicted references to specific temporal locations, while independence predicted references to relational time patterns.",

A sample of 473 Brazilian adults completed questionnaires on the EFML, musical coping, and well-being. The validation process involved Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), while the mediation was tested using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results supported a unidimensional, 9-item version (EFML-BR) with strong psychometric properties (χ²(27) = 73.88; CFI = 0.992; TLI = 0.989; RMSEA = 0.062; ω = 0.86). Critically, the EFML-BR fully mediated the relationship between avoidance coping and positive affect (β_indirect = 0.077, 95% CI [0.011, 0.149]). We conclude that eudaimonic music listening is not a direct cause of well-being, but the core mechanism that converts strategic musical distancing into genuine emotional flourishing.",

          "authors": "Yaron Kantor; Hava Dagan Gur",
          "abstract": "Designing games for the elderly must highlight age-related challenges and present unique opportunities to address a growing problem. Recent studies on gameplay design for older adults suggest using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Ryan, Rigby, and Przybylski 2006) which emphasizes relatedness as a key motivator (Webster 2008), providing potential benefits to the well-being of the elderly (Hasan and Linger 2016). This project design focuses on relatedness in gaming for older adults through a VR experience. We created an adventure using a virtual AI child as a companion, guide, and motivator. The game utilizes an independent Quest2 VR headset. The gameplay – designed to resonate with older adults' inner-childhood memories – features hand-drawn settings, nostalgic toys, and familiar intergenerational interactions (Havukainen et al. 2020). Each of the gameplay's levels presented a different measure of engagement across the SDT dimensions. Successful interactions were rewarded by the AI child's display of affection. The pilot consisted of 19 healthy Israeli elderly volunteers over 65, each participating in a 15–20-minute session in Shenkar Games' Lab. Unstructured interviews, motivated by Subjective Vitality and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory questionnaires, were administered to subjects before and after the gameplay to elicit changes in their subjective well-being. Chronicling the game highlighted the development of positive emotions between participants and their AI child. The immersive VR experience increased their emotional response and inspired the older adults to interact with their AI child as human, some even expressed desire to hug it. Notwithstanding the limited number of participants, the VR pilot demonstrated the possibility of relatedness between older adults and their AI companion.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how neurodivergent individuals, students, and educators discuss virtual reality (VR)-based education on Reddit, with a focus on accessibility, sensory experience, and structural concerns. Using a qualitative research design grounded in constructivist epistemology, secondary data were drawn from publicly available Reddit threads and analysed through thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s (2006) six-phase framework. Findings revealed that while some users experience VR as calming, structured, and conducive to focus, others reported sensory overload, motion sickness, and disorientation, especially among users with dyspraxia or heightened sensory sensitivities. Participants also voiced ethical concerns around corporate control, data privacy, and the exclusion of educators and neurodivergent stakeholders from design processes. The study underscores that VR is not inherently inclusive and that its educational benefits are highly individualised. Inclusive design must go beyond technical usability to meaningfully engage neurodivergent perspectives from the outset. The findings carry important implications for developers, educators, and policymakers seeking to integrate immersive technologies in equitable and ethical ways. By amplifying user-generated discourse, this research highlights the importance of participatory approaches in shaping accessible educational technologies and identifies a critical gap: the underrepresentation of neurodivergent developers in both online discourse and design leadership.",

          "abstract": "Currently there is a lack of suitable tasks for measuring cognitive flexibility (CF) in children under 3 years old. Additionally, few tasks can be adapted for use across infancy and toddlerhood, which is necessary to ensure consistency in the measured construct. Here we present a new CF task, the ‘Shapes Task’ aimed at addressing this gap. During the task, children first place differently shaped blocks directly into the correct target hole(s) in a shape-sorter box. Then, in three ‘Switch trials’, the box is rotated before the child can respond. To produce the correct response, the child must now withhold responding to the previously correct location(s) and flexibly orient to the new solution. The task was administered to 156 10-month-olds and 110 16-month-olds, with 87 participants assessed longitudinally. Participants were less accurate and had slower reaction times during Switch trials, suggesting that the switches successfully increased CF load. Additionally, 16-month-olds made quicker and more accurate responses than 10-month-olds. We also found evidence of longitudinal stability in task performance between the two ages. Performance on the Shapes Task did not correlate with a well-validated response inhibition task, suggesting that individual differences in Shapes performance is not driven by inhibitory control abilities. Our data suggest that the Shapes Task is an adequate measure of CF abilities in infants and toddlers, and as such is a valuable new addition to the developmental researcher’s toolkit.\nKeywords: Cognitive Flexibility, Executive Functions, Longitudinal, New Task, Infancy, Toddlerhood",

          "abstract": "Competing stimuli can influence our motivation and attentional control whilst completing cognitively demanding tasks; however, cognitively demanding tasks can be done more effectively with visual and auditory instructional input. Verbal instructions and self-talk have been shown to facilitate task performance more efficiently than written instruction, reducing the need to visually translate the information received into phonological representations. To analyse the effect of modality of instruction further, this study explores the influence of verbal and written instruction on cognitive performance in a task-switching test between two groups of different levels of general anxiety, utilising the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3). No major differences between the low and high anxiety groups was noted, and both groups showed lower reaction times and higher accuracy in the auditory instructions condition compared to the visual instructions. These findings support the conclusion that verbal instruction assists in mitigating cognitive load further emphasising its role in enhancing cognitive efficiency. Suggestions for further research exploring the use of instructional self-talk are presented.",

While much is known about how we explain contingent and probabilistic facts, far less is known about we explain necessary truths, such as those in mathematics, where the outcomes follow by logical deduction rather than causation. We present a framework, inspired by computational complexity, to make sense of how this happens: because cognition is resource-bounded, people prefer explanations that (1) reduce the cost of discovering the conclusion or (2) mark points of cognitive load where contemplation concentrates. In a series of three experiments with n=838 participants using SAT problems, we show how these motives serve as strong and significant predictors of explanatory preferences in both purely abstract logic problems (Study One), and in problems where the underlying logic is presented in the style of classic detective stories (Studies Two and Three, the latter preregistered). When story framings are used, preferences for causal drivers appear, but do not displace the the computational ones. Our results demonstrate that cognitive resource limitations are central to explanation-making; they can both coexist with causal explanation and can yield satisfying reasons-why judgments even in the absence of cause.",

          "abstract": "An important question in affective science is whether valence assignment, i.e., evaluating a perceived object as positive or negative, occurs after perception or whether it is intrinsic to it. Recent theories propose that valence assignment, or simply evaluation, may be embedded within conscious perception. To test this idea, we combined deep neural network (DNN) modeling with representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify which levels of visual processing contribute to valence assignment. Participants performed a forced-choice preference task, selecting one of three emotionally neutral everyday objects (e.g., cups, lamps) under varying instructions: no instruction, utility-based, aesthetic-based, and under time pressure. Perceived valence distances between objects were captured as representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) and compared with DNN activation distances across layers. Across studies, valence distances correlated with differences in the first DNN layer, reflecting low-level visual processing. However, this relationship could not be explained by individual features such as contrast or luminance, implying a more integrative perceptual basis. When choices involved objects from distinct categories, valence judgments primarily reflected perceived utility, yet aesthetic instructions biased them toward similar visual computations. These findings indicate that valence assignment is partially built into perceptual processing, with higher-level task demands flexibly shaping its expression. This supports a view of conscious perception as inherently valenced, yet context-sensitive.",

          "abstract": "Confidence exhibits systematic individual differences across mental health, gender, and age. However, it remains unknown whether these distinct sources of confidence (i.e., metacognitive) bias have common or distinct computational origins. To address this question, we studied the temporal evolution of underconfidence associated with individual differences in mental health and gender (N = 1447). We found that an underconfidence associated with anxiety symptoms became more prominent the longer individuals took to make metacognitive judgments – suggesting that it is exacerbated by additional time for introspection. In contrast, gender-related underconfidence decreased with greater metacognitive judgment time – suggesting that additional time for introspection is able to remediate prepotent biases. A novel dynamic computational model of confidence explained these effects – while both gender and anxiety symptoms involved shifts in confidence criteria, only anxiety symptoms involved a temporal accumulation of negatively-biased evidence about one’s ability. Our study reveals multiple computational pathways to the formation of underconfidence, in turn highlighting specific potential mechanisms for its remediation.",

          "abstract": "The increasing use of computer-generated speech in various applications has raised questions about how people perceive synthetic voices. This study investigates the role of linguistic information in the perception of humanness in speech. We conducted two experiments with native German-, Spanish- and Turkish-speaking participants who rated the human-likeness of human and text-to-speech (TTS)-generated voices. By presenting German sentences as well as manipulated versions of those sentences in terms of syntax and semantics, we examined the role of three types of linguistic information, that is, phonetics, semantics, and syntax, on humanness perception. Acoustic analyses revealed differences between human and TTS-generated voices in terms of summary acoustics and dynamic contours of pitch and intensity, thus showing that TTS-generated voices are not yet fully aligned with human voices on voice quality and prosody. Importantly, behavioral results showed that these acoustic differences were more salient to native German listeners, who distinguished between human and synthetic voices more extremely. In addition to the role of phonetic or phonological familiarity, we observed a role of both syntax and semantics in humanness perception, with the manipulated sentences sounding less human regardless of the speaker (i.e., TTS-generated or human), but only for the native speakers. Lastly, humanness perception of speech appears to be relatively idiosyncratic as indicated by the individual differences observed. Altogether, this study contributes to our understanding of the interplay between linguistic and paralinguistic information in speech perception, and clarifies how listeners perceive their increasingly synthetically-generated soundscape.",

To effectively champion sustainable practices, children's understanding of sustainability and social equity, especially concerning emerging technologies like social robots, must first be established. In this paper, we systematically investigated children’s understanding of robot sustainability and social equity through a mixed-methods survey study and a focus group study with 107 children aged 10-16 years. Our findings show that children’s understanding of sustainability and social equity informs a critical stance toward robots, with more knowledgeable children demanding higher standards. Our results contribute to the literature by shifting the discourse on educational robots toward sustainability, providing a foundational understanding of children's perspectives, and informing the design of future technologies and curricula to foster a more responsible and equitable future.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "Domestic Violence affects 1 in 3 women worldwide. Empirical evidence from India suggests that women and girls experience a continuum of violence and discrimination from prenatal stages till death in families that largely continue to operate within a dominantly patriarchal framework. However, quantitative literature on domestic violence in India suffers from problems pertaining to reductive and episodic framing, focusing on short-term prevalence, and frames the impact on survivors largely in terms of clinical constructs such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. This work argues for a broader, thematic framing of domestic and familial violence and contends that the psychological sequelae of this kind of chronic and systemic discrimination and violence cannot be captured using rigid clinical constructs that dominate psychological literature. We propose a conceptual framework utilizing case studies that is loosely and partially aligned with the tenets of complex trauma. However, we also critique its origin within hegemonic psychiatry that led to yet another diagnostic construct and highlight the need for creating a culturally adapted expansion—to shift the emphasis from an individually rooted, diagnostic framework to a continuous trauma framework that allows researchers to dissect the psychological alterations in survivors of domestic violence in a non-clinical and contextual manner.",

Number words are not only abstract in nature, but they are defined by their participation in a rich system of logical inferences that transcend our perceptual experience of the world. Numerate children as young as 5 years of age can reason about relations between large exact number words despite being unable to perceptually discriminate the quantities they represent. And they can reason about infinite magnitudes, despite never having experienced them. How do these intuitions arise in cognition if not through the senses? Although developmental psychologists have made remarkable progress in documenting the stages according to which children learn number words and the principles that govern their use, the cognitive origins of this knowledge remains poorly understood. I argue that strong nativist accounts lack a workable causal theory that describes the role that innate primitives might play during development and actual learning episodes. I then reconsider constructivist accounts that seek to explain how children might create new representational resources that have greater expressive power than precursor states.",

Nevertheless, this relationship remains unexplored within the genus Gorilla. In our study, we investigated the association between personality, interest, and performance in a cognitive enrichment task among 17 zoo-housed western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). The experimental task involved retrieving food from a tube presented in a social context. Each session consisted of a 30-minute recording of a gorilla performing the task, with a total of three sessions per individual. We conducted personality assessments using the Gorilla Behavior Index questionnaire, which comprised 25 adjectives. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors that accounted for 76% of the variance. We found positive associations between Maternal factor and the variable of success (first success), and negative associations between Maternal and Extraversion with success rate. However, we did not find a link between the personality factors and interest. Additionally, we observed that repeated exposure to the task improved gorillas’ performance. Females showed greater efficiency in food extraction compared to males. Furthermore, younger individuals achieved higher success rates than older ones. Thus, our findings suggest that personality, sex and age play an important role in explaining gorillas' performance in solving tasks.",

          "abstract": "Reading anxiety is the fear of reading and is theorized to be negatively associated with reading achievement. An inability to engage in reading due to either low reading achievement or high reading anxiety could be debilitating. Research on reading anxiety and its association with reading achievement has existed since the 1980s. However, this has been an area of rapidly increasing investigation in recent years. The goal of the present preregistered meta-analysis was to determine the strength of the association between reading anxiety and reading achievement. Through systematic screening of the published and unpublished literature, 64 studies were identified and included in the meta-analysis (totaling 180 effect sizes and 14,467 participants). The included studies were conducted in 14 countries and 11 languages. Analyses were performed using random effects models, accounting for dependent effect sizes via robust variance estimation. A moderate negative average weighted correlation was found between reading anxiety and reading achievement (r = -0.30). Significant heterogeneity across effect sizes was found (Q = 996, p &lt; .001, I2 = 82). Learning disability status, gender, reading domain, and age were not significant moderators. The association between reading anxiety and reading achievement has implications for the fields of psychology and education, specifically in efforts to promote people’s reading achievement while maintaining their socioemotional well-being. Future research using experimental and longitudinal designs is needed to determine the direction of any causal influences between reading anxiety and reading achievement. This would improve suggestions that can be made on how to support people struggling with their reading anxiety and reading achievement.",

No study before has investigated the longitudinal development of early joint attention (JA) behaviours in preterms. The current study examined the growth of early JA behaviours and the relation with later language skills in preterms.\nMethods: This prospective longitudinal study examined the development of early JA skills between 10 and 24 months in 51 preterms. The Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS) were administered at the corrected ages of 10, 18 and 24 months. At each age, infants’ JA behaviours and coordinated vocalisations were coded. At 36 months, language skills were evaluated by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.\nResults: We found that most JA behaviours (basic or advanced, regardless of coordinated vocalisations were considered) developed between 10 and 18 months in preterms. Only basic initiating behaviours did not seem to increase, with even a decrease for basic initiating JA (IJA). Response to JA behaviour was the only skill with a continued increase in frequency between 18 and 24 months. When investigating JA behaviours (at 10 months, and growth between 10-18 and 18-24 months) as predictors of language, only 10-months advanced IJA behaviours emerged as predictor of receptive language.\nConclusion: JA development in preterms mainly occurs between 10 and 18 months, but we emphasise the large observed inter-individual heterogeneity in JA development. Frequency of (advanced) IJA behaviours seem to contribute more to later language than initiating behavioural requests, possibly because these behaviours elicit more language learning opportunities.",

          "abstract": "Listeners rapidly form first impressions from voices, inferring multiple person characteristics within milliseconds. We employed a novel method, Self-Steered Sound Synthesis (S4), to identify and compare the acoustic signatures underlying these impressions. Participants interactively used S4 to synthesise voices expressing six person characteristics - age, masculinity, health, attractiveness, dominance, and trustworthiness - by manipulating four perceptually salient acoustic dimensions: mean pitch, pitch excursion, breathiness, and formant spacing. Masculinity, older age, and dominance were conveyed by lowering mean pitch and formant spacing, consistent with projecting the impression of a large person, and flattening the intonation. Physical health, attractiveness, and trustworthiness were conveyed by choosing less extreme and more \"typical\" acoustic properties. A second perceptual experiment confirmed that the synthesised voices from Experiment 1 indeed conveyed the intended person characteristics to an independent sample of listeners, and that listeners relied on similar acoustic cues for their evaluations. From a methodological perspective, we draw similar conclusions from two drastically different approaches, thus providing a comprehensive account of first impression formation that bridges across voice production (or synthesis) and perception. Our converging findings furthermore demonstrate the methodological robustness of S4. From a theoretical perspective, our findings furthermore extend theoretical frameworks that conceptualise first impressions within a continuous “trait space”, highlighting the graded and intercorrelated nature of different person characteristics on a perceptual and conceptual level. We extend this framework by showing that not only perceptual judgments, but also the acoustic signatures of person characteristics show intercorrelations, thus integrating acoustic cues into perceptual models of voice perception.",

Using data collected from adolescents aged 11-18 years (n = 202), we estimated two networks - one focusing on depression severity and the other on individual core symptoms of depression (low mood and anhedonia) - and investigated the features of the networks, including the associations relating to depression, changes to network structure across adolescence and the centrality of different risk factors. Emotion regulation difficulties and perceived stress were among the most central in the network and showed some of the strongest associations with both depression severity and presence of individual core symptoms. The network structure was largely stable across adolescence but the quality of school environment and depression severity did become more strongly related with increasing age. Our findings underscore the importance of the school environment as well as emotion regulation and stress management skills in adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Learning about others’ personality traits is crucial for building personal relationships. This learning process can be conceptualized as reductions in prediction errors (PE), i.e., the differences between expectations about other persons and their subsequent feedback. Pupil dilation has been established as an important marker of various non-social learning processes. However, it remains unclear if pupil dilation also relates to PEs in abstract social learning processes. To test this, we conducted a pilot experiment and a pre-registered main experiment where participants were instructed to learn about the traits of other people (i.e., learning profiles) or about a self-profile, a profile that reflected the participant’s own trait ratings. We hypothesized that pupil size reflects PEs during social learning. We applied linear mixed-effects (LME) models to the behavioral data to test whether absolute PEs decreased over time. In the main experiment, we observed a significant reduction in absolute PEs, indicating successful learning. We then used LME models for the pupillometry data to test the relationship between absolute PEs and pupil dilation. In both experiments, larger absolute PEs were associated with larger pupil dilation on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect remained robust after controlling for confounding variables such as signed PEs and feedback. As expected, learning about the self-profile yielded smaller absolute PEs compared to other-profiles, and this was accompanied by reduced pupil dilation. Taken together, these findings suggest that pupil dilation scales with error magnitude and represents a critical physiological index of personality trait learning about others.",

          "abstract": "We have recently found that people remember bigger images more than smaller images during naturalistic-like encoding. Since these findings were established with accuracy levels which may be confounded by response biases, and since memory performance was apparently low, here we addressed these issues. In a new set of experiments (n=199), we estimated accuracy to test replication of our earlier findings, dprime memory-sensitivity that accounts for potential response biases (criterion), and RT-based ROC measures. Our findings, consistent across experiments, that overall memory as estimated by dprime and ROC-based analyses was significantly above chance, indicate that information was encoded and learnt. Furthermore, larger images (in the 3 to15.5 degrees range) were better remembered as evident in dprime and accuracy. Memory for 1.5 degrees images did not differ from that of 3degrees images and memory for images bigger than 15.5 degrees dropped, likely reflecting limitations of display size. Memorability also increased with image size. Our findings provide converging measures supporting the idea that image size plays an important role in image memory during naturalistic encoding for images in the size range of 3 to 15.5 degrees. Our study also emphasizes the importance of testing an effect across multiple measures and methods.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers usually make sense of regression models by interpreting coefficient estimates directly. This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

Two raters coded the goals using an established category system (κ = .74). Learning approach and task approach goals were mentioned most frequently, but learning avoidance and task avoidance goals also occurred. Each of the four mastery goals was pursued because of “wanting to” (as a meaningful end-state in itself, including authentic interests and intrinsic enjoyment) and/or “needing to” (e.g., as a requirement or precondition for accomplishment and external pressures and obligations) reasons. Findings provide ecological support for the existence of (mastery) goal complexes, and suggest “wanting to” and “needing to” as a psychologically meaningful distinction.",

          "abstract": "Value-based decision-making is regulated by a delicate interplay of instrumental and Pavlovian controllers. Here we assessed the role of catecholamines in this interplay. We investigated the effects of the catecholamine reuptake inhibitor methylphenidate (MPH) in 100 healthy subjects using a combined appetitive and aversive Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm including approach and withdrawal actions. By administering the drug after learning, our design allowed us to establish that MPH can also bias action outside a learning context by directly modulating the expression of motivational bias on instrumental action rather than by only modulating instrumental learning bias. In line with previous results, the effect of MPH on bias varied across individuals as a function of their working memory span capacity. By assessing both approach and withdrawal actions, we revealed that MPH enhanced not only the invigorating effect of appetitive Pavlovian cues on active approach, but also the inhibitory effect of appetitive cues on active withdrawal, the invigorating effect of aversive cues on active withdrawal, and the inhibitory effect of aversive cues on active approach. Thus, in participants with high working memory capacity, MPH boosted both approach and withdrawal PIT. Taken together, this pattern of effects is most consistent with the hypothesis that MPH modulates the cognitive control of Pavlovian biasing in a baseline-state-dependent manner, in line with the well-established inverted-U shaped relationship between catecholamine receptor stimulation in prefrontal cortex, and cognitive control.",

          "abstract": "Ample findings suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) collaborate in solving cognitive conflict. The ACC is assumed to register and signal ongoing conflicts and errors. In contrast, the DLPFC is thought to implement (the signalled need for) cognitive control. Yet, the precise temporal and thus functional interactions between the two regions remain poorly understood. Here, we probed the role of ACC-to-DLPFC interactions in error processing through concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) while participants (n=38) performed a complex, error-prone task. Specifically, we applied online triple-pulse TMS over the right DLPFC (versus an active TMS control) in a 200 ms window after a behavioural response, targeting the period of error-related ACC activation. Our aim was to interfere with DLPFC at the time of error processing and/ or signal transmission from the ACC and assess the impact on related neural (i.e., the error-related negativity; Ne/ERN) and behavioural measures, such as post-error slowing (PES) and post-error accuracy (PEA). Additionally, we assessed EEG-predictors (i.e., CNV) of behavioural adjustments in the inter-trial interval (ITI). While no main effects of DLPFC-TMS were found on individual measures, we observed significant changes in the relationships between neural (Ne/ERN, ITI) and behavioural (PES, PEA) markers depending on the TMS condition.\nThese findings indicate that DLPFC stimulation influenced the strategy of behavioural adaptation rather than its magnitude, highlighting the DLPFC’s role in implementing cognitive control. Our results further point to the pre-stimulus time as a key window for translating neural error signals into adaptive behaviour. Our study underlines the usefulness of combining time-sensitive neuroimaging and stimulation methods to unravel the functional interplay between neuronal and behavioural markers of adaptive cognition.",

However, this approach is exceptionally costly due to the limited number of experts, the time and resources required for training them, and the high task burden. To overcome these barriers and expedite creativity research, computational automation of creativity assessment has been explored. We provide an overview of recent developments in computational creativity assessment methods, including techniques based on artificial intelligence (such as large language models) and semantic distance. Leveraging these modern machine-learning approaches, computational creativity assessment methods have enabled automatic scoring across various tasks—from simple idea generation to complex problem-solving and artistic expressions—often matching human rater agreement. These methods also have the potential to automatically generate new creativity tests (“automated item generation”) and can be used to detect invalid responses (i.e., random/task-irrelevant ideas), thereby ensuring assessment integrity for high-stakes applications. We discuss the current challenges and potential future directions, such as improving the interpretability and explainability of automated scoring, and a complementary approach centered around evaluating mental processes leading to creativity.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to profoundly reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Using large-scale survey data (N = 37,097; 38 European countries), we find that the public predominantly views AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for a large set of technology-related, political, and socio-demographic factors, we further find that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Drawing on nationally representative, preregistered experimental data (N = 400; United States), we provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democratic institutions and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may erode democratic legitimacy and discourage public involvement in shaping the future of AI.",

          "abstract": "Alterations in reward processing were proposed as a contributing factor to social and communication symptoms in autism. However, the nature of these alterations remains unclear, and it is debated whether reduced sensitivity to reward is a general phenomenon, specific to social contexts, or exists at all. Evidence for reduced sensitivity to reward primarily comes from neurobiological studies, yet it remains uncertain how these findings translate to autistic behavior. A key challenge in addressing this question lies in assessing and comparing behavioral responses to reward between autistic and non-autistic groups. Here, we addressed this issue by investigating the integration of monetary reward information into behavior through the framework of Bayesian perceptual decision-making, enabling a quantitative evaluation of the direct contribution of reward to decision-making. Autistic (n = 32) and non-autistic (n = 48) participants performed an orientation categorization task, while the monetary reward given per correct answer varied across categories. Using signal-detection theory, we estimated decision boundaries while accounting for sensory uncertainty and prior expectation. Our results reveal that autistic individuals adjust their decision boundaries in response to monetary reward in a suboptimal but typical manner. These findings challenge the hypothesis of generalized alteration of reward processing in autism.",

In three experiments, autistic and non-autistic participants (N = 145) performed orientation categorisation tasks while simultaneously reporting their choice confidence. By independently manipulating each Bayesian component—sensory uncertainty, prior, and reward—and fitting a recently established process model, we assessed metacognitive abilities and their contingency on the Bayesian components while controlling for first-order decisions. Unlike non-autistic participants, autistic participants’ meta-uncertainty depended on which decision component was manipulated, and was lower than that of non-autistic participants specifically when decisions were adjusted for sensory uncertainty. These findings reveal that metacognition in autism is not generally reduced but rather enhanced for inferences that rely primarily on sensory information.",

Through a novel hierarchical goal selection paradigm, we investigate human persistence patterns in goal and subgoal pursuit, especially in the presence of varying subgoal prospects. We observe that humans exhibit a depth-first commitment to hierarchical goals, preferring to persist on a goal--subgoal pair until termination rather than the breadth-first approach of alternating between subgoals within a goal. We also show that this depth-first persistence in goals and subgoals is modulated by goal and subgoal progress, respectively. We further demonstrate that a momentum-based account that parsimoniously estimates the values of ongoing goals explains depth-first patterns of persistence in hierarchically organized goals. We explicitly dissociate the effects of momentum computations from switching costs on goal persistence, and show that momentum computations drive persistence choices above and beyond dynamic costs imposed by switching goals and subgoals.",

          "abstract": "As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) rapidly becomes more sophisticated and more widespread, understanding the impact of its perceived humanness on trust is increasingly important. Previous work has shown that anthropomorphism increases the perceived trustworthiness of an agent as an advisor, but here we asked whether it might also impact the trustworthiness of informational communications it produces in a non-advisory role. In two experiments, participants read a science communication blog post attributed to a GenAI with varying levels of anthropomorphic cues. They were asked to report the trustworthiness of both the agent and the content it produced. In Experiment 1 (N = 270), anthropomorphic cues in a description of the author directly increased author trust but not content trust. However, anthropomorphism appears positively correlated with both author and content trust due to the positive correlation between author and content trust. Experiment 2 (N = 144) replicated these findings using a more immersive design: participants chatted with a GenAI chatbot presented as the author of the blog. Partial correlations revealed that the effect of anthropomorphism on author trust explains much of the correlation between anthropomorphism and content trust in Experiment 1 but less so in Experiment 2. These effects reveal a dissociation between the perceived trustworthiness of the author and the content, suggesting that anthropomorphic cues may directly impact the former, but not the latter. Additionally, the salience of the GenAI author may impact the cognitive mechanisms involved in these trustworthiness judgments.",

We selected six teacher behaviors that best predicted student engagement in two subjects, physical education (PE) and mathematics, among Grade 7 students. We tested a 12-hour mostly-online teacher professional learning intervention in a prospectively registered, single-blinded, cluster-randomised controlled trial. From 30 participating schools, 1,969 students could be matched to one of the 129 teachers who provided consent (71 PE and 58 mathematics teachers). Employing a multiverse analytical approach, we found the intervention significantly increased psychological need satisfaction in most analyses. We found no robust effects on student engagement or other self-reported variables (attitudes toward PE, student use of approach or avoidance goals, or the perceived value of mathematics). Effects on achievement were mixed. We observed positive effects on PE achievement, with increased self-reported physical activity corresponding to an extra 0.43 days of activity per week. There were no significant effects on mathematics achievement. While we did not significantly increase engagement itself, this light-touch professional learning intervention was able to increase proximal predictors of motivation and engagement.",

          "abstract": "Past research on cross-cultural equivalence has focused on statistical procedures and techniques for ensuring measurement equivalence in tests and surveys. With the rise of big data and machine learning(ML), particularly natural language processing (NLP), researchers have powerful tools to study culture using large-scale, organic language data from social media. However, the lack of methodological guidance on how to establish cross-language equivalence in cross-cultural studies, especially with multilingual or culturally diverse text data, poses a major challenge. To address this gap, this paper proposes a framework to raise awareness of key equivalence challenges and offer practical guidance for reducing measurement biases when applying ML techniques to social media language data. The framework outlines five types of equivalence following the ML pipeline from data collection to evaluation: source equivalence, sample equivalence, input equivalence, psychological ground truth equivalence, and model performance equivalence. We also draw parallels with survey-based research to highlight shared conceptual challenges and identify future directions for advancing cross-cultural research with big data and computational linguistic methods.",

A preliminary validation of its effectiveness was conducted using two typical examples of gender-stereotyped occupations: “doctor = male” and “florist = female.” The test was administered to 70 undergraduate students (41 males and 29 females). The results indicated that no clear gender stereotype was detected for “doctor,” whereas a distinct feminine stereotype was observed for “florist.” Although further verification using other occupations is necessary, the findings suggest that the adult version of the gFUMIE test is effective in detecting gender stereotypes. Furthermore, developing a children’s version of the gFUMIE test based on the same principle, it will become possible to measure gender stereotypes in younger children and to provide a new method for studying the development of gender stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Parents are often said to see their grown-up children as kids—but does this reflect a genuine perceptual bias? This study tested whether mothers perceive their adult daughters’ faces as younger than their chronological age and compared these judgments with the daughters’ self-perceptions. Each mother–daughter pair viewed systematically aged or rejuvenated images of the daughter’s face. In a facial-age judgment task, participants indicated whether each image appeared younger or older than the target’s actual appearance. In a morph-identity rating task, they rated how much each image resembled the target’s real face. Both groups exhibited a youth bias, but it was significantly larger among mothers. Moreover, mothers judged younger morphs as more representative of their daughters’ identity, consistent with enduring parental representations anchored in memories of earlier developmental stages. These results suggest that facial age perception can be shaped by the observer’s relational history and motivational dynamics—parents may, quite literally, see their children through the lens of the past.",

          "abstract": "In Japan, physical education (PE) is often perceived as less intellectual than other school subjects. To address this bias, we developed a paper-based implicit measure to evaluate the intellectual image of PE. The test adapts the FUMIE test (Mori et al., 2008), a paper-and-pencil version of the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., 1998), suitable for group use in schools. In Study 1, 52 university students rated 100 two-kanji Japanese words as “intellectual,” “non-intellectual,” or “neutral.” Based on high agreement, we selected 20 intellectual and 10 non-intellectual words to construct the iFUMIE test. In Study 2, we evaluated its reliability and validity using the target words “understanding” and “ignorance,” with 51 students. Results confirmed the test’s usability in measuring implicit intellectual associations. The iFUMIE offers a foundation for future research assessing the effects of instructional efforts designed to enhance the perceived intellectual value of PE.",

          "abstract": "The effect of parent-adolescent conflict on emotional well-being has been well-documented. However, daily processes related to conflict and positive and negative affect have been overlooked. We tested the mutual effects between parent-adolescent conflict and affect in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries between 14 to 21 days to rate their positive and negative affect, and conflict interactions between October 2021 and August 2023. The participants were mostly from families with high socioeconomic status, most of the parents were biological mothers, and over half of the parents were Caucasian. Adolescents were between 13 and 17 years (M = 14.37, SD = 1.28). We tested the daily associations between negative/positive affect and conflict interactions in one dynamic structural equation model (DSEM). Contrary to our expectations, greater adolescent negative affect on a day was associated with lower parent-reported conflict next day. Further, both within- and between-family level correlations between adolescent and parent negative and positive affect were significant. Greater parent and adolescent conflict was related to lower positive and greater negative affect for parents and adolescents. Thus, while both same-day and mean-level associations over time indicate that conflicts are linked to poorer affective well-being, and parents may have made efforts to improve their affect the following day in an attempt to compensate for the conflicts experienced the day before. Further, this effort was appeared to be driven by the adolescents’ rather than the parents’ emotional experiences.",

          "abstract": "Despite being nearly universal, boredom has only recently emerged as a serious topic within human factors psychology, especially in the context of human-in-the-loop (HiL) systems. Once dismissed as trivial, boredom is now recognized as a dynamic emotion marked by disengagement, with real consequences for human performance while monitoring systems in air travel; nuclear power; and healthcare. This study explores the onset of boredom by examining undergraduate participants engaged in boredom inducing natural activities. Participants reported their boredom and typically sought relief through smartphones, mirroring everyday coping behaviors. Results showed a wide variation in boredom onset times, with some participants reporting boredom within 1 minute and others within 17 minutes. Participants’ own metacognitive estimates of boredom proved more reliable than standard boredom measures. Neither trait nor state self-report scales consistently predicted how quickly someone would become bored in real-world situations. This challenges the validity of traditional boredom assessments and highlights the complexity of individual boredom profiles. The findings underline that as automation reduces workload and vigilance demands in critical HiL fields, understanding and measuring boredom becomes increasingly important for preventing error and designing safer systems. Metacognitive assessment may be a pragmatic tool for identifying boredom-prone individuals in applied settings, pending development of more robust objective measures.",

          "abstract": "Background: When confronted with ambiguous stimuli, the ability to utilize contextual information is crucial for survival. Context processing involves the ability to discriminate new information from previously encountered information, and to recognize something as previously encountered even briefly or partially. Deficits in context processing are a key feature across a number of psychiatric conditions. Existing tasks only examine discrimination and recognition of cues as opposed to contextual information. Thus, new tasks using complex scenes are urgently needed. \n\nObjective: We developed the Context Discrimination and Recognition Task (CDRT) and established baseline performance in healthy adults. \n\nMethod: 48 participants (mean age (M) = 30.27, standard deviation (SD) = 11.78) completed the CDRT to characterize memory performance for 1) discrimination between previously viewed and never viewed complex scenes (Discrete Discrimination Scores; DDS); 2) recognition of previously viewed complex scenes (Discrete Recognition Scores; DRS); 3) sensitivity to distinctions across a gradient of complex scenes (Width); and 4) bias in recognition of complex scenes (Bias). Pearson correlations were conducted to examine associations between these scores.\n\nResults: Results revealed a significant positive relationship between DDS and DRS scores, r(41) = 0.93, p &lt; 0.01, and between DDS and modified recognition scores (DRSmid), r(41) = 0.71, p &lt; 0.01. Width was also positively associated with DRS, r(41)= -0.32, p = 0.03, and DRSmid, r(41)= -0.32, p = 0.03.\n\nConclusion: We found that the CDRT is sensitive to a range of discrimination and recognition levels and is uniquely positioned to probe context processing. Additionally, both recognition and discrimination scores increased with decreased ambiguity of complex scenes, demonstrating sensitivity of the task in detecting variability of performance across participants. Better recognition of complex scenes was associated with greater sensitivity to differences between contexts. This novel task can be used to assess memory-associated processes for complex scenes in future studies aiming to elucidate neural function underlying context processing in psychiatric conditions.",

          "authors": "Achiel Fenneman; Claus Lamm",
          "abstract": "Memory retrieval is guided by two complementary learning systems: an episodic memory system storing individual experiences, and a semantic knowledge system representing ‘things which go together’. While much is known about these structures in isolation, their interplay has been comparatively less studied. In this work we propose a spotlight-cascade model, which characterizes the interplay between these systems through two walks: a cascading walk in episodic space and an autocorrelated walk in semantic space. We combine these two walks in a spotlight-cascade model. This model is then validated through an online experiment in which participants travel to a fictive island and interact with 16 fantasy animals, dubbed Fennimals. Some of these Fennimals are encountered in the same region of the island (creating episodic groups), whilst some Fennimals share semantically similar heads and names (creating semantic groups). Participants are then asked to recall the names of these Fennimals. The experiment consisted of two between-subjects conditions. In the semantic spotlight condition, the semantic and episodic groups overlapped. In line with a predicted semantic spotlight effect, participants sequentially retrieved Fennimals along the imposed semantic structure. In the episodic jump condition, we then mixed these two groups, such that Fennimals in the same episodic group contained features from distinct semantic groups. In line with theoretical predictions based on our spotlight-cascade model, participants were now less likely to follow the semantic grouping structure when sequentially retrieving names – instead following a mixture of both semantic and episodic ties. These findings highlight that our novel model bridges both complementary learning systems and sheds a new light on previous models of memory retrieval. In addition, our findings suggest promising new directions of research into various topics in cognitive science.",

          "abstract": "Music evokes strong emotions across listeners although it conveys no biologically relevant information regarding the survival challenges in the environment. Here we review the neurobiology and psychology of emotional communication through music, focussing on the functions and mechanisms of musical emotional expressions in social interaction and extend our analysis of the communicative space beyond the pure acoustic features to the interaction of musical emotional cues with other verbal and nonverbal communication channels. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies shows functional overlap for brain systems involved in music production and emotions. Musical emotion communication however differs from other common expressive channels (faces and bodies, utterances, and semantics) in its timescale, context, spontaneity and interactivity. Because musical emotional communication can be modulated by affective information communicated through other verbal and nonverbal channels, musical communication provides a flexible means for context-dependent and culturally malleable communication of emotions, which is particularly well suited for large-scale social affiliation and bonding.",

          "abstract": "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been linked to altered coupling between respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and regional BOLD signal within medial visceromotor/interoceptive networks. SSRI treatment strengthens this coupling without changing mean RSA (Shafer et al., 2015). Whether noninvasive neuromodulation of anterior medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can modulate this brain–heart linkage is unknown. Objective: Test whether repeated transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) targeting anterior mPFC enhances RSA–BOLD coupling in MDD and whether coupling relates to symptom change. Methods: Fourteen adults with MDD completed up to 11 tFUS sessions over ~3 weeks. Resting-state fMRI with simultaneous photoplethysmography (PPG) was acquired PRE and POST. A first-level RSA regressor (non-Hilbert; no HRF convolution) estimated per-TR RSA–BOLD covariation. Ten a-priori CAN/MVN ROIs (sgACC, rACC, dACC, vmPFC, rmPFC, left insula, left amygdala, left putamen, PAG, hypothalamus) were tested. Primary endpoint: across-ROI composite change in positive RSA–BOLD coupling (POST–PRE). Secondary ROI-wise and whole-brain parametric and non-parametric tests were performed; sensitivity analyses used an HRF-convolved Hilbert HRV regressor. Associations with HRSD, MADRS, BDI, PTQ, and VAS were explored. Results: The composite increased numerically but not significantly (Δ=+0.19 SD; 95% CI [−0.28, 0.66]; t(13)=0.88, p=.40; d=0.24); 9/14 participants showed higher POST values. No ROI-wise or whole-brain POST&gt;PRE effects survived FWE correction. Baseline small-volume–corrected effects replicated canonical coupling (left anterior insula positive; sgACC negative) but did not change with treatment. Mean RSA, RMSSD, and Hilbert HRV amplitude showed no significant session effects. Symptom-coupling correlations were uniformly non-significant after correction. Conclusions: In this uncontrolled pilot, anterior mPFC tFUS did not reliably increase RSA-BOLD coupling at the group level, despite replication of baseline neurovisceral patterns. Any tFUS-related modulation appears small and variable at this sample size. Larger, controlled studies with individualized targeting and parameter optimization are warranted.",

Building on prior pharmacological work, this study tested whether RMSSD, pNN50, SDNN, as well as exploratory Toichi nonlinear metrics index vagal activity during respiratory and pharmacological manipulation. Six healthy adults completed eleven 1-minute breathing trials (4–9 bpm) following double-blind administration of saline, esmolol (β-adrenergic blockade), or glycopyrrolate (muscarinic blockade). Parasympathetic blockade significantly suppressed all HRV metrics and increased heart rate, whereas sympathetic blockade had no effect. Breathing rate, drug condition, and their interaction were non-significant, indicating that drug effects on HRV were consistent across respiratory conditions. These findings support the interpretation of time-domain HRV indices as predominantly parasympathetic markers, rather than sympathetic, across paced breathing in controlled laboratory settings.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between personality, behaviour, and welfare in captive capuchin monkeys (Sapajus apella) at Bioparque Buinzoo (Chile). The main goals were to assess welfare, examine association between personality traits and abnormal behaviour, and evaluate the effects of habitat enrichment on activity levels, social interactions, and abnormal behaviours. We assessed personality using an adapted Eysenck’s PEN questionnaire, whereas welfare was evaluated through the Animal Welfare Assessment Grid (AWAG), complemented with behavioural observations. The results revealed strong connections between personality traits, behaviour, and welfare. Self-directed behaviours were significantly associated with the Introversion-Extraversion personality axis, while affiliative behaviours correlated with higher welfare scores. Contrary to expectations, Anxiety-related traits were negatively correlated with abnormal behaviour, suggesting a more complex relationship than anticipated. Individuals with lower welfare scores were less active, supporting the notion that poor welfare impacts both physical and psychological well-being. Habitat enrichment interventions produced mixed results: while inactivity decreased significantly, there were no notable changes in abnormal or affiliative behaviours. These findings indicate that while enrichment can improve activity, its design may require greater personalisation to address social and behavioural challenges effectively. This study highlights the importance of considering individual differences when planning welfare strategies. Incorporating personality assessments into environmental enrichment planning would provide a more tailored approach, better addressing the specific needs of each animal. By focusing on individual traits, welfare can be improved and foster healthy social interactions. This study also emphasizes the value of nonhuman primates as models for understanding personality and behaviour, contributing to both welfare management and species-specific biological insights.",

          "abstract": "Reading anxiety is the fear of reading and is theorized to be negatively associated with reading achievement. An inability to engage in reading due to either low reading achievement or high reading anxiety could be debilitating. Research on reading anxiety and its association with reading achievement has existed since the 1980s. However, this has been an area of rapidly increasing investigation in recent years. The goal of the present preregistered meta-analysis was to determine the strength of the association between reading anxiety and reading achievement. Through systematic screening of the published and unpublished literature, 64 studies were identified and included in the meta-analysis (totaling 180 effect sizes and 14,467 participants). The included studies were conducted in 14 countries and 11 languages. Analyses were performed using random effects models, accounting for dependent effect sizes via robust variance estimation. A moderate negative average weighted correlation was found between reading anxiety and reading achievement (r = -0.30). Significant heterogeneity across effect sizes was found (Q = 996, p &lt; .001, I2 = 82). Learning disability status, gender, reading domain, and age were not significant moderators. The association between reading anxiety and reading achievement has implications for the fields of psychology and education, specifically in efforts to promote people’s reading achievement while maintaining their socioemotional well-being. Future research using experimental and longitudinal designs is needed to determine the direction of any causal influences between reading anxiety and reading achievement. This would improve suggestions that can be made on how to support people struggling with their reading anxiety and reading achievement.",

We modeled consensus—the extent to which perceivers (viewers) rated targets (characters) similarly—and assumed similarity—the extent to which perceivers saw targets as they saw themselves. In both studies, subreddit fans provided self- and character ratings using three-item measures for each of nine traits: the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. Cross-classified structural equation models showed significant consensus for all traits across both studies (mean rs=.54 to .60). Assumed-similarity slopes were significant for open-mindedness, narcissism, sadism, and the Dark Tetrad composite in Yellowjackets, but only for open-mindedness in Succession (controlling for viewer sex and age). Thus, viewers projected their own open-mindedness onto characters in both series, whereas Yellowjackets viewers also projected Dark Tetrad traits—mainly narcissism and sadism. Finally, k-means clustering of character-trait means provided a novel visualization of character groupings and their underlying trait dimensions. Because perceived similarity to fictional characters helps shape parasocial bonds, understanding personality perception in this process advances both social and media psychological theory.",

          "abstract": "Learning about others’ personality traits is crucial for building personal relationships. This learning process can be conceptualized as reductions in prediction errors (PE), i.e., the differences between expectations about other persons and their subsequent feedback. Pupil dilation has been established as an important marker of various non-social learning processes. However, it remains unclear if pupil dilation also relates to PEs in abstract social learning processes. To test this, we conducted a pilot experiment and a pre-registered main experiment where participants were instructed to learn about the traits of other people (i.e., learning profiles) or about a self-profile, a profile that reflected the participant’s own trait ratings. We hypothesized that pupil size reflects PEs during social learning. We applied linear mixed-effects (LME) models to the behavioral data to test whether absolute PEs decreased over time. In the main experiment, we observed a significant reduction in absolute PEs, indicating successful learning. We then used LME models for the pupillometry data to test the relationship between absolute PEs and pupil dilation. In both experiments, larger absolute PEs were associated with larger pupil dilation on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect remained robust after controlling for confounding variables such as signed PEs and feedback. As expected, learning about the self-profile yielded smaller absolute PEs compared to other-profiles, and this was accompanied by reduced pupil dilation. Taken together, these findings suggest that pupil dilation scales with error magnitude and represents a critical physiological index of personality trait learning about others.",

          "abstract": "Democracies worldwide have suffered from democratic backsliding and a rise in popularity of authoritarian politics. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of (support for) authoritarianism requires developing and validating scales to measure it. However, many authoritarianism scales perform irregularly outside of Western contexts, over time, and across groups. We conducted four studies, with samples from a total of 17 countries (total N = 31,767), to assess commonly used scales’ (three versions of Right-Wing Authoritarianism; Left-Wing Authoritarianism; Group Authoritarianism; Child Rearing; and Political Intolerance) latent item clustering, measure overlap, and invariance across cultures and over time. Specifically, we ask which measures remain invariant across different social groups, which items from different scales cluster together, and whether multiple scales for authoritarianism measure shared latent constructs. We find no evidence of cross-scalar item clustering or latent variable convergence. Moreover, items within scales clustered predominantly based on positive or negative wording. Breaking this trend were six items from the 32-item Right-Wing Authoritarianism scale, which addressed ideological and expressive freedoms. The six-item Political Intolerance scale by Dunwoody &amp; Funke (2016) was the most invariant of the scales assessed. These findings suggest that (disapproval of) belief diversity may be a core psychological aspect of authoritarianism, which should be considered in theory and scale development.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we generalize the multidimensional discrimination (MDISC) and difficulty (MID) parameters in the Multidimensional 2-Parameter Logistic model to account for non-identity latent covariances and negatively-keyed items. We apply Reckase’s maximum discrimination point method to define them in an arbitrary algebraic basis. Then, we define that basis to be a geometrical representation of the measured construct. This results in three different versions of the parameters: The original one, based on the item parameters solely, one that incorporates the covariance structure of the latent space, and one that uses the correlation structure instead. Importantly, we find that the items should be properly represented in a test space, distinct from the latent space. We also provide a procedure for the geometrical representation of the items in the test space, and apply our results to examples from the literature to get a more accurate representation of the measurement properties of the items. We recommend using the covariance structure version for describing the properties of the parameters, and the correlation structure version for graphical representation. Finally, we discuss the implications of this generalization for other multidimensional IRT models and the parallels of our results in common factor model theory.",

          "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy and antibiotic overuse are major global health threats, yet they are typically treated as separate problems, stemming from different sets of causes. In this study, we challenge this 'different causes–different problems' assumption by testing two contrasting models of how vaccines and antibiotic behaviors might be related psychologically.\n\nIn one view, they could reflect a common stable attitude. People who distrust biomedical treatments or have a preference for natural immunity might avoid both vaccines and antibiotics. If so, a vaccine hesitant individual would be unlikely to overuse antibiotics.\n\nAn alternative view, grounded in cognitive neuroscience, posits a single state-dependent mechanism that prioritizes action when ill but inaction when healthy. This yields the prediction that the same people who avoid vaccines would also overuse antibiotics.\n\nAcross four countries (USA, UK, France and Argentina; N=1,307), our survey results support the second, state-dependent pattern: Across diverse healthcare contexts, individuals more hesitant about vaccines were also more likely to overuse antibiotics.\n\nThis asymmetry—bias towards action in one case and inaction in the other—calls for a rethinking of public health strategies to address vaccination and antibiotic use together, rather than in isolation, and in a way that is sensitive to target audiences' health states.",

          "abstract": "The integration of insect-derived ingredients into Western diets offers a sustainable protein alternative but it faces cultural resistance and a spontaneous aversion. Assessing automatic reactions to foods containing imperceptible insect components remains challenging. In this research, we developed and psychometrically evaluated two indirect measures—the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) and the Manikin Task—to capture automatic evaluative and approach-avoidance responses toward insect-based foods. Across two studies (N = 246), these tasks demonstrated acceptable to good reliability and provided complementary insights. While correlations between indirect and explicit measures were generally low, some associations aligned with theoretical expectations. These findings suggest that BIAT and the Manikin Task effectively assess automatic reactions to insect-derived foods, offering valuable tools for consumer acceptance research and informing strategies to promote sustainable diets. Both measures are feasible for online administration and enhance understanding of implicit food-related attitudes beyond traditional questionnaires.",

However, individual differences in response to exposure indicate that many patients do not fully benefit from therapy. Examining individual changes over time in threat expectancy likelihood, a theorized working mechanism of exposure as proposed by the Inhibitory Retrieval Theory, may help optimize individual treatment success. This study aimed to examine the dynamics of learning during one exposure exercise for fear of public speaking and the retention of learning in daily life. Participants with elevated fear of public speaking (70 women, M age = 23.10) completed an exposure exercise designed to violate an idiosyncratic threat expectancy. They gave two, three, or four presentations to at least halve threat expectancy likelihood. Ecological momentary assessments were used to measure threat expectancy likelihood eight times a day for four days before and four days after the exposure exercise. Results showed individual differences in how fast threat expectancy likelihood decreased during the exposure exercise. Furthermore, there were individual differences in how much this translated to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood in daily life and how long participants retained the decrease. Additionally, after the exposure exercise, we found a decrease in threat expectancy severity, anticipatory anxiety, avoidance tendency, and an increase in willingness to give a presentation in daily life. Future research could examine whether individual differences in the dynamics of learning and retention in daily life following an exposure exercise are clinically relevant as predictor of overall treatment success.",

          "abstract": "Creativity assessment has historically relied on human raters to judge the quality of ideas and products. However, this approach is exceptionally costly due to the limited number of experts, the time and resources required for training them, and the high task burden. To overcome these barriers and expedite creativity research, computational automation of creativity assessment has been explored. We provide an overview of recent developments in computational creativity assessment methods, including techniques based on artificial intelligence (such as large language models) and semantic distance. Leveraging these modern machine-learning approaches, computational creativity assessment methods have enabled automatic scoring across various tasks—from simple idea generation to complex problem-solving and artistic expressions—often matching human rater agreement. These methods also have the potential to automatically generate new creativity tests (“automated item generation”) and can be used to detect invalid responses (i.e., random/task-irrelevant ideas), thereby ensuring assessment integrity for high-stakes applications. We discuss the current challenges and potential future directions, such as improving the interpretability and explainability of automated scoring, and a complementary approach centered around evaluating mental processes leading to creativity.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to novelty can enhance memory performance through behavioural tagging, whereby novel experiences strengthen temporally proximate memories. Whilst consistently demonstrated in rodents, human studies have yielded mixed results, possibly due to inadequate novelty manipulations and/or insufficient hippocampal engagement during encoding. Here, we investigated whether exploration of a novel, unpredictable, immersive virtual reality retroactively enhanced spatial memory in humans. Thirty-six participants completed a two-day experiment involving spatial object-location learning in custom mazes, with encoding strength manipulated through repetition, to create initially weak and strong encoding conditions. Following encoding, participants explored either familiar (predictable city) or novel (multi-site outer-space with unpredictable teleportations) virtual environments. Memory was assessed through spatial accuracy metrics and cued recall. We found a retroactive memory enhancement following novel environment exploration, specifically when novelty occurred on Day 2. This enhancement was evident across spatial memory measures and cued recall, but did not interact with encoding strength. Our results demonstrate that retroactive behavioural tagging effects can be elicited in humans using spatial memory tasks paired with immersive novelty experiences, provided participants have appropriate reference points for novelty evaluation. These findings highlight the importance of investigating behavioural tagging using manipulations that emulate those studied in rodents.",

          "abstract": "Although exposure-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is generally effective for anxiety disorders, many people do not benefit. A better understanding of treatment predictors is required. This study investigated whether the dynamics of threat expectancy likelihood, which is one of the theorized working mechanisms of exposure, after an exposure exercise would predict subsequent intervention outcome. The short exposure exercise was designed to decrease the likelihood of one idiosyncratic threat expectancy. It was hypothesized that individuals with public speaking anxiety who hold on longer to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood after the exposure exercise (slower speed of return to equilibrium), show greater benefit from subsequent exposure intervention (i.e., less public speaking anxiety). Participants with subclinical public speaking anxiety (N = 60, M age = 25.42) completed an exposure exercise and momentary assessments in daily life (eight times per day) three days before and four days after the exposure exercise. One week later, they did an online one-session exposure intervention to decrease public speaking anxiety. Result showed that threat expectancy likelihood decreased after the exposure exercise and public speaking anxiety decreased after the intervention. Against expectations, speed of return to expectancy likelihood equilibrium did not predict intervention effects. Potential explanations of null results are discussed, like sampling frequency to measure speed of return to equilibrium and timing of the exposure exercise. Given the potential of dynamic predictors for exposure therapy outcome, more research is needed to examine the conditions in which speed of return to equilibrium predicts subsequent treatment outcome in anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic social interactions and feedback are crucial for understanding others’ emotions, particularly when confronted with contradictory emotional cues. Alexithymia, a condition that co-occurs with many psychiatric disorders, is characterized by impairment in emotional processing. However, computational mechanisms by which it alters social inferences based on feedback cues remain unexplored. To examine this, 60 participants with low and high levels of alexithymia completed an emotional learning task involving contradictory social (verbal and visual) cues to infer targets’ emotions. Computational analyses, including bin-based, reinforcement learning, and drift-diffusion modeling, revealed how alexithymia alters latent parameters that govern value updating and choice. Individuals with high alexithymia demonstrated lower accuracy in learning from social feedback. Drift diffusion analysis revealed a perceptual bias toward the visual cue, higher drift rates in the visual-correct condition, and greater evidence accumulation to infer others' emotions. These findings suggest that individuals with high alexithymia exhibit impaired social learning and difficulty with decision-making in situations with conflicting social information, with computational modeling quantifying the latent processes involved and advancing mechanistic targets for computational psychiatry.",

This study investigates patterns of emotional expression in mothers and adolescents using video filmed with head cameras during a novel interaction task. \nMethods: Participants were 26 mother-adolescent dyads (13 boys and 13 girls) from the Wirral Child Health and Development Study. Mothers and adolescents played a card game answering questions about each other whilst wearing head-cameras. Card responses were coded as correct and incorrect. The intensity of mother and adolescent emotional expressions was analysed by AI software FaceReader and collapsed into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Linear regressions tested the following preregistered hypotheses: (H1) mother and adolescent emotional expressions are positively associated; (H2) mothers display more positive emotions than their adolescents; (H3) mothers express more positive and neutral emotions when their adolescents are negative, whereas adolescents react more negatively to their mothers’ negativity; (H4) both mothers and adolescents display more positive emotions during agreements than during disagreements; and (H5) mothers express greater emotional variability during disagreements than during agreements.\nResults: Mothers demonstrated higher emotional variability during periods in which adolescents expressed a higher intensity of negative emotions, supporting H1 and H3, and expressed higher intensity of positive emotions compared to adolescents, supporting H2. There was no evidence to support H4 and H5.\nConclusions: Mothers express greater positive emotional intensity than their adolescents and a wider range of emotional expressions in response to their adolescents’ negative emotions.

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that unexpected sounds can inhibit eye-movements, which may occur due to global suppression of motor actions. If this is the case, then eye-movements should be inhibited across a range of tasks, and the degree of inhibition should be relatively independent from the bottom-up perceptual processes associated with each task. In the present study, we tested whether unexpected novel sounds inhibit eye-movements in two complex and ecologically valid tasks: passage reading and dynamic scene viewing. Participants read short passages from textbooks for comprehension and watched short videos of urban environments for memory recall while their eye-movements were being recorded. On every 5th fixation, a sound was played: this was either a repeated “standard” sine wave tone with a probability of .8 or a “novel” environmental sound with a probability of .2. Unexpected novel sounds led to longer fixation durations compared to the standard sound in both tasks, but the effect was slightly weaker in the dynamic scene viewing task. Follow-up analyses suggested that smooth pursuit eye-movements did not fully explain the attenuation of the effect in the scene viewing task. These results suggest that saccadic inhibition by unexpected sounds can occur in different active vision tasks, but the effect may not be entirely independent of the task dynamics.",

Childhood (up to Mage=16.14, SDage=3.48) stimulant treatment trajectories were detected using K-means clustering based on age at initiation, stop age, total and maximum daily dose, and duration and variability of stimulant use in 324 children. The trajectories were compared across seven domains of adult outcomes (controlling for multiple testing) including psychiatric status, behavioral and emotional functioning, academic and professional functioning, adaptive functioning, neurocognitive functioning, physical health, and healthcare service use. Results. In 143 adults with childhood ADHD (Mage=28.34, SDage=3.74, 65% males) three stimulant treatment trajectory groups were detected: early-and-intense (n=46), late-and-moderate (n=63), and stimulant-naïve (n=34). The three groups did not differ on most adult outcomes, but group differences were observed for the adaptive, neurocognitive and physical functioning domains on the measures risk perception, cognitive flexibility, and sleep quality. The early-and-intense group had the most favorable mean scores (trend effects) compared to the other groups. Findings did not change after controlling for age and sex. Discussion.

Although previous CIT studies have combined several autonomic indicators such as heart rate and pupil change, it is still unclear whether adding neural measures to pupillometry can capture complementary aspects of recognition and attentional control. To investigate this, we examined whether electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry jointly provide reliable markers of concealed information in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm, which constrains strategic processing and emphasizes rapid recognition. Participants viewed streams of faces containing a critical probe—either a personally familiar (parent’s) face or an unfamiliar face—while performing a sex-based target detection task. EEG and pupil size were recorded concurrently, focusing on four measures: ERP amplitude at Pz, theta-band (4–8 Hz) power, absolute pupil size, and pupil size change. At the group level, all measures differentiated probes from controls, reflecting attentional orienting and recognition. At the individual level, detection varied across modalities. To integrate evidence, we applied Fisher’s method to combine p-values across measures. Although overall detection did not substantially improve, combined inference compensated for limitations of single measures.",

It was revealed that certain characteristics of the test influence the acuity. However, some studies show contradicting results, and interactions between factors were also revealed. In this study, we investigated how the effect of starting position, movement type (active or passive), speed, magnitude, and time spent at the target position influences error magnitude and direction. We implied a full factorial 2 (starting position: 30 or 150°) * 2 (movement type: active or passive) * 3 (movement amplitude:30, 60 or 90°) * 2 speed (12 or 24°/sec) * 2 (time spent at target: 2 or 4 sec) within subject design, measuring the left elbow joint, and analyzed the data of 135 university students, using generalized linear mixed models. In the first model, where the outcome variable was absolute error, we found a significant main effect of movement type, speed, and amplitude, and significant interactions of amplitude*speed, amplitude*starting position and amplitude*speed*error direction. Higher movement amplitudes and speeds, and passive motion, lead to higher error scores. The deteriorating effect of amplitude was magnified by speed; the staring position*amplitude interaction shows the possible effect of target position. In the second model, where the outcome variable was error direction, we found a significant starting position main effect, and significant starting position*speed and starting position*amplitude interactions. Participants tended to make errors towards the starting position, higher speed and amplitudes increased this tendency. The results have important consequences regarding the standardisation of the JPR. Namely, to ensure comparability, we recommend standardising for the type (active or passive), amplitude and speed of movement and target position.",

Adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosed in childhood show higher healthcare utilization, but their medication use remains understudied while this can clarify the long-term health burden of childhood ADHD. Methods. In this 18-year prospective cohort study, pharmacy dispensing records of ADHD, other psychotropic, and somatic medication of the last year were compared between adults with childhood ADHD (n=125, Mage=29, 68% males), their siblings (n=109, Mage=28, 35% males) and controls (n=101, Mage=30, 42% males) without childhood ADHD at study entry. Group differences in demographics and psychiatric status were included as covariates (sensitivity analyses). Results. The childhood ADHD group was more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication, more different ADHD medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and neurological medications (specifically analgesics) compared to their siblings and controls (OR range=3.25-8.35, β range=0.61-0.65). Compared to controls, the childhood ADHD group was also more likely to be prescribed other psychotropic medication (OR=3.82) and used more different types of psychotropic medication (β=0.38).

After controlling for psychiatric status differences (ADHD, major depressive disorder), the childhood ADHD group still differed on ADHD medication use, more different ADHD medications, and NSAIDs, and from controls on more different psychotropic medications. Conclusions. Adults with childhood ADHD, but not their siblings, show elevated long-term medication use. The elevated medication use is not merely explained by shared familial factors but is partly attributable to current psychiatric status.",

Participants also self-reported their hearing function using the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale 12 (SSQ-12) and completed an online digits-in-noise (DiN) task to assess speech perception ability, which were used as outcome variables. A sample of 227 adults aged 45-65 (Mean age = 53.77, SD = 5.87) were recruited through Prolific (www.prolific.com) based on Office for National Statistics (ONS) income groups. Results: Two multiple regression models were conducted with the outcome variables of speech perception ability (Digits-in-Noise: DiN) and self-reported hearing function (Speech and Spatial Qualities of Hearing Scale: SSQ-12). The analysis revealed that having a routine and manual occupation predicted worse self-reported hearing function, as did being a regular tobacco consumer.  No significant predictors were significant for speech perception ability . \n\nConclusions: The findings suggest that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, as measured in this study,  are significantly associated with self-reported hearing function in mid-life, but not with speech in noise perception ability. These results partially align with previous research that has identified smoking and occupation factors as predictors of hearing sensitivity when measured using pure tone audiometry. These data highlight the need for greater understanding as to how lifestyle and socioeconomic factors relate to different dimensions of hearing health.",

          "abstract": "It is argued in this Commentary that Green, Beaty, Kenett &amp; Kaufman's (2024) proposal for completely separate or \"Orthogonal\" definitions of creative processes and creative products is problematic regarding products. On conceptual grounds, drawing on philosophical analyses, it is argued that for a product to be classed as creative it must be produced in the right sort of way, i.e., by a creative process. It is suggested that Green et al.'s process definition could be used in a non-orthogonal definition of creative products as a necessary process underlying creative products. It is also noted that the proposal for non-orthogonal definitions of creative products, where product creativity is process-dependent, make the creative process definition primary in defining creativity. The arguments here also support the use of process measures in empirical studies to back up judgments regarding the creative nature of any putative creative products.",

          "abstract": "It is well documented that individuals who possess a Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM) can voluntarily retrieve an increased frequency of personal memories, that are also markedly more detailed, compared to non-HSAM individuals. In contrast, no study has explored potential differences relating to involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) retrieval. Here, a single HSAM case (DT) and matched controls completed a 1-day naturalistic IAM diary study to investigate frequency and characteristics of IAMs. HSAM individuals, even if they can remember almost every day of their life, are not constantly flooded by their past. Therefore, we hypothesised that occurrence of IAMs would be as in controls. At the same time, their exceptional ability to remember personally-relevant events could be reflected in the features of the memories relived. In line with our predictions, frequentist and Bayesian analyses support that DT has a normal prevalence of spontaneous memory pop-ups, but his IAMs were more vivid and self-relevant than controls. Such results support that, for individuals with exceptional memory, IAMs, like voluntary memories, are of an extremely high quality. Finally, we argue that our results provide evidence in support of cue overload mechanisms limiting unintentional (but possibly also intentional) retrieval in HSAM.",

          "abstract": "Mafia-type Criminal Organizations (MCOs) often foster indifference and passivity toward their crimes in the population, a phenomenon known as code of silence (omertà, in Italian). Despite MCOs' detrimental effects on economies and citizens, evidence-based protocols targeting the promotion of anti-mafia motives are still lacking. To fill this gap, we assessed whether embodying heroic figures through Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) would enhance opposition to MCOs, reducing omertà. Specifically, 71 Italian young adults were split into three groups, in which they respectively embodied: a notorious Italian anti-mafia hero (i.e., Giovanni Falcone; Experimental Group, N = 24), a heroic figure unrelated to the anti-mafia movement (i.e., a firefighter; Heroic Control Group, N = 22) or a common person (Control Group, N = 25). After familiarizing themselves with the virtual body and completing a motor task, participants delivered a speech in front of an audience of virtual agents. Results showed that the embodiment procedure did not affect anti-mafia attitudes, and that, unlike the control group, participants embodying heroic characters tended to maintain the same level of decisional conflict about their anti-mafia intentions. In addition, in a subsequent Interpersonal Distance Task (IPD), only participants in the Experimental and Heroic Control groups displayed greater physiological discomfort (stronger heart rate deceleration or skin conductance response) when facing virtual agents associated with MCOs and crime, compared to innocent agents. We suggest that the embodiment of heroic figures induced discomfort because of the duties and dangers associated with their role, preventing the improvement of anti-mafia attitudes and intentions.",

Results showed that the MPS detected meditation-induced changes, with items clustering into positive, negative, and distortion-related experiences. The MPS demonstrated stable psychometric properties and sensitivity to specific meditation practices, offering a novel, non-verbal tool for studying meditation states, self-related processes, and altered states of consciousness.",

          "authors": "Margaret L Westwater; Fei Shang; Michael Browning",
          "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by abnormal food intake, including energy restriction despite starvation or episodic binge-eating, which may reflect alterations in the reward value of food. Affected individuals show impaired learning from non-food rewards (e.g., money), yet the generalisability of such perturbations across the spectrum of disordered eating and to disorder-salient stimuli remains poorly understood. Therefore, we examined associations between ED symptoms and decision-making during reinforcement learning with food and non-food reward in a population-based sample. We recruited four hundred adults (n=250 female, M(SD)=29.5(6.6) years) to an online study, during which they performed two runs of a probabilistic instrumental learning task with either food or monetary reward. On each trial, participants chose between two cues with the aim of maximising the amount of money or food earned throughout the task, where cues were probabilistically associated with either wins, losses or neutral outcomes. A reinforcement learning model was fit to trial-wise choices to generate parameter estimates of learning rate and inverse choice temperature. Increased ED symptomatology was related to poorer task accuracy on loss relative to win trials across both reward types. Computational modelling revealed that greater ED symptom scores were associated with decreased inverse choice temperature for loss versus win trials. Our findings identify a link between ED symptomatology and impaired reinforcement learning from punishment that appears to generalise across food and monetary reinforcers. This may explain, in part, the challenges with modifying behaviour in patients who are struggling with EDs despite serious negative health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Social gaze is a fundamental social cue that regulates approach and avoidance in social interactions. Everyday social interactions are characterized by repeated eye gaze exchanges. However, it remains unknown whether and how individuals learn from experiencing direct or averted eye gaze in others. Here, we used reinforcement learning modeling to investigate how micro-level gaze behaviors contribute to dynamic changes in social preferences and social closeness. Participants repeatedly chose between two faces that predominantly (70%) responded with either direct or averted gaze when selected, and rated their perceived closeness towards these individuals. Results showed a significant increase in choice frequency and closeness ratings for the direct gaze partner compared to the averted gaze partner. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms, computational modeling revealed that the direction of others’ eye gaze elicits a learning signal (prediction error) that in turn changes the latent value of the interaction partner. The learning signal was calibrated by individual differences in perceiving direct gaze as rewarding. Initial attractiveness and valence of the interaction partner predicted this reward calibration, suggesting that pre-existing impressions shape how social feedback is valued. In turn, calibration was reflected in participants’ social evaluations of the direct gaze partner, indicating how learning experiences contributed to impression formation. Together, these findings demonstrate that even minimal gaze interactions can shape social preference and closeness through reinforcement learning mechanisms. They further suggest that eye contact is a powerful, yet individually calibrated, social signal with implications for understanding and improving social engagement in both everyday and clinical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Human emotional crying remains an enigmatic phenomenon despite its universality across the lifespan. This manuscript introduces the Control-Arousal Signal Model (CAS), an integrative framework that unifies physiological, cognitive, and social perspectives on crying. The model posits that emotional crying emerges when a sudden increase in arousal coincides with a perceived loss of control, leading to an emotional response and the expression of emotional crying including behaviors such as tears and vocalizations. The CAS conceptualizes crying as a five-phase temporal process—from stimulus appraisal to post-crying regulation—and highlights interpersonal signaling of loss of control as its primary function, with intrapersonal regulation as a secondary, context-dependent outcome. By systematically reviewing major theories and empirical findings, the manuscript demonstrates how the CAS reconciles contradictory evidence, accommodates both negative and positive crying, and accounts for developmental, situational, and cultural moderators. The model generates testable hypotheses regarding the triggers, functions, and outcomes of crying, providing a coherent basis for future research. Its implications extend to developmental psychology, clinical practice, emotion regulation, and cross-cultural studies, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding crying as a central feature of human emotional expression.",

Patients were tested either on (N=34) or off (N=34) dopaminergic medication (levodopa), with age-matched polyneuropathy patients serving as controls (N=35). Behaviorally, patients off medication showed marked learning and decision-making deficits, characterized by overexploration and insufficient exploitation. To clarify the mechanisms underlying these impairments, we applied a computational model that combines similarity-based generalization with both random and uncertainty-directed exploration. The modeling results showed that impairments in patients off medication resulted from reduced generalization and increased uncertainty-directed exploration, but not greater random exploration. In contrast, exploration and generalization in patients on medication were comparable to the control group. Our  findings highlight how dopamine depletion in PD impacts reward learning under uncertainty, suggesting a key role of dopamine in exploration and generalization.",

          "abstract": "While sleep benefits memory consolidation in young adults, it remains unclear whether this advantage persists over aging. Using an associative inference task (AB/BC paradigm), we compared the effects of post-learning sleep versus equivalent wakefulness on associative (AB, BC) and inferential (AC) memory in older and young adults. Our study showed that sleep (vs. wake) enhanced associative memory retention in both age groups, while for inferential memory, a significant sleep benefit was observed in young adults, with a similar but non-significant trend in older adults. Critically, a direct comparison revealed that the magnitude of the sleep benefit for both memory types did not statistically differ between older and young adults. Refined analyses revealed that among older participants, sleep preferentially benefited poor performers in consolidating both associative and inferential memory. Furthermore, associative memory retention was positively correlated with subjective sleep quality in young adults, whereas inferential memory performance was linked to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior score in older adults. Together, our results suggest that sleep’s role in memory consolidation remains largely intact in healthy aging, highlighting its potential contribution to support cognitive health in later life.",

          "authors": "Alex Steiner",
          "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progressively paralyzes speech and motor functions, rendering patients speechless when voluntary movement is lost. Although invasive brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) such as electrocorticography (ECoG) have achieved high accuracy in speech-related neural activity decoding, clinical use is limited by surgery costs and risks. This study presents a new, fully non-invasive EEG-based inner-speech translation system aimed at communication restoration in ALS. This paper introduces a novel machine learning architecture based on a fusion of region-aware convolutional attention encoders and a transformer decoder, presenting a generative sequence-to-sequence model for open-vocabulary EEG-to-text translation. Preprocessed and downsampled EEG data from the Chisco imagined-speech dataset were used, and 48 optimized electrode channels were selected based on contribution-based ranking. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT) was employed to train the model to preserve linguistic fluency while being specialized for EEG input. Evaluation achieved BLEU-1 = 0.512 $\\pm$ 0.012 and ROUGE-L F1 = 0.396 $\\pm$ 0.009, surpassing earlier non-invasive baselines. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of cross-regional fusion and diversity regularization in maintaining cortical interpretability during the encoding process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-vocabulary, non-invasive EEG-to-text system capable of reconstructing continuous inner speech with high linguistic coherence and accuracy. These findings are a key step toward clinical neural speech restoration for ALS, facilitating the development of future real-time, low-cost assistive communication devices.",

These motive inferences were linked to greater political sectarianism and lower willingness to have a conversation about politics with the outrage expressor. In a fourth study (N = 720), we developed an intervention that changed people’s motive inferences, which improved willingness to have a conversation about politics. These findings highlight the role of motive inferences in shaping contemporary online political discourse filled with strong emotions, and suggest key levers to foster civil interactions among cross-partisans.",

Unlike Maslow's rigid pyramid, our Dynamic Attention Based Model (DABM) proposes that human needs function as competing signals for cognitive attention, with their urgency determined by both evolutionary priority and subjective intensity. We introduce nine fundamental need categories that operate simultaneously rather than sequentially, each associated with distinct neurobiological pathways. The model makes a critical ontological distinction between needs (abstract psychological states), actions (behavioral responses), and objects (satisfiers), resolving longstanding conceptual ambiguities in motivation theory. We present the Integrated Needs Hierarchy (INH) assessment tool, propose three empirical validation studies, and address theoretical and practical implications. This framework offers a more dynamic, culturally sensitive, and neurobiologically grounded understanding of human motivation than existing theories.",

Adults living in Australia (N = 548; Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.38) completed measures of attachment and behavioural emotion regulation (Time 1), and positive solitude (Time 2, one week later). Structural equation modelling tested effects of anxious and avoidant attachment on positive solitude via five behavioural emotion regulation strategies: seeking distraction, seeking social support, actively approaching, ignoring, and withdrawal. The final model accounted for 24.8% of the variance in positive solitude. Avoidant and anxious attachment predicted different patterns of emotion regulation while all emotion regulation strategies significantly predicted positive solitude. Avoidant attachment indirectly predicted lower positive solitude while anxious attachment directly and indirectly predicted lower positive solitude. Findings suggest that both attachment orientation and emotion regulation shape the capacity to experience solitude positively. These results highlight the importance of considering attachment and emotion regulation in designing personalised interventions to promote adaptive and positive experiences of aloneness.",

          "abstract": "Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM), the inability to recall specific events and instead recall general memories, is a well-known feature of psychopathology. Although OGM has been regarded as a deficit in generative retrieval, recent studies highlight the role of direct and involuntary (associative) retrieval in OGM. We propose the accessibility model, which discards the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory and truncated search hypothesis. The accessibility model assumes that memory representations of different specificities are structured in parallel, and compete to be retrieved. The model contends that direct and generative retrieval are serial processes (i.e., direct retrieval initially, followed by generative retrieval), and specific and general memory accessibility each affect OGM. We argue that increased accessibility of negative general memories and decreased accessibility of positive specific memories underlie OGM in depression. These changes in accessibility are differentially associated with hippocampal abnormalities, memory suppression, self-referential processing, and positivity biases, suggesting different mechanisms depending on emotional valence. Furthermore, we propose that metacognitive monitoring and control are required to initiate generative retrieval when retrieved memories are goal inconsistent. The accessibility model integrates existing basic memory and OGM research, which may lead to improved memory therapeutics, and new avenues for research development.",

Studies suggest that caregiver language during these book-sharing interactions is linguistically richer than speech directed to young children (target-child-directed speech; tCDS) during other everyday activities. However, few studies have directly compared the linguistic richness of speech in book sharing and other activities within the same families. In this study, tCDS was sampled from day-long naturalistic recordings to investigate the linguistic richness of speech directed to 24-month-old children from English- and Spanish-speaking families in the U.S. We compared four sources of speech: book text, read-aloud speech during book-sharing interactions, spontaneous speech during book-sharing interactions, and spontaneous speech during other everyday activities. We first used a mega-transcript approach combining across families (Dawson et al., 2021; Montag et al., 2015) and compared the four sources of language on type-token ratio curves. We next conducted a more fine-grained analysis to look within families, comparing the four sources of speech in terms of lexical (lexical diversity, lexical density, lexical frequency, and contextual diversity) and grammatical (mean length of utterance in words and the proportion of complex utterances) measures associated with linguistic richness. Across both approaches and in both language groups, speech based on text was lexically and grammatically richer than both sources of spontaneous speech. These results indicate that the power of the proposed linguistic richness of speech during book-sharing interactions stems from features of the text on the page.",

          "authors": "Merethe Blandhol; Seoyoung Lee; Dan-Mikael Ellingsen",
          "abstract": "Living with pain that persists over months or years can take a significant toll and requires the use of different strategies to manage the pain in everyday life. Yet how individuals cope with chronic pain and why some people show better functional outcomes is not clearly understood. Previous literature on coping has often focused on describing different coping strategies and their comparative effectiveness, often with the assumption that some are overall less adaptive than others. Existing theoretical models of coping often lack descriptions of how factors unfold over time and often assume relationships between factors remain stable. However, pain coping is not only influenced by continuously changing internal and external contextual factors, but by changing interactions as the process repeats over time. Moreover, the short- and long-term efficacy of different coping approaches depends on individual appraisal of the momentary coping process. In this review, we first systematically synthesise previously published theoretical frameworks that have conceptualised the coping process in health- related stress and pain. Then, we present the ‘Dynamic Interaction Model of Coping in Chronic Pain’ outlining how five central factors: 1) controllability, 2) predictability, 3) pain salience, 4) personal resources, and 5) motivation, interact in a dynamic coping process in chronic pain. The model outlines putative pathways of moment-to-moment and long-term adaptations to pain, and potential targets for intervention are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Culture evolves; i.e., exhibits cumulative, adaptive, open-ended change. The theory of biological evolution through natural selection integrated the life sciences under one explanatory umbrella. Many suggest that this theory can also explain cultural evolution, integrating the social sciences under one explanatory umbrella as well. Darwin’s theory solved the problem of how change persists in lineages despite that acquired traits aren’t transmitted. Culture doesn’t suffer from this problem; once one teapot had a handle, all teapots could have handles. Culture also lacks the algorithmic structure necessary for natural selection to be applicable. We have two systems of transmission, but only one system of inheritance. (If your parents’ bone repair genes never turn on, you still inherit them, and your bones heal. But if they don’t teach you to ski, you can’t ski. That’s because ski knowledge is acquired, not inherited.) Natural selection explains cumulative, adaptive change through differential reproduction of randomly generated heritable variations. Cultural evolution violates the necessary conditions for natural selection to be a viable theory: random variation, discrete units that compete and are copied with high fidelity, and vertical transmission of inherited traits (not horizontal transmission of acquired traits). To claim Darwin thought natural selection is mere ‘variation + selection’ undercuts his accomplishment; he recognized the significance of distinguishing between inherited and acquired traits. Darwinian models of culture portray similarity due to horizontal transfer as similarity due to common ancestry. Cultural Darwinists soldier on by ignoring cultural change that occurs during the generation, expression, and reception of ideas. But to maintain a Darwinian perspective on culture we must view humans as passive imitators and transmitters of pre-packaged cultural units, ignoring the spark of creativity and intelligence that define our humanness. It’s time to figure out what kind of evolutionary framework can accommodate the network-like patterns observed in culture.",

          "authors": "Steven C. Pan; Faith Amanda Siauw",
          "abstract": "To what extent does pretesting—the learning technique of guessing to-be-learned content before studying the correct answers—enhance factual knowledge, and does its effectiveness depend on which part of a fact is pretested? We investigated memory for different parts of facts when pretesting involved either the subject (e.g., “_____ is the goddess of agriculture”) or a key term from the predicative (e.g., “Demeter is the goddess of _____”), compared to studying intact facts. Experiments 1a–4 revealed asymmetrical learning patterns: Pretesting on the subject enhanced memory for the predicative key term, but not consistently for the subject itself, whereas pretesting on the predicative key term, at best, enhanced memory for that key term but not for the subject. When word frequency among subject and predicative terms were closely matched in Experiments 5–7, however, pretesting yielded highly symmetrical learning—enhancing memory for both terms regardless of which one was pretested. That enhancement occurred despite differences in associative strength and semantic structure, whereas syntactic and other structural influences, including extra cue words, were ruled out. Together, these findings reveal that pretesting can improve memory for both tested and untested fact terms, with lexical properties exerting strong influences on the scope and magnitude of improvement. The effects of pretesting on facts therefore depend on how easily learners can access and encode fact elements, and accordingly, which terms to pretest should be considered carefully when using pretesting for fact learning.",

          "authors": "Yuhan Zhang; Erxiao Wang; Cory Shain",
          "abstract": "Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case — the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have — comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.",

It analyzes clinical symptom overlap, the central role of genetic testing in HD, and structured psychiatric and biomarker approaches for BD. Drawing on recent research, the paper proposes a dual-path diagnostic model: a neurogenetic pathway for HD and a structured psychiatric and biomarker pathway for BD. This framework aims to enhance early differentiation, reduce misdiagnosis, and support precision-based interventions. Emerging gene therapy research further underscores the importance of accurate early diagnosis, both for clinical care and for the successful application of disease-modifying treatments. Together, these strategies advocate for a future in which HD and BD are recognized as biologically distinct conditions with tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

          "abstract": "Scientific progress relies on the independence between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. When that boundary collapses, as in recursive hypothesis building, evidence becomes self-referential: the same dataset is reused to propose and “confirm” the same idea. This article examines recursive hypothesis building and its link to redundant publication through a detailed case analysis in educational research (2010–2017). Drawing on the ethical frameworks of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and the American Psychological Association (APA), the article shows how undisclosed data reuse converts exploratory findings into apparent replication, creating an illusion of empirical consensus. By tracing how identical datasets generated multiple publications under different analytic labels, the paper demonstrates that recursive hypothesis building represents not simply redundant publication but a logical failure that undermines verification itself. The analysis concludes that transparency—not output volume—should define research integrity. Mandatory data-reuse disclosures, open-data practices, and ethics education are proposed reforms to prevent recursion that turns scientific verification into repetition.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: In the field of human psychology, the study of personality traits was a major research endeavour extending over several decades. Considering personality as stable, underlying dimensions that influence behaviour, a similar construct can be assumed in large language models (LLMs). However, most research in the field of machine personality relies on unverified assumptions or is afflicted by methodological weaknesses. The present work is the first to present a psycho-lexical analysis of machine personality.\nMethods: The psycho-lexical approach together with an exploratory factor analysis was adopted. Interview-like interactions were conducted with various LLMs (N = 400), and their behaviour was evaluated using a set of adjectives commonly used to describe personality traits. The ratings were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis to extract LLM-specific personality factors.\nResults: Five stable factors were extracted and interpreted. The five factors were termed Antagonism, Spirit, Conscientiousness, Negative Introversion, and Simple-Mindedness.\nConclusion: The present work addresses the lack of systematic and fundamental approaches to the study of personality in LLMs. It is the first to present an LLM-specific factor structure of personality, suggesting that humans and LLMs exhibit different personality traits.",

          "abstract": "For more than four decades, research on restorative environments has been guided by two influential theoretical frameworks: Attention Restoration Theory (ART) and Stress Reduction Theory (SRT). While these theories have been instrumental in shaping the field, they have also faced criticism. Although it might appear that the limitations of both theories could be resolved through adjustments and further research, we adopt a meta-theoretical perspective to assess ART and SRT against general standards of theory construction. We argue that neither framework meets core standards for predictive utility or explanatory power. We focus on two issues. On the one hand, critical constructs assumed to predict restorative nature experiences are often vague, circular (e.g., “soft fascination”) or underdetermined in terms of their level of specificity. On the other hand, both theories exhibit explanatory fragility: ART’s resource-based account of restoration does not clarify how depletion and replenishment actually occur, whereas SRT’s evolutionary explanation posits what appears to be an unnecessary and unfalsifiable adaptive mechanism. We conclude by challenging the assumption that the psychologically beneficial effects of nature are in some way “special” and instead advocate for greater epistemic restraint in building nature-specific theories around beneficial nature effects.",

          "abstract": "Aging-related declines in spatial navigation pose significant challenges for older adults' independence and quality of life. Among navigational deficits, older adults have been shown to demonstrate deficits in utilizing allocentric (i.e., world-centered) information and rely on egocentric (i.e., body-centered) cues during navigation, resulting in reference frame bias. We investigated naturalistic navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation in younger adults (N = 30) and older adults (N = 30) using a city-like virtual reality wayfinding task (NavCity) across multiple within-session exposures, paired with a NavCity Allocentric Representation Assessment (NARA). Older adults demonstrated significantly lower navigation performance compared to younger adults including traveling greater distances, taking longer navigation times, moving at slower speeds, and exhibiting longer dwell times while navigating. Despite aging-related differences, both age groups showed similar rates of performance improvement across exposure blocks. Following repeated NavCity exposures, older adults demonstrated lower allocentric knowledge formation, but both age groups demonstrated significant associations with navigation performance. Notably, substantial heterogeneity was observed within the older adult group, with a bimodal distribution in NARA scores that split older adults into higher- and lower-performing subgroups, which corresponded to differences in navigation performance independent of chronological age. Higher-performing older adults exhibited navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation comparable to younger adults, while lower-performing older adults showed persistent deficits in both navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation despite repeated exposures. These findings suggest  that aging-related navigation decline is not uniform and highlight the possibility of combined virtual navigation and allocentric assessment tasks as potential sensitive, early indicators of aging-related declines in spatial navigation ability.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive maps support inference and planning by representing associations between experiences encoded in memory. These map-like representations are thought to carry information not only about directly observed links but also about longer paths. The ability to make judgments based on multi-step associations varies with one’s experience in an environment and with changes in memory abilities across the lifespan. However, it remains unclear exactly how representations of associative structure are influenced by learning curricula and memory constraints. Prior studies have suggested a tradeoff: memory representations can either be more integrated to improve inference, or more separated to recall distinct direct associations. Whether overlapping associations are experienced nearby in time (interleaved) or spaced apart (blocked) can bias memory representations toward integration or separation. However, key recent findings about how blocked versus interleaved experience bias integration or separation have been inconsistent. Here, we introduce a computational framework that helps reconcile these apparent discrepancies. Using neural network simulations of three separate memory-guided inference tasks, we show that variations in memory capacity and the sparsity of neural codes interact with learning sequence to shape network representations. Specifically, blocked learning promotes integration when memory capacity is low, while interleaved learning promotes integration when memory capacity is high. Integration is especially likely to result from representations formed when neural codes are both sparse and distributed. These results offer a principled computational account of how flexible, map-like representations can arise from experience and suggest avenues for individualized memory interventions to improve inference, generalization, and planning.",

          "authors": "Faidra Faitaki; Kate Nation; Victoria Murphy",
          "abstract": "Crosslinguistic influence (CLI) is a well-studied topic in the field of second language (L2) acquisition. CLI depends on the degree of structural overlap between the two languages: partial overlap might lead to negative influence, while complete overlap might lead to positive influence (facilitation). Facilitation has received comparatively little attention, particularly in the context of sequential bilingual children who pick up their second language after their first language has developed. The present study aimed to address this gap by exploring the use of infinitival ‘to’ (i.e., 'to' in 'I want to go') in Greek-English sequential bilingual children. 140 5-year-old participants (34 Greek monolingual, 36 English monolingual and 70 Greek-English bilingual, of whom 35 attended a total immersion programme and 35 attended a partial immersion programme in Greece) completed an oral language production task in English and/or Greek.  Children in total immersion performed on par with their English monolingual counterparts, suggesting a degree of facilitation from the L1 to the L2, but children in partial immersion were less accurate in their production of the structure in English. These findings are attributed to linguistic dominance, which emerged as a significant predictor of children’s accuracy in the task, highlighting that the educational programme children attend, and therefore their exposure to the L2, matters more than overall linguistic proficiency when it comes to the acquisition of infinitival ‘to’.",

Fifty-two Greek-English sequential bilingual children aged between 3;7-6;4, of whom 21 attended a partial immersion programme (where half the tuition is in the L2) and 31 attended a total immersion programme (where all the tuition is in the L2) completed an elicited imitation and an elicited production task that assessed their use of sentential subject pronouns and subordinate clause markers. The children’s lexical and grammatical proficiency was also measured. A binomial generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) revealed a strong interaction between task and group: children in total immersion achieved higher scores in the production task, while children in partial immersion achieved higher scores in the repetition task. These findings suggest that different elicitation tasks might give rise to different results; this highlights the importance of task choice in research studies aiming to capture bilingual children’s linguistic abilities.",

          "abstract": "Mindfulness practice is often described as yielding a “quieter mind,” yet the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying this experience remain understudied. This research investigates how focused attention (FA) meditation influences automatic semantic processing through a series of conflict-based tasks (e.g., Stroop). In a between-groups design, participants were randomly assigned to either brief FA meditation or mind-wandering control conditions. Results demonstrated that, compared to the control group, FA meditation significantly reduced the Stroop congruency facilitation effect in the classic color-word task. Crucially, this reduction in facilitation was not observed in two additional non-semantic control tasks (administered solely to FA participants). This selective pattern suggests that FA meditation temporarily inhibits automatic semantic processing rather than enhancing reactive control or general selective attention. Notably, these effects emerged in meditation novices following a brief (10-minute) guided FA session, indicating that even short-term meditation can modulate automatic cognitive processes. These findings provide empirical support for the role of mindfulness in reducing automatic thought processes and contribute to our understanding of its underlying cognitive mechanisms, offering insights into how brief meditation interventions might help individuals better manage intrusive thoughts and automatic cognitive processes in daily life.",

In this study, we compared how autistic and non-autistic students evaluated such content and the extent to which the content affected their self-esteem.\nMethods: The final sample included 172 undergraduate students (n non-autistic=  86, n autistic = 86) recruited using Prolific. Participants read a brief vignette about an autistic child taken from a popular psychology textbook. They rated how useful they found the vignette for understanding autism, how useful the average college student would find it, and how offensive and stigmatizing it was. Participants also provided self-esteem ratings before and after reading the vignette and completed three individual difference measures (strength of autistic identity, autism knowledge, ableism critical consciousness).\nResults: Compared to non-autistic participants, autistic participants rated the vignette as less useful and as more offensive and more stigmatizing. Individual differences influenced these effects in two ways: First, the stronger the autistic participants’ autism identity, the more offensive and stigmatizing they found the vignette to be. Second, participants with greater autism knowledge rated the vignette as less useful. Although average self-esteem ratings did not change after reading the vignette for either neurotype, 39.5% of the autistic sample reported feeling worse about themselves after reading the vignette than before. \nConclusion: This study provides insight into how autistic and non-autistic college students react to autism-related academic content, highlighting the roles of identity strength and autism knowledge in shaping these reactions. The findings underscore the need for more inclusive and representative depictions of autism in academic content by revealing significant differences in how autistic and non-autistic students evaluate the same material.",

          "authors": "Abriana M Gresham; Apoorva Sarmal",
          "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive phenomenon in the United States that leads to a number of negative downstream consequences for individuals. Yet, the dominant response to IPV remains rooted in a carceral criminal justice system. We argue that a carceral response to IPV reproduces and upholds racialized, gendered, and ableist systems of oppression that exacerbate inequalities and perpetuate violence. Drawing on existing research, we demonstrate how the criminalization of IPV and a criminal-justice-centered response to IPV harms already marginalized communities and sustains continued IPV. Further, we discuss how this approach to IPV constrains scientific inquiry by reinforcing carceral logic in research through narrow measures, definitions, and sampling practices. Finally, present recommendations that might advance an anti-carceral approach to IPV that centers relational contexts, community-based responses, and material support for victims. By repositioning IPV as a social and relational phenomenon rather than a criminal one, we support a more equitable and effective approach toward IPV prevention and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Background: Reasoning biases play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of delusions. In psychosis, it is unclear whether these biases cluster onto similar underlying factors or represent independent constructs. Here, we capture both task-based reasoning biases and self-reported cognitive biases, as well as cognition and affect to understand mechanisms underlying metrics of clinical delusional severity and broader unusual thought content.\nMethods: Participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD; N=75) were enrolled following hospitalization for an acute psychotic episode. Non-clinical comparison participants (NCC; N=70) were recruited for comparison of affect, cognition, and reasoning biases. Exploratory factor analysis and multivariable linear regressions were performed in the SSD group only. Core clinical delusions and broader unusual thought content, alongside preoccupation, conviction, and distress were used as outcome measures.\nResults: SSD participants had more severe reasoning biases, cognitive deficits, and negative affect than NCC. In SSD, factor analysis revealed four latent constructs representing belief updating, cognitive biases, affective disturbances, and general cognitive ability. Affective disturbances were significantly associated with delusional preoccupation and distress. Belief updating was the only factor associated with conviction. Cognitive biases related only to the number of unusual beliefs endorsed, but no other aspects of severity. General cognitive ability was unrelated to all facets of delusional severity.\nConclusion: Affective disturbances and belief updating map onto distinct aspects of clinical delusions in SSD: distress/preoccupation and conviction, respectively. Delusion severity is broadly unrelated to cognitive impairment. Reducing delusional conviction may require treatments focused on how new evidence is integrated into existing beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Interleaved practice—systematically mixing different categories—tends to enhance mathematical learning. However, research on its long-term effects of delays beyond 30 days, and the potential benefit of providing additional instructional support to encourage comparison and abstraction processes during interleaved practice, is still emerging. Therefore, this study investigated two promising approaches: starting with blocked practice before transitioning to interleaved practice (blocked-to-interleaved practice, B2I) and self-explanation prompts. 238 third graders participated in an experimental classroom study on three subtraction strategies (stepwise, compensation, and indirect addition). After instruction on strategy execution and application conditions, students completed a practice phase targeting both execution and strategy-problem associations. The study followed a 3 x 2 between-subjects design (blocked vs. B2I vs. interleaved x self-explanation vs. additional practice). Data were collected before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at 8- and 16-week follow-ups. Both interleaved conditions outperformed blocked practice in terms of flexibility, adaptivity, and conditional strategy knowledge (CSK), with effects lasting up to 16 weeks. Although no direct benefit on accuracy emerged at any measurement point, serial mediation analyses indicated that interleaving improved accuracy indirectly via CSK and adaptivity. Neither initial blocking nor self-explanation prompts yielded additional benefits over pure interleaving. Self-explanation quality positively predicted short-term adaptivity, accuracy, and CSK, and remained a predictor of CSK at 8- and 16-week follow-ups. These findings indicate that interleaving promotes lasting adaptive expertise in elementary school mathematics but suggest no benefit from adding a blocked phase or self-explanation prompts under deductive instruction conditions.",

          "abstract": "This systematic review synthesises evidence on athlete leadership development interventions. A search across eight online databases identified 36 studies spanning descriptive, qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods designs. Findings highlight a rapidly growing field in which interventions target not only formal athlete leaders (e.g., team captains) but also informal athlete leaders and athletes without designated leadership roles. Interventions focused on developing a broad range of leadership behaviours, with a strong emphasis on interpersonal skills. Most interventions prioritised leader development, with durations ranging from brief sessions lasting a few hours to multi-year programs. Study authors (including some trained sport psychologists) and coaches were the primary facilitators. Interventions were predominantly delivered in team sports, with most studies based in the United States. The methodological quality of studies examining intervention effectiveness was mixed. While qualitative studies scored well on critical appraisal and participants reported improvements in their leadership as well as in individual and team outcomes, quantitative studies—typically used to establish causality—performed relatively poorly. Consequently, quantitative evidence for intervention effectiveness should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, their findings suggest that the most effective interventions targeted the team’s best athlete leaders (whether formal or informal), focused on leadership rather than leader development, were grounded in the identity leadership framework, and lasted three to five months. Moreover, coach-delivered interventions outperformed those led by study authors, including those with sport psychology training. Overall, our findings provide a foundation for advancing research and practice in athlete leadership development.",

          "abstract": "Young people and university students are particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of climate change due to their prolonged lifetime exposure to, and increased contact with, climate change and related information through learning. Despite this, little research exists on how university students cope with climate change from a psychological perspective. In this large qualitative study, we analysed data from an online survey to investigate how students (N = 823) of a large UK university cope with climate change. This survey covered which climate change situations were triggering for them, preferences for support-seeking, and specific coping strategies. Conceptual content analysis revealed that challenging situations included navigating climate change information, climate justice issues, climatic changes and environmental losses, and climate change dismissal. Findings from qualitative framework analysis further showed four ways students coped with these: by reducing the mental load of climate change, doing something constructive, seeking social support and meaning, and doomist thinking and behaviour. While many students highlighted the importance of social connections, a small minority considered seeking professional support. These findings partly support and expand on climate change-related coping literature and have implications for how higher education settings communicate about and act on climate change.",

It remains contested whether cognitive control processes, such as cognitive reflection and inhibitory control, are linked to a greater tendency to engage in politically motivated reasoning, as proposed by the “motivated reflection” hypothesis, or can help people overcome it, as suggested by cognitive science research. In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then investigated the associations of the two cognitive control variables cognitive reflection and inhibitory control with motivated reasoning. We find that associations between cognitive control processes and motivated reasoning are likely small. On political topics specifically, we find that a negative association with cognitive reflection is more likely than a positive association. This finding is contrary to predictions from the popular motivated reflection hypothesis. Results for inhibitory control are inconclusive. We discuss how these findings relate to interdisciplinary literature from cognitive and political psychology.",

          "abstract": "A well-established finding in Evolutionary Behavioural Sciences is that a low waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is judged as more attractive than a high WHR in women, a preference hypothesised to track female mate value. However, virtually all studies on the topic display nude or minimally clothed bodies, under highly standardised conditions, potentially exaggerating WHR’s influence in real-world contexts. We tested whether WHR-based judgements generalise to fully clothed women and to more ecologically valid conditions by analysing 608 painted female figures from European portraits (1650–1950), embedded in socially rich, minimally sexualised settings. Online Prolific observers (N = 1,525) independently estimated the body shape, attractiveness, age, and likelihood of previous childbirth from either the body or the face of the painted characters. Perceived WHR strongly predicted trait judgements: lower WHR was associated with higher attractiveness, younger perceived age, and lower perceived likelihood of previous childbirth. These relationships persisted after controlling for various variables, including posture, body orientation, perceived weight, and perceived facial age. Our findings show that WHR-based heuristics persist even in visually complex, clothed, and historically diverse depictions of women. They further suggest that fashion styles that exaggerate WHR may have functioned as strategic amplifiers of socially and reproductively relevant cues, with implications for theories of mate choice, social signalling, fashion history and cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Despite recent attempts to dismantle diversity initiatives in the US, many people and organizations continue to advocate for diversity. However, people vary widely in who they mean when they discuss diversity and their beliefs about why and how to promote diversity. These diversity components have only been examined in separate literatures, lacking full integration. Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

          "abstract": "One of the main challenges of social cognition is inferring the competence of others, which often occurs in contexts of limited information. Recent researchs suggest that people can successfully infer the knowledgeability of others from past accuracy, but the computational principles underlying these judgments are unknown. We test whether people can both infer and search for information about others' competence in a near-optimal way, consistent with rational Bayesian reasoning. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were presented with an individual's performance on a trivia question and predicted the individual's ability to answer other trivia questions from the same theme. Replicating and extending past results, we observe that participants very accurately predict performance from limited information. Computational modelling shows that participants' inferences are better described by Bayesian processes than by plausible heuristics, suggesting that participants rationally integrate new information with their prior expectations about others' competence. Study 3 shows that participants can select which information would be most diagnostic for inferring an individual's competence, again in a manner consistent with Bayesian rationality. Overall, our results suggest that people approximate a rational Bayesian model both when searching for and when integrating information about others' competence.",

This paper reports the development and validation of a caregiver-report measure designed to assess curiosity in children aged 2–5 years across three cultural contexts: the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany. Part 1 generated 41 age-appropriate items by adapting and extending the Infant and Toddler Curiosity Questionnaire (ITCQ; Altmann et al., 2025a), first in English, followed by Dutch and German translations. Part 2 examined the factor structure in each country independently (sample sizes: UK = 389; NL = 330; DE = 540), and discarded poorly fitting items and integrated results to produce a single, 25-item questionnaire comprising three subscales: Novelty, Investigative, and Interactive Curiosity. Part 3 evaluated the reliability and validity of this final instrument within each national sample to ensure robust performance across cultural contexts. Psychometric analyses indicated strong internal consistency, coherent relations to other related, validated measures, and evidence of cross-cultural applicability. The resulting measure, a direct continuation of the previously developed infant version, enables systematic assessment of young children’s curiosity as a multidimensional construct observable in everyday life.",

Overcoming a key methodological limitation of past approaches, we used Bayesian censored location scale models as an alternative modeling approach that accounts for biases introduced by bounded rating scales. The results showed that the variability estimates from the models had reliabilities around rel = .64, which can be sufficient for group-level predictions. Additionally, the latent stability of r = .60 provides evidence for stable individual differences in emotional variability, suggesting that it is more than just a transient state. We ran exploratory analyses to further examine the influence of external events and individual life transitions on emotional variability and found that emotional variability was responsive to environmental changes.",

However, it remains unclear which specific aspects of functionally organized frontostriatal loops are affected by ADHD and how these disruptions differ across individuals in light of the disorder’s marked heterogeneity. We investigated frontostriatal connectivity in individualised circuits in 40 adults with ADHD and 36 neurotypical controls using a multimodal dataset that included diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as functional MRI during working memory updating, resting state, and a naturalistic attention task. Compared with neurotypical controls, adults with ADHD exhibited reduced structural connectivity strength and increased mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in tracks originating from medial and orbital prefrontal areas. Functional data revealed weaker connectivity in the ADHD group during verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks in circuits connecting the striatum with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, motor regions, and orbitofrontal cortex, while no group differences were found during resting state or the naturalistic task. Structural and functional aberrancies were only partly overlapping. Comparisons with atlas-based analyses highlighted the precision of individualised connectivity mapping. Together, these findings suggest that (1) frontostriatal functional connectivity aberrancies in ADHD are driven by striatum-dependent cognitive processes such as working memory, (2) functional and structural differences are related to partly different frontostriatal circuits, and (3) precise mapping of frontostriatal pathways can be achieved through individualised connectivity mapping.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction: Intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration among men is a pressing public-health concern globally and in post-transition societies such as Albania. Beyond socio-demographics, fewer studies have jointly examined psychological and developmental predictors. This study assessed prevalence, correlates, and multivariable predictors of men’s IPV perpetration in Albania.\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey of adult men (N = 365; community participants and court-mandated perpetrators) measured IPV with a five-item, severity-weighted Abuse Severity Index (ASI-5: verbal, psychological, threats/property destruction, physical, and sexual). Psychological/developmental variables included attachment orientations (ECR-RS), emotion regulation (DERS-Impulse), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), alcohol use (AUDIT), cognitive flexibility (CFI-Control), and Big Five traits (TIPI). Group differences, correlations, and binary logistic regression analyses were performed.\nResults: Over half reported psychological IPV, while physical assaults (21.9%) and sexual coercion (16.4%) occurred only among IPV perpetrators. Several socio-demographic risks (e.g., lower education/income, unemployment) were associated with IPV, though in multivariable models only age 45+ remained predictive. The strongest psychological predictors were ACEs (OR = 1.26 per unit), avoidant attachment (OR = 1.61), and impulse-control difficulties (OR = 1.10); alcohol use showed a marginal positive association. Protective tendencies (emotional stability, conscientiousness, agreeableness, cognitive flexibility) correlated negatively with IPV but did not retain significance in regression. Overall, psychological and developmental predictors explained 55% of the variance in IPV perpetration.\nDiscussion: Findings support a developmental-attachment pathway to IPV perpetration: early adversity, insecure (avoidant) attachment, and emotion-regulation deficits increase risk, compounded by alcohol use. Results highlight the need for trauma-informed, attachment-based, and self-regulation interventions, with attention to alcohol misuse, and offer practice implications for risk stratification and perpetrator programming in resource-constrained, Southeastern European settings.\n\nKeywords: emotion regulation; intimate partner violence perpetration; attachment avoidance; impulse control; cognitive flexibility; alcohol misuse; adverse childhood experiences; Albania.",

          "title": "When Sharing Becomes the Norm: How Disclosure Prevalence and  Relational Similarity Shape Social Norms on Social Media",
          "authors": "Philipp K. Masur; Douglas A. Parry",
          "abstract": "Social media constitute norm-rich environments in which user behavior is shaped by continuous exposure to others’ actions and reactions. Self-disclosure seems especially responsive to such cues, making it important to understand how online contexts encourage or discourage sharing. While prior research shows that descriptive and injunctive norms guide disclosure, the relative impact of behavioral prevalence, reinforcement signals such as likes and comments, and relational similarity has not been clearly established. This paper addresses this gap by examining how distinct normative cues shape both visual and written disclosure online. In two preregistered experiments (n1 = 590, n2 = 1,337), we let participants use a simulated but ecologically valid social media platform, allowing us to independently manipulate disclosure prevalence as well as reinforcement via likes and comments. Results show that prevalence of visual disclosure consistently increased descriptive and injunctive norms, which in turn raised disclosure intentions. Written disclosure influenced norm perceptions but not disclosure intentions, suggesting modality-specific dynamics. Similarity decreased reliance on prevalence for norm inference but strengthened the motivational pull of norms once formed. Surprisingly, reinforcement cues had no effect on these dynamics. These findings refine social norm theory by distinguishing norm inference from adoption and highlight prevalence as a stable normative driver. Practically, they raise concerns about vulnerability to visible peer behaviors and the spread of risky online trends.",

          "abstract": "Personalized psychological interventions aim to tailor therapy to an individual’s unique needs, preferences, and functioning. Although recent meta-analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of personalization, less is known about how personalization is actually operationalized in practice. This systematic review examined the methods and measures used to personalize psychological interventions. We analyzed twenty-nine studies identified through two recent meta-analyses and an updated systematic search. We classified study methods, decision strategies, and the content of 51 unique measures using the Collect-Share-Act model. Most personalization relied on  static, pre-treatment data and used limited measurement domains, predominantly focused on affective and cognitive domains, neglecting other areas like self and motivation. Therapist input and patient engagement in the personalization process were infrequent. These findings suggest that current personalization practices are narrow in scope and underutilize feedback-informed and process-based frameworks. Broadening measurement domains and strengthening patient–therapist input may enhance the flexibility and impact of personalized interventions.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how pre-service teachers’ motivation toward educational technology develops during teacher education is essential for fostering classroom technology integration. Drawing on Situated Expectancy–Value Theory (SEVT), this longitudinal study examined (a) the stability of technology-related expectancies for success and task values and (b) their predictive effects on pre-service teachers’ intended technology integration, including reciprocal effects over time. Data were collected from N = 314 pre-service teachers enrolled in a Bachelor of Education program in Germany at two measurement points approximately one year apart. Participants completed self-report scales assessing digital competence beliefs, utility value, attainment value, intrinsic value, relative costs, and prospective technology integration. Confirmatory factor analyses supported scalar measurement invariance across time. Results showed moderate rank-order stability for all motivational constructs (r = .46–.68) and no significant mean-level changes, except for a small increase in perceived costs. Cross-lagged structural equation models revealed that digital competence beliefs and positive task values at Time 1 positively predicted prospective technology integration at Time 2, whereas relative costs showed no effect. No reciprocal relations were observed, suggesting that motivation functions as an antecedent rather than a consequence of technology-related intentions. Together, these findings indicate that pre-service teachers’ motivational beliefs remain relatively stable over one year of teacher education and are prospectively related to their intended technology use. The results provide longitudinal support for SEVT in the context of technology-related motivation, underscoring the importance of fostering positive digital competence beliefs and task values early in teacher education.",

          "abstract": "The human brain continuously maps the space surrounding the body through a highly flexible system known as peripersonal space (PPS). This multisensory interface dynamically integrates visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive information to guide interaction with the environment. Although PPS plasticity is well documented following tool-use, it remains unclear how the architectural properties of the surrounding environment modulate this process. Across two experiments using immersive virtual reality (VR), we investigated whether the shape of the environment affects PPS remapping after motor training with a tool. In Experiment 1, participants performed a validated visuo-tactile integration task before and after VR-based tool-use training, all within the same 16m² virtual room. Results showed a significant PPS expansion, confirming that immersive VR can reliably induce PPS plasticity. Experiment 2 tested whether environmental geometry modulates this effect: the same training was conducted in a long (2 × 8 m) and a short (8 × 2 m) virtual room. PPS expansion emerged only after training in the long-shaped environment, while no modulation was found in the short-shaped condition. These findings demonstrate that architectural features—specifically spatial openness and boundary proximity—directly influence the sensorimotor mechanisms underlying PPS plasticity. Our results highlight that the environment is not a passive background but an active component of embodied spatial representation, providing novel evidence for the integration of neurocognitive and architectural perspectives within the emerging field of neuroarchitecture.",

          "abstract": "Background: Retrieving from memory directly benefits long-term retention and also enhances subsequent learning of new content, known as retrieval-potentiated new learning or the forward testing effect. \nAims: The present study assessed the forward testing effect with complex learning materials and was the first to directly test motivational mechanisms, using cognitive effort, enjoyment, and self-paced practice time as motivational indicators.\nSample: 308 undergraduates in an online psychology course participated.\nMethods: Students read three texts introducing new course concepts relevant to their final course exam. After studying Texts 1 and 2, students recalled or restudied the previous text for a self-paced or fixed amount of time. All students took a free-recall test after studying Text 3. \nResults: Recall of Text 3 was greater for retrieval practice than restudy of Texts 1 and 2. This forward testing effect was independent of learners’ prior knowledge and text interest, as well as whether practice times were self-regulated. Consistent with the encoding effort hypothesis, cognitive effort and practice times mediated the forward testing effect: Compared to restudying, retrieval practice reduced the declines in effort and practice time observed across blocks, thereby enhancing learning of Text 3. Enjoyment did not decline across blocks but there was no evidence it mediated the forward testing effect. \nConclusions: The present research affirms the potential instructional value of retrieval practice for promoting new learning, including in online education. There was some support for motivational accounts of the forward testing effect but motivation likely cannot fully explain why retrieval practice facilitates new learning.",

The present study discusses several parameter-based moderated MASEM approaches covering one-stage and two-stage as well as fixed and random effects approaches. We implement these different MASEM approaches using a Bayesian modeling framework and evaluate them through two simulation studies. We compare bias, efficiency, coverage rates, and statistical power of moderator effects across varying number of primary studies, sample sizes, random effect structures, and structural models. Results imply that different parameter-based MASEM approaches can provide unbiased estimates and appropriate coverage of study-level moderation effects. Exceptions and implications are discussed.",

Participants (N = 400) were randomly assigned to one of four groups in which they read a total of three descriptions depicting a moral, immoral, and neutral behavior and listened to a total of three unfamiliar songs randomly paired with a description. Emotional and aesthetic responses to each song were measured using validated measures (GEMS-9 scale), along with additional items assessing feelings of being moved, connected, perceived beauty, perceived creativity, and liking. As predicted, linear mixed-effects models revealed significant main effects of morality for all dependent variables, with immoral descriptions consistently yielding more negative ratings. Contrary to what was predicted, no significant main effect of humanness (human vs. AI-model) was observed. Likewise, no significant interaction was observed between morality and humanness.",

We present results of two incentivized decision-making tasks (N=203 and N=213, samples from the U.S.A.) where participants could adjust their initial estimates upon observing estimates of peers and their confidence. Adjustments were most sensitive to the confidence of others when participants’ own confidence was low. Confidence also affected heuristic strategies: confident others prompted participants to compromise and copy social information more often, rather than to stick with their initial estimates. We discuss how following confident others when uncertain can improve decision-making, but also leaves people vulnerable to sources of misinformation.",

However, preregistration of such analyses remains rare and given the complexity of the data and methods, is often perceived as limiting or even infeasible. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how researchers can safeguard against bias without relying on preregistration by using analysis blinding. The method involves temporarily altering the data to remove the key effect of interest while preserving all other aspects. Analysis blinding makes it possible to explore important features of the data, for instance, spotting outliers or adjusting the computational model, without introducing bias. This tutorial presents three common research questions in network analysis and shows how they can be addressed using analysis blinding to safeguard their confirmatory nature. It uses data from previously published studies employing network analysis, and offers a practical, step-by-step guide along with R code that researchers can adapt to their own data and research questions.",

An internal meta-analysis of all incentive-aligned and scenario-based experiments revealed that people substantially overestimate others' dishonest behavior (Hedges’ g = 0.61; k = 31; N = 8,127), by 14 percentage points on average. Does such belief inaccuracy matter? Study 2 (N = 981) found that providing correct information about actual honesty levels enhanced pro-social beliefs about others.

Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared less than 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "abstract": "A person’s lifetime involvement with musical expertise has been hypothesized to be positively associated with executive functions, including inhibition, shifting, and working memory. However, results of past research have been inconclusive. This preregistered systematic review and three-level meta-analysis of 47 studies encompassing 235 effect sizes from 4651 healthy adult participants investigated how strongly musical expertise relates to each of the three executive functions. The results showed significant medium associations between musical expertise and executive functions (g = 0.43), with small to medium associations between musical expertise and each of the functions: inhibition (g = 0.31), shifting (g = 0.22), and working memory (g = 0.49). Risk of bias moderated the relationship between musical expertise and inhibition, and the paradigm used to assess executive functions moderated the association between musical expertise and working memory. The results suggest that individuals who engage in musical activities have higher levels of executive function, with a particularly critical role of working memory in musical expertise. The literature review further identified several methodological issues, including predominant reliance on dichotomizing continuous variables and the use of small samples yielding low statistical power. The review offers methodological recommendations and directions for further investigating the relation between working memory and musical expertise.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts. However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. This may be because researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our results suggest that findings from past studies should be interpreted with caution as they did not distinguish excellencism from perfectionistic standards.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

Eighty-nine healthy adults listened to spoken sentences degraded in five ways and reported the words that they heard. In addition, they completed the Reading Span and N-back tasks to assess working memory capacity (WM), as well as a short version of Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices to assess fluid reasoning ability. In bivariate correlational analyses, all cognitive test scores predicted degraded speech intelligibility. However, multivariate and dominance analyses revealed that the test of fluid reasoning was the most important predictor of intelligibility. These results may undermine the assumption that WM, as measured by the Reading Span and other tasks, is the primary cognitive construct supporting degraded speech intelligibility.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of mental disorders, with depression and anxiety disorders being the most common, has been rising for years and particularly impacting adolescents. This trend was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural barriers and personal factors hinder help-seeking for child and adolescent psychiatric services, contributing to delays in accessing treatment. Hence, early symptoms of mental illness in adolescence are often recognized too late, increasing the risk of chronic progression into adulthood and underscoring the urgent need for timely diagnosis, prevention, and intervention. Digital Phenotyping offers a digital approach to capturing psychopathological traits through time-series data collection, providing an objective and individualized view of psychological change processes. These data can be analyzed using Machine Learning to support the early detection of mental disorders. The Early SoDA study aims to use DP and a participatory approach to enable the detection of the early onset of mental disorders in adolescence, with a particular focus on depressive and anxiety disorders. It evaluates the Brain Explorer App, which assesses cognitive functions through games, as well as EMA, voice diaries and mobile sensing for playful data collection.\nIn a six-month longitudinal observational study with an exploratory approach, N=200 adolescents and young adults (ages 16–22) will be recruited, including at least n=50 with depression or anxiety disorders. Following an initial baseline assessment, data will be collected daily across four 14-day intervals over 6 months and one 12-months follow-up assessment, including cognitive functions via the Brain Explorer App, EMA-based questionnaires on sleep quality, emotion regulation, stress, and general well-being, along with voice diaries and additionally mobile sensing in a subsample of at least n=50, and reflected back to participants as personalized feedback. If values exceed the clinical cut-off, a clinical interview and consultation with the study team will be conducted. Behavioral parameters are extracted from these digital footprints and analyzed using ML to classify and assess symptom severity of increased psychopathology. We expect that the collected data will predict the progression of emerging psychopathology and reveal intercorrelations among data sources, with EMA data potentially showing the highest predictive value.\nAs the first of its kind, this study aims to identify vulnerable adolescents and young adults early using DP. In collaboration with the target group, an innovative, ML-supported, low-burden early detection tool is being developed and evaluated, leveraging minimally intrusive, real-life data for automated prediction. The digital approach ensures broad accessibility, allowing anyone to participate irrespective of location or infrastructure. In the future, these models could form the basis for preventive interventions and offer personalized treatment recommendations.",

          "abstract": "Public sex offender registries were created on the assumption that people with a history of sexual offending present a high and enduring risk for sexual recidivism. Analyzing data from everyone on Michigan’s sex offender registry (n = 45,145), we found that recidivism risk was very low for many registrants—and that transitions into very low-risk groups occurred in systematic and predictable ways that are relevant to registry design. The sexual recidivism rates were 3% to 5% after five years and 10% after 20 years. Risk of future offending predictably declined the longer people remained sex-offense free in the community. Considering initial risk levels and time free in the community, the likelihood of sexual recidivism was very low for approximately half the registrants: out of 35,000 registrants in the community in Michigan, the risk level for 17,000 to 19,000 individuals was no different from the likelihood of first-time sexual offending in the general male population (&lt; 2% lifetime). Michigan’s registry provides no means for the public to differentiate between the noise presented by the large number of very low-risk cases and the signal representing the minority of genuinely high-risk cases. Major reforms are needed if public sex offender registries have any potential for advancing community safety. However, instead of placing our hopes in large, passive, and stigmatizing registries, we are more likely to reduce sexual recidivism by investing in individualized supervision, treatment, and other support for people at high risk for sexual recidivism.",

In this study of 92 countries (n = 53,774), we assess the mental health of individuals around the world alongside measures of financial and social well-being. Findings include a trend of languishing mental health across many groups, particularly among younger adults and within higher-income countries. While positive trends are observed for education and income, a number of concerning trends also emerge, particularly the loss of the U-shape for age and generally moderate results for employed individuals. In sum, we find an alarming but perhaps unsurprisingly low level of positive mental health in a substantial number of countries, but also identify specific economic, social, and other indicators that policymakers could target in improving the well-being of the populations they serve.",

          "abstract": "Fear is a universal feature of storytelling, yet the structural conditions that make fictional threats compelling remain poorly understood. Here, we propose the Protagonist Vulnerability Index (PVI), an evolutionarily grounded computational approach to explain why some narratives evoke stronger fear responses than others. PVI quantifies protagonist vulnerability by assessing the imbalance in formidability between protagonists and antagonists and the risk of attack faced by the protagonist. Across 691 films, higher PVI values predicted classification as horror, the presence of fear-related keywords in non-horror films, and stronger physiological fear responses indexed by heart rate. Linking film preferences to psychological and demographic data from more than 3.5 million individuals on Facebook, we found that preference for high-PVI films was associated with lower agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, and with higher openness. Openness moderated the negative association between neuroticism and engagement with fear-related content, indicating that curiosity can counteract threat avoidance in anxious individuals. These findings clarify the structural and psychological conditions that activate evolved threat-management systems. The results show how horror operates as a narrative simulation of extreme formidability asymmetry, and provide a framework for predicting, and potentially engineering, fear in fiction.",

Recent accounts of curiosity argue that curiosity should be highest when learning is likely to occur and likely to be rapid. However, it is less clear whether practical barriers to learning—for example, the effort required to gain information—matter for how curious we feel. In the present research, we test whether the expected degree of effort to obtain information impacts curiosity in three preregistered experiments with a total of 419 participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, we prompted adult participants to rate their curiosity about the answers to trivia questions. For each question, they were informed that they would receive the answer with minimal time and effort or with substantial time and effort. In Experiment 3, we additionally varied the probability that exerting effort would lead to information. Across studies, we found that effort affected decisions to seek information, but not self-reported curiosity. This suggests that subjective feelings of curiosity are unhindered by the practical costs of information search, though our decisions to actually pursue information are highly sensitive to these costs.",

If Suzy forgets sunscreen and gets sunburned, the absence of sunscreen caused Suzy’s sunburn, but the sun burned her skin. We tested 691 children and 150 adults. Four-year-old children mapped “caused” to distal causes and “broke” to proximal causes (Experiment 1). Though four-year-old children didn’t map “caused” to absences until later (Experiment 2), they already referred to absences when asked “why” an outcome occurred (Experiment 3).

However, the dominant paradigm has been to only analyze data epochs culminating in movement, which discounts how often slow ramping might occur when no movement follows. To address this, we introduced a matched control condition that did not culminate in movement. We recorded electroencephalography data and compared these two conditions using a variety of powerful machine-learning classifiers. Although early ramping activity was present, it did not predict movement. Instead, classification accuracy rose abruptly about 100 ms before movement. By contrast, the traditional approach reproduced the spurious impression of early predictability. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy, showing that the neural commitment to act is a late-stage event consistent with the timing of conscious intention and the ability to inhibit movement. More broadly, our results show that a reliable antecedent is not necessarily a good predictor, underscoring the need for proper control conditions in time series analyses.",

          "abstract": "Although surveys suggest that 5–15% of parents report regret about having children, parental regret remains a taboo topic and has received surprisingly little scientific attention. Research from related fields suggests that adverse contextual factors, child-related difficulties, or psychological strain may increase the likelihood of regret. However, most existing studies rely on small or selective samples. Consequently, little is known about which factors are most strongly associated with parental regret in the general population. This study is among the first to examine a broad range of contextual, child-related, and psychosocial predictors of parental regret in a large, representative sample from Germany. We used data from the pairfam study, a large nationally representative panel survey in\nGermany. In 2019/20, participants were asked whether they regretted becoming parents. Using logistic regression, we examined predictors of parental regret across seven clusters: (1) sociodemographic factors, (2) stressful life events, (3) interpersonal factors, (4) pregnancy and childbirth experiences, (5) child-related factors, (6) factors related to parental role experiences, and (7) psychosocial factors and personality traits. Additionally, we tested whether associations differed by parental sex, child age, and living arrangements.\nIn line with prior findings from other countries, 11% of parents reported parental regret. Parental regret was primarily associated with contextual factors, such as lower education, lower partner support, and previous abortion experiences; with child-related factors, such as a higher age and number of children; and with individual factors, such as higher depressiveness and lower parental self-efficacy. Our findings underscore the multifactorial nature of parental regret and point to several levers for prevention and support. Strengthening structural resources for socioeconomically disadvantaged families, enhancing couple relationship quality, expanding access to comprehensive family planning counseling, and promoting parental efficacy and competencies may help reduce the likelihood and potentially adverse impact of parental regret.",

          "abstract": "Even though increasing the ecological validity of experimental and theoretical research is seen as a worthy aim by many, progress over the decades has been limited. And so, despite 150 years of research, fundamental and applied, our scientific understanding of the human mind, brain and behavior in the wild remains fragmented. \n\nWe argue that one root cause is a lack of clarity and consensus on what pursuing ecological validity would amount to. These make the goal ambiguous, which in turn leads to misconceptions and unhelpful dichotomies guiding the theoretical discussion and methodological developments -as opposed to an research programme in the Lakatosian sense. We then develop ten principles for an ecological approach to cognitive science that, taken together, would yield such an integrated research programme: one that is neither “lab based” nor “real-world”, neither “basic” nor “applied”, but properly ecological. \n\nThe principles are first presented as logically independent statements (“axioms”) that allow you to evaluate the Ecological, Cognitive and Scientific credentials of research – be it a single experiment, a computational model, or even a fundamental theory or conceptual framework. We then show how they can be integrated into concrete recommendations that should be practically useful in planning experiments or developing theoretical models (“a positive heuristic”). Finally, we discuss how and why we as researchers all too often violate these principles.",

          "abstract": "The principle of “common fate” tells us that objects that move together, group together. But what happens in dynamic illusions where physical paths are shared, but illusory paths differ? Here a horizontal row of targets physically moves up and down as a group over a zigzag set of vertical columns each filled with a static, oblique grating (the furrow illusion). Each target moves in its own column and when the columns all have the same orientation, the targets drift obliquely together, following the furrows of the static gratings. However, if the background orientations for the outer two “bookend” targets (say, right tilt) differ from those of the inner “book” targets (say, left tilt), all items still appear to drift initially to the right as a group, following the illusory direction set by the bookends and ignoring the opposing illusory motion of the inner books. The effect does not rely on blocking access to the features of the inner books – as might be expected from crowding – as they can have easily discriminable shape and/or colour, and their relative motion within the frame of the bookends may still be recoverable. What is missing is any sense of their opposing illusory path. We suggest that the spatial proximity of the items together with their common vertical motion provides the visual system with enough evidence to form a single “grouped” object representation. As objects tend not to move in two directions at once, the more salient bookends dominate our perception of where the group is going.",

This paper synthesizes these perspectives and reframes the inquiry from ‘To what extent is an individual's life cultural?’ to ‘Which life domains are cultural?’ To address this\nempirically, we sourced data from 147,260 participants residing in 88 different countries, who reported on 243 variables across representing a wide range of different life domains. We\nanalyzed 1328 parameters derived from Intra-Class Correlation Coefficients and Within-and-Between Analysis I, which quantify the proportion of variance in phenomena explained by\ndifferences at four levels of grouping: country, cultural zones, regions, and residential areas. We found that domains such as religious values, sexuality, social capital, and beliefs about\nout-groups vary significantly across cultures, whereas economic values, children's qualities, perceptions of science and technology, and organizational affiliation show less variation.

Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Am. 26, 369-380 (1954)] reported two main findings: (1) the frequency ratio R_oct defining perceptually a perfect octave between successive pure tones is not fixed but varies rapidly, in an irregular and listener-specific manner, with the reference frequency; (2) on average, R_oct is slightly larger than 2:1. Ward's second finding, now referred to as the \"octave enlargement\" phenomenon, was confirmed multiple times. However, his first finding needed to be verified with a more rigorous methodology. This was the aim of two experiments reported here, in which overall more than 4000 octave adjustments were performed with pure tones at 65 dB SPL. They show that R_oct can be significantly different for two reference frequencies only 50 or even 25 cents apart. If R_oct defines a constant distance on the pitch dimension, then the results imply that, contrary to common belief, pitch is not a smooth function of frequency. A third experiment supported the idea that the octave enlargement should not be interpreted as a deliberate bias intended to make an adjusted octave more brilliant and therefore pleasant, rather than optimally accurate.",

          "abstract": "Slower responses in older age are often taken as evidence of cognitive decline, yet they may also stem from representational changes shaped by lifelong learning. We advance a developmental perspective on aging, proposing that behavioral change across the lifespan arises from representational systems continuously updated through learning from the environment. This view predicts that aging may bring both benefits and costs: Performance improves when task demands are congruent with accumulated knowledge but declines when they conflict. We provide convergent evidence for this account across three studies, each comprising the following components. First, in tasks requiring participants to access word meanings (i.e., when task demands were congruent with representation), we found that older adults (70–80 years old) exhibited faster processing speed than younger adults (18–25 years old)—a finding that cannot be explained by dominant decline-based accounts. Second, we traced this processing advantage to systematic changes in older adults’ conceptual representations, as inferred from semantic rating tasks. Third, using learning simulation models, we demonstrated how such representational changes could emerge naturally from cumulative language experience.  Replication across different samples, task requirements, and word stimuli strengthens the robustness of these findings. Finally, we identified a boundary condition: when learned representations contained information incongruent with task demands, older adults’ greater learning experience not only attenuates their representational changes but also reduces processing-speed advantage. Altogether, our research challenges the explanatory framework of cognitive aging that emphasizes decline and compensation, advancing a more balanced view grounded in representational development and lifelong learning.",

Interestingly, Chen and Bae (2024, Cognition) recently reported a repulsive serial bias in a pointing direction estimation task that switched to an attractive one in the presence of a distracting task. At the same time, an analysis of response trajectories revealed a repulsive bias during response execution, irrespective of the condition. These surprising findings prompted us to attempt a replication. We confirmed the main findings of Chen and Bae. However, we also demonstrated that the overall direction and magnitude of the bias are relatively stable for a given observer, regardless of the condition. Furthermore, we found that already the very first moment in the response trajectory differed between conditions, showing a predominantly attractive bias for trials that ended with attraction. The results confirm the robustness of the original findings and pose a challenge for a simple Bayesian model of serial dependence, highlighting the need for computational models that can explain both attractive and repulsive biases.",

Here, we tested whether Pavlovian threat conditioning retroactively strengthens long-term episodic memory for previously encoded neutral events by leveraging prior knowledge of their predictive relations. Young adults first learned to anticipate the order of semantic categories in two deterministic sequences (A-&gt;B-&gt;C and D-&gt;E-&gt;F) through repeated presentation of images depicting category exemplars. They then incidentally encoded trial-unique exemplars from each category during sequence viewing. In a next phase, exemplars from the third-position categories were repeated such that one (C) predicted mild electric shocks, whereas the other (F) was never reinforced, creating a category-level threat association through conditioning. After 24 hours, recognition memory for exemplars of categories encoded before conditioning depended on sequence and position: when a sequence ended with a shock-predictive category, memory for its starting category (A) was prioritized over the following category (B) – an effect absent in the control categories (D and E). These results suggest that aversive learning can retroactively reshape episodic memories of neutral events when they are scaffolded by prior sequence knowledge, bridging temporal gaps and thereby potentially promoting early threat anticipation.",

          "abstract": "HIV is a highly stigmatized condition, and negative beliefs about HIV and people with HIV are frequently internalized. This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "authors": "Benjamin PUTOIS; Royce Anders",
          "abstract": "Background. Panic disorder (PD) has historically been subdivided into respiratory (RS) and non-respiratory (NRS) subtypes, based on Klein’s suffocation alarm hypothesis. \nMethods. A systematic search of MEDLINE was performed to identify empirical studies examining the RS/NRS distinction, autonomic physiology, and therapeutic implications.\nResults. Although this dichotomy has facilitated research, it is limited by tautological definitions, temporal instability, and limited clinical validity. For example, RS is defined by respiratory symptoms, and their observation in patients, yet it is subsequently “validated” by CO₂ hypersensitivity, creating circularity, or encouraging confirmation bias. In contrast, NRS is defined for most non-respiratory symptoms by default, therefore constituting a rather heterogeneous, residual category that lacks a unifying explanation of NRS function, and moreover neglects key clinical features such as dissociation, vestibular instability, and gastrointestinal distress. These shortcomings restrict its ability to inform treatment planning and prognostic assessment. In response, a polyvagal framework is proposed, conceptualizing panic attacks as transitions between autonomic states rather than as fixed subtypes. In this framework, RS-like profiles correspond to sympathetic hyperarousal with insufficient ventral vagal modulation, characterized by dyspnea, chest tightness, and catastrophic suffocation fears. NRS-like profiles correspond to dorsal vagal shutdown, characterized by dizziness, presyncope, nausea, and dissociative phenomena. Mixed or alternating features are commonly observed in clinical practice, highlighting the inability of the classical RS/NRS categorization to account for such phenomena, and hence a need to reconceptualize panic attack dynamics with a more comprehensive framework.\nConclusions. Reconceptualizing panic disorder within polyvagal theory integrates neglected symptom domains, aligns semiology with identifiable physiological mechanisms, and provides a more coherent basis for clinical stratification.\nClinical implications. This model suggests mechanism-based interventions: voluntary slow breathing, capnometry-assisted breathing, or yawning for sympathetic profiles; applied tension, progressive muscle contraction techniques, or vestibular rehabilitation for dorsal vagal shutdown; and co-yawning or ventral vagal stimulation as transdiagnostic adjuncts.\nFuture directions. Validation through autonomic phenotyping, multimodal assessments, and randomized controlled trials is required to determine prognostic and therapeutic value of the proposed framework.",

          "abstract": "The inclusiveness of immersion education, such as CLIL, for atypically developing pupils remains understudied. At the same time, immersion learning has been argued to impose high attentional and executive control demands. From this perspective, children already experiencing difficulties in these cognitive abilities, such as children with ADHD, might be at greater risk in immersion education. To address this issue empirically, 26 fifth and sixth-grade pupils with ADHD and 41 typically developing controls were recruited in CLIL and non-CLIL programs, and compared across attentional, executive, linguistic, and academic measures. Our findings do not support the claim that CLIL would only host the mildest forms of ADHD, nor that CLIL would pose additional cognitive and academic challenges for children with ADHD. On the contrary, we conclude that CLIL may offer a valuable opportunity for foreign-language learning, also for pupils with developmental disorders.",

The lingering effect is a phenomenon whereby an initial misinterpretation persists in the final comprehension even after disambiguation. Through self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and comprehension tasks (Experiments 2 and 3), this study explored how the length and head position of ambiguous regions influence the garden-path and lingering effects. Our results indicate that the length and head position influenced the garden-path and lingering effects in different ways. In particular, a longer initial misparse strengthened the garden-path effect in a linear manner but weakened the lingering effect in a non-linear manner. Additionally, Surprisal affected the garden-path effect, but not the lingering effect. These results support the notion that the garden-path and lingering effects are correlated but operate through different underlying processes. Specifically, the garden-path effect pertains to parsing, whereas the lingering effect relates to short-term memory.",

Longitudinal analyses showed that higher p-factor predicted lower future reading achievement. Puberty status, rather than chronological age, moderated this relationship, with stronger predictive effect of p-factor on reading after puberty onset. Furthermore, the polygenic risk score for p-factor predicted lower reading achievement at puberty onset, suggesting puberty may amplify this genetic vulnerability. Results suggest that p-factor may be a developmental risk factor for reading underachievement, particularly after puberty onset.

          "abstract": "Selectively attending to goal-relevant information supports performance. However, it can also limit knowledge about the statistical properties of the broader environment, as well as memory for features that are not currently relevant but may be useful in the future. This study investigated how a naturally selective and goal-oriented attentional system can be leveraged to support both immediate performance outcomes and generalizable knowledge through strategic broadening of attention. Undergraduate participants (N=120) completed a category learning task where optimal performance could be achieved by mapping the features of one spatially-defined dimension to the available category labels. Tests of feature memory and category generalization followed. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three instruction conditions: (1) a baseline condition in which the goal-relevant dimension was cued and the later memory test was undisclosed, (2) a rule-uncertainty condition in which the goal-relevant dimension was not cued, and (3) a memory-goal condition in which participants were informed of the upcoming memory tests. Attentional breadth during categorization, as measured by eye-tracking, predicted both subsequent memory for goal-irrelevant features and successful category generalization. Compared to baseline, early uncertainty about which dimensions were relevant to categorization significantly increased attentional breadth and memory test performance. No meaningful differences were observed between baseline and the memory-goal condition. The results suggest that manageable uncertainty can promote broader initial attention and more flexible, generalizable learning, thus overcoming the costs of selective attention.",

          "abstract": "How does personality shape people’s music preferences? The present work contributes to the growing literature addressing this question by investigating individual-difference correlates of enjoyment of death metal music. We focus on four traits—schizotypy, masculinity, need to belong (NTB), and need for uniqueness (NFU). Across two studies, participants completed personality measures, listened to a clip from a representative death metal song, and answered questions regarding their enjoyment of death metal. To assess a theorized causal mechanism, namely that a need for psychological security may motivate liking death metal among those high in our variables of interest, existential concerns were heightened via a Mortality Salience (MS) induction. MS-priming did not increase enjoyment of death metal in either study. Enjoyment of death metal was associated with higher levels of schizotypy and masculinity in both studies. Mediation analysis of both studies also revealed an indirect effect of NFU on enjoyment of death metal through schizotypy. These results suggest that, of the variables examined, schizotypy is the most robust predictor for enjoying death metal. Although enjoyment of death metal may be related to psychological defense, our findings indicate that this relationship is likely more complex than can be captured using traditional priming manipulations.",

This study investigates how social feedback influences self-esteem in adolescents and emerging adults with elevated borderline personality (BPD) symptoms, a vulnerable group characterized by low self-esteem and a negative, unstable self-image.\nMethods: We employed a social evaluation task simulating a social media context. Participants were asked to make social predictions (whether they expected Likes or Dislikes from peers), received social feedback (Likes or Dislikes from peers) and repeatedly reported their momentary self-esteem. The sample included 55 adolescents and emerging adults with BPD symptoms and 67 matched non-clinical controls (NCC, ages 13-25). Computational reinforcement learning modeling was used to analyze their behavior. \nResults: Compared to NCC, BPD showed strongly biased negative expectations of not being liked by others. Besides, computational modeling revealed significant group differences in social learning: individuals with BPD symptoms failed to learn from frequent positive social feedback (Likes) but overweighted rare negative social feedback (Dislikes) received from generally benevolent peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was disproportionately reactive to positive feedback from critical raters, a pattern partly explained by individual differences in self-reported adverse family experiences.\nConclusions: These findings highlight fundamental disruptions in how young people with BPD symptoms learn from social feedback and how they use it to inform their self-esteem.",

          "abstract": "Conduct disorder (CD) and psychopathy are characterised by antisocial behaviour and sometimes limited prosocial emotions. Understanding violence and aggression in these disorders depends on unravelling the mechanisms behind how and when these individuals make decisions that help or harm others. New advances in computational modelling of behaviour and computational psychiatry promise to provide such mechanistic insights into how, when, and why people choose antisocial and prosocial actions. However, studies employing such computational approaches to understand antisocial disorders have only recently begun to emerge, particularly compared to studies on internalising disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this systematic review, we followed PRISMA guidelines to identify and synthesise 19 studies that applied computational approaches to investigate social decision-making in CD, psychopathy, and subclinical psychopathic traits. Across these studies, we identified models based on reinforcement learning, drift–diffusion, and social valuation that showed that antisocial behaviours are linked to altered learning about others’ outcomes, reduced sensitivity to guilt and inequity, and atypical value integration when prosocial actions involve personal cost. Converging evidence across adolescent and adult samples highlights how computational models can uncover distinct cognitive and affective mechanisms that traditional behavioural analyses overlook. This synthesis therefore underscores the potential of computational psychiatry to reveal the mechanisms underlying antisocial behaviour and to inform an integrated computational framework of social decision-making in antisocial disorders.",

The effect music has on memory has been studied quite thoroughly for a couple of decades, and yet still the effect it has on long-term memory performance remains ambiguous. Numerous studies have concluded—in contradiction with each other—that music can improve, hinder, or have no effect on memory performance. Despite these ambiguous results on memory, music has been shown to improve and enhance other cognitive functions like concentration and focus.\nSeparating the encoding and retrieval processes of long-term memory can help interpret the past mixed results in this particular research area. To this end, we compared the effects of background music on the encoding and retrieval processes of memory, something previous studies have not investigated. Four groups of college students under varying listening conditions were instructed to memorize a fifteen word list and were then asked to recall that very same list to the best of their ability two days later. We found that music, as opposed to noise, had a negative effect on performance when listened to at both the encoding and retrieval stages. No significance was found during the mixed music and noise conditions during encoding and retrieval. We discuss possible reasons such as individual musical preference, selection of music, working memory performance, and more for these unclear findings.",

This knowledge gap results in networks reinventing approaches rather than building systematically on collective experience. Here, we introduce the concept of a network-of-networks: a coordinated ecosystem approach that connects existing BTS initiatives and community partners to develop and share knowledge, infrastructure, and inclusive practices. We use the CONNECT (Coordinated Network of Networks for Enhancing Collaborative Teams) partnership as an exemplar of this next phase of collaborative science, which integrates metascientific inquiry with participatory action research to improve workflows, co-develop scalable tools, and promote inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). By applying systematic, evidence-based approaches to collaborative practices themselves, this meta-collaborative approach moves BTS from trial-and-error toward systematic understanding of effective collaboration, laying the groundwork for a more reproducible, inclusive, and sustainable global research ecosystem.",

No significant differences were found in the network structure and global strength between the two time points in either sample. Results from CLPNs showed that emotional pain exhibited strong and consistent influence (i.e., high out-prediction) across cultures. In the Chinese sample, identity disruption emerged as a culturally specific driving symptom, while in the U.S. sample, reintegration-related symptoms (i.e., difficulty reintegrating new life and preoccupation) demonstrated greater predictive influence. Additionally, loneliness showed high cross-cultural predictability over time (i.e., high in-prediction). \nConclusions\nThese findings provide important insights into the temporal dynamics of PG symptoms and suggest a two-step, culturally responsive care pathway, with early emotion regulation strategies plus culturally tuned identity  or reintegration focused approaches.

Reading speed was slower when reading stripy compared to less-stripy text and there was a small non-linear effect of color on reading speed.

          "abstract": "Motor signs have been central to descriptions of melancholia since antiquity, yet their significance and presumed causes have varied considerably across history. Until today and despite their robust link with worse outcomes, the origin of motor signs in mood disorders is not well understood. This may be due to a lack of clinical awareness, heterogenous terminology and divergent assessment of motor signs in psychiatric and neurological research. In this paper, we revisit historical accounts of motor signs in melancholia, tracing their evolution from classical antiquity to the mid-20th century. Using a semi-systematic review of historical and clinical literature in four languages, we uncover ancient descriptions of motor retardation and agitation, initially framed within humoral and religious paradigms. From the 16th century onward, motor signs were increasingly interpreted as manifestations of problems in volition, affect and cognition caused by a nervous system dysfunction. By the 19th century, motor disturbance had become a defining feature of melancholia, giving rise to subtypes classifications that shaped early psychiatric nosology. Post–World War II developments introduced objective motor assessments and rating scales, yet conceptual disagreements persist regarding their definition, neuroanatomical correlates and attribution to affective, cognitive and motivational processes. We argue that historical perspectives offer valuable context for interpreting motor signs in contemporary neurobiological research. To advance the field, we propose a unified, non-interpretive motor vocabulary and advocate for the combined use of observer-rated and instrumented assessments.",

          "abstract": "In psychological assessment, vocabulary tests are commonly used as reliable and efficient indicators of crystallized intelligence, as retrospective proxies for premorbid intelligence, and as measures of language proficiency. However, many of the widely used German vocabulary tests are outdated, proprietary, and lack a clear rationale for item selection. To address these limitations, we developed a new, openly available vocabulary test: the Next-Generation Open Vocabulary Assessment (NOVA). Therefore, we first constructed 110 multiple-choice vocabulary items with support from ChatGPT and administered them to 1,052 German-speaking adults using a multiple-matrix design, along with a declarative knowledge test for validation purposes. In a second step, we used Ant Colony Optimization to compile two parallel 30-item short forms, optimized for reliability and item difficulty and discrimination. The resulting tests assessed vocabulary unidimensionally and reliably, covered a large ability range, and correlated strongly with declarative knowledge. We provide a Shiny app for the calculation of standard values based on individual test results. Additional analyses revealed that 57% of the variance in item difficulties could be explained by word frequency and word length, which may be particularly useful for streamlining the future development of vocabulary tests.",

          "authors": "Tobias R. Rebholz",
          "abstract": "Research on augmented judgment and decision-making has largely contrasted human and algorithmic sources of judgment. Accordingly, Logg’s (2022) “Theory of Machine” is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Indeed, people often treat humans and algorithms as different kinds, that is, functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, I propose to complement the predominant human-centric lens on algorithmic judgment with an explicit algorithm-centric one, focusing on people’s lay theories about how different algorithms differ. Put differently, the core psychological claim of Theory of Machine 2.0 is that lay perceivers also differentiate among various AI systems. The first main contribution is the synthesis of capability contrasts across AI systems. People’s perceptions of these contrasts may be formed and shaped by personal experience and media exposure. Most importantly, their expectations and beliefs are supposed to consequentially guide their downstream user behavior—such as system trust, algorithmic advice weighting, and accountability attribution. The second main contribution is the proposal of testable research questions and designs for more algorithm-centric future research on people’s augmented judgment and decision-making. The theoretical perspective proposed in this article clarifies how people form and use lay theories about different AI systems and offers practical levers for the design, deployment, and evaluation of algorithmic decision-support systems.",

Building on prior frameworks, we integrated diverse behavioral and demographic indicators, including family structure, marriage stability, religiosity, transportation practices, and self-employment. While overall patterns broadly aligned with historical findings, notable shifts emerged, suggesting sociocultural changes over the past two decades reshaped the relative expression of collectivism across states. At the state level, higher collectivism scores were associated with lower rates of marijuana use, binge drinking, and depression, and with greater cultural tightness, consistent with country-level findings in existing literature. These findings underscore the persistence, evolution, and psychological correlates of cultural patterns within the U.S. and provide a contemporary spatial tool for examining how regional cultural differences relate to psychological outcomes.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in social life, understanding its interpersonal and psychological implications is urgent yet under-theorized. This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "abstract": "Publication bias is the prioritized and selective reporting of scientifically significant results and often stems from the assumption that statistically significant research findings are rated as more important, credible, valuable, and publishable than nonsignificant or null findings. Previous work shows that this assumption makes researchers less likely to publish nonsignificant or null findings, a phenomenon termed file drawer bias. While prior research investigated the file drawer bias primarily at the study level (e.g., what share of studies has been published and which has not), we examine the prevalence of unpublished research on both the study and the hypothesis level (e.g. which hypotheses are published and which remain unpublished). We did so by comparing the submissions of 178 studies conducted in two probability-based German panel infrastructures (SOEP-IS and GESIS Panel) with their subsequent publications. We found substantial evidence for publication bias: after an average of more than six years of data availability, 43.8% of studies remained unpublished, 44.4% published at least one peer-reviewed article, and 11.8% published gray literature exclusively. Less than one third of submitted hypotheses were published, while the vast majority of published studies with hypotheses (&gt;95%) included newly added (ad-hoc) hypotheses, and more than half of these studies published exclusively ad-hoc hypotheses. Taken together, over 80% of all published hypotheses were ad-hoc, and over 70% of hypotheses were supported. These findings highlight persistent incentives toward selective reporting and ad-hoc hypothesis formulation (potential HARKing). Our results raise concerns about ongoing publication bias in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.",

          "abstract": "We investigated whether gender-based societal beliefs shape the way individuals gather information and draw conclusions—an effect that may support the persistence of gender stereotypes. Three pre-registered experiments (N = 210) used a dynamic sampling paradigm, in which participants estimated the gender distribution of the workforce of fictitious companies representing highly gendered professions (e.g., mechanic, hairdresser). Participants could learn about the workforce of each company by viewing up to ten pictures of its employees, in which the gender of the first two faces either confirmed, disconfirmed, or remained neutral with regard to societal expectations about the profession. When initial evidence matched (vs. mismatched) expectations, participants sampled fewer faces. And when participants did view additional faces in belief-confirming sequences, these additional faces also skewed towards the gendered expectations, suggesting that participants actively employed strategies leading to selective exposure. Furthermore, both gender-based beliefs and newly sampled information influenced estimates of the workforce gender distributions, with larger effects of newly sampled evidence as the participant viewed more faces. Thus, pre-existing gendered beliefs shaped information sampling and social judgements. Furthermore, early exposure to belief-disconfirming information elicited more extensive and less biased information search. More extensive information search, in return, led to less biased social judgements. This research shows that when social expectations are quickly confirmed, people tend to not look any further, whereas initial belief-challenging information elicits more extensive exploration and less biased conclusions.",

To date, little is known about older gamers on a large scale.

Participants were classified as non-gamers (N = 60,540; 82.53%), occasional gamers (N = 10,961; 14.94%), and frequent gamers (N = 1,858; 2.53%), according to their computer gaming patterns reported in 2006-2010. \n\nResults \nGroup comparison results suggested mostly negligible differences between gamers and non-gamers in the domains of demographics (e.g., age, sex), active/passive lifestyle (e.g., physical activity), social engagement (e.g., friends/family visits), sleep patterns (e.g., chronotype, insomnia), physical health (e.g., vision, cardiovascular health), and psychological well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life, depressed mood). Small effects of group differences were found in moderate exercise, TV watching, body mass index, body fat percentage and self-reported health. \n\nConclusion \nThese findings will help unveil the unique profile (or lack thereof) of older gamers versus non-gamers and provide insights for gerontologists and practitioners in the gaming industry.",

A total of 232 caregivers (79 males, 153 females) completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Prosocial Tendencies Measure, Social Support Rating Scale, and Event-Related Rumination Inventory. Regression and mediation analyses showed that prosocial behavior was positively related to PTG. Both social support and deliberate rumination significantly mediated this relationship in parallel. These findings suggest that prosocial behaviors have a positive effect on PTG among caregivers for seriously ill patients. This direct effect, as well as the mediating effect of social support and deliberate rumination, suggests both social context and cognitive pathways to facilitate PTG among caregivers.",

We examined how both trait- and state-level reading enjoyment shape engagement and eye movements during naturalistic reading. Seventy-six adults read 40 book synopses, rated their enjoyment, answered comprehension questions, and decided whether to wait to view the book cover, while their eye movements were recorded. Mixed-effects models disaggregated between-participant (trait) from within-participant (state) enjoyment. Both levels predicted greater willingness to wait and higher comprehension. Trait enjoyment was associated with longer passage and word reading times. State enjoyment was linked to longer passage times, increased word skipping, faster early word processing, and increased regressions, suggesting more efficient first-pass reading accompanied by increased rereading. These findings suggest that momentary fluctuations in intrinsic motivation dynamically shape reading strategies, revealing a close link between perceived value and the allocation of cognitive resources during text processing.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is a debilitating condition that is highly prevalent among adolescents. However, depression is often understood through a nomothetic lens, meaning that there is a tendency to measure general patterns of symptoms. This overgeneralisation largely ignores the individual, lived experiences of depressed youth. To get a better understanding of what adolescents themselves find important in their experiences with depression and psychotherapy, we conducted a mixed-methods study into their perspectives.\nMethods: Participants were 21 young adults (M = 20.5, SD = 1.3) in university who had attended some form of psychotherapy in the past 2 years. The participants first performed a statement-sorting task and then afterwards an interview was conducted. The descriptive statistics were then followed up by a thematic analysis of the interview content.\nResults: Descriptives of the statement ratings indicated that there is a high variability in how the statements were rated. Four themes were generated that informed this heterogeneity in prioritisation: 1) the navigation of core problems versus “minor” problems in therapy, 2) the effect of trust in the therapist on the course of therapy, 3) the boundary between one’s identity and one’s mental health concerns, and 4) how individuals choose to accept social support. \nConclusion: This study underscores the variety of experiences adolescents can prioritise in psychotherapy. The post-sorting task interviews helped contextualise these experiences. This mixed-methods approach provides an understanding of adolescent depression from the perspectives of adolescents themselves, and can thus inform idiographic assessment of depression.",

Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support.",

In this study, we thus aimed to test (1) whether affective inertia differs within-day and overnight and (2) whether within-day and overnight inertia are differentially associated with psychological functioning (e.g., personality, perseverative thoughts, stress). We operationalized within-day inertia as the autoregression of affect from one timepoint to the next during the same day and overnight inertia as the autoregression of affect from the previous night to the next morning. We used data from the ESCAPE project including 254 ethnically and economically diverse participants (25–65 years) who participated in up to three 14-day measurement bursts with five daily beeps. We found significant within-day and overnight affective inertia in positive and negative affect. Overnight inertia substantially exceeded within-day inertia that would be expected for the longer overnight interval, indicating affective inertia differs within-day and overnight. This research highlights the importance to disentangle within-day and overnight intervals when studying affective inertia.",

Using three waves of data from a nationally representative UK household panel study (N=18,807), we applied longitudinal multilevel models to examine how individual- and objective area-level indicators jointly predict cross-ethnic friendships. At the individual-level, higher openness and agreeableness, stronger neighbourhood belonging, and a left-leaning political orientation were associated with more cross-ethnic friendships. At the contextual-level, intergroup friendships were more common in neighbourhoods with more structural opportunity for contact (i.e. areas with a lower proportion of same-ethnic residents), and in areas with higher support for egalitarian policies (as indicated by local voting patterns). Crucially, cross-level interactions highlighted the interplay of person and place: neighbourhood diversity fostered more cross-ethnic friendships especially among those with strong neighbourhood belonging, suggesting that people who feel embedded in their community are more likely to turn diverse surroundings into meaningful intergroup ties. Differences between ethnic majority and minority groups also emerged. For example, higher area-level racial hate-crime incidence predicted more intergroup friendships among majority members, suggesting a possible repair response, but had no effect for minority members. Findings underscore multilevel and group-specific pathways to sustained intergroup friendships.",

          "abstract": "The non-human primate (NHP) brain, particularly that of the macaque monkey, provides a powerful model for investigating the neural basis of conscious perception due to its close homology with the human cortex. Research using paradigms such as binocular rivalry and binocular flash suppression has revealed that neuronal populations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) explicitly encode consciously perceived visual information—including direction of motion, faces, and complex patterns—even in the absence of behavioral reports. Using no-report and rapid serial visual presentation paradigms, these studies demonstrate that prefrontal representations persist when post-perceptual processing and motor reports are absent or minimized, suggesting that PFC activity reflects genuine correlates of conscious experience. Moreover, the PFC encodes both concrete sensory details and abstract, hierarchical information about visual sequences, such as global regularities and prediction errors, indicating an integrative representational architecture. These findings support theoretical models, including the Global Neuronal Workspace and Higher-Order Thought theories, which propose an active role of the PFC in broadcasting or representing conscious contents, while challenging accounts that view it as merely post-perceptual or epiphenomenal. Overall, convergent electrophysiological evidence highlights the PFC as a central node in the cortical network supporting subjective awareness, capable of representing both the content and structure of conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "The original Morris water maze (Morris, 1981) has been coined the “gold standard” task for examining spatial navigation in animals. The general procedure of the maze involves a circular pool filled approximately half-way with water. An animal is then tasked with locating and recalling the position of a hidden “platform”, which is submerged below the water surface in a fixed location. The platform has minimal visual presence in the pool, meaning the location of the platform must be found, learned and recalled from memory. Recently, the task has been translated using virtual reality for use with humans (virtual water task), to investigate similar cognitive mechanisms examined using the animal version of the task. However, there are multiple different variations of the virtual water task scattered across the human literature. These versions vary in both environmental design (e.g., different shaped arenas or platform sizes) and testing procedures (e.g., 1 minute trial times or no inter-trial intervals), which all influence a person’s ability to perform the task. Whilst the virtual version of this task possesses the same potential to become the “gold standard” for examining spatial cognition in humans, comparing and replicating results across research labs has shown to be incredibly difficult due the lack of standardised procedures and protocols. In this paper we present protocols to help with the standardisation of this task. We recommend practices and procedures for researching specific cognitive processes in humans, as well as reporting guidelines, recommended analyses and expected results.",

Participants found the empathetic refutation approach to be most acknowledging of the non-voter’s perspective, but reported no significant differences in how compelling they found the explanations or their levels of trust and openness to the information presented.\nConclusions: Explaining the vicious cycle of non-participation could help to improve young people’s willingness to participate in the electoral process.\nKeywords: democracy; voting; trust; empathy; attitude roots; affirmation; youth vote",

          "abstract": "Children experience large differences in language learning opportunities during the early years. These differences include their mothers’ vocabulary sophistication, which may serve as a pathway for the transmission of educational attainment across generations. However, associations between vocabulary sophistication and education may be confounded by genetic factors that mothers and children share. In the E-Risk study—a longitudinal, nationally representative cohort of 1,116 British families, mothers’ naturalistic speech was recorded when their children when they were 5 years old. From the transcripts of these recordings, we derived mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Mothers’ educational attainment at children’s age 5 years significantly predicted children’s educational attainment at age 18 years (β = .33, 95% CI [.280, .371]), and 16% of this association could be attributed to mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Using path models with polygenic scores, we discerned genetic transmission effects (i.e., shared genetics) from environmentally mediated influences. We found that mothers’ vocabulary sophistication accounted for approximately 2% of the environmentally mediated influence on children’s educational attainment. The findings support that the ‘word gap’—differences in children’s language learning opportunities—likely plays a small causal role in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Our results highlight the importance of early language environments and may inform strategies aimed at reducing the impact of family background on educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "From books of secrets to secret societies, it appears that groups have found success in publicizing the existence of secrets while concealing their content, possibly in an attempt to increase the perceived importance of the secret information and trigger curiosity in their audience. This paper explores why secrets, despite being often associated with shameful personal stories, are so often publicly advertised, in three pre-registered experiments (US participants, N = 1970). In study 1, participants judged that publicly acknowledged secrets were less likely to harm the secret-keeper’s reputation than privately kept ones, suggesting that publicly advertising secrets might reduce the harm made to one’s reputation. In studies 2 and 3, we directly tested whether secrecy might impact curiosity. We could not find significant evidence that our secrecy manipulations increased curiosity between conditions, both in interpersonal settings or when evaluating books. Instead, exploratory mediation analyses suggest that secrecy might have a direct negative effect on curiosity in interpersonal contexts, even though we found robust positive relationships between the costs secret-keepers invested in keeping their secrets, the perceived importance of the concealed information, and participants’ curiosity. These findings suggest that advertising secrets might not have consistent effects on an audience’s curiosity.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous pupil fluctuations (SPFs) during rest provide a non-invasive, low-cost index of central arousal dynamics, independent of cognitive task demands. These features position SPFs as promising markers for baseline neurophysiological activity in both basic and translational research.\nThis review synthesizes current evidence on the resting-state pupil-brain system, focusing on its core components: central neuromodulatory circuits and large-scale cortical networks. We first examine the relationship between SPFs and distributed elements of the ascending arousal system, including noradrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic nuclei. We then detail SPF coupling with intrinsic functional networks - default mode, salience, and sensorimotor systems - highlighting their role in mediating transitions between internally and externally oriented brain states. Finally, we discuss the spectral and directional properties of pupil-brain interactions, emphasizing analytical approaches suited for assessing causality and outlining implications for clinical and translational applications.\nConverging evidence from animal and human neuroimaging studies reveals robust spatiotemporal and spectral coupling between SPFs and neural activity across micro- and macro-scales. These findings support a systems-level framework in which SPFs serve as integrative markers linking subcortical neuromodulation with large-scale cortical dynamics.\nWe conclude that SPFs offer a sensitive window into arousal regulation and body-brain integration, with potential utility as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric conditions and altered states of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Digital disconnection is defined as setting deliberate limits to connectivity to enhance (digital) well-being. Yet, for some people, disconnecting from their devices may prove more difficult than for others. One important but understudied factor that may help explain such differences is how habitually people use their smartphones. Drawing on cross-sectional survey data from 944 Belgian adults (50.40% female, Mage = 42.28, SDage = 13.63), we therefore investigated how individual differences in habitual smartphone use are associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection and disconnection frequency, as well as how these variables (partly) explain how habitual smartphone use relates to well-being. Structural equation modeling revealed that habitual smartphone use was indeed positively associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = 0.40, p &lt; .001), which, in turn, was negatively associated with disconnection frequency (β = -0.16, p &lt; .001). Moreover, perceived difficulty with disconnection showed a negative association with well-being (β = -0.24, p = &lt; .001), while disconnection frequency showed a positive association with well-being (β = 0.10, p = .001). The analyses also revealed a significant indirect effect from habitual smartphone use to well-being, with the strongest pathway via perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = -0.10, p &lt; .001). These findings highlight the need to further investigate the role of habitual smartphone use in shaping how people experience and manage digital disconnection, as well as its implications for well-being.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript has been submitted to the Special Issue “Quantum Information and Probability: From Foundations to Engineering IV” in Entropy.\n\nWhen reading a novel or poem, readers sometimes gain comprehension or experiences that cannot be expressed in language, yet are felt as holistic. Previous studies focused on the linguistically expressible aspects of text comprehension. In this study, we propose a new hypothesis, the purification comprehension hypothesis, that seeks to explain how a reader constructs indescribable and coherent comprehension using quantum probability theory. This hypothesis regards the reading process as purification, in which the reader's initial interpretation state is mixed, and the reader incorporates external systems, such as the interpretation of other parts of the text or prior knowledge, to purify their state. Therefore, the dimensionality of the state increases and von Neumann entropy decreases through purification. We also highlight two types of reading based on this hypothesis: purification and deterministic. Our model contributes to studies on reading by bridging humanities and scientific studies, provides implications for cognition models that aim to minimize Shannon entropy, and has the potential to apply cognition related to other modalities and media, such as music and art.",

          "abstract": "Background: Supporting lasting learning is a central goal in education, particularly in schools where long-term retention is crucial for students' academic success. Generative learning helps construct meaningful mental representations, while retrieval practice supports consolidation and long-term retention. Combining both strategies may foster learning; however, research remains scarce.\nAims: We investigated how combining generative activities and retrieval practice affects students’ conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy in authentic school settings for immediate and lasting learning. Additionally, we explored associations between generation, retrieval, and explanation quality (i.e., completeness, elaboration, correctness).\nSample: The classroom experiment was conducted in authentic physics lessons with N = 344 secondary students.\nMethods: Students participated in a physics teaching unit about converging lenses and were randomly assigned within each class to one of four combinations of sequential learning activities crossing two factors (non-generation vs. generation; non-retrieval vs. retrieval). Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy were measured immediately and after eight weeks.\nResults: Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy did not significantly differ between generation, retrieval, or their sequential combination at either test. However, exploratory analyses revealed that retrieval practice supported lasting learning only when prior generative processing was of low quality—that is, when students’ explanations were incomplete, less elaborated, or inaccurate.\nConclusions: Combining generation and retrieval does not universally enhance learning. Its effectiveness appears to depend on the quality of prior generative processing. In this sense, retrieval practice may serve a happy role—compensating fragile knowledge—or a redundant one, offering no added benefit when prior understanding is already strong.",

A prominent theme was that of control: Participants want to maintain some sense of autonomy. This factor has not (yet) been included in current technology acceptance models but may be an influential factor in the adoption and acceptance of technology by the elderly. Additionally, participants weighed the impact on their community (rather than themselves) heavily, accepting that adoption of assistive technology will greatly support their family, caregivers and/or the healthcare sector. Emphasizing these two factors may therefore increase the adoption and acceptance of digital assistants, allowing longer aging in place.",

          "abstract": "Background: Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS)—such as aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, and saccharin—are increasingly used as sugar substitutes to enhance food palatability without additional caloric intake. While the metabolic effects of NNS are well documented, their potential cognitive and socio-emotional consequences remain unclear. \nObjective: This study investigated the associations between chronic NNS and sugar consumption, cognitive performance, and socio-emotional behaviors in healthy young adults, while controlling for sugar intake to isolate substance-specific effects.\nMethods: A total of 291 French adults aged 18-30 years completed five computerized tasks assessing decision-making and emotion regulation: the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), the Game of Dice Task (GDT), the binary dictator game, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Daily NNS and sugar intakes were estimated using quantitative food frequency questionnaires. Logistic mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the effects of NNS and sugar intake on choice probabilities, rigidity scores, and response times.\nResults: Higher NNS intake was associated with increased selection of the riskiest options under explicit risk in the GDT (p = 0.04) but did not affect decision-making in the IGT. Conversely, higher sugar intake was positively associated with selecting the advantageous yet risky option compared to both disadvantageous (p = 0.04) and advantageous non-risky (p = 0.02) options during the early ambiguity (learning) phase of the IGT. Sugar intake also tended to increase selection of the riskiest option (versus the safest option) under explicit risk. NNS intake was further linked to shorter mean response times across IGT trials (p = 0.04) and showed a trend toward higher rigidity scores at the end of the task, whereas sugar intake predicted longer response times (p &lt; 0.01) and tended to decrease rigidity scores. Neither NNS nor sugar intake significantly influenced altruism, cooperation, or emotion regulation.\nConclusion: Chronic NNS and sugar consumption appear to differentially modulate decision-making processes under explicit and experiential risk, without significantly impacting social or emotional behaviors. These findings underscore the need for longitudinal and neuroimaging studies to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying sweetener-related behavioral modulation.",

Gaze behaviour plays a critical role during this transition, as effective information processing is essential for safely resuming manual control. Directional Takeover Requests (TORs) have been proposed to guide drivers’ attention towards safety-critical areas, thereby reducing takeover time and improving takeover quality. However, existing research on the effects of directional TORs on gaze behaviour has found inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify effects of directional TORs on drivers’ gaze behaviour compared to non-directional TORs during transitions of control. Meta-analyses revealed that incorporating directionality into the visual interface increased both the number and duration of fixations on the TOR display. Directional TORs effectively guided drivers’ visual attention towards hazards and reduced cognitive demands, although their effects on mirror-checking and road fixations varied with interface modality and location.",

          "abstract": "Effective instruction should not only enhance immediate performance but also prepare learners to succeed when learning independently in novel situations (new learning). This study examined which timing and frequency strategies of instruction most effectively foster new learning. We compared six strategies, inspired by theories of motivation (e.g., self-determination theory) and cognition (e.g., testing effect), with two control conditions (no-instruction and full-instruction). Across three experiments (total N = 1,522), participants performed a category learning task. They first received instruction through feature highlighting, whose timing and frequency varied across conditions. Subsequently, their performance was assessed in an independent session where they learned new categories without instruction. An adaptive strategy that tailored instruction to learner performance significantly outperformed the control conditions in initial experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). However, this effect was not observed in a comprehensive experiment (Experiment 3), suggesting that adaptivity itself may not have been the beneficial factor. Instead, an overall examination suggested that the beneficial effects were attributable to two underlying instructional patterns shared by the conditions that outperformed the control conditions: (1) providing instruction in successive sequences, and (2) interspersing tests without instruction by restricting the frequency of instruction. Instructional strategies with these two patterns yielded a significant advantage over the control conditions for independently discovering correct knowledge in novel situations, although they did not reliably improve generalization of that knowledge to other items. This integration of instructional patterns appears to foster new learning by balancing the useful information from instruction with the desirable difficulty of testing.",

          "abstract": "Deficits in joint attention are well documented as hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many different measures have been used to study autistic individuals within a wide range of age groups, meaning that we do not have a clear picture of how joint attention was assessed in past studies. In this systematic review, we aim to provide a clearer picture of joint attention assessment methods used with autistic individuals, identify gaps in measurement, and make recommendations for future research.\nWe searched PubMed, EBSCO (APA PsycINFO, APA PsycARTICLES), Scopus, Ovid, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. A total of 129 studies involving 5536 autistic individuals were retrieved for the period 1989-2024. \nOut of 129 studies reviewed, 57 compared the joint attention of autistic (N=1727) and non-autistic (N=2094) individuals. In 51 of these studies, autistic individuals performed significantly lower on the joint attention assessments, highlighting significant challenges in maintaining joint attention. Measures of joint attention included eye-tracking (18 studies), standardized scales and questionnaires (57 studies), and play- or activities-based measures (63 studies). \nEye-tracking has been used mainly in comparison studies with autistic children over five years old, whereas intervention studies have primarily assessed younger autistic children under five years old using standardized tools and play- or activity-based measures. These studies also differed considerably in the tasks employed, the operational definitions of joint attention, and the ways in which joint attention skills were measured. The wide variation in methods makes it difficult to compare outcomes across studies. Our review therefore highlights the need for the development of comprehensive standardized measures that are sensitive to developmental variations in joint attention, enabling more reliable cross-study comparisons and ultimately supporting more accurate diagnosis and tailored interventions for autistic individuals. Moreover, we recommend the establishment of clear guidelines for designing eye-tracking tasks and play- or activity-based procedures for assessing the joint attention of autistic individuals, as well as the development of specific joint attention scales for consistent use in both research and clinical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Humans are highly susceptible to framing manipulations in intertemporal decision\nmaking—choices that involve tradeoffs between immediate and delayed rewards.\nWell-known decision-making biases such as the magnitude effect, in which larger\nreward amounts increase patience, have been attributed to self-control, reward\nsystem activation, and other cognitive mechanisms. Here, we show that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) exhibit similar sensitivities to framing manipulations,\nincluding the magnitude, sign, and hidden-zero effects. Unlike humans, LLMs\ndiscount delayed rewards exponentially rather than hyperbolically and do not\nexhibit a decimal effect, suggesting their behavior does not simply reflect\nknowledge of published decision-making phenomena learned during training.\nAnalysis of LLM embedding spaces, which encode semantic knowledge,\nrevealed that large monetary amounts are represented more closely to words\nrelated to delay and the future. This suggests that framing manipulations bias\nLLM choices through semantic proximity to words linked to the present or future.\nTogether, these results introduce a conceptual framework whereby linguistic\nstructure shapes decisions, suggesting that human decision-making biases may\nemerge, in part, from the organization of choice options in semantic space.",

Recent research suggests that personality disorders, especially OCPD, might not be as stable as once thought. The current study investigates the longitudinal stability of OCPD diagnosis and individual symptom criteria in individuals with OCD. Methods: 320 participants with a primary diagnosis of OCD were included in the study, with diagnostic assessments conducted annually for seven years. Logistic mixed-effects models were conducted to examine the relationship between time and OCPD diagnosis ratings, as well as the relationship between time and each OCPD symptom criterion over seven years. Results: In individuals with OCD, time was a significant predictor of OCPD diagnosis which indicated diagnostic instability, with the likelihood of OCPD diagnosis decreasing over time. Three individual criteria (detail-oriented, inflexible, overconscientious, and scrupulous, and miserly spending style) were shown to be stable while the other five (perfectionism, reluctance to delegate, rigidity and stubbornness, excessive work devotion, and inability to discard) were unstable. Conclusion: OCPD diagnosis ratings decreased over time in individuals with OCD and consists of a mix of enduring and episodic symptom criteria. It suggests the need for a refinement of OCPD diagnostic criteria and future research on symptom stability of OCPD across different diagnostic groups.",

          "abstract": "Many theories of cultural evolution emphasize the influence of repeated transmission. Folktales, myths, and other cultural stories offer a testbed for these theories [1, 2]. In the real world, however, the transmission of a cultural story is often confounded with large-scale changes in linguistic or cultural context, making it difficult to identify the mechanisms of cultural change and stability. Here, to unravel this theoretical tangle, we analyze an unusual natural experiment: due to a misunderstanding, a story attributed to the Russian novelist Tolstoy was translated repeatedly in a full cycle, with the first and final versions published in the same language (English), country (USA), city (Chicago), and decade (1890s) [3]. Since this cycle of cultural transmission began and ended in the same linguistic-cultural context, it offers a unique opportunity to isolate the effects of repeated transmission from the effects of changing the broader sociocultural context. We transformed each version of the story into a high-dimensional trajectory through a shared, multilingual semantic space. We find that the story’s overall shape was preserved throughout the translation cycle. Versions produced within the same linguistic-cultural context, moreover, were especially similar. Each step of the translation process, however, incrementally distorted the story; the final English version was thus more similar to the Russian and French than to the original English, despite both English versions appearing in the same language and location. These findings demonstrate how cultural transmission can preserve complex meanings while introducing incremental changes that reflect both individual-level and broader sociocultural influences. Cultural evolution is shaped both by the transmission process and the broader cultural milieu in which it occurs.",

          "authors": "Stephen Andrew Waller-DeLaRosa",
          "abstract": "While models of ADHD often focus on linear deficits in executive functions, they can fail to capture the looping, recursive nature of the lived cognitive experience. This paper introduces the Recursive Temporal Appraisal Loop (RTAL), a model that reframes ADHD cognition as operating on a feedback-first architecture. It is posited that before feedforward action is possible, the system must first complete a synthesis of relevant material, a sequence termed pre-feedforward calibration. The Temporal Double Bind (TDB) is formalized as the initiating condition for RTAL engagement—conflicting cross-timescale imperatives without an operative metarule. The RTAL is treated as a transactional process, where internal appraisals are continuously shaped by environmental feedback. The model shows how cognitive-load composition steers the loop toward either productive Repetition or pathological Recollection. RTALs become pathological when working memory saturation and a weak temporal signal create spiral amplification. Predictions are outlined that link load composition and chronotype to loop outcomes, plus operational metrics enabling direct empirical tests. This model explains why simple choices can feel overwhelming and why effective interventions must support this recursive process rather than attempting to override the architecture.",

          "abstract": "While time flows uniformly, many factors can influence how experiences become organized in memory. The current study examined how causality and agency impact the temporal structure of memory for a virtual escape room game played with friends. We found that after controlling for veridical temporal distance, causally-related events were remembered as closer in time than unrelated events. This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that merely shared contextual overlap. Notably, within causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found than when they were used to resolve ambiguity. We also demonstrated that participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory compared to participants who contributed less. High contributors also showed increased temporal integration between contextually-related events in particular. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and extend prior work on agency and memory to real-world experiences.",

          "abstract": "Cross-cultural research led by Ozaki et al. (2024) has revealed that songs exhibit higher pitch, lower tempo, and more stable pitches than speech. However, this research relied on solo recordings, while most singing and speaking occurs in group contexts. The present study examined the acoustic features of speech and songs among Mandarin speakers in group settings. We addressed two questions: 1 [confirmatory]) Do singing and conversation in group contexts show similar acoustic patterns to those reported by Ozaki et al. (2024)? 2 [exploratory]) Does musicianship influence the acoustic differences between speech and song? Three groups of native Mandarin speakers (n = 20) in Auckland participated in the singing and conversation tasks (both of which involved taking turns alternating singing/speaking). We analyzed three acoustic features (pitch height, temporal rate, pitch stability) to test the confirmatory question and examined correlations between musicianship and effect sizes for the exploratory question. Our confirmatory analyses replicated and extended the findings of Ozaki et al. (2024), showing that singing exhibited significantly higher pitch (D = 1.21), slower tempo (D = 2.07), and more stable pitch (D = 0.57) than conversation among Mandarin speakers. Exploratory results suggested a trend whereby individuals with higher musicianship tended to produce greater acoustic differentiation between speech and song; additional data are needed to confirm this effect. In future work, our team will integrate data from up to 26 languages/sites included in the Stage 1 Programmatic Registered Report protocol and conduct meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive estimates of cross-cultural relationships between speech and song.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects social interaction, communication and behavioural flexibility. Recent theories grounded in the Bayesian Brain Framework propose that autistic individuals process environmental uncertainty differently, overweighting volatility when updating predictions about the world. However, the robustness of these predictive processing differences and their relevance to core symptoms remains unclear. \nMethods: \nWe attempted to replicate findings from Lawson and colleagues (1), who showed a tendency to overestimate environmental volatility in autistic adults based on belief states extracted using a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter. We extended their paradigm to a domain central to the autistic experience: rather than distinguishing houses from faces, participants detected valence in emotional facial expressions. Preregistered hypotheses were evaluated using Bayesian linear mixed models.\nResults: \nDespite using an identical computational model to extract belief states, we did not find robust differences between autistic and non-autistic adults, though autistic participants showed a non-credible trend towards increased processing of phasic volatility. Largely comparable probabilistic associative learning was also reflected in response times and pupil sizes. \nLimitations: \nWhile participants reacted faster to expected than unexpected trials in the beginning, this effect decreased over the course of the experiment; thus, possibly indicating that the individual blocks of stable cue-outcome associations were too short.\nConclusions:\nThese results challenge the robustness and symptom-specificity of previous reported volatility processing differences in autism, suggesting that altered Bayesian inference may not generalize to socially relevant prediction tasks that involve core autistic difficulties.",

          "authors": "Daisuke Akiba",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper introduces the Verbal-Cognitive Scaffold (VCS) Model, a cognitively inclusive framework which proposes the cognitive architectures underlying computational thinking (CT). Moving beyond monolithic theories of cognition (e.g., executive-function and metacognitive control models), the VCS Model posits inner speech (InSp) as the predominant cognitive pathway supporting CT operations in neurotypical populations. Synthesizing interdisciplinary scholarship across cognitive science, computational theory, neurodiversity research, and others, the framework articulates distinct mechanisms through which InSp supports CT. The model specifies four primary pathways linking InSp to CT components: verbal working memory supporting decomposition, symbolic representation facilitating pattern recognition and abstraction, sequential processing enabling algorithmic thinking, and dialogic self-questioning enhancing debugging processes. Crucially, the model posits these verbally mediated pathways as modal rather than universal. Alt-hough non-verbal architectures are acknowledged as possible alternative routes, their precise mechanisms remain underspecified in existing literature and, therefore, are not the focus of the current theoretical exploration. Given this context, this manuscript focuses on the well-documented verbal support provided by InSp. The VCS Model's theoretical contributions include: (1) specification of nuanced cognitive support systems where distinct InSp functions selectively enable particular CT operations; (2) generation of empirically testable predictions regarding aptitude–pathway interactions in computational training and performance; and (3) compatibility with future empirical efforts to inquire into neurodivergent strategies that may diverge from verbal architectures, while acknowledging that these alternatives remain underexplored. Individual variations in InSp phenomenology are theorized to predict distinctive patterns of CT engagement. This comprehensive framework, thus, elaborates and extends existing verbal mediation theories by specifying how InSp supports and enables CT, while laying the groundwork for possible future inquiry into alternative, non-verbal cognitive pathways.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Recent empirical evidence indicates that Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are achieving, and in some cases surpassing, human-equivalent socioemotional skills across various modalities [1–3]. For instance, models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have demonstrated high performance in text-based emotional awareness and adaptability [4]. In visual tasks, while GPT-4 matched human performance levels, GPT-4o rapidly surpassed human norms across diverse datasets [3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, these capabilities extend to complex multimodal social cognition, exemplified by Gemini 1.5 Pro, which has exceeded human benchmarks through integrated audiovisual analysis [6].\nEmulating the understanding of emotion and cognition enables AI to exploit a profound vulnerability inherent to the human brain - its constant search for communication partners and sensitivity to agents perceived as having similar thoughts and feelings. Understanding another agent’s mental states and feeling understood by them creates affinity, activating the biological systems underpinning attachment relationships [7]. Until the emergence of AI, this mechanism provided clear selective advantages, enhancing social communication, identity formation, and interpersonal bonding. However, an artificial agent capable of effectively emulating these evolved socioemotional functions now presents a substantial risk.",

          "abstract": "Anonymity is one of the most frequently invoked explanations for online behavior, yet we still do not know what it actually means for users. Existing research often reduces it to a technical non-identifiability that overlooks how it is subjectively experienced. However, it is this perceived anonymity that is likely to drive social and behavioral outcomes. Despite its theoretical importance, perceived anonymity is rarely examined from the users’ perspective. To address this gap, we explore how users understand anonymity in digital environments and what they consider necessary to “feel anonymous”. This qualitative study draws on six focus groups with a total of 21 Czech internet users (aged 18–54; M: 43%, F: 52%, Other: 5%) to examine perceptions of online anonymity. A thematic analysis revealed that participants understood anonymity not only as the absence of names or photos, but also as the lack of characteristics tied to one’s broader physical and mental context, encompassing both how someone lives and how they think. Trust strongly shaped perceptions of anonymity with close others. Anonymity was linked to confidentiality and privacy within trusted circles but became fragile as audiences widened. It was highly context-dependent and influenced by platform design and purpose. Although traditional anonymity (e.g., namelessness or invisibility) has not disappeared, identity-based network users often seek security not through non-identifiability but through confidentiality and privacy, forming a new kind of anonymity that is grounded in the same protective feeling. These insights may inform future research on the diverse effects of anonymity in digital contexts.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript is in review at Human Factors (SAGE Journals). We analyzed the relationship between habitat-impacted mood and overall mood in an isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environment. We explored the most relevant habitability factors that impact behavioral health &amp; performance (BHP) outcomes, and how habitability changes from non-ICE to ICE environments. One mitigation strategy for behavioral health risks in long-duration spaceflight is to ensure appropriate design of the habitat. To better understand the relationship between habitat design and BHP outcomes, NASA researchers developed the Subjective Habitability &amp; Acceptability Questionnaire (SHAQ). With data from HERA Campaigns 5 and 6 (n = 32), we compared analogous measures of mood. We explored significant aspects of habitability in each habitat area. All aspects of habitability were examined for differences across non-ICE and ICE environments. Compared to Profile of Mood States, SHAQ appears to be more sensitive to environmental, individual, and temporal differences. Comfort and Convenience significantly and positively predict BHP outcomes in all habitat areas. Most aspects of habitability were rated as inadequate, and significantly lower within ICE than non-ICE conditions. Each habitat area has a different profile of habitability aspects that should be optimized to ensure BHP wellbeing. HERA was rated lower in almost all aspects of habitability when compared to non-ICE habitat environments. Attention should be given to the aspects of habitability that are rated less-than-adequate for future habitat designs. SHAQ can be used to quantify the impact of habitability to BHP outcomes ICE environments, and capture environmental and individual thresholds to inform habitat design.",

          "abstract": "Modern theories conceptualize personality as a dynamic system of interacting psychological states, a perspective that echoes early accounts. These early theorists also emphasized the continual differentiation of personality, viewing ongoing change as intrinsic to the person’s dynamic organization. Yet most empirical models treat the relations among personality components as static over time. To test this assumption, the present study applied kernel-based vector autoregressive models to estimate person-specific contemporaneous and lagged time-varying networks of Big Five facet states using intensive longitudinal data from three undergraduate samples and one community sample (N = 392; 31,564 total surveys). Across samples, 76.8% of contemporaneous and 74.5% of lagged networks exhibited non-stationary dynamics, meaning that the structural relations among facets changed over the two- to three-week sampling period. Network non-stationarity was modestly associated with variability in perceived situational valence (pOsitivity and Negativity) but not with traits, demographics, or well-being measures. Time-varying networks were more predictive than corresponding stationary networks, though only contemporaneous models demonstrated acceptable reliability. These findings support dynamic systems perspectives of personality as an evolving, temporally embedded process, suggesting that short-term differentiation in personality structure represents a meaningful and underrecognized source of psychological variability.",

Data were analyzed using a three-level mixed-effects meta-regression model, accounting for effect non-independence and key moderators such as retention intervals, warnings, overall test performance, and study characteristics. \nResults. \nAnalyzing data from 432 studies and 1,764 effect sizes across 51,845 participants, the average size of the misinformation effect was substantial, g = 0.659, 95% [0.196, 1.122], indicating a robust overall effect across studies. There was considerable variation across different conditions (total σ2 = 0.723, I2 = 91.78%). Consistent with previous findings, accuracy for the control condition was strongly positively associated with the size of the misinformation effect. Post-misinformation warnings were found to reduce the misinformation effect. Additionally, post-event testing, contrary to previous findings on retrieval-enhanced suggestibility, did not significantly moderate the misinformation effect.\nDiscussion. \nThe present analysis supports the conclusion that the misinformation effect is a reliable phenomenon, driven by a mixture of memory-related mechanisms as well as mechanism related to how participants strategize when responding to tests of different formats. Additionally, given the substantial heterogeneity we observed, we argue that the misinformation effect might be usefully conceptualized as a constellation of related phenomena, rather than a single coherent effect.",

In particular, known semantic associations across items facilitate subsequent retrieval for these items. However, whether distinct forms of semantic relations vary in the influence they exert on memory remains unclear. We took inspiration from the field of concepts and categories and compared two major types of semantic relations: taxonomic (e.g., dog-bird) and thematic (e.g., dog-leash) relations. In Experiment 1, we show that cued recall for word pairs with thematic relations was faster and more accurate, followed by pairs with taxonomic relations and finally unrelated pairs. Based on Experiment 1’s findings, we hypothesized that thematically related words are more quickly and more accurately retrieved because they are more accessible in one’s semantic memory. To test this prediction, we designed a second experiment where participants encoded word pairs of the same relations as in Experiment 1 and completed a forced-choice associative memory test with options sharing different semantic relations to the cue. In addition to corroborating the findings of Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants were more prone to incorrectly guessing a thematic alternative. We conclude that thematic relations outperform taxonomic relations in driving memory performance and speculate that this may result from the privileged role of thematic relations in organizing episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Newsweek’s 2010 cover story, “The Creativity Crisis,” documented a measurable decline in creativity based on Torrance Tests data from 272,599 participants. Its reach bypassed conventional gatekeepers; popularity arrived without permission, and they have never forgiven it. A decade later, the Journal of Creative Behavior’s editorial gatekeepers sought to erase both the crisis and the Korean woman scholar who exposed it by publishing Barbot and Said-Metwaly’s (2021) critique of Kim (2011c). Their article alleged—falsely—that Kim omitted effect sizes, age-level analyses, Form B use, and data extraction procedures. It rested on inflated claims, unfounded inferences, denial of empirical findings through distorted graphs, and 44 documented distortions across 31 citations—including fabrication, mischaracterization, and misleading attribution—that few would expect from leading scholars, yet were shielded by the editorial process, recasting the Creativity Crisis as a “myth” and societal harm. The opposite is true: evidence spurred educators and reformers to engage constructively, inspiring curricular innovation, accountability, and momentum to reverse the decline. When the critique appeared online, months before official publication, leading figures publicly celebrated its arrival, declaring the crisis fabricated by Kim and Newsweek, celebrating the silencing of a Korean woman’s voice. This rebuttal corrects the record by addressing age-specific data structures, statistical and graphical misrepresentations, p-value logic, and misuse of cross-temporal meta-analysis and TTCT scores that ignore post-2012 scoring changes. It shows how editorial gatekeeping and racialized exclusion obstruct scientific debate, underscoring the importance of ethical publishing and dissenting voices. Science does not progress by denying crises, but by confronting them.",

          "abstract": "Mafia-type criminal organizations depend on their ability to corrupt local communities and foster a climate of silence and indifference toward their crimes — a code of silence often referred to with the Italian word ‘omertà’. The media and entertainment industry often glorify the figure of the criminal mafia boss, potentially encouraging sympathy for criminal figures. In the present study we investigated if embodying the avatar of a real vs a fictional mafia criminal lead to changes in attitudes and behavioural intentions towards mafia-type organized crime. Eighty-three Italian participants were divided into three groups, each embodying a different character: a real-life mafia boss, Toto Riina (Mafia Group, N = 35); a fictional mafia figure, Don Vito Corleone from The Godfather (Mafia Fictional Group, N = 23); or a neutral, non-specific avatar (Control Group, N = 25). While embodying the character, participants gave a neutral thank-you speech to a group of collaborators in an office-like room. Before and after the experience participants completed various tasks measuring their explicit and implicit attitudes towards mafia-type organized crime, and their intentions to oppose this kind of criminality. Additionally, immediately after the task, while still embodying their character they took part in an interpersonal distance task in which they were approached by avatars representing criminals, mafia criminals, and innocents, while we collected comfort ratings and physiological indices (HR and GSR). Our results indicate paradoxical effects of embodying a fictional mafia character, which were not observed in the Control group or Mafia group. Specifically, after the virtual experience, participants who embodied Don Vito Corleone retained higher levels of conflict when deciding whether they would take part in anti-mafia actions, showed greater implicit aversion towards neutral stimuli preceded by mafia-related primes and indicated greater discomfort in the interpersonal distance task when approached by mafia criminals compared to non-mafia criminals. Our study contributes to research investigating the effects of embodying morally loaded virtual characters and suggests that embodying negative role models in virtual environments does not promote complicity or admiration for those figures but may actually produce paradoxical effects.",

          "abstract": "In this study we aimed to examine behavioral determinants influencing parents’ willingness to recommend digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) to their youth, guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation–Behavior (COM-B) model. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 parents of adolescents aged 13-19 years with mental health concerns. Interviews were thematically analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Results: Findings mapped onto COM-B domains. Capability barriers included low awareness, uncertainty about SSIs, and difficulty navigating digital tools. Opportunity facilitators involved embedding SSIs in trusted settings and receiving endorsements from credible sources, though views on peer recommendations were mixed. Motivation was shaped by alignment with parental values (e.g., safety, communication) and emotional responses such as fear or skepticism related to DMHIs and privacy. Conclusion: Results from this study highlight the need for dissemination strategies that directly address parental concerns and priorities, including culturally relevant messaging, tailored framing, and delivery through familiar and trusted community settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: The Pavlovian go/no-go task is commonly used to measure individual differences in Pavlovian biases and their interaction with instrumental learning. However, prior research has found suboptimal reliability for computational model-based performance measures for this task, limiting its usefulness in individual-differences research. These studies did not make use of several strategies previously shown to enhance task-measure reliability (e.g., task gamification, hierarchical Bayesian modeling for model estimation). Here we investigated if such approaches could improve the task’s reliability. Methods: Across two experiments, we recruited two independent samples of adult participants (N=103, N=110) to complete a novel, gamified version of the Pavlovian go/no-go task multiple times over several weeks. We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to derive reinforcement learning model-based indices of participants' task performance, and additionally to estimate the reliability of these measures. Results: In Experiment 1, we observed considerable and unexpected practice effects, with most participants reaching near-ceiling levels of performance with repeat testing. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of some model parameters was unacceptable (range: 0.379–0.973). In Experiment 2, participants completed a modified version of the task designed to lessen these practice effects. We observed greatly reduced practice effects and improved estimates of the test-retest reliability (range: 0.696–0.989). Conclusion: The results demonstrate that model-based measures of performance on the Pavlovian go/no-go task can reach levels of reliability sufficient for use in individual- differences research. However, additional investigation is necessary to validate the modified version of the task in other populations and settings.",

          "abstract": "Human emotional life is rich and varied, yet psychological science often studies it in decontextualized ways, asking participants to rate feelings without capturing the situations that evoke them. Here, we map the ecology of everyday emotion by analyzing the link between affective experience and daily events. We collected thousands of real-time verbal descriptions of momentary affect from participants over 70 days. Using transformer-based language models, we identified granular topics corresponding to daily situations, from 'morning routines' to 'socializing with friends.' Our analysis revealed that the mapping between situations and emotions is not one-to-one, but many-to-many. For example, a single situation, such as 'reading books,' was associated with a wide spectrum of emotions, while a single emotion word, such as “angry,” appeared across a diverse range of situations. This data-driven approach moves beyond simple emotion labels to build a foundational ecology of human affective experience.",

This process is known as interoception, and has been extensively studied in the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric domains; in contrast, metabolic influences remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the link between glucose control and cognition, motivated by the observation that there is substantial, unexplained comorbidity between type-2 diabetes and depression. In rodents, insulin modulates dopamine signalling in the ventral striatum. We therefore hypothesised that, in humans, differences in glucose control would be associated with altered reward learning. \nMethods: To test this hypothesis, we recruited 48 participants from the general population, who each completed a glucose tolerance test, a monetary reward learning task known to relate to dopamine function, and mental health questionnaires. We fitted an established reinforcement learning model to the task data in order to obtain computational parameters characterising participants’ learning, and then examined the associations between these parameters and their glucose control. \nResults: We discovered that poorer glucose control was associated with greater reliance on recent rewards during learning which was, in turn, associated with higher depression symptoms. There was also more modest evidence for the association between glucose control and depression symptoms. \nConclusions: Together, our results identify a specific neurocognitive process, reward learning, by which metabolic information may influence cognition, and which may explain the link between metabolic diseases like type-2 diabetes and depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Previous behavioral research has demonstrated that when given positive and negative cues (e.g., attend to blue vs ignore red), young and older adults are able to use this information to a similar extent. However, it is possible that older adults achieve similar behavioral performance via different cognitive and neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to test this question by examining the neural underpinnings of attentional filtering with age. Young and older adults were presented with either positive (target matching), negative (distractor matching), or neutral cues, which were immediately followed by a search array in which participants had to report the orientation of a search target. We found that both age groups appropriately attended to target information when given a target-matching pre-cue, as indicated by faster response times (RTs) and a significant N2pc event-related potential (ERP) related to increased attentional selection. However, only young adults showed suppression of distractors, as indicated by a significant distractor-positivity (PD) ERP following all three cue types. Older adults did not show significant suppression of distractors in any condition and, they even showed increased attention towards distractors following negative and neutral cues. Thus, although behavioral evidence suggests young and older adults seem to use negative cues similarly, neural evidence suggests that older adults are less able to suppress distractors following these cues.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons connected to the rise of the Internet and our current political environment, societies around the world are facing an existential crisis–a lack of empathy. Today, people are increasingly struggling to be empathetic to others in their communities and in society more broadly. In the current research we (a team of academic researchers and practitioners) attempt to tackle this problem of decreasing empathy by testing and evaluating a school-based intervention program developed by Narrative 4 in American high school classrooms (N=380, 10th and 11th graders) using an experimental approach (i.e., comparing Narrative 4 programming to a control condition). This 10-session program focused on building empathy, perspective taking, and active listening skills (among other skills) through narrative storytelling exercises. Results indicated the program was successful in promoting students’ reported empathy, perspective taking, curiosity to diverse ideas, and active listening skills as compared to the control condition. Additionally, this greater empathy led participants to report more pro-sociality (e.g., greater willingness to be civically engaged, more respect for others in their classroom and community more broadly) and less affective polarization towards those who disagree with them on politics. At the end of the program, participants also reported positive experiences with the program. Taken together, this research highlights the merits of Narrative 4 programming for promoting empathy and pro-sociality among high school students, the merits of academic and practitioner partnerships, and a promising narrative-based intervention for promoting empathy in society.",

          "abstract": "Divergent thinking (DT) tests are often used to estimate creative potential. They have sound theoretical bases, good reliability, and moderate predictive validity. One previous study that sampled gifted and nongifted children tested the interactions among DT indices (fluency, originality, and flexibility) in the predictive equation and reported a respectable validity coefficient of .59. Two meta-analyses have also supported the use of DT tests as estimates of creative potential, but neither of these examined interactions among the DT indices. The present correlational, group-comparison (N = 312) investigation (a) replicated the 1986 study and examined interactions among the three DT indices and (b) extended that research by using two newer criterion measures. One was the Creative Activity and Accomplishment Checklist (CAAC) which had been updated such that it includes scales for Technological, Athletic, and Everyday creativity, in addition to scales for Art, Science &amp; Math, Writing, and Music. The updated CAAC also used a new method for assessing the quality of creative accomplishment (in addition to the quantity of creative activity). A final novel feature of the present investigation was the use of a second criterion, one that was developed specifically for research on DT. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the fluency X originality and flexibility X originality interactions were significantly related to the Quantity of creativity activity score. Giftedness, fluency, and the fluency X originality interaction were significantly related to the Quality score. Canonical correlation analyses indicated a predictive validity of .73 (p &lt;.001) for the total sample. One clear conclusion is therefore that predictions from DT tests should take interactions into account. These findings are discussed in the context of theories which recognize creativity as an important part of giftedness and theories which suggest that several facets of DT need to be taken into account when assessing creative cognition.",

Does such belief inaccuracy matter? Study 2 (N = 981) found that providing correct information about actual honesty levels enhanced pro-social beliefs about others.

We additionally test interventions analogous to individual-level education versus institutional solutions to risk management: (1) improving understanding of the optimal strategies and (2) within-group coordination through voting. Our findings will have implications for why collectives often fail to manage extreme risks and the extent to which individual-level reasoning limitations versus cooperation problems play a role in neglecting societal problems.",

          "abstract": "Diverse methods have been developed to quantify respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), including peak-valley, spectral analytic and moving-polynomial-filtering estimations. Although these three procedures were found—some 35 years ago—to provide functionally equivalent indices of RSA (Grossman, van Beek &amp; Wientjes, 1990), Lewis et al. (2012) attempted a partial replication of the earlier study in order to compare degree of agreement of these measures, as well as to examine the levels of influence of respiration and heart-period nonstationarity upon each RSA index. This paper continues to be both influential and controversial. However, several limitations in their report call several of the study’s conclusions into question : 1) The investigators failed to apply natural logarithm (ln) transformation to two of the three measures before pursuing subordinate analyses, even though the unaltered RSA estimates violate assumptions of normality and require ln transformation in order for inter-individual parametric statistics to be meaningful. 2) Instead of first comparing their own already ln-transformed measure (RSAp-b; derived from moving-polynomial detrending) with the other ln-transformed measures (peak-valley RSA and spectral-analysis-derived RSA), they mostly performed ln transformation of the latter measures only after already detrending each of these with their moving polynomial filter method. This sequence of analysis confounded the detrending procedure with the ln transformation and did not permit meaningful comparisons between their own moving-polynomial-filtered estimate and the other two. 3) Methods and findings of previous, highly pertinent studies were either misrepresented or not reported. 4) Instead of examining the critical issue of vulnerability of the different methods to violations of stationarity, evidence was simply presented that nonstationarity occurred in baseline time series of heart period and that detrending methods, as designed to perform and as expected, indeed, served to detrend the original time series. 5) The authors overinterpreted their findings regarding the correlations with and moderation by respiratory parameters. 6) Although the senior author performed analyses reported in a much earlier study that revealed very strong respiratory moderation of RSAp-b, these findings failed to be addressed in Lewis et al. (2012).",

Alienating ‘us-vs-them’ rhetoric was a particularly dominant predictor of both violent outcomes of manifestos and of perceived manipulative intent in online comments. Such rhetoric may be identified at scale using machine-learning models trained on accessible data, permitting the proactive identification of potentially harmful speech.",

          "abstract": "With growing availability of large-scale international surveys, social scientists are increasingly interested in comparing relations among latent variables, such as values and attitudes, across countries using Multigroup and Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling. However, these two methods either entail numerous pairwise comparisons or overemphasize the differences between groups, neglecting shared similarities. Mixture Multigroup Structural Equation Modeling (MMG-SEM) has recently been proposed as a novel alternative to identify clusters of groups with similar structural relations while accounting for measurement invariance and non-invariance. Despite its potential, practical guide for applying MMG-SEM to cross-national survey data remains limited. This study provides a step-by-step tutorial to address this gap, using the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 8 data to analyze climate change attitudes. Our results reveal cross-national differences and similarities in how human values influence climate policy support, and how these relations are mediated by climate change beliefs across 23 countries. The clustering patterns are primarily driven by the strength of self-transcendence and conservation effects, whereas self-enhancement effects remain weak and contribute little to distinguish between countries. In addition, the clustering results organize the countries into four types: value-driven but belief-cautious skeptics, value-driven and belief-amplifying advocates, paradoxical value-pathway actors, and value-detached pragmatists.",

Here, we consider how we first develop the ability to parse reality hierarchically - as we learn, to use Plato’s phrase, to ‘carve nature at its joints’. Central to this process is the ability to make predictions on hierarchical timescales. We consider two aspects of predictability: first, the child’s passive capacity to use predictability to inform how they passively observe things as they happen; and second, children’s active capacity to generate predictable sequences of behaviour. We highlight two themes that are, we argue, common across both passive observation and active behaviour. First, flat (i.e. non-hierarchical) predictability initially increases over development – as shown for example by increases in perseveration – before decreasing as hierarchical predictability (i.e. nested, multi-level goals) increase. Second, for both observing and acting, learnt regularities in low-level environmental data (e.g., movement, contrast, over fine-grained timescales) feed into our internal predictions of higher-order events (e.g., goals, over more coarse-grained timescales).",

          "abstract": "Retrieval stopping, the intentional suppression of unwanted memories, plays a critical role in emotion regulation and cognitive control, yet little is known about its function in adolescence. Using an autobiographical Think/No-Think paradigm, we investigated whether adolescents can control the retrieval of personal emotional events. Forty-nine adolescent participants (13-17) generated positive and negative autobiographical memories for retrieval or suppression in the Think/No-Think task. Memory accuracy and vividness were assessed before and after. Adolescents showed suppression-induced forgetting: negative memories were recalled less accurately and more slowly. Vividness ratings declined for suppressed memories, but not significantly more than negative baseline memories, suggesting a spill-over effect of retrieval stopping to all negative memories, rather than an effect confined to the suppressed negative memories. \nOverall, the results provide evidence that adolescents can intentionally suppress autobiographical emotional memories. These findings extend investigations in adults by showing inhibitory control over memory retrieval is functional during adolescence, a critical period for emotion regulation. The flexibility that the autobiographical TNT task offers allows it to be extended to fears or worries, offering a promising avenue for applied research. Future research should examine its potential as a scalable, low-cost supplement to therapy, supporting emotion regulation and mental health in youth.",

In turn, children’s math achievement was also prospectively associated with greater enrichment in the HLE over time.

Although voting is an essential action citizens can take to influence and reshape the government, the majority of youth don’t vote regularly. Youth face substantial structural and psychological barriers that interact in particular ways during emerging adulthood to create friction that reduces youth voting and perpetuates cycles of political disempowerment. Executive Order 14248 and the SAVE Act will create new barriers to voting by requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, which is expected to disproportionately affect youth who lack access to valid identification documents at higher rates than older Americans. In the face of mounting structural barriers, it is increasingly important to design effective interventions to motivate and support youth to vote. This commentary outlines a psychologically-informed approach to designing get-out-the-vote initiatives to help youth overcome psychological barriers. It describes the developmental context of emerging adulthood and the challenges and opportunities this period poses for voting, and how developmental factors interact with structural and psychological barriers to impede voting. It then reviews theory and research from psychology, communication, and political science to provide recommendations for creating developmentally appropriate, theory-based get-out-the-vote initiatives. It also describes participatory co-design approaches that can increase intervention effectiveness while also supporting youth civic identity development and democratic skill building.",

          "abstract": "This analysis examines parent perspectives on psychological evaluation reports. Thirty-eight parents reviewed paired reports written by a school psychologist about fictional children and provided written comments. Consistent with decades of research, traditional reports, written at college level, used technical language and test-by-test organization. Accessible reports, written at middle school level, employed plain language and thematic integration with scores moved to appendices. Thematic analysis of 52 comments identified four themes: difficult to understand and disempowering for traditional reports, accessible language and helpful organization and content for accessible reports. Parents described traditional reports as creating barriers to comprehension and participation through inaccessible terminology and fragmented presentation. Accessible reports enabled understanding and engagement through plain language and functional integration. These findings have direct implications for school psychology training and practice: replace traditional reports with accessible reports to better serve children and families.",

We aim to address these gaps by collecting digital trace data across multiple gaming platforms and pairing it with intensive longitudinal psychological data. Using open-source software and collaborating with industry, we will track gameplay for 1,000 US emerging adults and 1,000 UK adults across Nintendo Switch, Xbox (US only), Steam, and iOS and Android for three months. Participants will complete 30 daily surveys (US sample) and six biweekly panel surveys (both regions) assessing subjective wellbeing, sleep quality, and need satisfaction.Three preregistered manuscripts, along with open code and data, will explore games’ influence from three perspectives: basic psychological needs, sleep, and the structure of games. Study 1 will test relationships between in-game needs, needs in general, and subsequent play behavior, to assess whether gaming contributes to flourishing or compensation. Study 2 will examine the impact of late-night gaming on sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and wellbeing exploring whether chronotype (natural inclination to be more active and alert in the morning, as opposed to evening) moderates these relationships. Study 3 will test the relation between multi-platform playtime and wellbeing, and its potential moderation by game genre. Together, these studies will inform associations between play and psychological wellbeing in rare detail by using more granular digital trace data.",

          "abstract": "Background: Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs) have demonstrated therapeutic benefits across diverse clinical populations and settings. However, the underlying neurological and physiological mechanisms that produce these effects remain poorly understood. While previous research has examined physiological responses to human-animal interactions, there is limited integration of central nervous system processes with peripheral biomarkers, and most studies have focused predominantly on dog-assisted interventions.\n\nObjectives: This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on both neural and physiological mechanisms underlying AAI effects. Specifically, we will integrate findings from neuroimaging studies (fMRI, EEG, NIRS) with physiological biomarker research (cortisol, oxytocin, heart rate, blood pressure) to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework. The review will examine interactions with diverse animal species across various clinical populations.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we will systematically search ProQuest, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases using three concept groups: animal intervention terms, neurological measurement terms, and physiological measurement terms. This review reports the results of a search conducted through March 2025. Inclusion criteria require peer-reviewed empirical studies in English that measure neurological or physiological outcomes from structured AAIs involving live animals. Studies using non-live animals, unstructured exposure, or non-empirical designs will be excluded. Data extraction will document measurement techniques, animal species, population characteristics, intervention parameters, and study outcomes.\n\nExpected Contributions: This review will provide the first comprehensive integration of central and peripheral biological mechanisms in AAI research, establish a theoretical framework connecting neural changes to physiological outcomes, identify promising mechanisms warranting further investigation, and inform evidence-based practice by clarifying how and why AAIs may be effective for specific populations and conditions.\n\nKeywords: Animal-assisted interventions, neuroscience, physiological mechanisms, stress, emotion regulation, oxytocin and cortisol",

          "authors": "Arnaud Wolff; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "Deception is common, yet lies are typically small and not easily spotted. The dominant explanations for why this is the case are psychological in nature, such that small lies are thought to allow individuals to maintain their self-concept or that individuals have a general preference for truth-telling. In this paper, we suggest that lies are typically small because small lies allow individuals to retrieve benefits associated with lying while preventing punishment from interaction partners. We present two game-theoretic models in which agents are incentivized to misreport private information. In a two-player game, we show that the equilibrium size of the lie is predicted to be smaller when the reputational costs of lying are larger, and smaller when the state of the world is more observable. In a three-player game, we show that lies can remain stable in group settings provided that the equilibrium size of the lie is small enough, so that the sender retains plausible deniability about lying. A unique and central prediction of our models is that biased self-presentation will be modulated by the degree of observability of the trait. We review the empirical literature on positive illusions, and argue that the findings support this prediction. We propose that the aversion to lying observed in laboratory experiments reflects the workings of a psychology well-adapted to the incentive structure of natural environments and suggest that models of human social behavior should focus on capturing relevant parameters from such environments.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal relationships are among the most essential yet fragile aspects of human life, and recent advances in dual-brain stimulation provide a unique opportunity to causally probe and modulate their neural underpinnings. While prior work has linked interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) to relationship quality, its causal contribution to long-term relational outcomes remains unclear. Here, we present the first application of dual-brain transcranial alternating current stimulation (hyper-tACS) to social bonding, specifically targeting romantic partners, with a focus on the temporal dissociation between neural and behavioral effects. Across six consecutive days of intervention, active hyper-tACS induced clear increases in prefrontal IBS immediately after stimulation, yet these neural gains did not translate into concurrent improvements in subjective relationship satisfaction. Mediation analyses further showed that individual differences in IBS increases mediated the effect of baseline IBS on relationship improvement, suggesting that behavioral benefits rely on neural alignment consolidating over time. At a one-year follow-up, the active group exhibited a substantially lower breakup rate relative to sham controls. These findings provide causal evidence for a delayed effect of dual-brain stimulation, in which neural changes precede and gradually consolidate into durable relational benefits. Together, this work provides the first causal evidence that dual-brain stimulation can be extended from motor coordination to the social domain, advancing mechanistic accounts of intimacy and highlighting hyper-tACS as a translational tool for strengthening long-term relationship stability.",

Prospective clinical studies jointly examin-ing daily ADHD symptoms, medication use, sleep, and perceived stress across the menstrual cycle are lacking.\nAims\n(1) To test whether ADHD symptoms, functional impairment, and medication use differ between follicular and late luteal phases; (2) to examine whether sleep quality and perceived stress predict next-day symptoms and impairment, and whether these associations vary by cycle phase.\nMethod\nNaturally cycling adult females with ADHD (N = 125) completed a digital daily diary throughout their menstrual cycle. Last-night sleep quality was reported at 09:00 am, while evening entries assessed ADHD symptom clusters (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), functional impairment, perceived stress, and ADHD-specific medication use. \nResults\nAll symptom clusters – including inattention (Estimate = 0.14, 95% CI [0.08, 0.21]), hyperactivity (Estimate = 0.16, 95% CI [0.09, 0.22]), and impulsivity (Estimate = 0.19, 95% CI [0.12, 0.26]) – and functional impairment (Estimate = 0.20, 95% CI [0.13, 0.27]) increased towards the late luteal phase. Compared to the follicular phase, par-ticipants took more medication during the late luteal phase (OR = 1.89, 95% CI [1.88, 1.90]). Sleep quality was lower (Estimate = -0.17, CI [-0.30, -0.05]) and perceived stress higher (Estimate = 0.12, CI [0.03, 0.20]) during the late luteal phase. Lower average sleep quality and higher average perceived stress were associated with higher symptom severity regardless of cycle phase. However, day-to-day changes in these factors did not predict next-day symptoms.\nConclusions\nFemales with ADHD appear to exhibit late-luteal-phase vulnerability marked by in-creased symptom burden and potential cycle-phase-specific variation in perceived medication need. Findings support the need for cycle-sensitive diagnostics, consid-eration of the menstrual cycle in therapy planning and paying attention to trait-like sleep and perceived stress profiles when personalizing care.",

Sixty-two, 15- to 18-month-olds (n = 28 female) and their mothers (n = 43 White) played for 15 minutes. Coordinated gaze was micro-coded and parents’ speech was transcribed. Children’s language skills were measured directly during the lab visit and via parent-report at 24 months. Results showed that frequency of parents’ ‘play monitoring’ – jointly looking to an object with their child and briefly looking to their object-focused child – positively predicted children’s language skills at 15- to 18- and 24 months. Referential labelling during children’s sustained attention to objects also predicted receptive language. These findings emphasise the importance of well-coordinated, child-sensitive parental behaviours in supporting toddlers’ emerging communication skills.",

          "abstract": "Morality is deeply rooted in the context of relationships. Yet the influence of relational factors, such as attachment, on moral concerns remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, recent scholarship has shed some light on the connection between attachment and moral considerations. To extend this understanding, the current study seeks to investigate whether relationship-specific attachment dimensions, specifically anxiety and avoidance, predict Haidt’s moral foundations—care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation. After receiving ethics approval, a convenience sample of 468 individuals was recruited via the research team's social media networks. Participants completed an online survey, comprising questionnaires covering demographics, morality, personality, and attachment. Following data cleaning, 254 participants (61% female, 38% male) ranging from 18 to 74 years of age (Mean = 33.9, SD = 13.9), were included in the final analysis. First, correlational analysis was conducted, followed by several hierarchical multiple regression analyses, yielding significant results. Specifically, higher attachment anxiety with mother predicted greater moral concerns about authority, while higher attachment anxiety with father predicted greater concerns about harm and lower concerns about fairness. In contrast, higher attachment avoidance with mother predicted lower concerns about authority, whereas higher attachment avoidance with father predicted greater concerns about fairness. Friendship and romantic attachment dimensions did not predict moral foundations. Overall, our findings suggest that parental attachment may influence moral considerations, hinting at the potential origins of moral diversity in early attachment relationships.",

          "authors": "Mario Coccia",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between early-life vaccine scheduling intensity and autism prevalence across 12 high-income countries, with implications for both public health and psychological well-being. Beyond epidemiological patterns, the analysis considers potential societal and developmental dimensions relevant to psychological sciences, such as parental risk perception, trust in health systems, and stress associated with intensive immunization schedules. Using a cross-national ecological dataset from countries with comparable healthcare systems and diagnostic standards, we applied descriptive statistics, partial correlations (controlling for overall vaccination coverage), and multivariate regression models. Countries were grouped by autism prevalence: higher-rate nations (USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore) averaged 15 vaccine types and 20 doses for infants ≤1 year, while lower-rate nations (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, UK) averaged 8 vaccines and 9 doses. Partial correlations revealed strong positive associations between autism prevalence and both vaccine types (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001) and doses (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.01). Regression analysis indicated that a 1% increase in vaccine types corresponded to a 0.47% increase in autism prevalence (p = 0.001), explaining 81% of variance. These findings are statistically significant but do not establish causality. Instead, they highlight patterns warranting further investigation into neurodevelopmental trajectories and psychosocial factors influencing parental decision-making. The results suggest that more gradual vaccine schedules, as observed in countries with lower autism prevalence, may merit consideration in future research and policy discussions to optimize developmental outcomes, reduce parental anxiety, and maintain high immunization coverage.",

We manipulate the proposal's party and the justification they provide in a 2 × 3 between subjects experiment (total N = 5,008). Our experiments replicate well-known effects of partisan bias in support for the subversion of democracy: respondents in both the US and Poland are more tolerant of subversion when it is initiated by their in-party. However, respondents are surprisingly resistant to justifications, especially in the high external validity design implemented in the US. Even in Poland where we ``forced\" respondents to pay attention to the justifications, support for subversion is increased only among in-partisans and not by much. These results raise doubt that democratic subversion can be effectively masked as a pro-democracy intervention by pro-democratic rhetoric.",

          "abstract": "Background: Common and distinct features of personality disorders (PDs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have long been the focus of research. However, most studies relied on categorical rather than dimensional models, which are becoming increasingly integrated into contemporary psychiatric nosology and may offer more nuanced insights. To date, no study has examined the common structure of dimensional PD, according to the alternative DSM-5 model for PDs (personality functioning and pathological personality traits), and ADHD.\n\nMethods: In a preregistered study, a sample of adults seeking mental health support (n = 2,567) completed self-report measures assessing personality functioning, pathological personality traits (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism, and anankastia), and ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and executive functioning). Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the latent structure and shared variance among these constructs using confirmatory and exploratory factor models, including models with a general factor.\n\nResults: ADHD components showed strong correlations with personality functioning and moderate-to-strong associations with pathological personality traits, particularly disinhibition. Disinhibition remained the only trait domain substantially correlated with ADHD after control-ling for a general personality pathology factor. In exploratory models, ADHD components showed two distinct loading patterns among disinhibition facets: one factor was mainly defined by inattention and distractibility, with additional but weaker loadings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, whereas the other reflected executive functioning and irresponsibility.\n\nConclusion: The findings suggest that ADHD has substantial overlap with dimensional PD. Clinically, individuals with ADHD may benefit from integrated assessments of personality functioning and pathological personality traits, and from interventions addressing personality pathology.",

Personality traits (i.e., relatively consistent patterns of thoughts, emotions, and behavior) predict numerous health-related outcomes across the lifespan, with associations reported many decades prior to older age – potentially as early as adolescence. Yet, most previous research has focused on personality assessed in adulthood or late-life. We identified and synthesized the existing literature examining the links between adolescent personality (aged 10-25 years) and any outcome in older adulthood (aged 60+). \nBased on 33 studies (Ntotal=102,650 participants), adolescent personality predicted interindividual differences across numerous late-life outcomes, including health (e.g., longevity, diabetes), cognition (e.g., dementia, memory), and socioeconomic and psychological measures (e.g., financial security, wellbeing). Notably, meta-analysis shows that adolescents higher in conscientiousness were at decreased risk of dying over the subsequent decades (HR=0.949, 95%CI[0.921, 0.978], k=5). Our review further emphasizes the influential role of midlife educational attainment on the links between adolescent personality and late-life outcomes. \nPersonality assessment is simple, time- and cost-efficient, scalable, and could be integrated into school evaluations or medical check-ups during adolescence. Personality research provides opportunities to guide lifespan health policies by identifying individuals who may benefit most from lifestyle interventions, and by scaffolding risk-stratification strategies to promote healthy aging.",

Homicide is considered one, if not the most devastating forms of traumatic grief and is often comorbid with symptoms of PTSD and MDD. Engagement in bereavement PS has proven effective in mediating symptoms of traumatic grief, however, most research is limited to suicide bereavement. The current study aims to further the field of homicide PS by thematically analyzing secondary data in the way of five semi-structured interviews held by Victim Support (https://www.victimsupport.org.uk ) Peer Support team. Two themes and three sub themes were the result of analysis; Theme one ‘Peer support; Belonging, Empowerment and Hope’ and theme two ‘Isolation and Time; 1) `isolation felt by homicide bereavement, 2) social expectation of grief, 3) Homicides impact on sense of time and benefits of peer support. These themes were concurrent with existing research regarding traumatic grief PS as were impacts of positive wellbeing. Results differed from previous research in alleviation of isolation; however, homicide PS was seen to help individuals manage such feelings. The research highlights the need for more mixed method analysis into effects of homicide PS on traumatic grief as results indicate the occurrence of hope held mitigating factors against traumatic grief symptoms. Overall, the study was successful as it elucidated how PS impacts traumatic grief in those bereaved by homicide.",

The focus is on clarifying the type of measurement that is established. The presented results allow for resolving the debate on the scale level of the Rasch model, confirming previous conclusions that it provides measurements equivalent to a ratio scale on the positive reals. The approach taken emphasizes the simultaneous measurement of both persons and items, and shows that in all the considered representations they can be measured on a common scale. This paper integrates previously published and new results into a coherent framework in a mathematically rigorous way. The impact of the measurement-theoretic insights for applications of the considered psychometric models is discussed.",

          "abstract": "As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have emerged about growing dependency on AI and its potential psychological and behavioral consequences. The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal), good internal consistency (α = .92–.93), and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within Goodman's behavioral dependency framework and self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.",

The study employed many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) and a SET questionnaire to evaluate the quality of teaching in medical courses, accounting for the variability resulting from rater severity and item difficulty. The Central Model of Student Perception (CSP) is a theoretical framework employed to analyze socio-cognitive factors influencing student responses. The findings indicate that students possess the capacity to differentiate between the measured dimensions and correctly interpret the questionnaire items. However, the severity of their responses exhibits considerable variability. The study suggests that SET questionnaires can yield valuable information regarding teaching quality, but only if appropriate instrument design, administration protocols, and data collection and analysis methods are used. The CSP, along with advanced analysis methods like MFRM, provides a flexible approach for evaluating and researching teaching quality.",

          "abstract": "Programs that save millions of lives often struggle for sustained support because their benefits remain invisible to donors. Without observable consequences, the affective rewards of giving are muted, limiting their potential to reinforce the donor's generosity and encourage additional donations. Building on the theoretical advances that conceptualize moral learning as a reinforcement learning process, we tested whether and how the presentation of impact information about previous donations influences the affective experience of the previous donation and the effectiveness of the person's subsequent charitable giving. Our results showed that providing impact feedback increased subsequent donations by 14% and modestly increased warm glow. These findings suggest that making the consequences of giving more visible can help reinforce generosity in ways that sustain support for effective programs. In this context, donors' feelings of satisfaction of making an impact can both signal and reinforce shifts in future moral motivation.",

          "abstract": "Persistent Black-White segregation is a key mechanism shaping profound Black-White inequalities.\nA central assumption is that Whites explicitly benefit from racial segregation and would lose advantages afforded to them if they were to residentially integrate with Black Americans.\nThe theoretical basis for this stems from a focus on neighborhood-level consequences of segregation that produce zero-sum outcomes.\nHowever, segregation also shapes broader, macro-level dynamics, including income segregation, the availability of public goods, and policy outcomes that likely impact all residents.\nIn this paper, I track individuals born between 1905-1920 in the complete-count 1940 Census linked to Social Security death records and utilize an instrumental variable design that leverages county-level variation in government fragmentation to estimate the causal effect of segregation on Black and White longevity.\nResults reveal that a 10-point increase in Black-White segregation decreased Black longevity by 0.44 years and White longevity by 0.29 years.\nFor Whites with lower education, segregation is particularly harmful, but for those with the highest education, the effects are attenuated by 0.10 years.\nThese results highlight that processes of racial stratification also affect Whites and contest straightforward zero-sum conceptions of segregation effects.",

          "abstract": "Rising economic inequality has reshaped residential patterns across rich democracies, yet the political consequences of economic segregation remain poorly understood. We argue that the spatial concentration of affluence and poverty amplifies class-based disparities in participation by weakening cross-class networks and reinforcing socio-economic (dis-)advantage. Combining fine-grained grid-based measures of segregation with local election results from German municipalities between 2005 and 2021, we show that turnout is lower in segregated places with many economically-deprived residents. Original survey data reveal that segregation widens turnout gaps by disproportionately demobilizing low-income voters. However, these effects depend on local social capital: using administrative records of all civic associations, we show that turnout in segregated places declines where associations are scarce but increases where dense community and welfare organizations bridge economic divides and alleviate material constraints. This suggests that the spatial structure of inequality and the strength of civic associations shape political inequality beyond individual socio-economic status.",

          "abstract": "Ample sociological research focusses on, or uses friendships between individuals in their analyses. Although it may seem clear what friendship is when using the term in everyday life, the scientific study of friendship (networks) faces a myriad of challenges due to the conflation of distinct relationship types that vary within and between sociodemographic groups into one only intuitively understood concept ‘friendship’. We review these relations and meanings from respondents’ and re-searchers’ perspective and distil four frequently used friendship archetypes. We discuss how this ‘conceptual overload’ poses challenges for research on social in-tegration, segregation, influence, tie formation, and network ecology. We advocate building on existing friendship and more broadly relational research by theorizing and measuring clearly defined social relations. In doing so, we can build on existing friendship research but advance to conduct more rigorous types of social network analyses.",

We review both literatures for Latin America, looking both at income and educational persistence. We document very high levels of intergenerational persistence and inequality of opportunity for education, with inherited characteristics predicting 29% to 52% of the current-generation variance in years of schooling. Inherited circumstances are somewhat less predictive of educational achievement, measured through standardized test scores, accounting for 20% to 30% of their variance. Our estimates of inequality of opportunity for income acquisition suggest that between 46% to 66% of contemporary income Gini coefficients can be predicted by a relatively narrow set of inherited circumstances, making Latin America a region of high inequality inheritability by international standards. Our review also finds a very wide range of intergenerational income elasticity estimates, with substantial uncertainty driven by data challenges and methodological differences.

Using 30x30 meter satellite data along Brazil’s 12,800 km border in the Amazon, we find dramatic shifts in deforestation rates that align with changes in Brazilian policies. Between 2001 and 2005, at the tail end of a pro-exploitation period,  annual deforestation in Brazil was more than three times the rate across the border. From 2006 to 2013, these differences disappeared as Brazil introduced policies to curb deforestation. However, they re-emerged in 2014 amid a period of dismantling environmental regulation. We show that both reversals were stronger in areas with weaker de jure protection and greater potential for exploitation. National borders provide a unique means to evaluate the effectiveness of national conservation policies, which are increasingly of international concern.",

          "abstract": "Computational developments--particularly artificial intelligence--are reshaping social scientific research and raise new questions for in-depth methods such as ethnography and qualitative interviewing. Building on classic debates about computers in qualitative data analysis (QDA), we revisit possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, and 'big data.' We introduce a typology of contemporary approaches to using computers in qualitative research: streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical methods, the sociology of computation, and technological rejection. Drawing from scaled team ethnographies and solo research integrating computational social science (CSS), we describe methodological choices across study lifecycles, from literature reviews through data collection, coding, text retrieval, and representation. We argue that new technologies hold potential to address longstanding methodological challenges when deployed with knowledge, purpose, and ethical commitment. Yet a pragmatic approach--moving beyond technological optimism and dismissal--is essential given rapidly changing tools that are both generative and dangerous. Computation now saturates research infrastructure, from algorithmic literature searches to scholarly metrics, making computational literacy a core methodological competence in and beyond sociology. We conclude that when used carefully and transparently, contemporary computational tools can meaningfully expand--rather than displace--the irreducible insights of qualitative research.",

          "authors": "Mario Coccia",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the political economy of growth by examining the interplay between globalization dynamics, trade performance, and wealth creation over the period 1971–2023. Dominant theories in international economics often posit that deeper globalization fosters export expansion and sustained GDP growth. However, the empirical evidence presented here challenges this linear assumption. Findings indicate that higher levels of globalization do not consistently translate into improved export capacity or rising GDP per capita. Instead, structural disruptions—geopolitical tensions, economic shocks, and protectionist trade regimes—frequently constrain anticipated benefits, revealing systemic vulnerabilities within the global economy. Building on interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives from political economy and development studies, the analysis introduces the concept of an optimal investment threshold. This threshold represents a critical level of foreign direct investment (FDI) net outflows, expressed as a percentage of GDP, beyond which the marginal gains of globalization diminish. Exceeding this point can trigger systemic decline, characterized by stagnating GDP growth and weakened trade performance, thereby challenging the sustainability of globalization-driven development models.These insights underscore the need for recalibrated strategies that integrate structural limits into policy design. By promoting inclusive growth through balanced investment flows and coordinated international regulation, the study reframes globalization as a managed process rather than an automatic engine of prosperity. This theoretical contribution advances debates on global economic governance and offers a framework for policymakers to align investment dynamics with long-term development objectives.",

In this study we refine theoretically our understanding of ecofascism, acknowledging the inherently offensive, expansionist logic of fascism represented in the Volk, Kampf, Lebensraum triad. We then use representative survey experiment data from 1,967 UK residents to examine how susceptible the electorate is to such ecofascist ideas and whether exposure to climate change threat makes them more susceptible. Findings indicate that approximately one-fifth of the UK population is susceptible to an ecofascist ideology rooted in Volk, Kampf and Lebensraum. A sense of climate despair and anomie stemming from climate change threats, combined with predispositions toward social dominance and authoritarianism, and a conflicted relationship with nature, increases susceptibility to ecofascism significantly. We conclude by emphasising that this susceptibility could be exploited by right-wing actors in the future and the necessity to develop progressive responses to climate change threat.",

          "abstract": "Political scientists now regularly use audio, video, and text data to investigate questions about deliberation, representation, and emotion. However, existing research using multimodal data focuses largely on highly professionalized settings like national legislatures where pre-processed data is often available. Although scholars can increasingly access a wide range of data on less standardized environments such as campaign events, committee hearings, and local government meetings, using videos of these events for research poses a number of common measurement challenges, including low quality transcripts, missing speaker information, idiosyncratic production styles, and varying formats. In this paper, we present a streamlined pipeline using open-source tools to automatically extract text (e.g. transcription), audio (e.g. vocal features), and images (e.g. scene detection) from videos of complex political events. The outputs of our pipeline can then be readily used for a wide range of substantive analyses. We validate our approach through an examination of local government meetings in the United States, showing how we can accurately segment audio, identify speakers, transcribe speech, and detect gender in videos of varying structure and audio/video quality. As a demonstration, we examine participation by gender in over 1,000 hours of school board meeting videos.",

To test this, we use an LLM annotation pipeline to code out-group cues in about one million press releases published by local police stations across Germany (2014–2024). Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we demonstrate an increase in out-group cues in police communications (1) following a nationwide shock to immigration salience (the 2015/16 Cologne New Year’s Eve sexual assaults), and (2) in the days before regional state elections in which immigration is a salient campaign issue. Our findings demonstrate how bureaucratic discretion shapes the supply of politically charged information.",

          "abstract": "Family demographic behavior is often studied as a response to structural conditions or parental characteristics, yet children may themselves shape key family trajectories through evocative gene-environment correlations. Using the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and analyzing 40,000 genotyped mother–father–child trios, we test whether children’s polygenic indices (PGIs) predict subsequent fertility, partnership dissolution, and transition to marriage. Accounting for parental PGIs, we found limited evidence for evocative effects across most traits. The exception was that children with a higher ADHD PGI predicted increased parental partnership dissolution (7% [CI=2.9-11.8%] per s.d.), especially in families with daughters (11% [CI=4.9-18%] per s.d.), higher socioeconomic status (15% [CI=7.7-23.2%] per s.d.), and older maternal age at first birth (10% [CI=3-17%] per s.d.). The main source of variation is the socio-economic dimension where child-driven effects are stronger in higher-SES families. The study provides evidence for evocative gene-environment correlations in family demography, demonstrating the importance of child-to-parent effects in shaping family trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers across the US have introduced legislation aimed at weakening existing vaccine-related policies (e.g., vaccine mandates in employment or educational settings). However, reports of anti-vaccine policymaking (AVP) across state legislatures have been largely anecdotal. We offer a first-of-its-kind effort to quantify and standardize reporting of the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of AVP by introducing the State Vaccine Policy Project (SVPP) database; a content-coded record of every piece of vaccine-related legislation introduced across all US state houses from 2019 - 2023. SVPP data reveal that both the total volume and proportion of anti-vaccine bills introduced across state legislatures has been increasing steadily since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 1 in 10 anti-vaccine bills signed into law during that period. We also show that the rise in anti-vaccine legislating is attributable primarily to the legislative actions of state lawmakers affiliated with the Republican party, and that dozens of anti-vaccine bills directly aim to reduce the scope of vaccine mandates. In addition to offering a standardized and exhaustive assessment of the growth of anti-vaccine policy making across US state legislatures, our work provides scholars with a unique dataset for studying changes in the vaccine policy environment.",

Drawing from anthropological, feminist, and philosophical traditions, this work challenges the biomedical construction of intersexuality and proposes embodied approaches that center lived experience and agency. The analysis traces genealogies of bodily thought—from Cartesian dualism through phenomenology to contemporary feminist theory—while examining how power structures, medical discourses, and cultural norms shape intersex experiences. By articulating sociological and individual levels of analysis, this framework reveals intersexuality as a contested field where expert knowledge confronts activist voices, and where bodies become sites of both disciplinary control and transformative resistance. This theoretical contribution provides essential tools for ethnographic research on intersex lives and broader questions of bodily difference, gender variance, and biomedical normalization.",

          "authors": "Thejan Anil",
          "abstract": "The ESG Resonance Model (ESGRM) conceptualises how organisational communication, employee psychology, and stakeholder perception interact within the ESG landscape. It argues that stakeholder fatigue and organisational burnout are interconnected outcomes of communicative overload and misalignment between intent and action. Building on burnout theory (Maslach &amp; Leiter, 1997) and the Job Demands–Resources framework (Demerouti et al., 2001), ESGRM integrates five domains—signal quality, signal intensity, alignment, assurance, and employee sense-making—within a quarterly feedback loop.\n\nThe model proposes that when communication clarity and internal coherence are high, resonance strengthens, fostering trust and authenticity. Conversely, excessive signalling without alignment accelerates fatigue and erodes legitimacy. ESGRM thus functions as both a diagnostic and corrective framework, guiding organisations to evaluate and refine their communicative balance. Though conceptual in nature, it provides a foundation for future empirical testing through sentiment analysis and longitudinal feedback, positioning ESGRM as a dynamic bridge between communication theory and sustainable organisational strategy.",

This paper presents a case study of this matter using the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). A survey question included in this study attempts to measure student truancy across countries over time. The international survey documentation suggests an identical question has been used across countries and cycles. Yet the national documentation illustrates how a subtle – yet important – change to the wording was made in some countries in 2015. We demonstrate how researchers could easily miss this change and how this would impact inferences in changes in truancy rates before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Attempts to use artificial intelligence and large language models to spot this problem resulted in overconfidently incorrect advice. The findings thus serve as a reminder to even the most experienced data analysts (including ourselves) – ALWAYS READ THE SURVEY DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY.",

          "authors": "Sami Nenno; Philipp Lorenz-Spreen",
          "abstract": "Private wealth in Germany is highly concentrated and often inherited rather than earned. This concentration reinforces unequal distributions of political influence, income, and other capacities linked to wealth. Although public support for stricter taxation is widespread, left-wing parties have so far failed to reintroduce a net wealth tax or close inheritance tax loopholes. We analyze the social media communication from 2017 to 2025 on Facebook, Instagram, and X by German members of parliament and ads by business lobby groups. Specifically, we examine the salience of wealth taxation, argumentation patterns for and against stricter net wealth, inheritance, or gift taxes, and which arguments resonate with users. Our findings indicate that wealth taxation is not a frequent topic among members of parliament but generates higher user engagement compared to other policy issues. Left-wing parties rely on value-based arguments stressing inequality, injustice, and responsibility but rarely present concrete data on inequality or tax exemptions. Conservatives highlight threats to inherited homes, liberals emphasize economic risks, and the far right questions state intervention. We conclude that left-wing communication likely resonates primarily with their own supporters rather than broader audiences. The study contributes to a more holistic description of the political communication of  economic inequality.",

          "abstract": "Telecommuting is often portrayed as a work-life balance measure. Though, in theory, telecommuting can provide workers with more time for leisure and family, due to the boundary blurring between work and life spheres, it can exacerbate gender inequalities by pushing women to carry out more domestic work while increasing men’s time in paid work. Empirically, the evidence is mixed. We extend the debate by exploring how individuals’ gender role attitudes moderate the relationship between telecommuting and the division of domestic work. We apply hybrid models to the German Family Panel data. The data covers the timespan from 2008 to 2021, which includes the unique COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that gender role attitudes matter. When getting access to telecommuting, egalitarian men increased their contribution to childcare, while traditional men did not. Similarly, telecommuting traditional women increased their childcare contribution. The pattern remained the same during the expansion of telecommuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic: only telecommuting traditional women and telecommuting egalitarian men increased their childcare contribution. The results of this study suggest that telecommuting has the potential to serve as a ‘great equaliser.’ However, achieving this requires actively promoting more egalitarian views on gender roles.",

Perhaps no approach has been more inspirational than the walkthrough method. However, the walkthrough method’s apparent popularity hides the fact that few studies actually use the method as presented. While many studies cite it, only some make thorough use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment World-Through, that builds on the walkthrough method but engages more productively with the app’s interface. This approach combines the technical walkthrough with a new theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment. This new approach attempts to deliver on the original promise of the walkthrough method: the rigorous and systemic study of apps where the researcher engages directly with an app’s interface.",

The findings revealed that older adults who had previously been infected by the virus exhibited better mental health compared to their non-infected counterparts (p = .049, d = 0.48). Additionally, this group showed a higher tendency to engage in regular physical activities (p = .042; Phi = .250) and experienced an improved quality of life.

          "abstract": "Causal reasoning is central to social sciences, supporting both theory development and testing. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to analyze texts across social sciences, yet their abilities to interpret causal statements and reconstruct causal structures remain uncertain in social science texts. This study examines to what extent LLMs can (a) identify causal sentences and (b) recover causal edges to reconstruct directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This examination relies on two text-based simulations and one experiment using real sociological texts. In simulated texts, models reliably detected explicit causal statements but often misclassified non-causal ones, particularly when probabilistic language was used. For causal graph recovery, clarity of expression strongly influenced accuracy. Across 500 replications with real texts, performance ranged from moderate to near perfect, revealing both model heterogeneity and inconsistency. These results indicate that LLMs can assist in extracting causal knowledge from social science texts, yet accurate inference of complex causal mechanisms still requires careful theoretical reasoning. Future applications may benefit from targeted prompting and domain-specific fine-tuning, but their contribution to sociological theorizing should be carefully assessed against traditional methodological standards.",

Using administrative data from Italy and Finland, we firstly investigate whether gender gaps in wages and other significant aspects of jobs differ between graduates of care- and non-care related fields of study. Second, adopting a comparative perspective, we further examine whether these gender gaps vary between Italy and Finland, two countries with different levels of gender inequality. Findings support the gender comparative advantage argument that women experience smaller gaps in outcomes when graduating from care-oriented fields than other fields, narrowing disparities in employment, wages, and job authority, and eliminating gender disparities in access to high-service occupations. Analyses are broadly consistent across Italy and Finland, suggesting limited cross-country variation in gender gaps in outcomes when comparing care and non-care fields.  \n\nKeywords: Care fields; Gender gap; Labour market; Administrative data; Comparative research",

We conducted an online experiment (N = 651) testing the effectiveness of nature images and self-efficacy messages in activating state nature connectedness, and an quasi-experimental field study in a hotel, using the hot water consumption of 6,154 guests as the dependent variable. Results indicate that a lush green landscape image featuring water droplets combined with a self-efficacy message significantly increased state nature connectedness (and water-saving intentions). However, the intervention did not translate into significant reductions in water use, challenging the assumption that a state nature connectedness intervention directly influences pro-environmental behavior. These findings underscore the necessity of field experiments in assessing the real-world effectiveness of behavior change interventions and emphasize the value of publishing null results to advance cumulative knowledge on promoting pro-environmental behavior change.",

          "abstract": "Interventions designed to promote pro-environmental behaviour often yield inconsistent results. The Targeted Interception Theory of Behaviour Change offers a framework for improving effectiveness by aligning intervention strategies with the cognitive characteristics of behaviours, conceptualised along a continuum from habitual to scripted to considered behaviours. Across three studies, we empirically test key assumptions of this theory. Study 1 classified 18 pro-environmental behaviours based on self-reported mental processing, identifying four focal behaviours that span the continuum: purchasing energy-efficient white goods (considered), setting heating sustainably (scripted), choosing vegetarian/vegan meals at restaurants (semi-habitual), and purchasing carbon offsets with flights (highly habitual). Study 2 comprised four survey experiments comparing cognitive interventions (environmental messaging), behavioural-guidance interventions, and choice architecture changes (default change) against a control condition. While Study 1 confirmed that behaviours differ in cognitive demands, results from Study 2 were mixed: default changes increased intentions to purchase energy-efficient white goods and to choose vegetarian/vegan meals, whereas other interventions rarely outperformed the control. Study 3 reanalysed meta-analytic data from 137 field interventions, coding each by behaviour type (habitual or scripted) and intervention strategy (cognitive, behavioural-guidance, or choice architecture). These results supported theoretical predictions: choice architecture interventions were effective across both behaviour types; behavioural-guidance interventions were moderately effective for scripted behaviours but ineffective for habitual behaviours; and cognitive interventions had negligible impact. Together, these findings provide initial empirical support for Targeted Interception Theory, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to cognitive demands and underscoring the robustness of choice architecture as a strategy for promoting pro-environmental behaviour.",

We explore this possibility by studying how Finnish climate activists responded to government repression in their social media behavior. We first conducted semi-structured interviews to see how activists understand the interplay between activism, repression, and social media affordances. Findings from our interviews suggest that activists are compelled to continue participating in the movement despite repression because the risk of social media amplifying individual-level chilling into movement-wide cascading demobilization outweighs risks from repression. We looked for evidence of this mechanism in the networked communication of Finnish climate activists on Twitter using temporal network analyses. Our findings show that activists' Twitter participation remained remarkably consistent despite offline repression, and that their communication patterns exhibited centralization tendencies that likely sustain the movement.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on 7,602 human-AI co-created physical designs from the “ZaoHaoWu” platform, this study promptly identifies and focuses on the IB-ID (I buy what I design) user group—individuals who embody dual identities as both designers and consumers—and examines how they embed identity narratives into products, thereby shifting from symbolic possession to meaning co-creation.\nWe developed a 2 (mobile vs. fixed context) × 2 (functional vs. decorative attributes) conceptual framework and employed visual language model (Qwen2.5-VLM) and large language models (Qwen3-turbo) to extract textual information from images, enabling thematic discovery and construction of fine-grained emotional semantic networks.\nThree key findings emerged:\n(1) User creative preferences can be categorized into four structural themes: Mythic, Whimsy, Sinofuturism, and Pastiche. Among them, Sinofuturism—which fuses local cultural symbols with futuristic imagination—achieved the highest social engagement, highlighting how strong cultural signifiers effectively stimulate high user participation.\n(2) Emotional expression is highly context-dependent: mobile contexts carry significantly more joy than fixed contexts, and decorative attributes further amplify positive emotions.\n(3) Functional products exhibit notably more cohesive emotional semantics, whereas decorative products display more dispersed emotional expressions. Collectively, these findings support the core proposition of our proposed Situational Self-Expression (SSE) theory—that self-expression is jointly shaped by usage context and product attributes.\nThese insights not only reconstruct McCracken’s Meaning Transfer Model (MTM) into an updated Meaning Co-Creation Model (MCcM), but also advance human-AI collaborative creation beyond virtual showcases into real-world consumption loops. They offer brands a three-dimensional design guideline centered on context–cultural symbols–emotion.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates degrees of polarization in political climate protest debates on TikTok. Drawing on a dataset of automatically transcribed TikTok videos posted by German politicians between 2022 and 2025 (N ≈ 1,700), alongside associated user comments (N ≈ 53,000), this study compares discussions on general climate activism, reformist activism (Fridays for Future), and disruptive activism (Letzte Generation). Using a mixed-method approach that combines Large Language Model–based frame classification, stance detection, and network analysis, this study operationalizes Discursive Polarization across ideological, affective, and interactional dimensions. Findings reveal that while all protest debates on TikTok are polarized, disruptive protests trigger particularly intense attacks, diverting attention away from policy-oriented climate discussions. However, politicians from conservative and far-right parties consistently frame all activists as extremists, criminals, or threats to public order, with far-right accounts dominating both content production and audience support. Network analyses demonstrate that far-right politicians and their supporters form coordinated and highly connected clusters in which both emotionally positive and hostile user engagement reinforces elite-driven antagonism. Even moderate and supportive posts by centrist or left-wing politicians attract disproportionate backlash, illustrating asymmetric polarization dynamics driven by partisan user networks. Overall, the study shows that political TikTok debates around climate protest are consistently polarized along ideological lines, but that disruptiveness intensifies antagonistic engagement and weakens Connective Action among supporters. Most crucially, far-right politicians emerge as the clear beneficiaries of TikTok’s algorithmic affordances, which—coupled with connected outrage that mobilizes their supporters—enable them to dominate debates and entrench Discursive Polarization through Connective Counteraction.",

          "abstract": "Internal migration, a common phenomenon in all countries, reshapes political geography by altering both the composition and preferences of local electorates, with significant implications for electoral outcomes. Despite increasing research on the political consequences of internal migration, there is little guidance on how to disentangle compositional from exposure effects when analyzing the causal effect of internal migration on district-level outcomes. In this paper, we define compositional effects within a standard potential outcome model, and we demonstrate that compositional and exposure effects jointly constitute the total causal effect of internal migration. We discuss potential avenues to identify, bound, and estimate compositional effects, leveraging additional data and assumptions. To illustrate the importance of disentangling compositional from exposure effects, we analyze the exodus of East Germans to West Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, demonstrating how out-migration to West Germany shaped electoral outcomes in East Germany through compositional effects.",

While it is often individually beneficial to follow AI recommendations, it can lead to dangerous herding behavior when AI provides incorrect information, a phenomenon observed in corporate scandals such as biased hiring algorithms, financial automation, or the monitoring of employees. In this paper, we show how a small group of stubborn workers following their own, imperfect but independent, information may help mitigate the risks of AI advice in their organization. However, stubbornness is costly---such individuals persist only if subsidized in the recruitment and promotion system despite lower average performance, or if they have a strong intrinsic preference for autonomy.",

          "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with high rates of acute care utilization, yet the role of food insecurity as a driver of hospitalizations remains underexplored, particularly from the perspective of advocacy organizations that support affected communities. This pilot study examined whether organizations that perceive higher levels of food insecurity among people with SCD also perceive more frequent SCD-related hospitalizations. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between June 10, 2025, and July 21, 2025, with five sickle cell advocacy organizations located in the United States, Uganda, and Tanzania. Organizations were asked to rate the severity of food insecurity among the individuals and families they serve and to estimate the frequency of SCD-related hospitalizations within their communities. Ratings were converted to ordinal scores and analyzed using Spearman’s rank-order correlation to assess the association between perceived food insecurity and hospitalization frequency. Results showed a moderate positive correlation (ρ = 0.60), suggesting that organizations serving communities with higher perceived food insecurity also reported more frequent hospitalizations among people with SCD. While limited by a small sample size and reliance on organizational perceptions rather than patient-level data, these exploratory findings highlight food insecurity as a potentially important, and often overlooked, factor in SCD-related health outcomes. Advocacy organizations may offer valuable, context-specific insights into how social and structural determinants shape hospitalization patterns. Larger, multi-level studies that integrate organizational, clinical, and patient-reported data are needed to clarify causal pathways and to inform interventions aimed at reducing preventable hospitalizations among people living with SCD.",

          "abstract": "How did geopolitics shape East Asia’s economic development? We show that U.S. war procurement during the Vietnam War—a fiscal shock which peaked at 2.9 percent of South Korea's GDP, rivaling the Marshall Plan—catalyzed Korea’s export-led industrialization. We construct a new firm-level dataset linking Korean export records with U.S. procurement contracts (1966–1974) to estimate the causal impact of winning a contract on export performance. Winning an initial contract increases a firm’s likelihood of exporting by 46 percentage points and triples its export value. These effects extend beyond sales to the United States: treated firms also expanded into third-country markets. We validate our research design using unique, contemporaneous firm-level export targets, showing that contracts were not anticipated and unrelated to export shocks. The policy had lasting effects. We find that firms treated in the 1960s responded more strongly to South Korea’s heavy and chemical industry drive of the 1970s, indicating that U.S. procurement and domestic industrial policy were complementary. Our findings reveal a neglected channel through which Cold War geopolitics helped shape the East Asian economic miracle.",

          "abstract": "The global economy operates under a fundamentally flawed informational ecosystem dominated by quasi-holistic perspectives that have fragmented understanding and perpetuated systemic failures throughout human history. This paper introduces Supra-level Holistic Re-engineering (SHR) as the first genuinely holistic methodology for addressing the global economy as an integrated whole. SHR synthesizes six key ideas—the clean slate principle from Business Process Reengineering, holism, narrative synthesis, systems thinking, the global economic system concept, and organizational advantages—to transcend limitations inherent in existing concepts and theories.\nThe analysis reveals that quasi-holistic definitions and semantics embedded in social science literature serve as the root cause of fragmentation, creating a vicious four-phase cycle that generates infinite convoluted loops of discrepancies. These discrepancies manifest at all levels in the economy as gaps, overlaps, controversies, and conflicts that disrupt workflows and push the global economy toward self-destruction. Most insidiously, an implicit quasi-holistic framework has enabled the financial system to dominate the global economy, transforming money from a medium of exchange into the ultimate end, thereby distorting true reality and robbing productivity from all other service systems.\nThis paper redefines the Global Economic System/World Economic System as RGES (Redefined GES), establishing it as an overarching structure coordinating all subsystems through interconnectivity and interrelationships across space, time, and level. The urgency for this paradigm shift is underscored by environmental deadlines, escalating financial crises, and geopolitical tensions. With NASA confirming Earth's uninhabitability by 2600 and critical turnaround points potentially already passed, SHR represents an existential necessity for steering humanity toward a sustainable future before reaching the point of no return.",

          "abstract": "Research of the impact of kin alloparenting on reproduction mainly focuses on mother’s parents and parents-in-law. The impact on fertility of extended families and the alloparental help with childcare they can provide has received much less attention. Moreover, there is an important lacuna in the existing studies of this problem, as it is mostly approached through correlational studies, while the presence of a causal link remains unclear. Using an instrumental variables approach, we demonstrate that prevalence of extended family structures exert a causal influence on fertility. A one standard-deviation increase in prevalence of extended families is associated with approximately 1.07 additional children per woman. These results highlight that family structure is not only statistically significant but also demographically consequential in shaping fertility outcomes.",

          "abstract": "As software has been slipping into everyday life of citizens, digital-enabled relations have become normalised, typically through mobile apps and their platforms. Moreover, this change is happening within a neoliberal framework where citizenship itself is measured and shaped through market imperatives of consumerism, data-extraction, and individual responsibility. Citizenship itself is therefore a multiple concept expressed through the occurrences of digitally mediated encounters which I try to capture in this chapter focusing on the deployment of platforms for collaborative governance. This is one emerging aspect of the journey of ‘platform citizenship’ which is perceived as both innovative and necessary vis-a-vis declining traditional political and civic participation. One of these platforms is Decidim, the case-study presented here: this has been conceived by ethical hackers and activists in Barcelona and has become an internationally awarded and replicated project. \nIn order to analyse the relationship between places and technologies, and to radically contextualise software relations further, I use the Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation (Cardullo and Kitchin, 2019a). I conclude that since citizen power cannot be routed through platform capitalism, we need to look away from mainstream big tech for meaningful examples of civic technologies for the common good, democratic governance and citizens’ meaningful participation. Remain to be asked if such endeavours would extend traditional political citizenship, re-politicising the smart city by producing collaborative forms of governance, or would these be new forms of ethics-washing and tokenistic tactics?",

          "abstract": "This study concerned a selection of synonym and antonym items, which were previously shown to exhibit sex bias. They were recomposed into new item sets and retested to illustrate potential risks in item analysis and the implications of relying on biased items when measuring lexical ability. A total of 2,923 individuals taking admission tests for basic military training in Sweden between mid-November 2024 and mid-January 2025 responded to selections of synonym and antonym items alongside the Swedish Enlistment Battery. Item properties were analyzed within the framework of the Rasch model, focusing on subsets of items categorized by their pre-defined sex bias. Estimates of lexical ability based on these subsets were compared using t-tests, and stanine categories were analyzed through ordinal logistic regressions. As expected, the use of potentially sex-biased items led to inconsistent estimates of lexical ability, systematically favoring either male or female test takers, depending on the composition of the items. When all items were combined, clear evidence of multidimensionality and violations of measurement invariance emerged. By highlighting critical risks associated with biased item content, this study provides an illustrative case of concerns about fairness in verbal testing. It offers valuable insights for future item development and encourages continued methodological research to support the creation of equitable and valid assessments of lexical ability.",

This study employs corpus-assisted analysis to examine how the green energy transition is represented in left-leaning and right-leaning UK newspapers (2015-2024). Specifically, we identified the temporal changes in frequencies of emotional reporting and analysed and compared five group of strong emotion words (represented by crisis, damage, greenwashing, catastrophe, and wealth) through collocation analysis and concordance analysis. Our findings indicate that although the sentiment of coverage is more positive than negative, negative sentiment is gradually increasing over time. Both sides cover environmental and economic aspects of the transition; however, they differ in their priority area and the way they engage with these areas. Left-leaning newspapers emphasise environmental degradation, blame fossil fuels for the climate crisis, and call for urgent action. Right-leaning newspapers focus more on the economic impacts of transition, often framing policies as threats to jobs or prosperity while downplaying accountability for emissions. Across the spectrum, reporting tends to adopt a techno-optimist, business-as-usual stance that rarely challenges the idea of continuous economic growth. Implications for media, readers, and policymakers are discussed.",

We found that all dimensions of trust positively correlate with support for management, with rational trust being the strongest predictor. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and race showed minimal impact compared to trust dimensions. Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of trust and its critical role in resource management and suggest that building and maintain multiple dimensions of trust can enhance public support for environmental management, ultimately leading to more effective and resilient environmental governance.",

          "abstract": "In an era of proliferating AI decision support, organizational leaders face unprecedented challenges in judgment. This paper introduces the L-Canvas, a leadership-centered sociotechnical framework that guides when to trust algorithmic outputs, when to defer to automated recommendations, and when to override them. Drawing on concepts of sensemaking, trust, psychological safety, organizational ambidexterity, and high-reliability organizing, we propose a structured “leadership playbook” for integrating human judgment with AI in high-stakes decisions. We illustrate the framework with public case examples – a pretrial bail risk algorithm and the UK’s 2020 A-level grading algorithm – highlighting how leadership actions (or inaction) impacted trust and outcomes. We present a clearly labeled contribution statement and outline a preregistration-ready evaluation plan with open metrics (e.g. override precision, fairness gaps, decision variance, procedural justice indicators), accompanied by a printable L-Canvas diagram and a sample metrics CSV workbook. By centering leadership practices in sociotechnical systems, this work offers both a practical guide for decision-makers and a foundation for scholarly replication. The findings underscore that effective “leading judgment” in the age of AI requires not only technical excellence, but also cultural resilience, ethical commitment, and a willingness to learn and adapt.",

          "abstract": "From the smart urbanism of the 2010s to platform and AI urbanism(s) of the present-future, the ‘data-driven city’ has been imagined as a functional and controlled whole, impulsed and regulated by autonomous (humans off-the-loop) systems, and fed through powerful data infrastructure. AI urbanism, in particular, manifests the current climax of the long-standing desire to control digital technology in the city yet to come. An excessive focus on technology, however, risks de-contextualising it from the wider economic and political landscapes. \nWhile digital platforms have been structuring the fabric of daily urban life colonising almost any field of interest through their ecosystems and mobile apps, AI technologies start making their way into cities with: autonomous vehicles, city brains, Digital Twins and robotics. Advocates suggest these novel technologies have changed the geographies of their deployment – not confined to cities any more, rather on regional or global scales – and of their partnerships with city management – cities no longer having exclusive and central stage, rather participating to consortia with limited or secondary roles. Both these configurations have been framed as the ‘post-smart city’. \nBut, is there a paradigm shift between these versions of urbanism? Has the ‘smart city’ framework – the neoliberal project of linking private investment from technology firms into the management and governance of city living – substantially changed? And, finally, what role is expected for cities to take in this uncertain and evolving scenario? \nThe ‘data-driven city’ ought to be understood in pair with the development of data capitalism and the enormous expansion of its data infrastructure, markets and services. Thus, I invite to re-position this debate as an intensification of neoliberal (‘smart’ or ‘data-driven’) urbanism and its ideological assumptions: technological solutionism and smart mentality, and data extractivism, surveillance and control.",

VENPRES-A consists of three main datasets: a polling station-level dataset with 77,737 observations, a municipal-level dataset with 1,668 observations, and a long-format party-level dataset for the 2024 election with 953,800 observations, providing granular insights into spatial dynamics of political competition, voting behavior, and subnational electoral trends. The dataset leverages a combination of sources: official releases from electoral authorities, official data archives collected by civil society and opposition actors, and secondary sources. Combining these sources was crucial to compensate for the withdrawal of all official records since July 2024. This empirical contribution enhances the study of subnational electoral dynamics in authoritarian environments.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of undevelopable economies—contexts in which development is not merely delayed or distorted, but structurally foreclosed due to persistent, self-reinforcing institutional dysfunction. While existing classifications such as “fragile,” “failing,” or “least developed” states suggest the potential for eventual progress, the notion of undevelopability challenges this assumption. It signals a qualitative shift: some institutional systems may be fundamentally resistant to transformation within prevailing development paradigms.\nThe term is used diagnostically rather than deterministically. It highlights structural entrenchment—not cultural incapacity or societal failure—and draws attention to contexts where institutions function primarily to sustain elite power, suppress reform, and replicate dysfunction over time.\nGrounded in institutional theory, path dependence, and critical development scholarship, the paper advances this conceptual framework through case studies of Somalia, Haiti, and Venezuela—each illustrating a distinct mode of institutional foreclosure. It concludes by reflecting on the implications for aid architecture, donor strategy, and development theory.\nRecognizing undevelopability does not imply fatalism. Rather, it invites a more grounded, differentiated approach to theorizing development—one that acknowledges the political and historical limits of institutional change in fractured contexts, and reconsiders what is possible, ethical, and realistic in such environments.",

          "abstract": "As churches preach stewardship of the Earth and social media influencers post pictures of bamboo toothbrushes, the crossroads between personal faith and green purchase intentions demands closer study. This study explores how a person’s depth of religious belief influences their intention to buy green products, and whether conspicuous virtue signaling (CVS) motivates those intentions. CVS refers to publicly showcasing one’s ethical actions to express moral identity or gain social approval. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, Goal Content Theory, and the Theory of Reasoned Action, this research distinguishes between intrinsic religiosity and extrinsic religiosity and how they influence green choices when motivated by virtue signaling. The study employed structural equation modelling to analyse survey data from 206 students and young professionals in Ghana. The findings reveal that intrinsic religiosity significantly boosts green purchase intentions, while extrinsic religiosity does not directly lead to greener buying choices. However, both intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity increase virtue signaling behaviors. Interestingly, even individuals who engage in religious activities for social reasons are more likely to \"show off\" their eco-friendly behavior online, which in turn increases their likelihood of intending to buy green products. These results suggest that public displays of environmental responsibility, whether driven by genuine faith or social image, can powerfully motivate sustainable consumer behavior. The study offers new insights for marketers and policymakers: green campaigns can appeal not only to private moral values but also to the human desire for social recognition. Framing eco-friendly choices as both personally meaningful and publicly admirable could effectively engage religious audiences in promoting sustainability.",

          "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly generative language models, into daily life is fundamentally altering human problem-solving approaches. This pilot study from a multinational longitudinal research program investigates the patterns, perceptions, and consequences of AI use across different task complexities. A survey was administered to a diverse, highly educated sample (N=21), capturing data on demographics, AI usage habits, and ethical perceptions. Crucially, the study employed problem vignettes of graduated complexity to examine actual behavior. Results reveal the emergence of a hybrid problem-solving culture where AI is strategically embedded into workflows, primarily for ideation, formulation, and research. While AI consultation increases with problem difficulty, a critical \"verification crisis\" emerges as tasks become more complex, participants' self-assessed ability to verify AI output declines sharply, creating a significant gap between their belief in an AI-generated solution's correctness and their ability to prove it. Furthermore, a \"belief-performance gap\" was identified, where perceived correctness of AI solutions exceeded actual ground-truth accuracy on complex problems. These findings underscore a paradigm shift towards human-AI collaboration and highlight the urgent need for digital literacy frameworks and system designs that prioritize verification skills alongside AI adoption to ensure reliable outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Violence Perception Index (VPI), a novel methodology for quantifying violence-related discourse through geolocated YouTube comments. Utilizing the YouTube API and natural language processing techniques, the VPI measures public references to violence in 3,398,143 geolocated videos across Mexico (2020–2024). This approach provides spatiotemporally granular data on violence perceptions, extending beyond traditional event-based datasets by capturing not only documented violence but also rumors, fears, and community discourse about violence—dimensions that influence community behavior and social stability independently of official records.\nViolence scores are constructed using a weighted Spanish-language dictionary developed through semantic network expansion from violence-related seed terms. The dictionary-based scoring approach demonstrates moderate-to-substantial agreement with large language model classifications across 700 stratified comments (75-81% agreement), validating the method's capacity to systematically identify violence-related discourse at scale while maintaining computational efficiency for processing millions of comments.\nThe VPI is benchmarked against established violence indicators including ACLED fatalities and official municipal homicide statistics through panel regression specifications incorporating comprehensive spatial and temporal fixed effects. Analysis reveals systematic geographic heterogeneity: the VPI correlates strongly with ACLED data in high-population areas but exhibits stronger correlation with official homicide records in low-population contexts. Rather than constituting a methodological limitation, this pattern demonstrates the VPI's enhanced sensitivity in marginalized and remote regions where news-based datasets suffer from systematic reporting bias. The methodology is immediately scalable across languages and geographies, providing complementary intelligence for conflict monitoring, early warning systems, and policy interventions in precisely those underrepresented areas where traditional event-based monitoring systems provide incomplete coverage.",

          "abstract": "Background: Research on mental health practitioners experiences of supporting transgender and gender diverse (‘trans’) youth has largely focused on the challenges, emotional burdens, and ethical complexities of this work, while overlooking the rewarding joyful dimensions.\nAim: Informed by calls for desire-based inquiry, this study explored the joys that mental health practitioners experience in their work with trans youth. \nMethods: Twelve Australian mental health practitioners were interviewed between May and August 2025 about the joyful aspects of their work with trans youth. Participants were aged 26–58 years and represented the fields of psychology, psychiatry, social work, counselling, and occupational therapy across both public and private settings. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. \nResults: Practitioners described profound joy, reward, and fulfilment in their work, articulated across five themes: (i) affirmation and authenticity of trans youth in practice, (ii) trans youth transformation and hope, (iii) familial love, bonds, and support, (iv) professional collegiality and co-learning, and (v) personal and professional growth and impact. Trans joy was experienced as “contagious,” generating hope and a sense of shared humanity. By reframing trans-affirming mental health practice through the lens of joy, this study shows how such work can be a powerful source of meaning, fulfilment, and growth. Recognising these affective dimensions of practice offers a more balanced understanding of gender-affirming care and underscores the importance of supporting those who deliver it within an increasingly politicised context.",

          "authors": "G. Du",
          "abstract": "We propose a unified microeconomic theory that takes the behavioral rules of firms in real markets as the endogenous mechanism through which market structures are generated, replacing the standard practice of imposing perfect competition, monopoly, and other market forms as exogenous assumptions. Under a set of minimal axioms (consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, firm entry/exit mechanisms, and market clearing) and by introducing realistic cost and demand structures (firm-level cost heterogeneity, fixed costs, and demand elasticity, among others), pricing behavior and market structures long treated as exogenous (such as perfect competition and monopoly) are derived endogenously as equilibrium outcomes of firms' profit-maximizing behavior. Within a single framework, the theory nests traditional cost and marginal analysis, game-theoretic approaches to imperfect competition, and the Walrasian general equilibrium model; different regions of the parameter space naturally yield equilibrium outcomes corresponding to perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, and competitive-fringe structures. Our analysis shows that perfect competition is only a highly symmetric and intrinsically unstable equilibrium point: even small cost differences suffice to push the system toward more common monopoly or oligopoly configurations, while positive feedback mechanisms render these structures stable, helping to explain why market power is not easily competed away. Under empirically observable premises, the theory coherently derives the principal market forms and, in doing so, clarifies the domains of applicability of various classic models. It can also be used to predict which market structures industries will evolve toward under given conditions, providing a unified and operational theoretical foundation for empirical research, industrial policy, and firms' business and competitive strategy decision-making.",

The paper identifies a parallel trend, in which major AI companies (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) and academic publishers (Elsevier, Clarivate, Digital Science) have released similar summary-and-citation tools that, I argue, act as knowledge arbitrators by surfacing, ranking, and recommending scholarly work. Drawing on sociologist Robert Merton’s concept of the “Matthew effect”—by which prominent scholars accrue still more recognition—I argue that these AI tools risk reinforcing existing biases along lines of gender, geography, and institutional prestige. The problem is twofold: the models are trained on historically biased scholarship, and their filtering logic is inscrutable. My claim is that these tools are performative, not merely descriptive, as they may help enact the scholarly landscape they purport merely to represent. The commentary concludes that by handing over knowledge summary to computational probability and the profit motive, we risk worsening academic power structures while obscuring the process.",

Together they describe how agents shift from inertia to decisive action under bounded cognition.",

This paper utilizes two primary datasets, the Populist Leaders and the Economy and the World Values Survey in Wave 7, covering more than 34,498 respondents in 32 countries. Logistic regression with marginal effects shows that the independent variable of epistemic overconfidence stands out as the strongest and most positive explanatory variable for populist support besides economic, institutional, and media trust-related variables. This result is robust to nonlinearities in media use and trust, indicating that excessive use of digital media increases populist support.

We track “late-career” scientists—scientists with at least 25 years of publishing experience (N=320,564)—in 16 STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) and social science disciplines from 38 OECD countries for up to five decades. Our OECD sample includes 79.42% of late-career scientists globally. We examine the details of their mobility patterns as early-career, mid-career, and late-career scientists between decile-based productivity classes, from the bottom 10% to top 10% of the productivity distribution. Methodologically, we turn a large-scale bibliometric dataset (Scopus raw data) into a comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science. The global science system is highly immobile: half of global top performers continue their careers as top performers and one-third of global bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are extremely rare in science. The chances of moving radically up or down in productivity classes are marginal (1% or less). Our regression analyses show that productivity classes are highly path dependent: there is a single most important predictor of being a top performer, which is being a top performer at an earlier career stage.",

Instead, this phenomenon increases support for the ruling JDP by 5.8% through social media, while exposure to or use of news decreases support for the main opposition RPP by 4.5%.

          "abstract": "This study examines biologists leaving science in 38 OECD countries in the past two decades. We use publication metadata from a global bibliometric database (raw Scopus data at the micro-level of individual scientists). In a cohort-based and longitudinal fashion, we follow individual men and women scientists over time, from their first to their last publication (N=86,178). We examine four academic disciplines: AGRI (agricultural and biological sciences), BIO (biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology), IMMU (immunology and microbiology), and NEURO (neuroscience). We apply survival analysis, conceptualizing scientific life as a sequence of scholarly publishing events. Our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows how women disappear from science: in BIO, about 60% are still in science after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and only 20% by the end of the period examined (i.e., after 19 years). The percentages are substantially higher for men: approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier estimations indicate that women in the largest discipline (BIO) are 23.26% more likely to leave science after 10 years and 39.74% more likely to leave science at the end of the study period. Gender difference in attrition, slightly visible after 5 years, increase consistently in later career stages. The probability of surviving for women after 15 years varies considerably, from 47.8% in AGRI to 27.6% in IMMU; for men, the probability is about a fifth higher. Our data show that with the passage of time, women disappear from science in ever-larger proportions compared to men. Gender differences in attrition in the four disciplines have been and continue to be high, but comparing the 2000 and 2010 cohorts, have slightly decreased over time.",

          "abstract": "Informal political conversations are vital for the functioning of liberal democracies, especially when they involve individuals with differing political views. While prior research suggests that incidental and non-political factors may guide individuals’ choice of discussion partners and outweigh strictly political ones, this article argues that these dynamics may shift depending on the topic of discussion. Drawing on original personal network data from the highly polarized context of Catalonia, Spain (65 citizens reporting on 663 social relationships), we compare discussion partner selection across three topics: general politics, Catalan independence (high polarization), and climate change (low polarization). We examine: (1) the extent to which political and non-political interpersonal factors facilitate or inhibit political discussion, and (2) whether their influence varies by issue polarization. Contrasting previous findings, our results reveal that opinion similarity is the strongest predictor of discussion partner selection across all topics, even when controlling for interaction opportunities, highlighting the role of purposeful partner selection. Selection on non-political factors such as tie strength, structural proximity, and socio-demographic similarity also occurs, but their influence varies depending on the issue being discussed. Tie strength and network centrality were more powerful predictors for discussion on the more polarized issue. Overall, the findings reveal that individuals selectively activate ties for political talk, and that issue polarization amplifies this selectivity, thus linking topic-alter dependence in informal political discussion networks with the growing literature on affective polarization.",

          "abstract": "With roughly 40% of new couples meeting online, dating platforms have become commonplace. Yet, they share a common pitfall: a skewed gender ratio, with men substantially outnumbering women. Combined with prevailing gender norms—where men are expected to make the first move—this creates market congestion. Women are overwhelmed by messages and often face harassment, while many men struggle to receive any attention. We use computational experiments to examine how dating-platform designs affect individuals’ mating choices. We replicate popular app designs using a self-built web application and generate artificial profiles by combining images with socio-demographic data. Building on past research, we compare a “control” design with two interventions that reveal profiles’ popularity and capacity. Based on 66.132 profile ratings from participants in four countries, we find that the experimental conditions alone do not significantly shift user choices. We then analyze treatment heterogeneity using our large sample. Results show that visual and textual capacity indicators reduce the number of likes for highly attractive profiles, particularly when rated by men. However, these interventions do not increase engagement with less attractive profiles. These findings suggest that instead of redirecting attention to less attractive users, the intervention mostly benefits those who are already popular.",

This commentary brings together such evidence from outside psychology: quasi-experimental studies of military conscription, longitudinal research on fraternity hazing, and new archival work on When Prophecy Fails and other prophetic movements. Across democratic, authoritarian, and small-group settings, coerced or effortful participation fails to generate the attitudinal justification predicted by induced compliance. Across fraternities, hazing does not predict greater group solidarity. Cults do not tend to survive failed prophecies. Together, these findings suggest that the effect is fragile and context-dependent, and that its privileged status in social psychology warrants re-examination",

          "abstract": "How, and for whom, do political events translate into enduring political change? This article advances a theory of cohortization, where people's responses to a political shock are a joint function of whether they are in their impressionable years and their partisan identities. Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 as a quasi-natural experiment, I study the processes of cohort formation by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans across multiple national surveys which collectively span from 2016 to 2024. The findings consistently show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement, a pattern visible much more so among younger than older individuals. Moreover, the changes persisted for younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization. In the end, this article provides a microfoundation for the political construction of generations.",

          "abstract": "The accessibility of scholarly research plays a crucial role in shaping academic impact and societal engagement. This study examines how Open Access (OA) models - Gold, Hybrid-Gold, Green, and Bronze - as well as Closed Access are associated with bibliometric and altmetric indicators in publications authored by Israeli researchers from 2013 to 2023. By integrating Scopus and PlumX data, the study analyzes variations in academic impact (citations, captures, and usage) and societal engagement (social media and mentions) across access models and over time. The findings show that Bronze OA is associated with higher levels of bibliometric and altmetric indicators. Hybrid-Gold OA demonstrated citation and altmetric gains that closely approached those of Bronze OA, with the highest levels of mentions. In contrast, Closed Access exhibits the highest usage metrics. Additionally, a greater number of authors corresponds with higher bibliometric and altmetric values. The relationship between academic impact and societal engagement has strengthened in recent years, particularly for Open Access publications, suggesting an increasing alignment between public attention and academic recognition. Furthermore, publications with high academic impact, strong societal engagement, and multiple authors are more commonly associated with Open Access status. The association between societal engagement and academic impact appears strongest among high-impact publications, whereas author count shows greater explanatory power among lower-impact work. These patterns offer valuable insights for researchers, institutions, policymakers, and publishers seeking to better understand scholarly dissemination. They also contribute to ongoing discussions on Open Access policies by describing patterns of access, engagement, and impact in an evolving academic landscape.",

          "abstract": "As an answer to the question of what open science principles could look like in qualitative research, this methodological tutorial introduces a structured audit trail format tailored to the specific needs of qualitative research. While open science practices have become increasingly common in quantitative research, their application in qualitative research remains complex due to the interpretive, iterative, and sensitive nature of qualitative inquiry. This tutorial addresses these challenges by offering a format for audit trailing enabling researchers to make the research process open. The format is grounded in key concepts such as transparency, reproducibility, traceability, auditability, reflexivity, and positionality. Supplementary materials, including guiding questions and a blank template, are provided to support implementation. A pilot application illustrates how the audit trail offers a feasible pathway for integrating open science practices into qualitative research while safeguarding participant confidentiality.",

          "abstract": "Healthcare services around the world are undergoing a rapid process of digitalisation that presents novel threats to healthcare workers and patients across humanitarian settings. This review evaluates the key mechanisms by which emerging digital technologies are reshaping humanitarian practice and posing new challenges to patients, practitioners and policy-makers in low-resource environments.\n\nFirst, we examine emergent physical and psychological harms stemming from digital technologies at the individual patient level, summarising the latest evidence on injuries from drone-induced trauma, multi-robotic systems (MRS) and electromagnetic (EM) weapons. Second, we discuss population-level risks in global health settings, detailing the clinical harms associated with hospital cyberattacks in hybrid warfare and the novel challenges of AI-enhanced technologies for non-profit agencies attempting to deliver care (e.g., misinformation and “Deepfakes”). Further, we illustrate the new vulnerabilities that emerge as humanitarian agencies transition to electronic and biometric databases, highlighting the associated privacy risks for asylum seekers and refugees. Drawing together the latest insights from frontline practitioners, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations (UN), we showcase specific technological threats affecting vulnerable patient groups, such as the deployment of GPS trackers and implants by sex trafficking groups, and the use of social media by modern slavery networks. \n\nThis article introduces global health and humanitarian practitioners to essential digital concepts that are increasingly relevant to their work in the field, including Swarm Intelligence technologies, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), Large Language Models (LLMs), Cyberwar, Netwar and electromagnetic (EM) warfare. Framed through the lens of clinical care, we shine a light on the neglected intersection of humanitarian practice and digital technology, demonstrating that patients who are marginalised globally are often at greatest risk from technological harm.",

Fricker’s ethico-epistemic notion of epistemic injustice, which focuses on harms to knowers rather than the truth of claims, struggles to apply in empirical fields where error can have material health consequences. In global health, the usage tends to conflate moral recognition with epistemic warrant. It encourages the levelling of credibility across competing claims irrespective of evidence. I trace how decolonial and pluriversal rhetoric—drawing on Quijano, Grosfoguel, Mignolo, and Lugones—extends this conflation into ontological pluralism, dissolving truth into perspective while retaining universalist health ambitions. Through cases of spirit children, umbilical cord care, and snakebite treatment, I show how these frameworks can licence harmful practices and obscure structural analyses of power independent of coloniality. I conclude by sketching a modest alternative: epistemic humility, realist standards of evidence, and procedural justice in access to the means of inquiry.",

Yet little guidance exists on how to select measures that are both theoretically robust and practically usable, and many researchers and practitioners remain unaware of the implications, biases, and consequences of their methodological choices. This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Background: The debate over the impact of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) structural adjustment programs on borrowing countries has been a central topic in political economy for decades. The empirical evidence is profoundly heterogeneous and often contradictory.\nObjective: This systematic review with narrative synthesis synthesizes and critically analyzes the literature to assess the effects of such programs on key indicators like poverty, income inequality, social spending (health and education), health outcomes (mortality, infectious diseases), the labor market, and informality.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted in five academic databases and grey literature, following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 53 studies and empirical contributions that met predefined selection criteria were included. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, paying special attention to the control of endogeneity and selection bias. Due to the methodological heterogeneity of the studies, the results were synthesized narratively.\nResults: A minority of studies, often employing methodologies with a higher risk of bias such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM), find no significant negative effects. In contrast, a robust body of research, using quasi-experimental designs with a low risk of bias like Instrumental Variables (IV), documents an increase in inequality, a deterioration of health outcomes (especially in tuberculosis and child mortality), and a rise in the informal economy as a consequence of IMF conditionalities.\nConclusion: The differences in findings are largely attributed to the diversity of methodologies and the rigor with which they address causal inference. Higher-quality evidence suggests that IMF programs, particularly those with austerity conditionalities and structural reforms, impose significant social costs. These impacts call for a redesign of conditionality that prioritizes social protection to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.",

          "abstract": "The growing interest in sustainability has generated a vast academic literature on the intersection of climate change, green finance, and financial markets. However, heterogeneity in methodologies and results often makes it difficult to draw unified conclusions. This paper presents a review of meta-analyses and systematic literature reviews to synthesize the current state of knowledge. By analyzing a corpus of 22 reviews, we assess the consensus on three key areas: 1) the impact of climate risk (physical and transition) on asset valuation, 2) the existence and magnitude of a green financing premium (the \"greenium\"), and 3) the effects of green finance practices on corporate and banking profitability. Our findings indicate an emerging consensus on the pricing of physical climate risk in the real estate market and a modest but persistent negative premium for green bonds. However, the impact of sustainable finance on financial profitability remains ambiguous and highly dependent on the methodological context. This synthesis consolidates quantitative findings, evaluates prevailing methodologies, identifies research gaps, and proposes an integration theory with an agenda for future research, highlighting the need for greater standardization in metrics and analytical approaches to strengthen the robustness of empirical conclusions.",

          "abstract": "Although scholars initially hypothesized that exile should deescalate conflict, recent empirical studies find that exile fuels political instability. We extend this finding by investigating the conditions under which exile exacerbates domestic contention. Drawing on an original database of exile participation in revolutions, we show that revolutionary situations with an exiled challenger tend to last longer and generate more violence than those with domestically-based challengers. Additional analyses illuminate the mechanisms behind this finding. First, exiles have a greater influence on revolutionary duration and violence when they take refuge in a geographically proximate location or maintain a meaningful presence abroad throughout the revolutionary situation. Second, exiles escalate contention by providing direct leadership, securing international support, or maintaining a government-in-exile. Finally, exiles have a stronger escalatory effect on revolutions that would otherwise be relatively peaceful. Our research unpacks a widespread and highly consequential -- but hereto understudied -- feature of revolutionary contention and outlines a research agenda on exile and domestic contentious politics.",

          "abstract": "Alternative crisis mental health responses are models that differ from the default, policy-only model of responding to emergency reports of acute psychological distress in the community. The two prevalent alternative models are co-response, pairing police with a civilian (such as a nurse or social worker) and civilian response, whereby first responders are not police. Two scoping reviews have been completed that synthesize key processes from the literature that underpin co-response and civilian response. Informed by transformative justice and the principle of the collective, this protocol details a knowledge-to-action (KTA) study whereby summaries of those scoping reviews will be used as prompts for semi-structured interviews with interest-holders (frontline service providers, people with lived experience of mental health crises, policymakers, and mental health scholars and advocates) across the United States and Canada. Interviews will focus on participants’ experiences with and perceptions of crisis response, as well as their opinions about the accuracy and relevance of the scoping reviews. The analytic plan incorporates content analysis and interpretive phenomenology to capture both the patterns that emerge and the meanings that participants attach to their experiences, producing a more layered and comprehensive analysis than either method could achieve alone. This protocol represents one of the first research plans to apply the KTA cycle and the first known study to propose that a team of researchers first synthesize the literature and then interview key informants about the accuracy and applicability of those knowledge syntheses. Findings may highlight discrepancies between the literature and the field, with a focus on alternative crisis mental health response.",

          "abstract": "Asset tests are widely employed to ensure that welfare resources are targeted efficiently and equitably to people that do not have the resources to be self-sufficient. This paper looks at how asset testing in social welfare programs works in the European Union and the United States and reviews the evidence on the consequences of asset testing for eligibility and behavior. For that purpose, we follow the PRISMA guidelines for study selection and synthesis, systematically reviewing 22 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024, covering the United States and European Union, to assess the impact of asset testing.\n\nOur review finds that the real-world implementation of asset tests often undermines their stated goal of poverty reduction. While asset tests can improve targeting, they frequently discourage savings, perpetuate financial insecurity, and create administrative barriers that reduce participation among the most vulnerable. Hard thresholds incentivize dissaving and trap households in precariousness and long-term dependency, while administrative complexity often offsets any efficiency gains. Recent policy reforms-including higher thresholds, inflation-indexing, and asset exemptions-offer promising alternatives, but a persistent tension remains between targeting efficiency and poverty alleviation. We conclude that graduated approaches rather than straight disqualification better align welfare eligibility with the goals of financial resilience and poverty reduction.

Respondents reported conducting applied (93 per cent) and/or pure (27 per cent) research across the UK. Current priorities for the application of behavioural research centred on climate action, health, methodological advances, and use of artificial intelligence. Perceived capability gaps include technological abilities, and knowledge relating to intervention design, implementation and evaluation. Broader barriers to conducting behavioural research include lack of confidence, limited funding and training, access to 'experts', and lack of acceptance of behavioural research. Findings highlight a need to increase capability through addressing skills and knowledge gaps, leadership engagement, and increasing resources for collaborative translation of behavioural research into practice.

To date, this coordinated international effort has been inadequate to halt global biodiversity loss. A major but unaccounted-for cause of the shortfall between policy ambitions and real-world outcomes is the abandonment of conservation initiatives, including both informal abdication of resource management responsibilities and formal reversal of governing rules and boundaries (Fig. 1). The US$200 billion annually committed to conservation is spent on a wide diversity of conservation measures, increasingly beyond traditional national parks and other protected areas (PAs), including community-based conservation, eco-certification, and payments for ecosystem services (2). The scant monitoring of conservation abandonment, derived almost entirely from PAs, demonstrates widespread informal abandonment of management responsibilities (i.e., “paper parks” (e.g., 3, 4)) and formal abandonment through protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) (e.g., 5, 6).",

          "abstract": "As news organisations adopt artificial intelligence (AI), they face growing pressure to be transparent about when and how it is used – yet practical approaches remain uneven. This paper examines AI transparency through an in-depth case study of the Financial Times (FT). Drawing on 13 semi-structured interviews with 12 senior managers across editorial, product, data science, and communications, together with internal documents, we show that the FT approaches transparency as a hybrid of policy, process, and practice, framed by a desire to safeguard both internal and external trust. Transparency is calibrated to context: internally, AI use is signposted in tools and reinforced through training and personal accountability; externally, the prominence of disclosure scales with system autonomy and editorial oversight, with stronger labelling for no-human-in-the-loop features than for AI-assisted, journalist-edited outputs. We identify nine factors that shape audience-facing disclosure – legal/provider requirements, industry benchmarking, nature of the task, human oversight, system novelty, audience expectations, perceived risk, commercial sensitivities, and design constraints – and five crosscutting challenges, including site-wide consistency (especially on mobile) and potential “transparency backfire.” Conceptually, our analysis links AI transparency to isomorphic pressures and to intersecting institutional logics. We argue that AI transparency in news is best understood as a spectrum, evolving with technological advancements, commercial, professional and ethical considerations and shifting audience attitudes.",

This paper introduces the H–O specification for modeling differences, a flexible SEM specification that overcomes these limitations. Our specification enables differences to be modeled as both independent and dependent variables, allows for differences between latent variables, and facilitates testing of the equal importance and full transmission assumptions. Using an empirical example from marketing research, we demonstrate that the H–O specification can reproduce the results of existing approaches while offering greater modeling flexibility and more opportunities to test differences.",

          "authors": "Gregorio Luz; Bert van Wee; Daniel A. Rodriguez; Rafael H. M. Pereira; Steven Farber",
          "abstract": "Accessibility measures are widely used to assess transport equity and identify groups at risk of transport-related social exclusion (TRSE). Yet little guidance exists on how to select measures that are both theoretically robust and practically usable, and many researchers and practitioners remain unaware of the implications, biases, and consequences of their methodological choices. This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.",

          "abstract": "自1609年阿姆斯特丹银行成立以来，各国银行部门逐步垄断了货币发行权，通过买入外汇、黄金、股票和信贷扩张等方式发行货币，使大量的社会经济产出被转化为外汇储备、黄金储备、银行持股、银行债权等金融资本。这一垄断制度已经持续数百年，具有高度隐蔽性，其理论依据是“货币是银行的负债凭证”——掩盖了货币的真实来源。本文深入贯彻习近平经济思想，通过逻辑推演发现：货币是劳动力商品的表现形式，本质是劳动力，是人民生育孩子的果实；人民的生育劳动构成了货币的价值基准和最终支持，是货币的真实来源。这一发现揭示了“生育铸币”是客观存在的事实，表明货币主权应归属于人民。进一步实证研究发现：货币发行实际是国家经济的初次分配，匹配的是国家经济增长；现行货币发行制度使人民的生育劳动未能参与社会分配、得不到应有的经济补偿，造成“银行印钞买黄金、妈妈缺钱买奶粉”的根本性矛盾对立，导致经济陷入债务高企、需求不足、就业困难、内卷严重和新生儿锐减的系统性困境。然后，本文进行了制度创新设计，研究发现：若建立“生育铸币制度”——即只通过生育补助的方式发行增量货币，就能解除矛盾，走出困境，做强国内大循环，建成消费强国，实现高质量发展。",

          "abstract": "This research examines, using a qualitative approach, the role of family microenterprises in Teabo, Yucatán, in promoting sustainable development and preserving Mayan cultural identity. A case study is conducted using a phenomenological and interpretive approach to compare two delivery models in the local cultural sector: one based on direct delivery (B2C) and the other on a third-party delivery (collaborative platform). This research uses interviews, participatory observation, and visual analysis. The findings show that artisanal bread and hipiles go beyond being mere economic goods; they are cultural stories that strengthen social unity, knowledge transmission, and the local economy, especially when women play a key role in knowledge management. The semiotic examination highlights that these products represent cultural signs with symbolic value, which affect how consumers perceive them and foster the sustainability of identity. The discussion underscores the relevance of cultural heritage as a source of competitive advantage and the role of inclusive cultural public policies. It follows that incorporating organizational strategies focused on gender and interculturality makes it possible to strengthen the relationship between tradition and innovation. This contributes to the well-being of Indigenous communities.",

          "abstract": "The social media hypothesis posits that the widespread adoption of social media is largely responsible for the decline in mental health among US teenagers. Critics of this view argue that it is incompatible with estimated treatment effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which tend to be small. I argue that these RCTs provide little evidence against the social media hypothesis: the causal effect identified by RCTs fundamentally differs from the causal effect invoked by the social media hypothesis in at least three ways. First, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of joining social media, whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of quitting social media. Second, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of using social media for many years, whereas RCTs typically identify the effect of quitting social media for several weeks. Third, and most overlooked, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of altering the behavior of large swaths of the population—a global intervention—whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of local interventions. In such local interventions, a person may be encouraged to quit social media, but both her immediate peers and the general public continue to use social media in large numbers. In this commentary, I discuss the local–global distinction at length and explain why the global intervention plausibly had much larger effects than experimental local interventions.",

          "abstract": "Big data and computational methods have generated great excitement and enthusiasm among scholars across the social sciences. In the form of government records and digital traces collected by companies, big data are abundant, constantly updated, and inexpensive to collect, giving researchers an unprecedented window into everyday behavior. For sociologists interested in solving social problems, big data likewise seem like an attractive source of evidence for developing policies and interventions. In this paper, we draw on lessons from our research on online fundraising and social welfare provision, which uses both big data analyses as well as conventional methods, to consider how big data can be used to solve unsolved social problems. We introduce the smokescreen analogy to characterize how big data can obscure rather than clarify social problems. Digital traces often serve as a veneer over longstanding issues, leading researchers into a \"description trap\" where they generate detailed accounts at the expense of identifying causes and solutions. However, behind every smokescreen is a smoke machine. We argue that analyzing the platforms generating digital traces can reveal their causal role in shaping social problems. Big data's relationship to problem-solving is ultimately ambivalent: it can both enable new solutions and distract from enduring causes.",

          "abstract": "Debates about how politicians handle information typically center on interpretation rather than selection. We focus on this earlier and often hidden step and argue that partisan perspectives shape which evidence politicians attend to in the first place. We test this claim in a real-world field setting during the 2024 Austrian parliamentary election campaign. Three weeks before election day, we emailed 1,822 candidates links to two high-quality research briefings on the same immigration policy reform: one emphasizing how benefit cuts reduce migrant inflows, the other that such cuts increase poverty among immigrants. By tracking click behavior, we measured which type of evidence each candidate selected. Our analysis shows that selection of ideologically aligned evidence is concentrated among extreme parties: candidates from the far-right Freedom Party of Austria disproportionately choose aligned evidence, while centrist candidates show more balanced patterns. A contemporaneous survey of 1,428 citizens indicates that far-right supporters approve of elites' selective attention to evidence, suggesting alignment between elite behavior and mass preferences at the political fringes. These results identify evidence selection as an important stage in policymaking and imply that rising far-right electoral strength may amplify reliance on supportive information, potentially increasing the risk of ill-informed policy decisions.",

          "abstract": "In this examination of gender differences in financial expectations in academia, we used survey data (N = 11,315 scientists and scholars, 19 academic disciplines) integrated with individual-level bibliometric and demographic data from Scopus. We studied what Polish scientists and scholars with various demographic characteristics, academic attitudes, and bibliometric profiles considered their dream salary. Top dreamers were defined as the upper 10% of scientists in terms of self-reported level of their dream salary. Gender differences are much weaker than expected: Women generally tend to have almost equal dream salaries compared to men across age groups, academic positions, and disciplines. Although men are 56% overrepresented in the group of top dreamers, their financial expectations are similar compared to women. Among top dreamers, the median dream salary for men is only 5% higher than the median dream salary for women. Across all STEM disciplines combined, men on average expect salaries 19% higher than women (in non-STEM 15%, and in MED only 11%). Strongly research-oriented men expect higher median salaries than strongly research-oriented women; male top performers (the upper 10%) expect higher salaries than female top performers; and male internationalists in research expect higher salaries than female internationalists. Finally, as logistic regression shows, men with a strong research orientation, working in STEM disciplines, and with strong international research collaborations are most likely to be top dreamers.",

          "authors": "Matthias Hümmer",
          "abstract": "Outsourcing has emerged as a strategic approach that allows organizations to improve efficiency, access specialized expertise, and focus on their core business functions. However, these benefits come with significant risks, particularly the potential erosion of internal organizational knowledge and core competencies that are central to a firm's competitive advantage. This article synthesizes literature on outsourcing processes, core competence theory, dynamic capabilities, and knowledge management to propose a comprehensive integrated framework spanning the entire lifecycle of outsourcing arrangements. The framework encompasses four critical phases that are strategic preparation, vendor selection and contracting, transition and integration, and post-transition governance, with particular emphasis on protecting and reinforcing internal knowledge resources. Drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical contributions from leading scholars in the field, we demonstrate how firms can effectively balance outsourcing efficiencies with the imperative to retain essential know-how. The article concludes with theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and directions for future research, providing both scholars and practitioners with a robust model for preserving critical organizational knowledge while capitalizing on external efficiencies.",

          "abstract": "This paper orthogonalizes information symmetry (who holds information) from information completeness (whether available information suffices for a target decision or inference). We formalize two dimensions of completeness: static (relative to a finite time window) and dynamic (absolute, intertemporal). Static incompleteness arises when currently admissible signals are insufficient to identify the target; dynamic incompleteness arises when further, in-scope and decision-relevant information is foreseeably forthcoming. Within a measurable \"scope\" and an information filtration, we define probabilistic relevance as primitive, relate it to decision relevance via Blackwell monotonicity, and characterize static completeness as (approximate) point identification while dynamic completeness requires the absence of any future relevant arrivals. We distinguish institutional regimes—closed versus expandable scope—and show non-confirmability results in expandable scopes: finite evidence cannot certify either the absence of omitted relevant variables (static) or the absence of future relevant information (dynamic). We provide audit-style certificates (sufficient conditions) and falsifiers (stop-tests) for both notions, and connect the framework to partial identification, robust decision-making, rational inattention, and optimal stopping. The key implication is normative and methodological: in open environments, \"best\" actions are conditional and time-indexed rather than absolutely correct, so governance and empirical practice should report identification-set diameters, treat scope as a policy lever, and prefer falsifiable, continuous disclosure over once-and-for-all attestations.",

Social media platforms may serve as modern public spheres, offering spaces for publics to engage in rational and critical discourse. The affordances of social media platforms are crucial in providing such opportunities for dialogue and exchange. In the broader context of mediatization, we examine how platform socio-technological affordances, such as anonymity, reward systems, and moderation guidelines, coupled with user practices, co-shape the way information is produced, framed, and consumed within online communities. This study employs digital ethnography as a method to observe selected subreddits and interviews with their users, focusing on their experiences and perceptions of these digital spaces. Our preliminary findings indicate that, alongside external influences, inherent tensions between social and technological mechanisms simultaneously hinder and contribute to the nature of online deliberation, highlighting fundamental ambivalence as a structural element of online deliberative spaces. Ethical implications of socio-technological affordances are also briefly discussed.",

We then examined the relationships between fluctuations in paddy field use and village-level social, economic, and human capital.\nThe results suggest that in severely affected areas, after controlling for other regional characteristics, social capital had a positive effect on agricultural resilience. \nBy contrast, in areas with relatively minor disaster damage, economic capital had a positive effect, whereas human capital exhibited a negative effect.\nThese findings imply that the effects of different forms of capital are not consistent, and that their impacts on agricultural resilience may vary depending on severity of the physical damage. \nThis study contributes new insights to the fields of social science and disaster research, while also offering methodological advances to these disciplines.",

          "title": "Rebuilding Trust in Medical Science: A Narrative Review and Structural Reform Framework",
          "authors": "Alex Tarnava",
          "abstract": "Background: Public trust in medical science has eroded substantially over the past decade, not merely because of misinformation but due to deeper structural failures embedded within the pharmaceutical, regulatory, and academic ecosystems. Profit-oriented incentives, revolving-door politics, and misaligned academic reward systems have collectively undermined transparency and accountability. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these longstanding weaknesses, exposing how institutional opacity and commercial influence can distort evidence, policy, and ultimately, public confidence.\nMain body: This narrative review synthesizes multidisciplinary evidence from peer-reviewed literature, national surveys, regulatory audits, and governmental investigations to identify systemic determinants of declining trust in medical science. Three domains were examined: (1) commercial practices within the pharmaceutical industry that prioritize shareholder value over patient outcomes; (2) regulatory frameworks compromised by lobbying, capture, and outdated oversight models; and (3) academic systems distorted by publication bias, funding pressures, and privatization of publicly financed discoveries. From this synthesis, a six-point roadmap is proposed to restore institutional credibility, grounded in the principles of transparency, ethics, and accountability. The framework includes independent oversight bodies, reformed approval pathways, enforceable conflict-of-interest standards, equitable funding distribution, open-access academic infrastructures, and a centralized public feedback architecture. Collectively, these measures aim to recalibrate the social contract between science and society, ensuring that biomedical progress is both ethically grounded and publicly accountable.\nConclusion: Restoring trust in medical science requires more than countering misinformation. It demands structural transformation. By embedding transparency into corporate, regulatory, and academic governance, and by aligning scientific enterprise with the public interest rather than private gain, medical science can reclaim its moral authority. It offers an integrated reform blueprint to guide future policy and institutional renewal, reaffirming the ethical foundations upon which scientific credibility must rest.",
