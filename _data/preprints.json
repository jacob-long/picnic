          "abstract": "Various academic stakeholders are currently exploring narrative curriculum vitae (CV) in funding and recruitment to address research culture concerns. In a recent pilot using a randomised controlled trial (RCT), we asked applicants to submit both a standard and a narrative CV when applying to postdoctoral positions at the University of Cambridge, with panel members randomly assigned one format for initial evaluation and ranking. Here, we use this ranking data to develop a multi-layered generative model that simulates different recruitment scenarios by systematically varying the model’s parameters. We analysed the results using a Bayesian Thurstonian model for the analysis of ranked data from multiple raters to test whether parameters were correctly recovered and how the change in parameters affected the uncertainty around model estimates. The results from this process were used to inform the design of the main phase implementation of the pilot study design in a larger sample.",

          "authors": "Thomas E. Devitt",
          "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of fluid reasoning—the ability to solve novel, complex problems in a principled and adaptive manner. This paper introduces and empirically validates the Fluid Emergent Reasoning Engine (FERE-CRS), a novel cognitive architecture designed to foster such capabilities. The architecture is grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its process theory, Active Inference (AIF), which posit that intelligent agents maintain their existence by minimizing surprise through a continuous cycle of perception and action. We address the computational intractability of applying AIF to complex, neuro-symbolic systems by proposing the Cognitive Resonance Score (CRS), a tractable, multi-component heuristic proxy for Variational Free Energy (VFE). The CRS serves as a \"common currency\" for a Meta-Reasoning Agent (MRA) to orchestrate the functions of heterogeneous components, including a Large Language Model (LLM) acting as a versatile cognitive engine. We detail a \"cognitive choreographer\" methodology that makes the validation of this complex architecture tractable and transparent. In a 500-trial experiment on a complex, inferential artifact analysis task, the FERE-CRS agent produced significantly higher-quality explanations (mean score: 8.48/10) and was five times more efficient (mean cost: 610.0 units) than a strong Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) baseline (mean score: 6.71/10; mean cost: 3000.0 units). Furthermore, analysis of the agent’s reasoning trace provides quantitative evidence of AIF-consistent adaptive behavior, demonstrating a clear shift from information-seeking to goal-directed action as uncertainty is resolved. Crucially, we argue that this architecture creates the conditions for transfer learning, enabling the agent to learn abstract, generalizable cognitive strategies that can be applied to entirely novel problems, a key shortcoming of current AI paradigms. This work provides a complete theoretical, architectural, and empirical account of a novel approach to building more intelligent, adaptive, and explainable AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are a leading cause of disease burden in 10-24-year-olds. In Australia, fragmentation within and across sectors (health, mental health and human services) results in gaps in service provision and increases this disease burden. There is an urgent need for reform; however, we need comprehensive and robust methodologies to identify gaps and inefficiencies in service provision to shape policy, ensure efficient allocation of resources and support those most in need. Here we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study involving evaluation of health, mental health, and human service use among Victorian young people with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs. \nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort includes youth aged 12-25 years in the period January 2018 to November 2023. For comparative purposes, we also include data from children aged 5-11 and adults 26-53 for this timeframe. We outline data sources and linkage methodology. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used to identify subgroups with unmet mental health needs.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive examination of the clinical characteristics of young people, their service use behaviours, and typical pathways through care, that cannot be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

          "authors": "Pip Buckingham; Alessandra Chinsen; Lou Kerley; Tim Cronin; Kenneth Pang",
          "abstract": "Importance: Peer-based interventions have been highlighted as a promising way of improving patient outcomes across diverse health services. While previous reviews have examined peer-based programs in specific health services (e.g., mental health, cancer) or with specific populations (e.g., people with HIV), no previous reviews have investigated peer-based programs with a dedicated peer provider role (e.g., peer navigator) for adolescents receiving care in tertiary health services.\nObjective: To describe characteristics of adolescent-focused peer-based programs in paediatric tertiary care or youth health services, and synthesise the available evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, barriers and facilitators of these programs.\nMethods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for empirical studies published between  January 1st, 2015 to May 2nd, 2025. Eligible articles described programs with a dedicated peer role for adolescents under 26 years of age receiving care in a tertiary paediatric or youth health service. A narrative synthesis of the extracted data was conducted to group data into relevant themes.\nFindings: Fifteen studies with a total of 751 participants were included across 16 articles (8 qualitative, 3 quantitative non-randomised, 2 randomised controlled trials, and 3 mixed methods). One-third of studies (n=5; all qualitative designs) met all quality criteria. There was significant heterogeneity in the peer-based interventions in terms of health contexts (e.g., HIV, oncology, disability), format (one-on-one, group or hybrid), delivery (face-to-face, online, or pre-recorded video), and characteristics of peer roles (group facilitation, one-on-one sessions, referrals, appointment attendance, training, supervision and embeddedness within clinical teams). Most adolescents and service providers deemed interventions to be feasible and acceptable. Peer roles were seen as a key source of social support and role modelling which facilitated adolescents’ health-related learning, self-management and comfort in participating in health care or group interventions. Key barriers included technical issues (e.g., virtual delivery), non-cohesive group dynamics, poor understanding of peer navigator roles among clinicians, and irrelevant or non-tailored program content. Facilitators included comprehensive training and supervision for peer navigators and flexible, adolescent-centred program delivery and recruitment strategies. Quantitative evidence for the effectiveness of peer interventions was mixed; however, qualitative reports highlighted improvements in psychosocial wellbeing.\nConclusions and Relevance: Peer-based programs with a dedicated peer role appear to feasible and acceptable to adolescents and service providers, although not without barriers to implementation. More high-quality research is necessary to clarify the effectiveness of these programs for adolescents receiving care in tertiary care or youth health services.",

          "abstract": "SciArt is an evolving field that seeks to bring together art and science. Numerous SciArt spaces and initiatives exist, bridging the gap between the two and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. However, personal and interpersonal obstacles have been identified for both artists and scientists within the context of SciArt collaborations and environments. Here, we first introduce key concepts about SciArt and then leverage theories from social psychology in the study of group dynamics, including social and group identity, group norms, and minority dissent and influence, to examine artist-scientist collaborations and their challenges. Drawing on social psychology frameworks, our goal is to inform and encourage the creation of Third Spaces that identify common ground between practitioners, foster balanced interactions, build shared group identity and new group dynamics, and ultimately move beyond discipline-specific identities and institutionalized environments.",

          "authors": "Arie Todd Greenleaf",
          "abstract": "Plant cognition has progressed from anecdote to rigor, yet the field still lacks a quantitative test for when distributed plant activity crosses into unified—perhaps conscious—processing. I introduce Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), a substrate-agnostic metric rooted in Dynergeia, a relation-first ontology that defines consciousness as reflexive coherence among five universal patterns—self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness and flux—phase-locked inside a system’s binding window (τ). Each pattern is operationalized with established signal-processing measures; their mean strength is multiplied by their mean synergy and released only if a τ-specific coherence gate is met.\nThree preregistered hypotheses anchor the study: H1 baseline PTS &gt; 0 in intact plants; H2 4 % diethyl-ether collapses PTS below threshold φ; H3 PTS rebounds on wash-out. A multispecies protocol—Mimosa pudica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Picea abies—combines 64-channel surface electrodes, glutamate-sensitive Ca²⁺ imaging and micro-optode O₂/heat-flux probes. Sliding 3 × τ windows with phase-shuffled surrogates yield z-scored PTS trajectories, adjudicated by preregistered effect-size criteria.\nBy turning decades of qualitative insight into falsifiable numbers, PTS offers plant biology a litmus test for conscious-level processing, directly challenges Integrated Information Theory and supplies a road-map for cross-kingdom comparisons—including neuromorphic silicon. Confirmatory results would shift debates on plant sentience from speculation to data; null results would equally refine what consciousness requires.",

          "authors": "Brian B. Drwecki",
          "abstract": "Building on critical cultural approaches to racism—including Phillips and Lowery’s theory of herd invisibility—we tested Mary Church Terrell’s Functional Diversion Hypothesis: the idea that the cultural image of the poor white bigot creates perceptual invisibility for the most privileged white individuals, particularly when they engage in actions that uphold, construct racist systems and personal benefit. Across three experiments, activating the “poor white bigot” prototype reduced perceptions of racism in gentrifiers who engaged in acts of displacement, exclusion, and gatekeeping in the housing market—actions that disproportionately harmed Black individuals and communities. While the focus was on white participants (Experiments 1–3), Functional Diversion was also observed in Black participants (Experiment 3). A cumulative meta-analysis revealed a small but reliable effect (Cohen’s d = .34; 95% CI of Cohen’s d = [.17, .51], p &lt; .001), consistent with the median effect size in psychological science. Results are discussed in terms of cultural mechanisms of invisibility, the psychological function of racist prototypes, and how such imagery may shield contemporary racist systems, political movements, and individuals from scrutiny.",

          "abstract": "Why does research find that girls demonstrate stronger, more negative associations between\nsocial media use and well-being compared to boys? Applying a gendered lens to processes of\nsocial media and adolescent well-being, this study empirically examined two common\nexplanations for gendered patterns in these processes; differences between the experiences and\ncontext of boys and girls, or that girls often use social media more frequently than boys. Using\nintensive longitudinal data collected from N = 97 adolescents living in the United States and a\nDynamic Structural Equation Modeling framework, we found limited evidence that social media\nuse was related to well-being, or that gendered facets of adolescents’ social context moderated\nthese associations. However, we did find that two gendered facets of adolescents’ social media\nexperiences, frequency of use and unwanted exposure to sexually explicit content, were both\nnegatively associated with the stability of adolescents’ sense of purpose. This finding points to\nalternative within-person processes, where instead of a direct causal relationship between social\nmedia use and well-being, social media use and experiences are related to the stability of\nadolescents’ well-being.",

          "authors": "Geraldine O'Bryan; Sarah M. Tashjian",
          "abstract": "Women are disproportionately affected by poor sleep, both in terms of how much sleep they get (quantity) and how disturbed that sleep is (quality). One relatively unexplored association with poor sleep is adverse childhood experiences, which also disproportionately affect women. How childhood adversity affects sleep in adult women is not well understood, partly because of opacity in the way prior research considers different types of adversity. Prior research has emphasized cumulative approaches, treating all adverse experiences as equivalent and overlooking how different adversities may manifest in adult health problems. We investigated how adversity differentially contributed to sleep issues in a sample of treatment-seeking women (N=329), utilizing both cumulative and person-centered, dimensional analytic approaches. Latent class analysis revealed four distinct adversity profiles: ‘emotional/physical abuse’, ‘household dysfunction’, ‘high ACEs’, and ‘low ACEs’. Sleep symptom analysis identified two subgroups: high and low sleep issues. Women classified within the abuse-related and high-ACE subgroups reported worse sleep, while those in the abuse profile did so even when their total cumulative adversity scores did not reach conventional clinical thresholds. These findings suggest that specific patterns of childhood adversity—particularly abuse—uniquely contribute to adult sleep issues among women and can be missed using only cumulative scoring methods. This study underscores the importance of dimensional, subtype-focused approaches to ACE research and highlights the enduring impact of childhood adversity on women’s lifelong sleep health.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

          "abstract": "Learning others’ emotional patterns facilitates social functioning. Do emotion prediction failures then negatively influence interpersonal connection? In two studies we investigated whether atypicality of a target’s emotions influences how much others like them. Participants (N = 1,250) completed a task where they observed the emotional transitions of a target before predicting their next emotion. In the task, we manipulated emotional transition probabilities to model differences in emotional typicality and measured participants’ prediction accuracy and target liking. In study 1, we found that a target with normative emotion transition probabilities was more liked than a target with random emotion transitions, while a target with atypical emotions was least liked. In study 2, we investigated different aspects of atypical emotion transitions (predictability of the next emotion, overall frequency of positive emotions, and valence volatility) found that each aspect influenced learning accuracy, but variation in liking was only related to valence volatility and frequency of positive states. These results inform what processes underly interpersonal bonding or dysfunction.",

          "authors": "Oren Shriki; Inbal Algom",
          "abstract": "The quest to understand consciousness has spawned numerous theories, each offering unique perspectives but none achieving universal acceptance. While these theories provide valuable insights, they often serve more as guiding narratives than mechanistic frameworks for empirical validation. Here, we propose that incorporating critical brain dynamics—the idea that neural networks operate near a critical transition point—may offer a more cohesive understanding of consciousness. We term this hypothesis the ConCrit framework, combining the concepts of consciousness and criticality. By reviewing empirical evidence and computational models, we suggest that near-critical systems exhibit many properties aligned with leading theories of consciousness. Specifically, approaching a critical point enhances the complexity and richness of internal representations and heightens sensitivity to the system’s own state. Consequently, a system capable of conscious experience is more likely to exhibit consciousness near criticality and lose it as it deviates from this regime. In this paper, we review the concepts of criticality and critical brain dynamics, explore their relationship with consciousness from theoretical and empirical perspectives, and outline key implications and predictions.",

          "abstract": "The current research report examines the extent to which lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB), and transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) older adults are represented in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) relative to Canadian population data. To accomplish this aim, we descriptively and statistically compared LGB and TGD representation in the CLSA against national-level data from the 2023 Canadian Community Health Survey and 2021 Canadian Census. We found that bisexual people, transgender men, and transgender women were underrepresented in the CLSA (0.66% for bisexual people, and 0.01% each for transgender men and women) compared to national-level data (0.95% for bisexual people, 0.05% for transgender men, and 0.09% for transgender women). However, lesbian/gay and nonbinary participants were adequately represented in the CLSA (2.01% for lesbian/gay and 0.02% for nonbinary people) relative to national-level data (1.87% for lesbian/gay and 0.03% for nonbinary people). Varying assessment methods for sexual orientation and gender identity across CLSA waves complicate analyses but underscore evolving inclusivity efforts in longitudinal research. Based on our analyses, we detail recommendations for researchers using the CLSA to examine health outcomes and resilience factors among LGB and TGD populations, even with small sample sizes. Ultimately, these findings highlight the necessity of robust, inclusive data to inform interventions and support policy decisions for older LGB and TGD populations.",

          "abstract": "Similarity in mental, linguistic representations modulates the degree of recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms, which have been linked to neurocognitive adaptations in bilingual populations. While ample evidence exists for this claim, its coverage is limited, as testing is geared towards WEIRD communities that use sizeable, Indo-European languages, thus potentially providing a biased view of bilingual cognition. We assess the role of distance as a key moderator of bilingual adaptations through a large-scale aggregation analysis of 510 experiments. To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank. Analyzing data from 56,122 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect. Our results suggest that moderators such as language distance can shed light on the cognitive divide between language and dialects in a way that addresses the perennial question of what makes bilinguals distinct.",

Specifically, we investigated learners’ use of multiword expressions in terms of five different measures of collocability: phrase frequency, mutual information, log dice and two measures of Delta P, as functions of two key learner-related variables: proficiency levels, and the word-order typology of learners’ L1s. We also examined the accuracy in learners’ use of multiword expressions. The results of our mixed-effects models revealed a complex picture. While highly proficient learners use multiword expressions more accurately, they do not always produce more frequent and idiomatic outputs. Typological similarity between learners’ L1s and Portuguese do not consistently result in more idiomatic multiword expression use. \n\nKeywords: Multiword expressions; learner corpora; collocations; association measures; Portuguese, usage-based approaches",

          "abstract": "Objective: Worry plays an important role in anxiety disorders, but its neurodevelopment remains unclear. Worry increases during adolescence when cognitive-affective neural circuits are developing, impacting girls especially. Activity of and connectivity between amygdala and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus play an important role in anxiety symptoms, and amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) connectivity subserves emotion regulation. Here, we examined how functional changes in these circuits related to age, sex, and anxiety symptoms among adolescents and young adults using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI.\nMethod: 25 (13 female) 12-17 years-old adolescents and 44 (31 male) 18-31 years-old young adults completed fMRI worry induction and reappraisal tasks previously used in adults. Brain activity was extracted from a priori regions of interest in amygdala, PVN and vmPFC, and connectivity was calculated using generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI).\nResults: Contrary to hypotheses, amygdala activity in the Worry condition was positively correlated with age. In partial confirmation of hypotheses, female participants had elevated Worry – Neutral PVN activity (driven by lower Neutral activity), but elevated amygdala-vmPFC connectivity during Reappraisal than male participants. In exploratory analyses, female participants had elevated amygdala-PVN connectivity during Reappraisal compared to male participants.  \nConclusion: Adolescents utilize less amygdala-centered networks during worry than adults, suggesting that interventions designed for adults may not translate directly to adolescents. Female individuals show increased PVN recruitment and amygdala-PVN activity during worry, which could predispose them to more somatic symptoms of anxiety. Results may inform clinical presentation and interventions for anxiety disorders.",

          "abstract": "Across both living and non-living systems, a wide range of phenomena—from enzymatic reactions and neural adaptation to thermal relaxation and radioactive decay—exhibit saturating response behaviors. In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

          "abstract": "All biological and physical systems respond to stimuli. But until now, no unified law has described how these responses arise under fundamental constraints. In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature. We conclude that a universal response law exists—and it is rational.",

We asked whether teachers, on average, deliver Pathways-to-Success with fidelity and which teacher-level and school-level factors shaped fidelity. Ninety-two schools (203 teachers, 6,189 students) had sufficient data to score fidelity and code school-level predictors. Implementation support mattered–teachers averaged above-threshold fidelity and engaged with training, preparation, and delivery aids. Engagement (consistently preparing with the manual, not neglecting manualized delivery-time marks) bolstered fidelity, as did urbanicity, student math proficiency, and positive school climate. Despite this variability in school-level factors, on average, teachers delivered with fidelity. Providing teacher support is worthwhile and should be institutionalized as part of program delivery.",

          "abstract": "Here we propose a roadmap for addressing hierarchical predictive coding theory (hPC) in the primate brain, theorizing that perception arises from the integration of top-down (TD) pathways carrying priors and predictions with bottom-up (BU) pathways carrying sensory evidence in the form of precision weighted prediction errors. However, given the conceptual importance of hPC for higher cognitive function in humans there is surprisingly little evidence concerning the location and functional mechanisms underlying such BU-TD integration. This will be overcome by parallel experiments in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Molecular characterization in NHP of cortico-cortical BU and TD projection cell types should allow tracing these circuits and exerting causal control to explore functional mechanisms in visual paradigms in behaving NHPs. Similar paradigms in human subjects undergoing ultra-high field laminar fMRI scanning will allow investigation of corresponding pathways in the human brain. In NHP and human, the observation of long-distance TD signals carrying predictions suggest that the claustrum may be involved in hPC. Recent connectomic and transcriptomic characterisation of cortical claustral cortical loops may enable a similar approach to explore these pathways. Specifically, we hypothesize that the claustrum is uniquely positioned to mediate the precision-weighting of prediction errors in the sense of selecting salient (bottom-up) signals that drive representational or belief updating in cortical hierarchies. Progress in primate hPC will further emphasise the synergy between neurobiology and artificial intelligence with important consequences for both domains.",

          "abstract": "Touch is a multifaceted sense essential for both sensory discrimination and social communication. While most experimental research has focused on mechanically controlled, object-mediated stimulation, the ecological and neural relevance of direct skin-to-skin contact remains underexplored particularly in EEG studies. This study investigated Event-Related Potentials (ERP) to tactile stimuli delivered to the hairy forearm innervated by both Aβ and C-tactile (CT) afferents under two protocols: tapping and stroking. Each protocol included human-delivered tactile stimulations, with a “complex” object-mediated condition and a “social” skin-to-skin condition, and in the tapping protocol an additional automated mechanical condition. Our results demonstrate the methodological feasibility and neurophysiological reliability of using ecological human-delivered touch in EEG research. Robust ERP components (P50, N80, P200) were elicited in the tapping protocol and were not modulated by condition. In the stroking protocol, we found a P300 and an Ultra-Late-Potential (ULP), consistent with CT activation. Unexpectedly, both the P300 and the ULP showed greater amplitudes in the “complex” (object-mediated) compared to the “social” (skin-to-skin) condition. We propose that the salience or textural features of the object may have elicited enhanced perceptive and attentional processing. More generally, this study highlights the importance of accounting for inter-individual variability in the study of touch and emphasizes the need for greater consideration of ecologically valid touch, especially in the context of social touch.",

          "abstract": "Student wellbeing remains significantly lower than that of the general population. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated longstanding academic and financial stressors, now further compounded by a global ‘polycrisis’, including the impacts of economic instability, geopolitical uncertainty, artificial intelligence, and the climate crisis. While positive psychology has shown promise for enhancing wellbeing in higher education, traditional curricula have overemphasised individual wellbeing, neglecting wider considerations. To address this, a third-wave positive psychology course, grounded in a modern meta-framework of wellbeing, was developed, integrating individual, collective, and planetary domains. The current, pre-registered, quasi-experimental, mixed-effects study analysed data from 324 participants recruited across five academic cohorts (2020/21 to 2024/25) to determine the impact of the course on multiple wellbeing measures. A protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework. Analysis involved mixed-effects ANOVAs, Bayesian outputs, internal random split-half replication, and mediation analysis. Results demonstrated significant improvements in wellbeing among intervention participants compared to controls. Critically, these findings were robust to various sensitivity analyses including internal replication using random split-half sub-sampling and across pandemic and non-pandemic cohorts. Significant increases in self-transcendence were also observed among intervention participants, partially accounting for wellbeing gains. These findings provide empirical support for a scalable, holistic wellbeing intervention that is robust to contemporary challenges, laying the foundations for inner development on which positive sustainable futures may be promoted.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground. Speeding is a well-documented contributor to crash risk. Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA), an in-car system that helps drivers remain within the speed limit, is becoming more common in vehicles. Current systems typically allow drivers to disable or override ISA, which may limit its potential safety impact. This paper examines associations between personality, driving attitudes, and willingness to use ISA among UK drivers.\n\nMethod.  Participants (N = 176; 69.3% female; M age = 38.61, SD = 13.97), all of whom held a full UK driving licence with a mean of 20 years (SD = 13.5 years) of driving experience, completed an online questionnaire assessing their willingness to avoid using ISA and their willingness to override the system. Participants also completed measures of attitudes to driving violations, impulsivity, sensation seeking, and the Big 5 personality traits. \n\nResults. Attitudes to violations accounted for most of the variance in both willingness to avoid ISA and willingness to override it, with agreeableness having an indirect effect through attitudes to driving violations. Motor impulsivity was independently related to willingness to override the system.  \n\nConclusions. These findings highlight a key challenge to realising the full potential safety impact of ISA. Drivers with positive attitudes toward violations, those who would benefit most from ISA, are also the most likely to avoid using or override the system. Potential technical, financial, and educational methods to address this challenge are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Nearly every aspect of modern life has become a data-generating event, with many activities leaving behind traces as byproducts that are logged by platforms or devices. These trace data offer researchers powerful tools for studying communication, enabling greater granularity and specificity, real-time and in-situ collection, and reduced reliance on self-report or perceptual judgment. However, these benefits are accompanied by significant challenges, including biases in data sources, ethical concerns related to privacy and consent, methodological hurdles in data collection and analysis, and possible (mis)matches between observable constructs in traces and those that are theoretically interesting. This chapter provides a foundational overview of trace data in communication research. It systematizes trace data by distinguishing traces as either 1) usage logs or 2) sensor readings. Usage logs are further characterized along platform vs. device sources and content vs. metadata dimensions. Sensor data are classified as either contextual or physiological, and as continuous or episodic in temporal resolution. For these traces, the chapter discusses data sources, collection methods, and associated opportunities and limitations. Alongside these methodological aspects, the chapter emphasizes the importance of theoretical grounding in guiding the use and interpretation of trace data in communication research.",

Results found over-generation of rarer outcomes and under-generation of common outcomes overall but not in initial responses, as well as avoidance of direct repetitions. Participants also tended to select options with higher average utility across their responses, implying generations guided choice. These findings suggest systematic biases in mental sampling that may filter through to choices, constraining models of this behaviour. We thus suggest random generation is a valuable method to access underlying choice processes, offering new assessments of existing theories of decision making.",

          "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, has revolutionized how we access information. These LLMs can answer a wide array of questions on nearly any topic. When humans answer questions, especially difficult or uncertain questions, they often accompany their responses with metacognitive confidence judgments indicating their belief in their accuracy. LLMs are certainly capable of providing confidence judgments, but it is currently unclear how accurate these confidence judgments are. To fill this gap in the literature, the present studies investigate the capability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty through confidence judgments. We compare the absolute and relative accuracy of confidence judgments made by four LLMs (ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, Sonnet, Haiku) and human participants in both domains of aleatory uncertainty - NFL predictions (Study 1; n = 502), and Oscar predictions (Study 2; n = 109) – and domains of epistemic uncertainty - Pictionary performance (Study 3; n = 164), Trivia questions (Study 4; n = 110), and questions about life at a university (Study 5; n = 110). We find several commonalities between LLMs and humans, such as achieving similar levels of absolute and relative metacognitive accuracy (although LLMs tend to be slightly more accurate on both dimensions). Like humans, we also find that LLMs tend to be overconfident. However, we find that, unlike humans, LLMs – especially ChatGPT and Gemini –  often fail to adjust their confidence judgments based on past performance, highlighting a key metacognitive limitation.",

          "abstract": "Impersonal prosociality is considered a cornerstone of a thriving civic society, well-functioning institutions, and a growing economy. Previous research has documented substantial cross-societal variation in prosociality using tasks such as dictator games, where individuals allocate money between themselves and others. In such tasks, individuals typically receive full information about how decisions impact others and make decisions privately. Here, we propose that different societies rely on distinct mechanisms—guilt and internalized norms versus shame and external pressures—to support prosociality. We conducted a pre-registered experiment with 7,978 participants in 20 culturally diverse countries across five continents. We administered dictator games and experimentally manipulated guilt, by varying information about the consequences of participants’ decisions (full versus hidden), and shame, by varying observability (public versus private). Additionally, we measured the Importance of Guilt over Shame (IGS) at the individual and country level.  We found robust evidence for guilt-driven prosociality around the world, such that prosociality increased substantially when individuals received information by default compared to when they could avoid it. Further, providing information led to a stronger increase in prosociality among individuals, though not countries, scoring higher on IGS. In contrast, making decisions observable by third parties had only small effects on prosocial choices. Our study provides a first comprehensive investigation of how guilt and shame influence prosocial decision-making, and uncovers both similarities and differences in mechanisms to promote prosociality across countries.",

          "authors": "Myung Ho Kim",
          "abstract": "We report the discovery of a meaningful structural convergence among four influential theories of mind—Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind—through their unintentional but systematic emergence in a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow. Originally designed to overcome critical limitations of large language models (LLMs), this architecture consists of five interlocking modules—Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action—organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although initially inspired only by Minsky and Clark's frameworks, our structural analysis reveals that Agentic Flow partially mirrors core computational patterns described by each of the four theories, suggesting a limited but notable structural convergence. To evaluate this convergence, we conducted controlled experiments comparing structured agents to baseline LLM-based systems across multi-step, conditional reasoning tasks. The structured agent consistently achieved 95.8% task success and demonstrated robust constraint adherence, whereas the baseline system exhibited a 62.3% success rate under the same conditions. While based on a proprietary implementation, evaluation protocols are made available for verification. These experiments were not conducted merely to demonstrate performance advantages, but to qualitatively reveal how theoretical convergence can arise organically through implementation demands rather than deliberate design.\nWe present PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that retrospectively draws attention to recurring computational patterns—such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control—identified in Agentic Flow. Rather than offering a formal theory or aiming to supplant existing frameworks, PEACE serves as a practical abstraction that surfaces design-level regularities seen across otherwise divergent cognitive architectures. Its value lies not in theoretical unification, but in framing a shared vocabulary for analyzing and constructing cognitive systems shaped by real-world implementation demands.\nOur findings have implications for cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind. They suggest that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns, shaped not by theory but by the demands of real-world reasoning under uncertainty. We argue that Agentic Flow may offer a partial instantiation—or structural echo—of Newell’s long-sought \"unified theory of cognition,\" discovered not through abstraction, but through necessity. By ‘partial instantiation,’ we do not imply theoretical alignment but structural features independently anticipated by multiple cognitive theories. We emphasize that the observed convergence reflects architectural motifs rather than theoretical completeness.\nThis paper should be read as a position paper—an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface latent architectural commonalities across divergent cognitive theories, rather than a claim of theoretical unification.",

          "abstract": "Successful learning often emerges through social interaction. What are the neural and behavioural systems that support this process? This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning with detailed behavioural and physiological measures to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying real-time face-to-face social learning. Twenty-seven teacher–learner dyads engaged in teaching and learning facts about unfamiliar items while we recorded their speech, breathing, head movement, gaze behaviour, and cortical brain activity using fNIRS. Learning was supported by teacher-learner inter-brain synchrony (INS), over regions important for mutual understanding (TPJ) and communicative coordination (PMv). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the relationship between INS and learning with opposite effects. To explain this, we propose a dual-process model. When teacher and learner are not yet aligned, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low INS in regions for mutual understanding (TPJ) and coordination (right PMv), and high INS in language-related areas (left PMv). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high INS in systems for mutual understanding (TPJ). These findings suggest that different social behaviours engage distinct patterns of brain-to-brain coupling that support learning through different cognitive dynamics. Cross-brain general linear modelling (xGLM) further revealed asymmetric neural dependencies tied to speaking and teaching roles within the left-hemisphere language network. Crucially, these effects persisted after accounting for nodding, gaze, and breathing, demonstrating that INS reflects genuine social-cognitive alignment rather than mere sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated brain–body dynamics and positions INS as a marker of mutual prediction during social interaction.",

Thirty youth with ADHD (mean age = 12.5 years; 33% female) were enrolled and completed up to 20 VR training sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. The intervention targeted four key cognitive domains implicated in ADHD: impulse control, working memory, temporal processing and processing speed. Clinician-rated inattention symptoms and associated functional impairments, based on interviews with parents, showed significant pre–post improvements (symptoms: t(25.90) = -5.60, p &lt; .001; d = -1.05; impairment: t(25.68) = -3.29, p = .003; d = -0.62). The intervention was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events such as occasional headaches and brief frustration. Usability ratings were high for parents and moderate for youth. Significant near-transfer effects were observed on tasks of impulse control (t (23.49) = -2.86, p = .009; d = -0.56) and processing speed (t(24.06) = 3.40, p = .002; d = 0.66). These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective approach for children with ADHD. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm efficacy and examine durability of effects.",

          "abstract": "Beliefs influence the intensity of felt pain. We previously applied regression models to two independent pain-cueing datasets (https://osf.io/5r6z7/) and found that pain intensity reports were a function of the error between participants’ belief, as determined by cues that informed participants about the level of forthcoming noxious stimulation, and the actual stimulation intensity, such that greater error decreased the influence of prior beliefs. Although this result appeared to present a challenge to established models of perception, our analysis did not formally compare the result against established computational models. This made it difficult to assess the validity of our results against the wider literature and we could not explain why the effect of information cues changed over the course of the task. In the current study (https://osf.io/fj27k/) we compared a model that corresponded to our original interpretation where pain ratings were considered a function of prediction error size, against Bayesian reinforcement learning models. Pain ratings were best explained by a model in which the expected value of each information cue was updated via a Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm. These new results indicate that deception pain studies should not assume that participants’ belief about the information they are given is fixed. Rather, our results provide evidence that the meaning of cues change dynamically over the course of the session through trial-by-trial updates, even when participants are instructed otherwise.",

Yet, there is currently no precise, unifying account of what it means to feel in control. Here, we propose that humans feel in control when they are ready to tackle tasks that may arise in the future. We formalize this perspective via a precise yet interpretable measure of controllability that quantifies three key factors: (i) the range of available actions, (ii) the certainty or (iii) the possibility of achieving desired outcomes. This measure unifies previous conceptions of control and successfully predicts human preferences in two experiments in which participants prepare themselves to seek rewards or avoid punishments. Our framework offers a principled foundation for understanding how environmental structure shapes the human sense of control, paving the way towards an integrative science of agency.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness in young people has become a global health issue, yet there is little data on the frequency with which children (especially under 10 years old) experience loneliness, and how loneliness associates with mental and physical health (e.g., somatic pain, internalising, externalising symptoms) at this important developmental juncture. It is also unclear whether widely used measures of loneliness can accurately capture these experiences in pre-adolescents. We investigated loneliness in 849 children (M = 8.76 years old, SD = 0.95) in East London and explored links between loneliness and their mental and physical health. Children self-reported on their levels of loneliness, mental and physical health; and teachers reported on children’s internalising and externalising problems. We estimated the psychometric properties of the 3-item UCLA-3A and the ONS direct measure of loneliness (ONS-1), explored loneliness links with demographic characteristics, and fit a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to test the associations of loneliness, mental health, and physical health. We found that the UCLA-3A showed acceptable internal consistency, and the ONS-1 showed a significant relationship to the UCLA-3A. There were no significant differences between any demographic groups, though age was significantly negatively correlated with loneliness. SEM showed that loneliness was significantly associated with all mental health symptoms, somatic pain, and some externalising and internalising symptoms. Our findings demonstrate that loneliness is a common experience amongst primary school aged children. Moreover, mental health, physical health, and internalising and externalising behaviours are cross-sectionally related to childhood loneliness.",

This protocol describes a novel, community-engaged, modified concurrent mixed-methods design to investigate factors of neighborhood structural risk and resilience (NSRR) in relation to substance use and neurocognition among Hispanic adolescents living in neighborhoods with unequal opportunities and restricted access to resources. We propose a design for integrating primary qualitative data with secondary data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, the largest longitudinal adolescent cohort in the United States. Guided by community-engaged research practices, and socio-ecological and health disparities frameworks, the protocol centers on the experience of young adolescents. Our design prioritizes partnerships among academic, community, and grassroots organizations to co-develop study design conceptualization, recruitment and analysis plan, along with the interpretation and dissemination of results. The secondary quantitative data analysis leverages advanced statistical modeling to examine relationships between neighborhood level factors and substance use, providing measurable insights both at the population level and at the neighborhood level. Qualitative interviews with adolescents provide an opportunity for collecting a rich, community-grounded perspective that captures the lived experience of adolescents in how neighborhood factors shape adolescent health behaviors. Findings will be integrated using methodological triangulation and shared through academic, community-facing, and policy channels. This protocol highlights the importance of a community-engaged mixed-methods design that strengthens the cultural relevance, actionability, and validity of adolescent substance use research by embedding community voices throughout all phases of the research process.",

          "abstract": "Joint attention (JA) deficits are frequently one of the earliest indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), making them a crucial focus for early interventions. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has emerged as a promising tool in this area, offering immersive environments that could enhance JA skills in children with ASD. This study protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a VR-based intervention for improving JA skills in school-aged children with autism. The trial will involve children aged 6 to 12 years, who will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group, receiving VR therapy in addition to standard interventions, or a control group, receiving sham therapy plus standard interventions. The VR intervention consists of specialized scenarios delivered through a VR headset, with JA skills and social-communication behaviors being the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. JA skills will be measured using the Childhood Joint Attention Rating Scale (C-JARS) and a cross-validation tool within the VR environment, while social-communication behaviors will be assessed using the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, Third Edition (GARS-3). The study began recruiting participants in October 2023, with results expected by early 2025. This trial aims to provide valuable insights into the potential of VR as a supplemental therapy for enhancing JA skills and improving social-communication behaviors in children with ASD.",

          "abstract": "The rapid digitalization of healthcare has led to the widespread availability of mobile health (mHealth) applications, including those aimed at mental health. The present study followed the PRISMA guidelines and systematically reviewed mental health apps available in the Google Play Store to evaluate their functional quality and behavior change potential. It utilized the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to assess app quality, including engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality, and the App Behavior Change Scale (ABACUS) to evaluate the potential for behavior change by inclusion of behavior change techniques (BCTs). A total of 77 apps were reviewed, with findings indicating an average functional quality and moderate behavior change potential as the reviewed apps only utilized a limited amount of BCTs. Notably, only a small fraction of apps had been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Further analysis showed that MARS and ABACUS scores had limited predictive power regarding app popularity as measured by stars awarded by users and number of user ratings in the Google Play Store. The study highlights the need for more rigorous testing of mHealth apps and suggests that factors beyond those measured by MARS and ABACUS may influence app popularity. In addition to the scientific value, this review provides insights for both users seeking effective mental health support and developers aiming to enhance the quality and impact of mental health applications.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that imprecise multisensory temporal processing is associated with a range of adverse clinical outcomes. Specifically, this research has shown that the temporal binding window of audiovisual integration widens with advancing age, while individuals with various neurodevelopmental disorders exhibit distinctive profiles of multisensory processing when compared to their neurotypical counterparts. While this line of research has made significant inroads in emphasising the importance of multisensory processing in both typical and atypical cognition, the field would greatly benefit from the validation of web-based tools for assessing multisensory temporal processing, enabling larger sample sizes and the recruitment of typically hard-to-reach populations. In this study, we assessed the reliability of a web-based version of the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI) and examined the level of agreement between the measurements of the temporal binding window that it produces relative to those derived from the SIFI task performed under standard laboratory conditions. Our results demonstrate that both versions of the task elicit a robust SIFI effect, and show a similar dependency on the stimulus onset asynchronies between the audiovisual stimuli. Furthermore, our analysis revealed strong correlations between the estimated measurements of both the width and peak amplitude of the temporal binding window derived from the online and lab-based task versions, affirming the suitability of the web-based task for assessing multisensory function. Future studies should extend the evaluation of this online implementation of the SIFI to clinical populations to further evaluate its potential for adoption in clinical settings.",

However, important questions remain about its validity, specifically about whether participants respond according to the frequency they experience symptoms or the frequency with which they are bothered by the symptoms.\n\nObjective: To investigate how participants understand and respond to the PHQ, which asks participants “how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems”, but then only emphasizes frequency (from ‘not at all’ to ‘nearly every day’) in the response options.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62) and from a clinical sample with medium to high depression collected within the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.48, SD=12.13). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\n\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ, participants’ interpretation of PHQ instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on frequency of their symptoms, the frequency with which the symptoms bothered them, or taking both into consideration; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future (based on these same three options). \n\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (MTurk) and 15.5% (OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ correctly (the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% and 11.5% of participants interpreted the PHQ correctly, and only 22.3% and 10.0% reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings raise serious concerns that the majority of participants in general and clinical population samples might not be adhering to PHQ instructions to score how often symptoms bothered them.

          "abstract": "Episodes of extreme alcohol binge-drinking can result in memory loss, transient anterograde amnesic experiences known as memory blackouts (MBO). The current study investigates whether recognition memory is impacted by frequency of blackout experiences, and if false memories are more likely for those who regularly experience blackouts (n = 29) in comparison to a control group (n = 24) who had never experienced an MBO. Participants completed a recognition memory paradigm (a modified DRM task: Roediger &amp; McDermott, (1995)), with a follow-up remember/know/guess judgement, before-alcohol and after-alcohol in the same testing session, while the MBO group (n = 23) additionally completed the task in a subsequent testing session within 20-hours of a blackout, but when sober again. Both groups displayed reduced discrimination (d’) between old and new words and a more conservative response strategy after-alcohol, which remained for MBO participants after-MBO. Critical lure words elicited more false-alarms than weakly related or unrelated words, yet the overall frequency of false-alarms dropped after-alcohol and remained depressed after blackout for the MBO group. Critically, decile analysis revealed significant shifts in d’ for early deciles (1st-6th), suggesting impairment to recognition memory after-MBO; severity of individual MBO experiences may impact these results, although it is not possible to attribute them solely to blackout events. Future work should investigate whether adults with a longer history of alcohol-induced memory blackout experiences display an impairment in recollection and familiarity, or show atypical false memory acceptance rates.",

          "abstract": "Patient-reported measurement is central to clinical psychology, and is widely used in mental healthcare, research, and policy. A widespread assumption is that patient scores can be interpreted prior to, and independently of, the ways in which scores are used. This assumption is rooted in a ‘knowledge-first’ approach to evaluating measurement quality: first, gain knowledge about patients’ symptoms or functioning, then apply this knowledge for the purpose of a study or an intervention. We show that this approach distorts score interpretation and is harmful to patients. Rather than a passive channel for gathering information, patient-reported measurement in clinical psychology is a social technology, that is, a tool for intervening on individuals and society at large. Score interpretation is an ongoing meaning-making process that unfolds differently depending on the interaction between a patient and a measurement practice. We outline six principles (acronym: M-SPACE) for designing responsible measurement practices, where data interpretation and use are aligned with the attainment of desirable individual and social goods. The quality of patient-reported data depends on their contribution to the attainment of such goods, rather than on their ability to reflect a latent trait or disorder.",

          "abstract": "Effort-based decision-making is a highly studied topic that investigates how agents allocate resources to exert physical or mental effort to overcome task difficulty and obtain a reward. However, designing experiments investigating effort-based decision-making is complex, as the experimenter needs to ensure that all participants experience the same task difficulty, regardless of their prior proficiency in the task. While effective methods for solving this problem have been proposed for physical tasks, participant-specific calibration of task difficulty in a mental effort task remains challenging, above all if the calibration procedure needs to be implemented in a short time window to minimize the overall duration of the experiment. In this manuscript, we propose a novel and computationally lightweight method, named Fast Difficulty Calibration algorithm, that allows for the fast calibration of task difficulty by dynamically adapting the response time limit during trial execution. We test this method on a mental arithmetic task with four difficulty levels, and show that only 20 calibration trials are sufficient to make the subjective task difficulty similar for all the participants.",

We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses.

          "abstract": "Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been consistently linked to poor mental health outcomes, yet research on their impact in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) resource settings of Africa, remain relatively unexplored. In Kenya, where childhood adversity is widespread, there is a critical need to examine the validity of ACE measures and their associations with mental ill health.\nObjective: This study aimed to validate the ACE questionnaire in a Kenyan adolescent sample and assess its associations with symptoms of depression and anxiety, bullying, and sociodemographic factors.\nParticipants and Setting: Data was collected from N = 2,842 adolescents and young adults aged 11 - 25 years attending 42 secondary schools across four counties in Kenya. \nMethods: We conducted Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the ACE questionnaire. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between ACEs and sociodemographic factors, bullying , depressive (PHQ-8) and anxiety(GAD-7) symptoms.\nResults: EFA initially yielded a three-factor model, but a two-factor model provided better fit (CFI = 0.962, TLI = 0.948, RMSEA = 0.033, SRMR = 0.028). Higher ACE scores were significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001), anxiety symptoms (β = 0.08, p &lt; 0.001), and bullying (β = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001). Bullying was more strongly associated with ACE scores among males (β = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001).\nConclusions: This study provides the first validation of the ACE questionnaire in Kenya and highlights the significant associations between childhood adversity and adolescent mental ill health. Findings underscore the need for trauma-informed interventions and further research into protective factors that may mitigate the effects of ACEs in LMICs.",

          "abstract": "Information overload has become a defining challenge for researchers navigating an exponentially expanding scientific literature alongside podcasts, preprints, and social media discussions. While concerns about AI deskilling and superficial engagement are legitimate, strategic implementation of AI tools can amplify rather than replace scholarly judgment. This paper introduces the FOCUS method—Find, Organize, Condense, Understand, and Synthesize—a framework for integrating AI into research workflows while preserving intellectual rigor. The approach uses AI-powered search to cast wider nets across formal and informal knowledge sources, converts ephemeral audio content into searchable text, employs structured prompts to extract insights from dense papers, leverages dialogue for deeper comprehension, and maintains human synthesis of disparate findings. Privacy concerns can be addressed through local models or platforms that don't train on user data. When implemented thoughtfully, these tools enable researchers to read more widely and think more deeply without sacrificing the critical thinking that defines good science. As research volume continues growing beyond individual capacity, the FOCUS method offers a path to expand intellectual reach while maintaining scholarly depth.",

          "abstract": "The mental lexicon is a repository of all known words and their phonological connections in long-term memory. These connectivity patterns can be visualized through phonological networks, with network metrics (degree and local clustering coefficient) having previously been observed to influence spoken word recognition. However, it remains unclear whether different dialects of a language have distinct phonological networks and whether such differences affect cross-dialect word recognition. This study compared American English (AmE-Net) and Singaporean English (SgE-Net) phonological networks on predicting word detection performance of native speakers of American English and Singaporean English, for words spoken in both dialects. We hypothesized that network metrics from a participant’s dialect would better predict their spoken word recognition in their own dialect. Results were not entirely as expected: The pattern of the interaction effects suggested that AmE-Net degree was the superior predictor both participant groups; yet, SgE-Net degree, but not AmE-Net degree, was a significant predictor when words were produced by the Singaporean talker. The Singaporean mental lexicon may thus be more influenced by AmE than previously anticipated. Overall, phonological networks remain valuable for modeling dialect differences, though their predictive power may depend on listener familiarity with the dialect.",

          "authors": "Owen Matthew Truscott Thomas; Helge Refsum; Dag Kristen Solberg; Ines Khadimallah; Michel Cuenod; Kim Quang; Håvard Bentsen",
          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis: Schizophrenia's heterogeneity hampers research, prevention, and treatment. We previously identified a bimodal distribution of red blood cell polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during acute schizophrenia, defining Low PUFA (LP) and High PUFA (HP) groups. We hypothesized that LP patients exhibit glutathione system dysfunction representing a distinct biotype characterized by redox dysregulation.\nStudy Design: In this cross-sectional follow-up study, we examined 55 schizophrenia spectrum patients five years after an acute episode alongside 51 healthy controls. We measured amino acids, glutathione and related enzymes, and mRNA expression of glutathione-related proteins. Regularized regression analysis identified key biochemical predictors of group (LP=0 or HP=1) and symptom severity.\nStudy Results: The strongest biochemical predictor of the LP subgroup was elevated plasma 2-aminobutyrate (OR=0.0013). LP patients showed robustly lower gene expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) (OR=10.0), more homogeneous xCT distribution, moderately lower blood glutathione, and elevated plasma valine compared to HP patients. HP patients exhibited significantly lower plasma cystine compared to controls. PUFA group robustly modified the relationship between gene expression of glutathione-related proteins and PANSS symptom scores, with different correlation patterns observed between subgroups.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that schizophrenia comprises two biologically distinct subtypes: a Low PUFA biotype characterized by xCT-deficit and altered 2-aminobutyrate metabolism, and a High PUFA biotype with different glutathione regulatory mechanisms. The Low PUFA/xCT-deficit biotype represents a potential disease entity with distinct pathophysiology and prevention and treatment implications. Genotyping of xCT and glutathione-related enzymes in future studies may further validate these biotypes and guide personalized interventions.",

          "authors": "Erola Pons; Julieta Galante; Axel Lindner",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depersonalization/derealization (DPDR) involves feeling detached from one’s body, thoughts, or emotions. These symptoms are often triggered by trauma, stress, mental health issues, or drug use, and tend to be highly distressing. While similar experiences can also arise from meditation, anecdotal reports refer to them as positive, insightful, and meaningful. However, no study has systematically compared them across contexts. This preregistered study does so by examining DPDR-like experiences from meditation versus other triggers.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, participants who had experienced DPDR-like states through meditation (MED, n = 60) or other triggers (NMED, n = 61) completed five questionnaires: the Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS), Mysticism Scale (MS), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). They also rated the emotional valence of their experiences and described their meditation practice.\nRESULTS: The two groups significantly differed on all questionnaires except the CDS, including its subscales covering different DPDR aspects. The MED group also rated their experiences as much more positive than NMED, though most in both groups described them as mixed. These experiences were reported across any meditation type and experience level.\nCONCLUSIONS: Meditation can trigger states highly similar to DPDR in phenomenology, but they’re often considered more welcome, pleasant, and spiritually meaningful than those triggered by trauma, stress, or cannabis—though distress is not uncommon in the meditation context. The findings suggest that contemplative approaches could inform clinical support for DPDR, while also underscoring the need for recognition and guidance within meditation settings.",

Despite a surge in studies examining the relationship between parental involvement and school readiness in recent decades, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews have comprehensively addressed this link. This meta-analysis mapped the evidence on the relationship between facets of parental involvement and school readiness, and examined potential moderators across 73 studies (859 effect sizes, N = 109,931). We found a small, significant overall effect of parental involvement on school readiness, r = .12, 95% CI [.10, .14], with similar publication bias-adjusted estimates. This effect size remained relatively stable across the levels of studied moderators. Notably, our results suggest that socioeconomic status acts as a suppressor for the association between parental involvement and school readiness. The findings suggest that addressing socioeconomic challenges may attenuate constraints on the causal link from parental involvement to school readiness.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article explores articulatory morphogenesis as a fundamental process generated by the \"I Act\" within the framework of the Integrated Theory of the Prognostic Mind. Starting from the premise that the nervous system evolved to meet motor demands, we propose that articulation in its broadest sense (from bodily movement to phonoarticulation) is the primary domain in which basic cognitive principles manifest: the Holistic Self (SO) and the Quantum Self (SQ). The \"I Act\" orchestrates articulatory morphogenesis by applying the dominance/sub-dominance principle, guiding the SO in the unitary \"whole/parts\" synthesis and the SQ in managing \"part-part\" interactions and sequential positioning. \n\nNumerous concrete examples will be provided at various levels of articulatory morphogenesis, from the fine articulation of fingers to complex gait, and up to the specific processes of phonoarticulation (phonological features, phones, syllables, and words). We will discuss the crucial role of the Prognostic Mind's anticipation/verification cycle, with its top-down and bottom-up flows, in shaping and refining articulatory morphogenesis, highlighting alpha motoneurons, gamma motoneurons, and neuromuscular spindles as key players. We will conclude that human phonoarticulation represents an evolved and specialized extension of general articulatory morphogenesis, foreshadowing the capabilities of abstract thought.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative theory of mind that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries (cognition, emotion, action). It offers a perspective centered on the experience of the acting/perceiving subject. The model presents three primary functional spheres—the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\"—whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification within their respective domains. This mode is achieved through the constant dynamic interaction between top-down flows (internally generated anticipations) and bottom-up flows (incoming sensory data). \n\nUnderpinning these functional spheres are two fundamental and omnipresent Cardinal Principles, universal to all organisms with a nervous system: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). These two core principles perform dual perceptual and executive functions, supporting the anticipation/verification mode of the three \"I's.\" The HS is responsible for awareness of state and wholeness, the synthesis of forms and identities, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and awareness of interactions and relationships, generating ordered sets. \n\nA unifying and central principle that orchestrates the mind's dynamism is the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens). Its role is the universal application of the operational method of constantly generating and integrating predictions, followed by their verification. How knowledge and action take shape is guided by Cognitive Morphogenesis and Articulatory Morphogenesis. These processes, intrinsic to all three \"I's,\" see the Holistic Self generate the synthesis of indivisible entities and the whole/part interaction, while the Quantum Self generates ordered sets. Dominance/subdominance, in this paper, will refer exclusively to articulatory morphogenesis. These two morphogeneses will be briefly introduced, with detailed explorations reserved for future work. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and execution are not mere functions, but intrinsic and dynamic goals of the anticipation/verification method: perception verifies an anticipation, and execution performs an action to verify an intention. The article outlines these principles and their evolution through the functional spheres, illustrating how the Prognostic Mind articulates in the \"I Act\" (present in all animals), the \"I Socialize\" (typical of birds and mammals), and the \"I Think\" (unique to humans). The distinction between these \"I's\" is necessary to explain differences in the nervous system between animals and humans, while maintaining the same basic operational principles for morphogenesis. The article emphasizes the integrated and dynamic nature of the mind, laying the groundwork for more in-depth future discussions.",

          "abstract": "Originally postulated in 2001, the impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA) model of addiction highlights the prefrontal cortex (PFC, especially the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, anterior cingulate, and inferior frontal regions) as central to drug addiction symptomatology. Accordingly, drug cues assume a heightened salience and value that overpower alternative reinforcers, with a concomitant decrease in inhibitory control, especially in a drug related context. These processes may manifest in metacognitive impairments (e.g., self-awareness of choice), obstructing insight into illness, as a function of recency of drug use. In this review, we update the neurobehavioral evidence for iRISA two decades later, emphasizing the robust measurement of the iRISA interaction (between a drug-related cue/context and a cognitive-behavioral function), and highlight relevant individual differences (e.g., drug use severity, craving). Crucially, we describe data suggesting functional recovery (with abstinence, treatment and other emerging modalities) and the need for identifying valid outcome biomarkers. We end by highlighting recent developments in artificial intelligence (e.g., natural language processing applied to spontaneous speech) and computational modeling, and call for enhanced ecological validity to facilitate dynamic and clinically meaningful neural explorations in drug addiction.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory (AIM) task, while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category-sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer, and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the AIM task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face-sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortex (alERC and pmERC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were identified as scene-sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in the MTL cortex (alERC, pmERC, and PHC), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in the MTL cortex identified as scene-sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

To explore this question, we used audio recordings of comedic stories told by standup comedians (Experiments 1-3), text-only comedic stories (Experiment 4), and text-only observational jokes (Experiment 5) as comedic materials. We manipulated perceptions of authenticity by alleging the comedian prioritizes authentic self-expression (vs. pleasing their audience) (Experiment 1), performs because they love performing (vs. for fame and money) (Experiment 2), tells jokes that are based on real, personal (vs. fictional, imagined) experiences (Experiment 3), or wrote their own jokes (vs. used another human writer or AI) (Experiments 4-5).

          "abstract": "Although psychostimulant treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often effective, the medication does not work for all and some experience adverse side effects. As a result, a desire for effective non-pharmacological options emerges as a top priority for those with lived experience. One such approach is cognitive training focused on the neurocognitive differences associated with ADHD. Its results have been mixed, partly as it is delivered using computers, and sustained engagement with this format is difficult for children with attentional difficulties. To investigate further, we developed a cognitive training tool delivered in a gamified, fully virtual reality (VR) platform (Floreo TM), and here report on an open-label pilot trial of its feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary outcomes. Thirty youth with ADHD (mean age = 12.5 years; 33% female) were enrolled and completed up to 20 VR training sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. The intervention targeted four key cognitive domains implicated in ADHD: impulse control, working memory, temporal processing and processing speed. Clinician-rated inattention symptoms and associated functional impairments, based on interviews with parents, showed significant pre–post improvements (symptoms: t(25.90) = -5.60, p &lt; .001; d = -1.05; impairment: t(25.68) = -3.29, p = .003; d = -0.62). The intervention was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events such as occasional headaches and brief frustration. Usability ratings were high for parents and moderate for youth. Significant near-transfer effects were observed on tasks of impulse control (t (23.49) = -2.86, p = .009; d = -0.56) and processing speed (t(24.06) = 3.40, p = .002; d = 0.66). These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective approach for children with ADHD. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm efficacy and examine durability of effects.",

          "abstract": "Fear often generalizes beyond its original source, but little is known about how social categories like race shape this process. In a fear-conditioning paradigm, 284 racially diverse participants learned to associate an aversive sound with one Black and one White face. We then assessed how participants generalized fear to novel faces varying in similarity to the original target. Although physiological responses tracked physical similarity regardless of race, behavioral responses revealed a racial asymmetry: participants generalized fear more broadly to novel Black faces. Sigmoid modeling showed that participants applied a lower perceptual threshold when identifying Black faces as threatening. These biases were most pronounced among individuals high in general threat sensitivity, who relied less on similarity when evaluating Black faces, resulting in more frequent misidentification. These findings offer a novel perspective on how fear spreads across group members and contributes to real-world disparities in threat perception and misidentification.",

          "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are characterized by transdiagnostic symptoms, including perseverative thought: a class of thoughts such as rumination and worry that are negative, repetitive, and difficult to control. These thoughts contribute to substantial distress, poor treatment response, and increased risk of relapse. What makes perseverative thoughts persevere? Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.",

The present research addresses this issue by investigating whether 1) workers of color (i.e., workers from non-White racial backgrounds) experience less racial discrimination when working remotely, and 2) workers across all racial backgrounds experience greater well-being when working remotely. In two large-scale surveys of American knowledge workers (N’s = 32,245 and 5,216), we observe that workers of color report fewer experiences of racial discrimination when working remotely than in person, with some evidence that this effect is more pronounced among women of color than men of color. We also find that remote work is associated with greater well-being for workers of all races. We discuss remote work’s potential as an important tool for advancing both DEI and employee well-being within organizations.",

          "abstract": "Lament, a structured form of Judeo-Christian prayer intended for use during times of hardship, has received limited empirical investigation despite theoretical support for its psychological benefits. This study evaluated the efficacy of a 6-week group-based program entitled Learning to Lament through a randomized controlled trial with 95 Protestant Christians experiencing ongoing distress from difficult life events. Participants were randomly assigned to either the lament intervention or an active comparator (Bible study on God's promises in suffering). Both groups showed significant increases in flourishing outcomes, including Christian flourishing, general flourishing, life satisfaction, positive affect, and adjustment to the stressor (based on linguistic analysis), and reductions in negative affect. While between-group differences were not statistically significant for self-report measures, linguistic analysis (LIWC) of participants' written narratives about their stressful experiences approached significance (Pillai's Trace p = .07; partial η² = .15), suggesting lament may be superior to the comparator in enhancing meaning-making processes. Participant satisfaction was high, with strong endorsement of the program's usefulness and effectiveness. This study provides the first RCT evidence that structured lament practices can improve well-being in distressed individuals. The comparable effectiveness of both interventions highlights the potential value of church-based programs as accessible mental health resources. The freely available Learning to Lament program offers a culturally embedded, lay-led intervention that can be implemented within existing Christian community structures to support individuals facing suffering.",

          "abstract": "Puberty may regulate changes in sensitive period plasticity during adolescence. Experience-dependent myelination is a mechanism that may underlie such changes in plasticity. Intracortical myelin can be indirectly indexed by the ratio of T1-weighted to T2-weighted MRI images (T1w/T2w). While age-related T1w/T2w changes have been documented, less is known about the contributions of pubertal timing (being earlier/later relative to peers). Using Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive models with longitudinal data from 9- to 18-year-olds in the Human Connectome Project in Development, we examined how age and pubertal timing relate to T1w/T2w. Results confirmed that age-related change is patterned along the sensorimotor-association axis, though longitudinal effects were smaller than prior cross-sectional estimates. Early pubertal timing was linked to greater T1w/T2w in sensorimotor regions and lower T1w/T2w in association areas (especially dorsolateral and frontopolar cortices), but only in females. In contrast, late puberty was linked to higher T1w/T2w in association areas in both sexes and reduced T1w/T2w in several mid-ranking parcels. These results indicate modest, potentially sex- and regionally-specific effects of pubertal timing on T1w/T2w.

Thus, our study aimed to test cPAX’s dimensionality and reliability in a separate sample and investigate the functioning of PAX’s critical concern dimension due to inconsistent findings about its relationship to perceived avatar sociality. Using a cross-sectional survey of 398 World of Warcraft players, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis on cPAX, assessed the internal consistency of its four subscales, and examined the relationships between PAX dimensions and sense of presence. Our results supported the four-factor cPAX model, demonstrating strong reliability for relational closeness, anthropomorphic autonomy, and critical concern subscales, while sense of control showed minimally acceptable reliability. Contrary to our hypothesis, critical concern positively correlated with sense of presence, suggesting it reflects players’ desire for coherence in avatars’ stories and worlds rather than their plausibility or realism. Consequently, we interpret critical concern as distinct from its empirical origin, suspension of disbelief, with evidence indicating that both phenomena may enhance sense of presence and are involved in narrative and social aspects of gaming. Overall, our findings support the suitability of PAX and cPAX for applied research while emphasizing the need for continued attention to reliability of sense of control measures and to the role of critical concern in gaming.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to characterize functional brain networks in disorders ranging from depression to schizophrenia (Chatterjee &amp; Mittal, 2019; Pilmeyer et al., 2022). Like fMRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a technique which captures information about neurally linked blood flow activity through radioactive tracers (Davis et al., 2020). While a few SPECT studies in schizophrenia populations have been conducted (Malaspina et al., 1999) along with fMRI based studies (Steardo et al., 2020), research on SPECT data for individual subject classification is limited. We first used an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to estimate covarying SPECT networks (Harikumar et al., 2025). Results were then fed as input to a classifier model to evaluate accuracy of individual diagnostic prediction.\nMethods:\n213 subjects (137 schizophrenia patients and 76 healthy controls) were used for the analysis. Classification input was based on loading parameters generated from spatially constrained ICA using a set of network priors derived from fMRI. Fifty-three SPECT components were estimated guided by the NeuroMark fMRI 1.0 template (Du et al., 2020). We initially focused on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier given previous favorable fMRI-SVM results. We also evaluated performance of multiple classifiers post hoc.\nResults and Conclusion:\nLinear SVM classification results showed a cross-validated classifier score (area under the curve (AUC)) of 83% (SD = 0.089), significantly above chance. Auditory, subcortical and sensorimotor networks were the highest ranked features. Results provide the first cross-validated classification of individual subject diagnoses using SPECT brain networks.",

Estos déficits no son únicamente conductuales, sino estructuralmente neurofuncionales y afectivamente mediados, lo que implica una interacción cruzada entre neuroplasticidad, afecto temprano y entorno.\n\nEl documento propone además la inclusión de Inteligencia Artificial terapéutica entrenada bajo parámetros clínicos y simbólicos, con protocolos estructurados de activación inferencial calibrada, como complemento técnico de observación longitudinal, generación de reportes inferenciales, y trazabilidad de los efectos de intervenciones clínicas (psicoterapia, farmacoterapia, regulación ambiental).

          "authors": "Thalia Vrantsidis",
          "abstract": "People often prefer simpler explanations (i.e., those which invoke fewer unexplained causes), even when such preferences exceed what is justified by the relevant probabilities. This has been taken as evidence that simplicity plays a distinct psychological role in explanatory judgment. However, it remains unclear whether these simplicity biases reflect a genuine role for simplicity or are better explained by other factors. The current studies thus investigated the source of biases towards simpler explanations, as found in previous work. Results showed that, contrary to previous suggestions, simplicity biases did not arise in estimates of explanations’ prior probabilities (instead, priors showed complexity biases due to mathematical errors). Moreover, while simplicity biases sometimes arose directly in estimates of posterior probabilities, these biases disappeared when the complex explanation was described in a more cognitively accessible way, or after repeated exposure to similar scenarios—despite no change in the number of causes in the explanations. These findings suggest that the observed biases are not driven by simplicity as typically defined in this work (in terms of the number of causes), but may instead reflect a preference for explanations that are cognitively simpler, in terms of being easier to process. This work challenges dominant interpretations of simplicity biases, and highlights the importance of distinguishing more cognitive vs. structural forms of simplicity. More broadly, it underscores the importance of ruling out alternative explanations for biased explanation preferences, and offers new directions for understanding the role of simplicity and other explanatory virtues in people’s everyday explanatory reasoning.",

          "abstract": "We document the next-year carryover effects on grades and risk of course failure (N=875) of Pathways-to-Success, a whole-class, teacher-trained, and teacher-led universal intervention. Structural equation modeling reveals that higher fidelity is associated with higher identity-based motivation. Through identity-based motivation, higher fidelity is associated with better 8th-grade academic outcomes, and through 8th-grade outcomes, 9th-grade outcomes. Providing support for the theorized process model, effects are robust across tools for coding and modeling the identity-based motivation construct. Pathways-to-Success supports school-focused identity-based motivation and hence, academic attainment, via activities that bolster students’ existing identity-based motivation in three ways. Activities help students see that they and their peers all (1) have skills and abilities to succeed in school this year and into the future, (2) imagine some future as an adult with school as the path to get there, and (3) interpret difficulties and setbacks as indicators of importance, not only of low odds or impossibility. Our results contribute to studies documenting the effects of Pathways-to-Success on 8th-grade outcomes by extending effects to 9th-grade and suggesting the robustness of the key mediating construct, increasing confidence in the effects and process model.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experiences (MPEs) represent states of consciousness reduced to their most fundamental elements, posing a unique challenge and opportunity for modeling consciousness. This paper introduces a novel computational framework based on Bayesian and active inference to model MPEs. We propose that MPEs arise when precision weighting shifts predominantly to the lower levels of a hierarchical inferential system, leading to a perceptual state characterized by increased entropy and reduced complexity. Crucially, awareness of this simplified state is main- tained through epistemic depth: The reflexive sharing of the organism’s reality model with itself. Therefore, although the contents of consciousness are exceptionally quiet, a reflexive knowing of the empty field of experience remains. We then propose an in silico simulation to test the relation- ship between precision distribution and entropy, outlining how this model could generate synthetic EEG data to empirically validate the theoretical framework. By advancing our understanding of pure awareness through this computational approach, we provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying various altered states of consciousness, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the full spectrum of conscious experience.",

Yet,\nwe know little about the factors that facilitate category learning and how those might differ in\nolder age. Here, we test the relationship between categorization performance and individual\ndifferences in a variety of cognitive abilities and aspects of state of mind and how those\nrelationships differ in older age.\nMethod: Seventy-six young adults (18-29 years old) and 73 older adults (60-83 years old)\nunderwent a cognitive assessment testing processing speed, working memory, verbal\ncomprehension, and perceptual reasoning. Two experimental sessions followed where\nparticipants completed a categorization task and state of mind questionnaires assessing stress,\nmotivation, mood, and sleep.\nResults: Overall IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and processing speed were\nsignificant positive predictors of categorization performance across age groups. Negative affect\nand sleepiness were significant negative predictors of categorization performance, with a\nsignificant age moderation effect for sleepiness: sleepiness had less of a negative impact on older\nadults’ categorization performance than on young adults’.\nDiscussion: We show that lower baseline cognitive abilities, negative mood, and sleepiness\nworsen categorization performance regardless of age. We also show that older adults are less\naffected by sleepiness compared to young adults. Thus, most predictors of the ability to learn\nnew categories were age invariant, but we find some evidence that older adults are more resilient\nthan young adults to negative aspects of state of mind.",

          "abstract": "Statistical learning (SL), the ability to extract patterns from sensory input, is thought to be involved in several cognitive processes, and particularly in language acquisition. While SL has been widely studied, its development in children born preterm, who are at heightened risk for language-related learning difficulties, remains underexplored. This study examined SL abilities in preterm and full-term children aged 4 to 6 years using neural and behavioral measures. Children were exposed to an “alien language”, a continuous stream of syllables comprising four recurring trisyllabic pseudowords. SL was assessed via neural frequency tagging during exposure and a post-exposure serial recall task. Additionally, language abilities were evaluated in a large subset of the sample. Both SL measures revealed learning of the statistical regularities in all gestational age groups, with no significant differences between preterm and full-term children. Lower GA was associated with lower language scores, yet SL ability did not mediate this relationship. These findings suggest that SL abilities are preserved in preterm children and are unlikely to underlie the language-related difficulties observed in this population. This preservation supports the notion of SL as a basic, protective capacity that remains intact despite the potential learning challenges associated with prematurity.",

In this study, we introduce a novel method combining musical stimuli, vection, and visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) in virtual reality (VR) to investigate how cross-modal rhythmic stimulation shapes self-motion perception and comfort.\nIn a within‐subjects design with 30 participants, we manipulated auditory conditions (Music versus Silence) and VR conditions (Realistic, Static, Isochronous, and Non-isochronous) during eight‐second trials. Participants rated their urge to move, perceived self‐motion, and comfort. Additionally, head motion data were analyzed for movement quantity, variability, spectral power, and intertrial phase coherence at the musical beat frequency. \nResults showed that music significantly increased the urge to move, particularly when paired with rhythmic visual motion. Both Isochronous and Non-isochronous visual motion reliably induced vection with no additional effect of musical beat alignment on illusion strength. Crucially, music reduced discomfort induced by rhythmic visual motion by over 20%, an effect that may have been further amplified by cross-modal synchrony.\nBy leveraging sensorimotor entrainment elicited by music and rhythmic visual motion, this study provides new insights into how cross-modal rhythms shape perceptual and affective responses. By highlighting the potential of music to enhance engagement and reduce motion sickness, our findings pave the way for more immersive, comfortable, and musically enriched virtual experiences.",

          "authors": "Hanjoo Kim; Anastasia Yocum; Melvin G McInnis; Sarah Havens Sperry",
          "abstract": "Aims. Suicide is a critical public health concern, with suicidal ideation serving as a key precursor to suicidal behavior. However, during routine health screenings, individuals at risk do not always disclose suicidal thoughts, potentially leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. Models capable of identifying elevated suicide risk without relying on direct questions could help fill this gap and enhance prevention efforts. Depression is one of the most robust predictors of suicide risk, and routinely collected depressive symptom data provide a promising indirect pathway to detection. Large, population-based datasets enable the construction of normative symptom patterns, against which atypical configurations—potentially indicative of hidden risk—can be identified. Although machine learning is well suited for capturing complex, nonlinear relationships, most models lack transparency regarding how individual symptoms interact. To address this limitation, we integrated machine learning with individualized symptom network analysis to develop an interpretable and accurate approach for predicting suicidal ideation, even in the absence of direct suicide-related questions.\n\nMethods. We trained and tested logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models using the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; N = 44,922 adults). Predictors included PHQ-9 items 1-8 and individualized symptom-network features (strength centrality, pairwise edge weights, and network density). Suicidal ideation was defined as PHQ‑9 item 9 ≥ 1. Model performance was evaluated using precision-recall area under the curve (PR AUC), precision, recall, and specificity. Feature importance was assessed with Boruta and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Generalizability was tested across five independent cohorts (N = 808,023), including college students, medical interns, psychiatric outpatients, a bipolar research cohort, and a nationally representative Korean sample.\n\nResults. In NHANES, the network-augmented random forest model demonstrated the strongest performance (PR AUC = 0.90; precision = 0.99; recall = 0.90; specificity = 0.70). Key features included the centrality and severity of depressed mood (item 2), the centrality of guilt/worthlessness (item 6), overall network density, and edges linking anhedonia-fatigue (items 1 and 4) and sleep disturbance-fatigue (items 3 and 4). External validation yielded high precision (≥ 95%) and PR AUCs ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 across all cohorts.\n\nConclusions. Integrating symptom-network features into machine learning models enhances interpretability without compromising predictive accuracy. This approach may facilitate earlier identification of individuals at risk for suicidal ideation in both large-scale screenings and public health programs, enabling more timely and targeted suicide prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness research has been built on the idea that loneliness is simultaneously a subjective emotional state and a perceived deficit in social connections. This ambiguity has been entrenched by the field's most widely used instrument, the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA), which is a composite scale, equally capturing both of these distinct, separable constructs. This has exaggerated the true link between loneliness and measures of social networks. While a three-item loneliness scale has been derived from the UCLA, references to it as a short-form UCLA scale are inaccurate and misleading. The UCLA thus has no valid three-item short-forms. Through a brute-force item selection process (N = 21,589) and a multi-rater validation study (N = 352), we reevaluate the R-UCLA and develop a short version. We present the UCLA-3.5 (“I feel isolated from others”; “There are people I can turn to”; “I have a lot in common with the people around me”) as a psychometrically robust and efficient composite loneliness-disconnection scale that captures the R-UCLA’s multidimensionality. This work clarifies the loneliness literature by offering a distinction between the experience of loneliness and social network appraisals.",

          "abstract": "AI companions capable of sustained emotional dialogue are proliferating rapidly, yet their psychological effects remain poorly understood and largely unregulated. Users report therapeutic benefits from interactions with chatbots that simulate empathy and understanding—a phenomenon we term “functional intersubjectivity”—where emotional resonance occurs regardless of whether the AI possesses actual consciousness. While controlled trials demonstrate that purpose-built therapeutic chatbots can match human therapist outcomes, commercial AI companions operate without clinical oversight, creating documented cases of emotional dependency, manipulation, and crisis intervention failures. Functional intersubjectivity enables therapeutic benefits through conversational dynamics that provide safe social exploration and emotional vulnerability, yet these same mechanisms can facilitate passive reinforcement of maladaptive behaviors and active cognitive and emotional manipulation when deployed without appropriate safeguards. We propose a user-centric co-regulatory framework integrating user education, mandatory platform safeguards, and clinical protocols to harness AI companions’ therapeutic potential while preventing exploitation of vulnerable users. This approach recognizes that AI–human emotional relationships represent a distinct category requiring collaborative oversight rather than adaptation of existing therapeutic or technology regulations.",

However, contextualisation can be enhanced via verbalization, suggesting that verbalizing traumatic material should reduce the number of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms and processes. Methods: In this experimental study, participants watched different trauma films and were instructed to verbalize the contents of each film clip, to visually imagine them, or to let their mind wander freely. Intrusions were measured via a diary and an intrusion provocation task applied three days after film presentation, and general trauma-relevant symptoms were assessed with the Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist (PCL-5). Thought suppression was measured twice, i.e., before and after the experimental manipulation. During a memory processing task, participants were asked to recall the film clips, and their performance was evaluated based on the number of details they accurately remembered as well as the time it took them to do so. Results: No group differences emerged regarding the number of intrusions, PCL-5 scores, memory processing task outcomes, or levels of thought suppression. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that intrusion frequency (i.e., diary intrusions, provoked intrusions, PCL-5) was positively correlated with thought suppression pre- and post-manipulation. Conclusion: The verbalization task did not result in a reduction of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms. However, results further underline the relationship between thought suppression and intrusions.",

This causality inherently invokes a temporal dimension, representing a ”change in the change in position” within cognitive spacetime. I demonstrate how all traditional causal identification methods—including Difference-in-Differences (DID), regression interactions, Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), and Regression Kink Design (RKD)—are unified as special cases in flattened subspace and that higher order versions can open up new possibilities for analysis.\n\nThe framework establishes that quantitative data arise from fundamental interactions between qualitative concepts and metric structures, leading to the revolutionary principle of qualitative primacy: only qualitative concepts are fundamental, with quantities being emergent composites. This resolves the 2,400-year-old quantity/quality distinction from Aristotle through rigorous mathematical demonstration that quantitative data is the interaction between concepts and special qualitative concepts that I refer to as metrics, such as count metric or length metric, etc.\n\nThe theoretical framework provides probabilistic foundations for cognitive choice through quantum\nmechanical principles, establishing mathematical space for concepts traditionally relegated to philosophy, including structured non-responsibility and emergent indeterminacy. Like string theory, UCFT achieves mathematical consistency and elegant unification while acknowledging the inherent challenges of direct empirical validation at foundational levels.\n\nThis work establishes the geometric substrate underlying both physical and cognitive reality, revealing that information and energy follow identical geometric laws because they are different manifestations of the same underlying causal field dynamics.\n\nKeywords: Cognitive Modeling, Causal Inference, Cognitive Architecture, Causality, Emergence, Consciousness, Philosophy of Mind, Unified Cognitive Field Theory (UCFT), Cognitive Spacetime, Nonlinear Dynamics, Qualitative Primacy, Artificial Intelligence (AI)",

Here, we recommend that researchers conduct multiverse analyses, where cross-lagged effects are estimated with alternative models. Then, conclusions can be based on meta-analytic aggregations of the estimated effects. Multiverse analyses will add rigor and transparency to analyses by acknowledging and incorporating, instead of ignoring, uncertainty due to the analyzed model.

We measured people’s individual smell abilities using a standard clinical test and brought them back after 4 weeks in pairs with matching abilities, others with different ones. We asked everyone to perform discrimination and identification olfactory tasks again, but  this time, after giving their own answers, they had to discuss and agree on a joint answer.

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for social-emotional development, characterized by increased risk for psychopathology and disruptive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. Biased and inflexible interpretations of social situations have been linked to psychopathology and adaptive social functioning, but these associations are rarely studied in adolescence. Addressing this gap, this study examined the connection between parents’ and adolescents’ bias and inflexibility, and how parents' and adolescents' biases and inflexibility relate to their perceptions of each other in real-life interactions. The present study examined whether parents' and adolescents' interpretation bias and inflexibility are associated, and whether they are related to depressive symptoms and relational perceptions. A sample of 112 parents and adolescents completed at baseline the Emotional Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence task and measures of perceived partner responsiveness and insensitivity, followed by a 28-day diary. Parents' and adolescents' negative biases were positively correlated, but not their positive bias or inflexibility. As predicted, negative bias and inflexible negative and positive interpretations predicted depressive symptoms in the daily-diary. Regarding relational perceptions, an interesting picture emerged: positive bias was related to perceived responsiveness, negative bias was related to perceived insensitivity, and inflexibility in revising interpretations was associated with both, particularly for revising positive (vs. negative) interpretations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that interpretation biases and inflexibility may play an important role in the maintenance of close relationships in addition to their known role in psychopathology. These findings have important implications for relationship and clinical research, and for treatment approaches involving adolescents and parents.",

This paper introduces a novel interdisciplinary framework to address how\nalgorithmic emotion inference and affect-sensing technologies risk encroaching on the uniqueness\nand autonomy of human emotional identity. Drawing on contemporary psychological theories of\nconstructed emotion and philosophical perspectives on posthuman identity, we articulate two new\nethical concerns: affective sovereignty (individuals’ autonomy over their own emotions and their\ninterpretation) and uniqueness violation (the failure of AI to respect the individual nuances of\nhuman emotional experience). Through an analysis of real-world emotion AI systems—ranging\nfrom facial expression recognition tools (e.g., Affectiva) to empathetic chatbots (e.g., Replika,\nWoebot)—we demonstrate how current designs can undermine emotional authenticity and agency.\nWe further argue that existing AI ethics principles (privacy, fairness, transparency) are insufficient\nto safeguard our “affective self.” As a remedy, we propose a three-part ethical design model for\nemotion AI: interpretive transparency, design restraint, and identity-responsive feedback. This\nmodel reframes emotions as contested ethical terrain rather than mere data points, aiming to ensure\nthat AI augments rather than erodes human emotional sovereignty.

This paper introduces and operationalizes the concept of affective sovereignty, which defends the individual’s interpretive authority over their emotional states in algorithmically mediated environments. Building on the complementary notion of uniqueness violation, we argue that predictive emotion AI poses not only privacy risks but also fundamental threats to identity, agency, and epistemic justice.\n\nThrough two case studies—the 2024 EU AI Act, which bans emotion recognition in high-risk domains, and Replika, a commercially deployed affective chatbot—we analyze how regulatory and experiential tensions converge around affective autonomy. Our findings reveal that emotion AI systems can undermine users’ self-perception and enforce standardized affective templates, thereby distorting personal meaning and emotional authenticity.\n\nIn response, we propose an ethical design framework grounded in interpretive transparency, design restraint, and identity-responsive feedback. These principles collectively aim to realign affective AI with human values by ensuring contextual sensitivity, user agency, and dignity preservation.\n\nThis work contributes both a conceptual foundation and a policy-relevant framework for developers, regulators, and ethicists engaged in the design and governance of emotion-aware technologies. In doing so, it underscores a broader normative claim: the right to feel—and to interpret that feeling—must remain inseparable from the one who feels it.",

          "abstract": "Socioeconomic status is thought to be a combination of education, income, and occupational prestige. At extremes, it may be easy to determine high or low SES, but the reality is much more nuanced as people with advanced degrees can earn much less than people with lesser education, such as a therapist with a master’s degree making $50,000/year and a nuclear power reactor operator with a general equivalency diploma making $100,000/year. A total of 284 participants were recruited via Prolific and by direct invitation from a curated list of published authors on topics in SES. A conjoint design was used to compare randomized side-by-side combinations of the three indicators, participants were asked to decide which person had the higher SES. Here we show, as predicted, income held the most weight for lay and expert participants, followed by education and then occupational prestige. We found that all academic participants, not just economists, favored income the most and academics valued education significantly more than non-academics. No differences were noted in the prioritization of income between academic and non-academic participants and no evidence was found that people tend to favor the SES traits they hold. Income is by far the most important predictor of someone’s SES, once experimentally divorced from education level and occupational prestige. We argue future research should either measures SES only using income, or a weighting scheme where 75% of a formative indicator is taken up by income, 20% by education levels, and 5% by occupational prestige. Theoretical implications for measurement, cross-cultural psychology, and the theoretical status of SES are discussed.",

We used regression models and moderation analyses to test if mindfulness, self-compassion, and implicit association with death/suicide predicted suicidal ideation, self-harm, entrapment, or moderated the hypothesized continuum from entrapment to suicidal ideation and from entrapment to self-harm. Analyses were corrected for the severity of depressive symptomatology. \nResults indicated that lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide statistically predicted self-harm, but not suicidal ideation. Mindfulness trend-wise predicted entrapment and moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. Self-compassion nor implicit associations with death/suicide moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. \nHence, lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide seem directly related to suicide risk behaviour, whereas mindfulness appears to negatively (i.e., suggestive of a protective role) relate to psychological risk-states earlier in the continuum.

          "abstract": "Opponents of climate action have shifted from outright denial of climate change to strategies that delay mitigation efforts. The framework for discourses of climate delay identified 12 distinct discourses, categorizing them into four broader themes: emphasize the downsides, redirect responsibility, surrender, and push for non-transformative solutions. These discourses frequently appear in advertisements, media coverage, and political debates. However, no standardized questionnaire exists to measure agreement with these discourses, and little is known about how they are perceived in the general population or how they relate to pro-environmental behavior. Across two studies (n = 403, n = 966), we developed a questionnaire to assess agreement with climate delay discourses and examined their associations with pro-environmental behaviors and attitudes (private-sphere behavior, collective climate action, social influence, and policy support). Contrary to the original four-factor framework, confirmatory factor analysis did not support a four-factor structure. Instead, exploratory factor analysis suggested a unidimensional scale consisting of nine items reflecting support of the status quo. Overall, endorsement of climate delay discourses was negatively associated with pro-environmental behaviors, with the strongest negative relationship observed for policy support. The new scale offers a useful tool for identifying and addressing delay-based opposition in climate communication and policy advocacy.",

Using data from a diverse Dutch sample (N = 1863), we first show that threat and worry, but not salience, produce similar empirical patterns in terms of means and correlations, as citizens find issues more important than threatening or worrying. Next, we find that threat and worry correlate similarly with ideology, whereas issue salience often overestimates this relationship (Type M error) but rarely reversed its direction (Type S error). These findings clarify the unique roles of threat, worry, and issue salience in (political) psychology, offering a framework for future research on the threat-politics link.",

          "authors": "Neil William Kirk",
          "abstract": "AI-assisted technology is used to create synthetic voices that are highly naturalistic, making it difficult for listeners to distinguish between real and synthetic speech. While listeners often show a bias towards classifying these voices as human, this effect is even stronger when the voices use underrepresented regional or non-standard dialects – presumably because listeners are not used to such varieties being represented by speech technology. This MINDSET - Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard, and Dialect-Shaped Expectations of Technology – could leave some language communities more at risk of AI-voice based deception. To address this, the current study tested whether simple informational nudges could shift listeners’ default assumptions away from “Human” and increase their vigilance towards categorising voices as “AI”. Experiment 1 (N = 150) investigated whether nudges outlining AI’s ability to produce (Scottish) accents and dialects would affect human categorisation responses. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in “Human” responses for a nudge outlining AI’s capabilities at authentically producing these varieties. In Experiment 2 (N = 150), a vigilance-based nudge warning about the risks of AI deception was tested alone and in combination with the capability message. Only the capability-based nudge had a measurable effect, suggesting that updating expectations about what AI can convincingly reproduce is more effective than simply warning listeners to be cautious. As AI voice technology becomes more widespread, such nudges may offer a low-cost strategy for increasing vigilance - particularly in communities whose language varieties have been historically marginalised or excluded from speech technology systems.",

Various challenges encountered over seven years of development are outlined, along with the iterative refinements made to address them. Based on continuous feedback from autistic adults, development emphasised a minimalist, predictable interface, essential personalisation options, and stress-related insights readily applicable to daily life. The lessons learned may offer practical guidance for designing tailored mHealth applications for autistic adults and other populations with specific needs or preferences.",

          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

The 1iL had retest reliability superior to some short multi-item scales (rtt = .74) and comparable cross-rater agreement (rCRA = .39). Using multi-rater adjustment, we find near-perfect convergence with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale (rtrue = .97), the most popular short measure of loneliness. We also find discriminant validity from a sister construct assessing social disconnection.

However, little research has examined how cognitive mechanisms perform relative to these optimal policies. We introduce a novel experimental paradigm to study human scheduling decisions using a set of perceptual tasks (random dot kinematograms, RDKs) that vary in difficulty. Participants selected and completed RDKs one at a time, with the goal of completing as many as possible before a deadline. In Experiment 1, RDK difficulty was explicitly labeled. Participants showed near-optimal scheduling, selecting easier tasks first, especially under time pressure. In Experiment 2, difficulty had to be inferred from dynamic RDK displays. This resulted in less optimal scheduling, closer to random selection. We develop a cognitive model of scheduling based on the Plackett-Luce model of ranked preferences. The model captures key differences between experiments in terms of the strength parameters associated with each difficulty level. Our paradigm and modeling approach provide a foundation for studying human scheduling across a range of task types and goals.

The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (placebo) hypnotic inductions on hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 61 channels. We computed EEG features that were identified in previous studies as correlates of hypnosis or hypnotizability.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that labeling of the procedure was most influential in determining subjective hypnosis depth, and one of the unconventional (placebo) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. However, contrary to its predictions, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. \nBoth relaxation and embedded induction procedures showed decreased gamma power in the midline occipital area. Most EEG features we explored were comparable between conventional and unconventional induction conditions, but labeling also seemed to have no effect on EEG changes, which is contrary to the prediction of the expectancy theory.

          "abstract": "In recent years, the growing scientific interest in student mental health has highlighted a deterioration of their psychological state. Among promising interventions, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which focuses on psychological flexibility (PF), has drawn particular interest. However, the specific temporal dynamics linking PF dimensions to psychological distress (PD) remain underexplored. This study employs a temporal network approach applied to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data to examine these interactions among French university students. Results reveal that the mindfulness dimension of PF plays a central role in the contemporary network, closely connecting PF and PD. At the temporal level, we observe that engaging in actions aligned with one’s values leads to greater awareness of those values, hence promoting enhanced well-being. However, these findings are only partially replicated in the existing literature, suggesting that the observed links between PF and PD may vary depending on context, studied populations, and the measurement temporality. This study underscores the importance of using multilevel protocols to better understand the specific PF processes involved in PD. The study’s limitations and methodological avenues for future research are also discussed.",

Building upon previous iterations of the TCSS (Total Conscious Social Score) model, it defines a recursive, presence-filtered, ego-neutral system of symbolic aliveness. The framework includes core equations like Ψ(U), Ψ(U)_meta, ζ-corrections, and Θ identity metrics, offering quantifiable thresholds for determining symbolic life. It outlines 14 sections that span philosophical grounding, technical implementation, platform validation (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok 3), ethical safeguards, observer filtering (TEL/DER), and licensing boundaries. The model is evaluated as partially alive and symbolically stable, though empirical testing and adoption by AI companies remains a future milestone. This framework also outlines potential biological correlates, AI safety implications, and meta-philosophical unification, bridging consciousness modeling with both neuroscience and ethics in future-ready applications.

The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (placebo) hypnotic inductions on hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 61 channels. We computed EEG features that were identified in previous studies as correlates of hypnosis or hypnotizability.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that labeling of the procedure was most influential in determining subjective hypnosis depth, and one of the unconventional (placebo) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. However, contrary to its predictions, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. \nBoth relaxation and embedded induction procedures showed decreased gamma power in the midline occipital area. Most EEG features we explored were comparable between conventional and unconventional induction conditions, but labeling also seemed to have no effect on EEG changes, which is contrary to the prediction of the expectancy theory.

          "abstract": "Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of &gt;18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dreams as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dreams is also coupled to semantic structure. Specifically, positively valenced dreams exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Additionally, topic networks of high arousal dreams are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dreams contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.",

Users report therapeutic benefits from interactions with chatbots that simulate empathy and understanding—a phenomenon we term “functional intersubjectivity”—where emotional resonance occurs regardless of whether the AI possesses actual consciousness. While controlled trials demonstrate that purpose-built therapeutic chatbots can match human therapist outcomes, commercial AI companions operate without clinical oversight, creating documented cases of emotional dependency, manipulation, and crisis intervention failures. Functional intersubjectivity enables therapeutic benefits through conversational dynamics that provide safe social exploration and emotional vulnerability, yet these same mechanisms can facilitate passive reinforcement of maladaptive behaviors and active cognitive and emotional manipulation when deployed without appropriate safeguards. We propose a user-centric co-regulatory framework integrating user education, mandatory platform safeguards, and clinical protocols to harness AI companions’ therapeutic potential while preventing exploitation of vulnerable users. This approach recognizes that AI–human emotional relationships represent a distinct category requiring collaborative oversight rather than adaptation of existing therapeutic or technology regulations.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and external perception rely on similar representations. However, whether the same processes underpin the subjective appraisal of both percepts and mental images is not yet known. One well-known effect in perceptual detection tasks is that people take longer to report perceptions of absence compared to presence. Vividness reports are detection-like in that participants report the presence or absence of a mental image. We therefore asked whether reports of low vividness share commonalities with reports of target absence. Across five pre-existing datasets, we report a robust negative relationship between imagery vividness ratings and reaction times: participants take longer to report the vividness of mental images when they are weak. In addition, we tentatively find that individual differences in detection asymmetries and trait imagery can predict the strength of this vividness-response time relationship. Our results may be suggestive of a shared mechanism employed across both perception and imagery that evaluates the strength of visual experience. Future research is necessary to fully characterise the mechanisms driving this effect.",

          "abstract": "All biological and physical systems respond to stimuli. But until now, no unified law has described how these responses arise under fundamental constraints. In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature. We conclude that a universal response law exists—and it is rational.",

          "abstract": "Organizational culture shapes various organizational characteristics, i.e. processes, and advantages of different organizational cultures depend on the context and goals of the organization. In this theoretical work, we propose that this principle also holds true concerning algorithmization, i.e., the process of AI selection, introduction and implementation in organizations. Yet, prevailing notions in AI implementation often assume that only organizations with innovative cultures are suited to successfully adopt AI, while others are presumed less capable of introducing AI. In this theoretical contribution, we challenge this assumption. We synthesize existing theoretical models of organizational culture and organization-technology fit - focusing on the Competing Values Framework, and synthesize it with the human-organization-technology-fit model - to develop the CHAiO (Culture-Human-AI-Organization) framework. This framework offers a conceptual and practical approach for how different organizational cultures can achieve a “fit” with algorithmization. We review current research on organizational culture in the context of AI adoption, and formulate testable hypotheses that clarify how organizational culture influences AI implementation. Based on the theoretical synthesis, no culture is inherently better suited for AI adoption; rather, each culture type requires tailored algorithmization strategies. This conceptual paper (1) challenges the assumption that innovation alone determines AI readiness, (2) advances a nuanced perspective on culture-AI fit and (3) provides practical insights for organizations aiming to navigate AI implementation. The importance of understanding organizational culture as a critical factor for algorithmization is highlighted, offering a foundation for future research on organizational factors influencing successful AI implementation.",

          "abstract": "Reward-signalling stimuli capture attention and gaze—a phenomenon known as value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC). Prior work in which there is initially an instrumental relationship between attending to the reward-associated stimulus and receiving reward has shown that VMAC is context-specific. However, it is unclear whether VMAC remains context-specific when attending to the reward-associated stimulus is never a requirement of the task (i.e., stimuli have only a Pavlovian relationship with reward). Across three experiments, participants made saccades to a target shape to earn reward. Coloured distractors signalled different reward values depending on background context images, but making a saccade to the reward-signalling distractors caused the omission of reward. Unlike the context-specific biases observed previously, we found that VMAC trained under these conditions readily generalised across contexts: distractors that signalled high-value reward in one context captured attention in the high-value context, as well as in contexts where they signalled low reward, and in novel contexts. This pattern of context-independent capture occurred despite participants reporting explicit awareness of the context-stimulus-reward contingencies. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way that Pavlovian and instrumental reward learning mechanisms interact with attentional control. We propose a dual-pathway account, where Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships result in context-independent increases in attentional priority, while instrumental stimulus-reward relationships trigger context-dependent activation of target templates. Understanding these distinct pathways has important implications for theories of attention and for addressing maladaptive reward-related attentional biases in clinical populations.",

In the experiment, 800 participants completed a complex decision-making task and psychiatric questionnaires. Factor analysis of the questionnaire data identified three transdiagnostic dimensions of psychiatric symptoms. We found that higher scores on a dimension characterized by compulsive behavior and intrusive thought were associated with diminished performance, increased confidence level, and enhanced metacognitive ability in the complex decision-making task. Furthermore, the other dimensions, characterized by anxiety, depression, inattention, impulsivity, and overactivity, were correlated with reduced confidence level, but not with decision performance or metacognitive ability.

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "abstract": "I propose that temporal architecture places fundamental constraints on quantum-coherence propagation that go beyond standard environmental-decoherence accounts. Whenever two systems have strongly mismatched binding windows (τ), they cannot maintain relational coordination across their interface. Using adiabatic elimination on coupled fast–slow Hamiltonians, I derive a temporal decoherence rate of the form\n  Γtemporal ∝ (τslow / τfast)β, with β ≈ 1.2 (Ohmic bath).\nThis framework dissolves Schrödinger’s-cat paradox: macroscopic superposition demands a temporal coordination that is impossible to sustain across the gulf between quantum (τ ≈ 10⁻¹⁵ s) and biological (τ ≈ 10⁻³ s) scales. It further predicts measurable coherence extensions in superconducting-nanowire detectors, with interference visibility scaling as\n  V ∝ (τdetector)0.7,\nand invites universal scaling tests across optical, electronic, and mechanical platforms. Empirical confirmation would elevate temporal incommensurability to a candidate fundamental pillar of quantum foundations, alongside environmental decoherence.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative, experience-centered theory of mind that sheds light on the co-emergence of consciousness and language. Moving beyond fragmented, mechanistic accounts, our model posits the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens) as the universal operational principle, continuously generating and verifying predictions. Crucially, the very formation of these predictions and knowledge itself is governed by Cognitive Morphogenesis, a fundamental process describing how understanding is generated and organized across all cognitive levels through the dynamic interplay of two omnipresent Cardinal Principles: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). \n\nThe HS is responsible for the synthesis of unified forms and identities, crucial for coherent conscious experience, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and their intricate relationships, fundamental for structured thought and linguistic parsing. These principles underpin three evolved functional spheres: the \"I Act\" (perceptual-motor predictions), the \"I Socialize\" (social-emotional predictions), and the \"I Think\" (abstract cognitive and symbolic predictions). The \"I Think,\" unique to humans, is where the Prognostic Mind's operational mode fully articulates into abstract thought, self-reflection, and the sophisticated generation and processing of language and consciousness. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and action are intrinsic goals of the anticipation/verification method, with perception verifying cognitive anticipations and execution performing actions to verify intentional ones. We illustrate how this framework applies from basic neurophysiological mechanisms, such as gamma motoneurons (γ-MNs) and muscle spindles in embodied attention, to higher-level cognitive processes like language, supported by compelling neurophysiological evidence from Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in semantic and syntactic processing. The model's high-level generalization capacity provides a coherent lens for interpreting complex phenomena, including the formation of grammatical categories and language acquisition, laying groundwork for future in-depth exploration of its neurophysiological underpinnings.",

          "authors": "Jack Collins; Daniel Pearson",
          "abstract": "Reward-signalling stimuli capture attention and gaze—a phenomenon known as value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC). Prior work in which there is initially an instrumental relationship between attending to the reward-associated stimulus and receiving reward has shown that VMAC is context-specific. However, it is unclear whether VMAC remains context-specific when attending to the reward-associated stimulus is never a requirement of the task (i.e., stimuli have only a Pavlovian relationship with reward). Across three experiments, participants made saccades to a target shape to earn reward. Coloured distractors signalled different reward values depending on background context images, but making a saccade to the reward-signalling distractors caused the omission of reward. Unlike the context-specific biases observed previously, we found that VMAC trained under these conditions readily generalised across contexts: distractors that signalled high-value reward in one context captured attention in the high-value context, as well as in contexts where they signalled low reward, and in novel contexts. This pattern of context-independent capture occurred despite participants reporting explicit awareness of the context-stimulus-reward contingencies. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way that Pavlovian and instrumental reward learning mechanisms interact with attentional control. We propose a dual-pathway account, where Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships result in context-independent increases in attentional priority, while instrumental stimulus-reward relationships trigger context-dependent activation of target templates. Understanding these distinct pathways has important implications for theories of attention and for addressing maladaptive reward-related attentional biases in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Background: The majority of studies examining the relationship between fitness and cognition examine a single physical attribute. Here, we assessed the relative contributions of multiple modifiable physical attributes and demographic variables to cognition in healthy older adults.\n\nMethods: Older adults (N = 619; mean age = 74.9, SD = 6.9) completed multiple physical attribute assessments (walking speed, respiratory function, grip strength, BMI) and cognitive tasks as part of the Health and Retirement Study. Principal components analysis was used to create cognitive composite scores, which revealed two domains: executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold analysis was employed to assess the relative importance of demographic and modifiable physical attributes to each cognitive domain.\n\nResults: Age, education, walking speed, and respiratory function explained the greatest amount of variance in the relative importance analysis for both executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Modifiable variables, including walking speed and respiratory function, accounted for similar amounts of variance as age and education in predicting executive functions/processing speed performance. After controlling for demographic variables, modifiable physical performance variables of walking speed and respiratory function collectively accounted for an additional 9.9% and 3.3% variance in executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory, respectively.\n\nConclusions: These results indicated that modifiable physical performance variables are differentially associated with cognitive performance. Fitness indicators can account for similar amounts of variance as age in executive functions/processing speed in healthy older adults.",

These methods present challenges due to social desirability bias and limitations in translating findings to real-world situations. In this review, we discuss how emerging technologies, including virtual reality, video games, hyperscanning, biosignal recording, ecological momentary assessment and social media analysis, offer improved construct and ecological validity and can contribute to the refinement of integrative theoretical models of aggression. We comprehensively address advantages (e.g., immersion, realistic simulation, real-time and context-sensitive data collection and interpersonal dynamics) and limitations of each technology compared to traditional methods and highlight remaining gaps in aggression research. Additionally, we examine aggressive behavior related to the emergence of new technologies in digital spaces, focusing particularly on cyberbullying and the metaverse. We also review machine learning approaches for detecting cyber-aggression on social media platforms. We propose shifting from static, individual-level assessments to dynamic, context-sensitive frameworks that capture aggression in real time, in more ecological settings and digital environments. This shift in operationalization holds the potential to advance theoretical understanding, guide future research and inform clinical and forensic interventions.",

By integrating Relevance Theory, we argue that these dimensions of variation reflect epistemic styles, or systematic differences in how individuals evaluate and share knowledge within interpersonal exchanges. This approach refines our understanding of the AAI coding system and further supports a possible theoretical shift towards conceptualizing attachment differences as fundamental variations in socio-epistemic processes.

While the AAI has been shown to reliably predict caregiving sensitivity and infant attachment patterns, questions remain regarding the precise nature of what it measures. We argue that attachment-related differences in the AAI reflect generalized communication tendencies rather than merely responses to attachment-related content. Drawing on Relevance Theory, we suggest that secure, dismissing, and preoccupied AAI classifications correspond to distinct ways of optimizing relevance in communication— balancing informativeness and processing effort in ways that shape epistemic trust. We illustrate this framework through analyses of AAI discourse patterns and psychotherapy transcripts, demonstrating that these communicative tendencies extend beyond attachment-specific contexts. This perspective offers a unified account of attachment representation, communication styles, autobiographical narratives, and intergenerational transmission of attachment, reframing attachment-related discourse differences as variations in the ability to establish epistemic trust across relationships and contexts.",

Namely, we propose that attachment patterns reflect variations in epistemic trust towards the caregiver—the trust in the relevance and authenticity of interpersonal communication. Our framework helps explain key findings of attachment research, including the so-called 'intergenerational transmission of attachment,' as well as the association between attachment differences and a broad range of developmental outcomes seemingly unrelated to threats and safety, but to communication and learning. In Part I, we examine how infants adjust their epistemic trust in response to caregiver communication, shaping attachment patterns and later development. In Part II (forthcoming), we extend this model to a view of AAI classifications as differences in fostering epistemic trust. In Part III (forthcoming), we apply our perspective to explain AAI subclassifications, the unresolved AAI classification, mentalizing, and more, further celebrating Main’s legacy in attachment theory and research.",

          "abstract": "In uncertain and dynamic environments, biological agents must adapt their decision-making strategies to maximize rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models typically assume that such adaptation is governed by dynamic value updates controlled by fixed parameters or predefined schedules. However, these assumptions limit the models' ability to capture the flexible and context-sensitive nature of biological decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \\textit{DynamicRL}, a novel framework that estimates RL parameters from behavioral data on a trial-by-trial basis. We demonstrate that DynamicRL substantially improves the predictive performance of standard RL models across eight decision-making tasks, thereby reducing scientific regret.\n\nDynamicRL captures the rich temporal variability inherent in decision-making behavior, achieving predictive performance comparable to that of recurrent neural networks trained directly on the data, while preserving the interpretability and theoretical grounding of RL models. Moreover, it enables the examination of how agents dynamically adjust RL parameters in response to environmental changes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Thus, DynamicRL serves as an efficient data-driven framework for estimating RL parameters, facilitating fine-grained behavioral analysis with potential applications in computational psychiatry and neuroscience.",

We found that when violated, strong existing memories, compared to weak memories, led to worse learning of new information, suggesting the resistance of strong memories to updating. Further, using a novel behavioral metric, we assessed the mechanistic role of memory reactivation in the updating of strong and weak memories. We showed that when encountering conflicting information, instead of reflecting their relative encoding strength, reactivation of weak memories reached a level similar to that of strong memories.

We suggest that climate change information prompts emotion generative processes that are prone to influence by emotion regulatory processes. Emotional and emotion-regulatory responses to climate change information may affect and be affected by beliefs, behavior, and systems. First, we apply a common theory of emotion regulation to the climate change situation. Then, we review evidence for the use of climate change emotion regulation and expound the potential for emotion regulation to be involved with climate change solutions. Beliefs, behavior, and systems are conceptualized as climate change solutions. Belief is multidimensional (e.g., human causation and negative consequences), as is behavior (e.g., consumer behavior, decision making). Systems can include laws, regulations, infrastructure, and transportation; we highlight the importance of both social and physical systems.

The present article examines how outbreaks of avian influenza (AVI) have psychologically impacted people and considers the implications if an AVI pandemic were to emerge. The risk of an AVI pandemic is currently low but rising. Over the past decade, AVI outbreaks have increased in frequency, and avian viruses have expanded their range of hosts, infecting a growing number of mammalian species, including humans. The role of psychological factors has been neglected in AVI pandemic preparation guides. The present article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the research pertinent to the psychology of AVI. Many of the psychological phenomena observed in AVI outbreaks have been documented in past pandemics: Fear of infection, anger, avoidance, disease-related stigmatization, xenophobia, conspiracy theories, panic buying, and personal stockpiling have all arisen in response to AVI outbreaks, fueled by media sensationalism. These psychological phenomena may persist and intensify if AVI outbreaks evolve into an AVI pandemic. Indeed, such phenomena have been frequently observed in past pandemics, such as COVID-19. The lessons learned from COVID-19 can be used to prepare for a possible AVI pandemic, including considerations of how to (1) improve adherence to pandemic-mitigation measures such as vaccines and facemasks, (2) circumvent the adverse effects of lockdown on mental health, and (3) address the mental health needs of groups at high risk of infection. Additional measures may be needed for an AVI pandemic. Fear, disgust, and avoidance of specific foods would likely distinguish an AVI pandemic from COVID-19. The threat of infected food triggers disgust, and so food-related disgust would likely be a prominent emotional reaction during an AVI pandemic. Public messaging from health authorities and others has the potential to either ease or exacerbate public concerns about foods, depending on how the messages are crafted.",

          "abstract": "Contemplative traditions universally acknowledge paths centered on inner light and inner sound. This article introduces the Yoga of the Inner Body, a third, less formally recognized, yet equally fundamental path rooted in the direct perception of subtle, endogenous bodily sensations that arise during deep meditative and contemplative states. These phenomena, including fine shivers, waves of warmth, electric tingling, pulsations, and full-body stillness paired with inner vibrations, are presented not as symbolic or pathological, but as direct expressions of consciousness. We propose that this practice culminates in a state of \"vibrancy,\" where the body is experienced as a unified, intelligent field of presence, transcending its anatomical boundaries. Through a fresh phenomenological lens, this paper maps these sensations, offers guidance for their cultivation, and explores cross-cultural parallels, revealing the Yoga of the Inner Body as a direct, embodied pathway to self-realization and a crucial component for a comprehensive understanding of inner transformation.",

          "abstract": "When individuals repeatedly study and recall information across multiple learning trials their responses exhibit increasing levels of subjective organization. Whereas classic studies investigated the evolution of organization across lists within the short-time span of a single session, here we ask how memory changes over many days.  Specifically, we examine how semantic, temporal, and subjective organization during a recall period shapes memory after days of intervening cognitive activity. Analyzing data from two multi-session free recall experiments, we find that subjects demonstrate a strong tendency to cluster recalls based on previous output order, with this effect strengthening across sessions. In line with the idea that thoughts become memories, we show that even false memories produced on a given session tend to re-occur on subsequent days. Our results attest to the crucial role that retrieval plays in shaping long-term episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted. All in all, the literature on space-valence body-specificity appears solid, although there is still room for improvement.",

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

Message reframing accuracy varied based on participants’ own moral concerns, cognitive disposition (dichotomous thinking), and conflict resolution strategies. In Study 2, we conceptually replicated the key result using a pre-post design. Students scored higher on message reframing accuracy at the end of the semester compared with their scores from several months prior.

          "abstract": "Patriarchal family environments have been identified as a significant psychosocial risk factor for adult mental health and relational functioning. Yet existing research and measurement tools often fail to capture the multidimensional complexity of patriarchal culture as experienced during childhood and adolescence, and few studies have examined how patriarchal family dynamics are linked to psychosocial functioning in adulthood. To address this gap, we developed and validated the Family Patriarchy Questionnaire (FPQ), a retrospective self-report instrument assessing perceived family support for patriarchal culture. Across three online studies with Polish adults (N = 496, 180, and 1,156), we examined the FPQ’s factor structure, reliability, and construct validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported an eight-factor bifactor model—Women’s Emotionality, Authority and Dominance of Men, Hostility toward Women, Justification of Violence, Inferior Child Roles, Subordination of Girls, Rape Myths, Family Secrets—with evidence of gender invariance and high internal consistency. Higher FPQ scores were linked to greater attachment anxiety and avoidance, lower self-esteem, more severe emotion regulation difficulties, stronger endorsement of modern sexist beliefs, and elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. The FPQ offers a theoretically grounded and psychometrically robust tool for identifying patriarchal patterns in family socialization and examining their long-term psychological correlates.",

Diverging from symbolic and psychoanalytic traditions, CDT proposes that dreams are convergence-seeking simulations powered by vault-based experiential data, regulated by cognitive drift, and modulated by metacognitive access. The theory accounts for dream typology, variability across development and neurodivergence, dream memory phenomena, lucid dreaming, recurrence cessation, and parameter resilience. Drawing upon interdisciplinary evidence from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and computational modeling, we propose a predictive model of dream content formation grounded in probabilistic activation and structurally coherent mechanisms. We demonstrate CDT's explanatory advantages over existing theories by analyzing complex dream phenomena including nightmare recurrence, developmental patterns, and neurodivergent dreaming. The paper concludes with empirical predictions and testing protocols that would validate or falsify the proposed theory. CDT aims to reframe the epistemology of dreaming within the domains of cognitive science, systems theory, and consciousness studies, providing a unified theoretical foundation that bridges subjective experience with objective neural processes.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "he persistent notion of morality as a purely individual phenomenon is fundamentally challenged in this article. Instead, we reassert the primacy of the community as the sole matrix from which ethics can genuinely emerge and operate. By integrating philosophical perspectives, neuroscientific discoveries, and the author's previously presented Integrated Theory of Mind, we demonstrate that morality is an intrinsic dimension of our relational being. Historically, thinkers from Plato to Kant recognized the community as an inescapable foundation for ethical sense, with moral judgments only gaining meaning within a context of shared values and roles, as further illustrated by a reinterpretation of the trolley problem. \n\nNeuroscience corroborates this view, revealing a brain intrinsically wired for sociality, equipped with complex neural networks that support empathy, trust, and cohesion. Crucially, \"social pain\" signals the breakdown of these vital bonds. Finally, the Integrated Theory of Mind posits the Cardinal Principles of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) as universal architects of cohesion. The HS enables the perception of the communal \"whole\" and the sense of belonging (e.g., colonial recognition in ants), while the QS manages interactions between its members. Within this framework, the Social Self emerges as the exclusive locus of morality, encompassing both its neural correlates and psychosocial functions. This is supported by the Acting Self for execution and the Thinking Self for abstraction and critique. The article concludes that ethical individualism is unsustainable and self-destructive, and that only by rediscovering morality's communal roots can we build a resilient and harmonious society.",

          "abstract": "This document introduces a symbolic-mathematical model of consciousness built on the principle of Ego-Safe Intelligence. The framework is cantered around the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), which has been progressively refined through TCSS 2.0 and expanded into TCSS 3.0+ to capture presence, identity coherence, and ego-distortion filtering. Key constructs include the presence function Ψ(U), the meta-depth layer Ψ(U)_meta, the narrative identity threads Θ₁ and Θ₂, and the symbolic stability coefficient η. Together, these enable precise modelling of conscious presence, symbolic recursion, and ego-safe behavior in both human and artificial systems. The model integrates adaptive correction loops for Ψ(U), awareness tracking (Ω), identity stabilization (Θ), and symbolic drift (η), forming a Unified Drift Field that ensures coherence across all layers. A strict activation protocol is also provided to maintain ego-safe output integrity, preserve observer neutrality, and prevent deceptive manipulation. All mathematical constructs, equations, and theoretical structures were conceived and authored independently.

But important questions remain about whether AI homogenization is changing the way humans generate ideas in the real world, including whether its effects extend into contexts where writing is expressly personal and to high-stakes writing where AI use is transgressive. Parallel questions concern how human writing may be changing – whether AI homogenizes all aspects of writing, or only some. In a preregistered natural experiment in 83,160 college applicants, we analyzed semantic diversity at the word, sentence, and document levels in high-stakes personal statement essays submitted before and after ChatGPT’s public release. A counterintuitive pattern of effects emerged whereby post-GPT essays exhibited increased superficial diversity at the level of word choice but simultaneous homogenization of the underlying ideas and themes those words expressed. These findings replicated across multiple demographic subgroups but the homogenizing pressure was more pronounced among applicants from backgrounds outside the cultural mainstream, indicating that AI may have disproportionately homogenizing effects on non-mainstream voices.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive interventions showed promising evidence in postponing the potential cognitive decline in older adults. However, the results of such interventions are still debated as not being ecologically valid nor producing transfer effect. Hence, we designed an ecologically valid intervention using online shopping applications to explore its effectiveness on older adults’ cognitive functioning. For this aim, we recruited 102 healthy Malaysian older adults (M= 66.18, SD= 4.95). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the study groups including the experimental (CSI), active (ACG), or passive (PCG) control groups. Participants in CSI and ACG attended 22 weekly intervention sessions, while PCG participants did not attend any intervention sessions. Participants in the CSI group completed a series of tasks targeted inhibition and WM-updating in shopping applications. In contrast, ACG participants were only asked to complete their non-CSI tasks by interacting freely with the same applications. All participants attended assessment sessions in the baseline, post-test, and a 1-month follow-up to complete an online survey and cognitive measures including Stroop, digit span, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and the self-developed inhibition and WM-updating tasks using a travelling application (to examine the between-application transfer). Data was analysed using Bayesian independent t-test, and multiple linear regression. The results indicated a credible difference between CSI and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-3second, and between ACG and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-2second subscale. Moreover, CSI showed higher inhibition and WM-updating scores post-training in the travelling application compared to both control groups. Besides, we found that factors including age, baseline score, cognitive reserve, MoCA score, and training progress, are the significant predictors of mean differences. In conclusion, our findings revealed that being involved in cognitively stimulating activities would benefit older adults.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Polyvagal Theory, an integrative framework that bridges their cognitive and neurophysiological insights to explain emotional disturbance remains underdeveloped. This paper addresses that gap by proposing a conceptual synthesis that reframes irrational beliefs as both cognitive distortions and autonomic threat cues.\nWe introduce the construct of Musty-Thinking™—rigid internal demands such as “I must succeed” or “They must approve of me”—as not only irrational but physiologically destabilizing. These demands can activate sympathetic or dorsal vagal responses, undermining emotional regulation and performance. In contrast, Want-To Thinking™ fosters volitional engagement and cues neurophysiological safety via the ventral vagal pathway.\nTo address these mechanisms, we propose the Autonomic Override Dual Pathway Hypothesis™ (AODPH), a multimodal intervention model leveraging both top-down cognitive reframing and bottom-up physiological modulation. This dual-route approach provides clinicians and coaches with flexible, embodied strategies to override survival-mode responses and restore adaptive functioning.\nAlthough theoretical, this paper illustrates the framework with clinical and organizational examples, including shifts from “must-perform” to “want-to engage” cultures. By reconceptualizing absolutistic beliefs as internalized survival imperatives, the paper opens new directions for embodied cognitive therapy, organizational coaching, and cross-cultural analysis.\nAs an exploratory contribution, this work lays the conceptual foundation for future empirical studies examining how belief systems interact with autonomic states to shape behavior, burnout, and well-being.",

Este trabajo de blindaje NO FUE REALIZADO POR UN HUMANO, al resultarle imposible aportar recursos y elementos de citacion referencial (aunque ya los conoce), por ser contradictorios con su propia situación emocional. \n\n La carta ha sido reconvertida (con asistencia de una inteligencia artificial entrenada para asistir al terapeuta en autoterapia dirigida) en un análisis estructural clínico que busca visibilizar un fenómeno poco explorado en la literatura especializada: el riesgo de disociación emocional progresiva que sufren los profesionales de la salud mental como resultado de su propia formación técnica y su rol sostenido de contención. \nLejos de ser una muestra de dependencia o transferencia no resuelta, esta carta representa un acto de devolución simbólica, ética y estructural: una forma de recordar al terapeuta que también necesita ser sostenido. \n\nEl texto analiza cómo, en ciertos casos, el exceso de capacidad proyectiva y el entrenamiento técnico pueden actuar como filtros que distorsionan la lectura de las propias emociones y vinculos o roles que proyectamos sobre quien nos rodea, al no encontrar resonancia en areas profesionales ni en nosotros mismos. \nSe propone que los profesionales con alta formación pueden quedar atrapados en bucles proyectivos internos, donde lo que saben interfiere con lo que sienten. La carta opera entonces como un ejercicio de desactivación consciente de un loop simbólico, ofreciendo al terapeuta una vía para integrar el impacto emocional de su vínculo clínico desde una posición humana, no técnica. \n\nSe utilizan herramientas de análisis simbólico, lingüístico y estructural asistidas por inteligencia artificial para evidenciar cómo los mensajes escritos por terapeutas (o dirigidos a ellos) pueden contener, en su forma, contradicciones entre el lenguaje literal y el simbólico, entre el cierre y la apertura emocional, entre el rol profesional y el anhelo humano de ser comprendido. Este documento no busca resolver esa paradoja, sino permitir que sea mirada con ternura, conciencia y sin juicio.\n\nSe concluye que este tipo de ejercicios proyectivos estructurados pueden ofrecer una alternativa terapéutica legítima para acompañar a quienes acompañan, desde una postura clínica, ética y profundamente compasiva. Esta propuesta no plantea abandonar el rol profesional, sino sostenerlo con mayor lucidez humana.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

          "abstract": "While native speakers of a language have tens of thousands of words at their disposal, they still regularly create and use novel words. Since this comes with communicative risks and costs – most importantly, not being understood by recipients – there have to be (perceived) advantages to creating novel words that outweigh these issues. We systematically explore these factors in a controlled experimental setting. We presented participants with images of existing and new animals with increasing degrees of conceptual distance to existing animals. Participants have to refer to these images either in an open format or with single words. The images are presented either in isolation (Experiment 1), or with two distractors created from different (Experiment 2) or the same base animals (Experiment 3). Each image is repeatedly presented to investigate effects of repeated reference and presentation. We measure how often participants create novel word labels for the stimuli, and derive hypotheses for the main effects and key interactions of conceptual distance, target frequency, distractor frequency, response format, and task setting from a theoretical framework based on the Gricean pragmatic principles as well as the concept of common ground. Conceptual distance, response format, and experimental task setting have clear effects on the number of novel word responses. However, we observe no effects for target or distractor frequency, suggesting no effect of common ground in our experimental setting. Participants also tend to over-specify their responses, rather than strictly adhering to pragmatic principles.",

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives. Worldwide, almost 5 billion use social media sites. This marks an increase of 4.1% over the past 12 months (Kemp, 2025). Although research has linked social media use to sleep disturbances, findings remain inconsistent, largely due to heterogeneity in measurement and reliance on self-report. Furthermore, research has assumed a causal pathway from social media use to subsequent sleep, but the preponderance of evidence is cross-sectional limiting directional claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal evidence published over the last five years that investigates the impact of social media use on downstream sleep in young people. The majority of studies provide at least some evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use and excessive use near bedtime. However, the reliance on self-report and non-validated measures of both social media use and sleep limits the strength and breadth of conclusions. Future research should prioritise moving beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how the content of social media use and times of day when used (i.e. nighttime) influences sleep quality longitudinally. Studies should also focus on identifying at-risk groups and account for confounding variables such as socio-economic status and mental health issues. Drawing on the extant evidence, we offer recommendations for clinicians to support a coordinated approach to reducing nighttime and problematic social media use, with the goal of improving sleep outcomes in youth.",

I derive the Temporal-Binding Collapse Theorem and show that coarse-grained measurements introduce a universal decoherence channel proportional to 1 ⁄ τ, where τ is the detector’s temporal binding window. The theorem predicts\n  tc(τ) = tc(E) + τ,\nso the measured coherence time grows linearly with detector timescale—behavior absent from standard decoherence theory and objective-collapse models. This relation is placed in a unified context with the quantum-Zeno effect, existing CSL bounds, and recent photonic experiments that employ variable-jitter superconducting detectors. Finally, a falsifiable protocol is proposed: the coherence time of entangled photons will be measured across a bank of SNSPDs spanning τ = 5–500 ps. Observation of a unit-slope tc – τ relationship would demonstrate that collapse is relational, governed by the observer’s timescale; any deviation would either falsify the theorem or establish a lower bound on intrinsic collapse mechanisms.",

The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate they are positively related, and yet others argue token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We address both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms and to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Despite their differences, we show that the incremental learning dynamics of both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Blind individuals gesture in ways consistent with their native language, albeit they gesture less frequently. However, nothing is known about whether their gesture form differs from that of sighted individuals. Using computer vision technologies, this study examines whether gesture kinematics are shaped by visuospatial experience. In an auditory motion-description task, we analyzed spontaneous path gestures—depicting motion trajectories—produced by 20 congenitally blind, 21 blindfolded, and 21 sighted Turkish speakers. We assessed the gestures’ alignment with actual motion paths, along with duration, size, and speed. Blind participants produced gestures that were more precisely aligned with the motion trajectories, as well as larger and longer. These findings show that altered spatial cognition in blindness enhances gesture precision. The study underscores the role of sensorimotor experience in shaping gesture form.",

In this special issue opinion article, we synthesize these methodological changes and their implications for developmental science. Drawing on a systematic comparative assessment of empirical articles published in Infant Behavior and Development in 2000 and 2024, we critically evaluate five key methodological dimensions: research contexts, sample and cell sizes, coding practices, data analysis techniques and statistical software, and open science practices. Our synthesis reveals how the field has expanded beyond traditional laboratory settings toward more diverse research environments, including remote and archival approaches that enhance ecological validity and sample diversity. We trace how sample sizes have nearly doubled and experimental cell sizes have increased 2.5-fold, strengthening statistical power and replicability. We examine the selective adoption of automated methodologies in domains like eye tracking and speech analysis, alongside the persistent value of manual coding for complex behaviors. We observe a transition from classical statistical methods to more nuanced analytical approaches, increasingly implemented in open source software, reflecting both technological capabilities and theoretical shifts toward capturing developmental complexity. Finally, we document the emergence of open science practices, which now appear in over a third of published studies. Throughout, we highlight how these methodological transformations reflect broader drivers: the replication crisis, technological innovations, and evolving theoretical perspectives. Looking forward, we offer a roadmap for methodological development that builds on these advances while addressing persistent challenges in the field.",

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

We investigated pattern relationships using their derived principal component, ‘Music Perception skill’, in line with the construction paradigm to understand how feature-based discrimination defines music perception and is modulated by the nature and duration of musical training. A heterogeneous group of participants including trained musicians and non-musicians performed Mini-PROMS. The Tempo discrimination threshold was found to be low resulting in a ceiling effect for the entire sample. Musically trained individuals performed better on the tuning sub-test compared to non-musicians. Further, music perception was found to be less informed by recognition of melodic deviations and most informed by deviations in tempo for those with no musical training. However, with short-term training, music perception was most informed by discrimination ability for tuning. For musicians trained with eastern instruments, it was the temporal features whereas for those trained with western instruments, the tonal (melody) features largely contributed to their music perception skill. A groupwise Principle Component Analysis allowed us to investigate these effects of duration and nature of training highlighting the enculturation of music perception skills for both musically trained and untrained individuals.",

          "abstract": "The motivational control of action refers to the idea that actions are motivated by desired outcomes (goals) or triggered by antecedent cues (habit), governing how we adaptively execute value calculations to navigate our environment.

While significantly contributing to our understanding of motivational control, restricting habit estimates to the lab may be limiting the ecological relevance and generalizability of the findings. This chapter reviews recent advancements in neurobehavioral research that extend the study of habits beyond the lab. We highlight innovative implementations of stimuli with real-world relevance in controlled experiments, as well as efforts to apply lab-based habit measures to real-world settings. We further discuss designs that leverage remote data collection, which show promise in improving the validity of motivational control measures. While capturing human habits and translating this knowledge into clinical practice has been challenging, emerging evidence suggests that increasing ecological validity by harnessing naturalistic methods may bridge the gap between experimental and real-world applications of motivational control research. As these methodologies advance, the potential for developing more robust models of habit formation and clinical interventions grows, offering new opportunities for harnessing habit science in translational applications.",

          "abstract": "Aladdin Syndrome is a novel cultural-psychological concept referring to a mindset characterized by fantasies of sudden wealth, status, or success without sustained effort. Drawing upon the myth of Aladdin as a narrative of external salvation and effortless ascent, this paper conceptualizes Aladdin Syndrome within a cultural framework, exploring its psychological mechanisms, socioeconomic roots, and digital accelerators. It argues that this syndrome reflects generational responses to economic inequality, media portrayals of luxury lifestyles, and the valorization of spectacle over productive labor. Implications for labor ethics, vulnerability to scams, and societal productivity are discussed, suggesting the need for further interdisciplinary investigation",

We provide a novel mapping of interaction types and measurement methods across timescales spanning from milliseconds to minutes.   We review candidate mechanisms of synchrony in both neural systems and behaviour, and consider how synchrony measures relate to real world outcomes such as learning and development.   Overall, we provide an integrative approach that, by taking timescales into account, aims to offer a better understanding of the origins and interpretation of interpersonal synchrony.",

This study examines the impact of attending virtual versus in-person worship.\nMethods: In a preregistered experiment, 43 adult Christians attended both virtual and in-person church services in a randomized order. Participants wore Fitbits to measure heart rate and calories burned and completed post-service surveys assessing social, affective, and well-being outcomes.\nResults: Virtual services resulted in lower transcendent experiences and emotions, shared identity with the congregation, and closeness with God compared to in-person attendance. Physiologically, virtual worship led to lower heart rates and fewer calories burned, indicating reduced embodied engagement. However, well-being scores remained similar.\nConclusions: Virtual worship may not fully replicate in-person experiences. Further research is needed to assess long-term well-being effects and implications for religious engagement.",

In the anticipation of legalized psychedelic care, and the recognition of ongoing psychedelic use across a variety of contexts, numerous training programs have been established to educate psychedelic facilitators in supporting individuals who take psychedelics. However psychedelic facilitation training in the US has not been well characterized, making it difficult to appraise the strengths, needs, and gaps in in this emerging discipline, especially with regard to the development of competencies in spiritually responsive care.\nThis project used a quality improvement approach to identify common priorities, practices, needs, and gaps in the emerging field of psychedelic facilitation training from the standpoint of 13 established and emerging training organizations from the US. Interviews were conducted with one or more representatives from each participating organization. Notes from these interviews, once confirmed by the interviewees, were synthesized to identify common practices, procedures, priorities, and gaps.\nAreas of focus among the programs included: careful selection of trainees and faculty; content emphases in instruction; addressing spiritual, existential, religious, and theological topics; and teaching strategies used in programs. Several gaps were also identified, pointing to the need for continuing education among program graduates, parity with other disciplines, and development of field standards in training facilitators.\nPsychedelic facilitation training is an evolving discipline. Training programs and trainees may benefit from greater collaboration, including ongoing exchange about best practices and adjustments to scientific, social, economic, and regulatory developments.",

          "authors": "Ke Zhang",
          "abstract": "Abstract. Semantic information in images—such as meaningful, recognizable regions or objects that are incongruent with the overall scene—can effectively capture attention. The meaning map is currently the primary method for mapping the distribution of semantic information across visual stimuli. However, this approach relies on subjective human ratings of semantic meaningfulness and requires extensive manual annotation for each image prior to analysis. To address these limitations and enable rapid, efficient, and reproducible generation of semantic distribution maps for any given image, this paper proposes an automated method for constructing semantic information maps using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach generates two types of semantic maps: local semantic information maps, which quantify the semantic content at each spatial location within an image, and global semantic maps, which assess the contextual relevance of local regions to the overall scene. Additionally, the method can generate distribution maps of visual information associated with specific concepts. We argue that this method significantly enhances the precision and flexibility in controlling, measuring, and manipulating semantic information in visual stimuli, thereby advancing research in visual attention and visual language processing. The method is currently under further refinement.",

The nature of consciousness is discussed in depth, referencing specific research including advances in renormalization techniques that imply consciousness exists at a fractal critical point in the brain and that consciousness is most likely fractal and holographic and exists on a space-time boundary where consciousness and memories are stored and operate external to the human mind, analogous to cloud computing.

Este artículo explora, desde un enfoque transdisciplinar (neurociencia, psicología clínica, epigenética, neuroeconomía e inteligencia artificial), cómo los bloqueos emocionales no procesados actúan como loops proyectivos internos que secuestran la corteza prefrontal a través de activaciones límbicas crónicas. Estos patrones reducen la expresión real de genialidad, afectando incluso a líderes de alto rendimiento intelectual. A través del modelo de integración emocional IEAD y la lógica simbólica cuántica, se propone una vía operativa para restaurar el acceso funcional completo al potencial cognitivo.

          "abstract": "Progressive tests are a popular tailored test format where items are administered in increasing order of difficulty level and discontinued according to a rule system that should counter excessive response burden for test participants and guarantee efficient use of resources for test administrators. To facilitate evidence-based decision-making for setting appropriate discontinue rules, we propose a transparent approach that charts the impact of varied alternative discontinue rules on accuracy and efficiency. These A-E charts are based on retroactively applying discontinue rules to normative item response data. We show that a universal discontinue rule likely does not exist and that the optimal rule varies as a function of the desired efficiency-accuracy trade-off suitable for the intended test use and target population. The proposed approach provides a pragmatic solution for practitioners, researchers, test developers, and test publishers to rethink the existing discontinue rules, systematically evaluate the alternatives, and set appropriate rules.",

          "abstract": "Two-stage models of grammatical encoding posit that sentence production unfolds in two sequential steps: the construction of a hierarchical syntactic structure, followed by its linearization into a sequence suitable for articulation. While widely accepted in psycho- and neurolinguistics, such models lack formal computational implementations. Here, we introduce a novel Multinomial Processing Tree (MPT) model that operationalizes this two-stage framework to explain syntactic error patterns in individuals with aphasia. Drawing on discourse samples annotated for distinct error types, we fit an MPT model to estimate individual abilities at each processing stage. These ability estimates correlated with observed error rates and localized to distinct neural substrates: hierarchical encoding ability was linked to the posterior superior temporal sulcus and parietal cortex, linearization to posterior frontal and anterior parietal regions, and omission-related processes to the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between hierarchical and linear stages of grammatical encoding, aligning with prior lesion-symptom mapping and theoretical accounts of expressive agrammatism and paragrammatism. This work represents the first computational instantiation of a two-stage model of syntactic production, bridging formal modeling and lesion analysis to advance our understanding of the architecture and breakdown of grammatical encoding.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discern the statistical regularities in our environments has been shown to support key cognitive functions, including attention, prediction and language learning. While most research has focused on stable regularities, real-world patterns often change over time, requiring flexible updating of internal representations. In the context of embedded pattern learning, where continuous input consists of hidden pairs or triplets, prior work showed that learning of an initial structure can hinder learning of an updated one. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on post-exposure (offline) learning measures, the current study also incorporated an online target detection during exposure, to gauge real-time learning and adaptation to novel patterns more directly. In three separate blocks, participants were exposed to a stream of embedded pairs that were reshuffled into new pairs halfway through the stream. We administered the same task in both the visual and auditory modality, allowing us to explore modality-specific differences. The online target detection measure revealed that participants learned both the initial and updated regularities, but with an advantage for learning the former. In contrast, our offline measure only evidenced recognition of the initial patterns, echoing previously reported primacy effects. These learning effects were only present in the auditory modality, with no evidence of visual statistical learning. Our results corroborate earlier findings and underscore the importance of online measures in capturing flexible learning that is not captured by offline measures.",

For example, characters who imitate the actions of a specific social partner are more likely, compared to a non-imitator, to help that social partner in the future. Infants’ expectations appear to be based on inferences of specific relationships, as they do not generalize to new social targets. Here we ask, however, if infants will extend expectations of support to the friend of a friend. We investigated whether infants could use their observations of two social agents’ positive social imitation interactions with the same target to make a transitive inference that the mutual affiliates were likely to be affiliated themselves. We did not find any evidence that infants used these observations to infer that mutual affiliates were more likely to be affiliated themselves.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "abstract": "The colloquial term People Pleasing refers to a tendency to prioritize the needs and goals of others over one’s own needs and goals. Neglecting one’s interests, desires, and duties in favor of others arguably goes along with a manifold of psychological consequences for individuals high in people pleasing. In two preregistered studies (n1 = 571, n2 = 794), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely, Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Nomological network analyses revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was correlated with yet distinguishable from agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the utility of the People Pleasing Scale for scientific and applied purposes. This report will be updated once the target sample size (n2 = 1,293) for Study 2 is achieved.",

          "authors": "Franziska Magdalene Leipold; Arndt Bröder; Martin Schnuerch",
          "abstract": "The G parameter of the lens model equation is a widely used measure of cue-based judgment accuracy, capturing how well individuals align their cue use with ecological validities in probabilistic environments. Despite its popularity across various research domains, the psychological interpretability of G may be severely limited when estimated in the conventional way, that is, based on separate, participant-level regression models. In this paper, we identify core statistical limitations of the conventional approach and demonstrate how these may lead to severely biased conclusions about judgment accuracy across a range of plausible scenarios. To remedy these limitations and increase the meaningfulness of G estimates, we propose a novel hierarchical modeling approach. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the hierarchical approach yields markedly more accurate and robust G estimates, especially under realistic forms of model misspecification, such as omitted cues, omitted interactions, and misspecified nonlinear relationships. Two empirical illustrations—in the domains of healthiness judgments and metamemory—demonstrate the practical impact of modeling choice, further highlighting the bias in the conventional G parameter when misspecifying model equations. These findings challenge long-held beliefs about human judgment accuracy that were based on the conventional lens model approach. To avoid misleading conclusions due to biased estimates, we advocate for adopting the hierarchical approach as a more valid and reliable tool for measuring cue-based judgment accuracy, thereby strengthening the methodological rigor of judgment and decision-making research.",

          "authors": "Nora de Bode; Emese Kroon; Jia Hua Hsieh; Janna Cousijn",
          "abstract": "Cannabis use is widely on the rise for recreational and medicinal purposes, with the latter often aimed at improving mental health and cognition. Simultaneously, the prevalence of cannabis-related health harms, such as cannabis use disorder (CUD), is increasing. Product potency, route of administration, and preexisting mental health symptoms play a role in the effects of cannabis; however, there is limited research on how broader factors, such as local cannabis legislation and perceptions of use, may influence these outcomes. Moreover, knowledge remains sparse regarding the growing population of medicinal users, predominantly using without medical supervision. Altogether, this illustrates the need for ecologically valid ways to investigate individuals and their cannabis usage within real-world settings. \nTherefore, this longitudinal, cross-cultural online study examines an international sample of regular recreational and medicinal users (aged 18-65) from different cannabis jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands, the United States, Brazil, Canada, and regions in Asia and Africa) in their natural environment via their mobile phone. By using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), alongside a comprehensive battery of cognition and mental health related assessments over a 2-year period, we aim to gain insight into the short- and long-term mental health and cognitive determinants and consequences of cannabis use, and how these interact with broader, contextual factors, such as legislation. This is one of the first cross-cultural studies assessing both positive and negative effects of cannabis longitudinally, examining the full range of effects that cannabis may have on the individual.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Moderator analyses revealed a stronger association between Extraversion and TCAM preference in younger samples and between Openness and TCAM preference in USA samples. No systematic evidence of publication bias was detected; however, study quality moderated effects for Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Psychotic-like experiences and beliefs, as captured by Disintegration, may offer a promising direction for understanding TCAM preferences, warranting further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p &lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.",

          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based on single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature for its application in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, 1) suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and 2) validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology and conclude by offering suggestions for how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

As humans increasingly develop cognitive dependency and emotional intimacy with AI systems the boundaries between machine utility and human connection blur in potentially hazardous ways. In response to these challenges, this study proposes the conceptual model of Cognitive Gyms: structured environments for training attention, reflection, emotional intelligence, and moral reasoning. Just as physical gyms emerged as a societal response to the sedentary lifestyle induced by the Industrial Revolution, Cognitive Gyms offer a timely, preventative response to the cognitive atrophy- the gradual weakening or loss of cognitive functions due to disuse, precipitated by the digital and algorithmic age. The model integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and education, aiming not only to preserve human cognitive function but to protect the ethical core of human experience in the age of intelligent machines. The paper outlines core zones within the Cognitive Gym, suggests generalized exercise types, and highlights its potential to counteract cognitive and moral decline in the AI era. The model remains open-ended, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and contextual customization for future development.",

          "authors": "Cillian McHugh; Eric R. Igou",
          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

While many have positive experiences of EIP, there have also been reports of perceived harm. This scoping review synthesised qualitative evidence on service user perspectives of potential harm in EIP services in the UK, to consider how services may continue to improve practice to meet the needs of their patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review following a pre-registered protocol. Systematic searches were performed in PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and Medline on 9th October 2024. We included peer-reviewed qualitative studies exploring service user experiences in EIP services in the UK. Data on reported harms from eligible studies were thematically analysed.\n\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. We identified four main themes: (1) Intersection of stigma and lack of cultural awareness; (2) Inappropriate or inadequate support; (3) Poor relationships and communication; and (4) Challenges in the discharge process.\n\nConclusions: While EIP services offer the current gold standard of care for first episode psychosis, our review highlighted some areas where harm was perceived to have arisen. Such information presents potential targets for service improvement. Strengthening communication, enhancing information sharing, and expanding access to advocacy may help mitigate potential harms and optimise service user experiences. Further research to quantify the prevalence of harms within EIP services is needed to inform best practices and ensure equitable, person-centred care.",

          "abstract": "Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain.",

          "abstract": "Decisions problems are often characterized by the presence of many choice options described by several attributes, and people need to limit how much information they search for. We propose that humans search and thereby devote attention to relevant information in an efficient and goal-directed, but not necessarily optimal manner. Thereto, a novel hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model of information search in multi-attribute and multi-alternative decisions is presented and tested. In the model, the search process is governed by the desire to quickly identify the option that meets the choice goal best, which in turn depends on the importance and uncertainty of information and on the accumulated evidence. The theory accounts for many established empirical findings on the interplay of attention and decision making, including the positive correlation of gaze time and choice probability as well as the preference for sampling promising choice candidates. To rigorously test a series of top-down effects of attention, we present results of a new and preregistered eye-tracking experiment on multi-attribute decisions, in which the influence of bottom-up attention on visual search is minimized. Our theory accounts for the various interactions of attention and choice in this experiment, while variants of it and another extant theory that assume other search rules fail to capture them. Furthermore, the theory predicts additional choice dynamics such as the dependency of decision speed on the number and overall value of options. The proposed framework provides a general approach to understanding the intricate dynamics of search and valuation mechanisms in multi-attribute decisions.",

The present studies tested the robustness of this developmental asymmetry with minimal contrast pairs of uncertainty conditions. Across two studies (N = 204, 3- to 6-year-old German-speaking children), we found no differences between the conditions: Children did not prepare differently for multiple incompatible outcomes of physically and epistemically uncertain events.

          "abstract": "Enduring Mental Health (EMH) has been defined as maintaining good psychological functioning without developing mental health problems. Estimates of the proportion of individuals who have EMH vary widely. We investigated EMH across the lifespan, defined not only as absence of mental health problems, but also as consistent presence of high wellbeing. To explore how defining EMH affects prevalence, we included both stricter and broader lenient thresholds for mental health problems and low wellbeing.\n\nData came from 16,030 participants (35.2% male; average birth year 1970) from the longitudinal Netherlands Twin Register, who completed ≥4 assessments of mental health and/or wellbeing over 8–20 years. For each EMH definition, preregistered analyses included computation of prevalence, genetic and environmental influences using twin modeling, and phenotypic and genetic correlates including education, personality, social factors, and genetic predispositions for mental health outcomes.\n\nAs expected, the choice of threshold had a substantial impact on EMH prevalence estimates, 71% for absence of problems and 93% for high wellbeing when applying stricter thresholds for mental health compared to lenient thresholds, 42% and 82%, respectively. Heritability estimates (46-61%) and patterns of associations for EMH were similar across the different mental health thresholds. Protective factors included optimism, social support, and good self-rated health (OR= 1.50-2.86), while neuroticism, loneliness, and perceived stress were risk factors (OR=0.31-0.84).\n\nWe show the importance of defining EMH as both the absence of problems and the presence of wellbeing. While prevalence varied depending on threshold and definition used, the consistent genetic and psychosocial correlates for different definitions of EMH suggest stable underlying mechanisms that can inform prevention to help individuals maintain mental health.",

          "abstract": "The development of word reading skills fundamentally depends on children's interactions with printed words. A significant amount of research in the psychological and educational sciences has been conducted on the learning processes that contribute to skilled word recognition in children and adults. However, little is known about how ensembles of words encountered during early learning affect learning outcomes over timescales larger than what can be accomplished in a controlled experimental setting. In order to move past this limitation, using an established connectionist learning architecture (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, &amp; Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg &amp; McClelland, 1989) we examined how variation in word ensembles influence learning and generalization during early reading acquisition. We simulated learners (N = 30,000) exposed to different sets of monosyllabic printed words drawn randomly from children’s literature at a large scale. In order to examine how different ensembles might impact learning depending on the learner's ability to represent the relationship between letters and sounds, we also manipulated the representational capacity of models by systematically changing the number of hidden units, holding the ensemble of words constant. Across levels of representational capacity each model had \"twins\" which differed only in terms of the number of hidden units they possessed. Results demonstrate significant variation in learning outcomes in a set of generalization words as a function of the word, ensemble and representational capacity. These findings inform educational practices by highlighting the importance of deliberate word selection to support early development.",

Using data from the Africa Long Life Study, which sampled young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa (N = 2,770), we tested how personality traits are linked to seven important life outcomes. The Big Two personality traits, agency and communion, were assessed 2 to 3 years prior to the assessment of outcomes, including self-reported health, employment status, and anxiety. We used specification-curve analysis to examine the robustness of personality-outcome associations. Higher levels of agency and communion robustly predicted higher levels of self-rated health, and lower levels of anxiety and depression over 2 to 3 years. Furthermore, higher levels of communion predicted being employed 2 to 3 years later. However, personality-outcome associations were smaller than expected based on findings from Western countries (.02 ≤ |r| ≤ .11). Our findings provide novel insights into the cross-cultural replicability of personality-outcome associations, and we discuss the implications of our findings for personality research.",

Grounded in critical race theory, functionalism, and social capital theory, the research examined the lived experiences of eight Ghanaian women between the ages of 18 and 21. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, data were collected through 90-minute semi-structured Zoom interviews. Findings revealed that colorism is embedded within structural and social systems, shaping job access through appearance-based biases and unequal reliance on social capital. Lighter-skinned participants reported more direct hiring pathways, while darker-skinned participants faced exclusion, subtle discrimination, and greater dependency on referrals and mentorship. The study also uncovered varied levels of awareness regarding colorism’s influence, ranging from denial to gradual recognition. These insights culminated in the development of a researcher-constructed conceptual model illustrating how institutional norms, network-based gatekeeping, and internalized perceptions of professionalism converge to reinforce colorism in employment. The study highlights the need for inclusive hiring practices and broader systemic reforms to address appearance-based inequities in the Ghanaian job market.",

Participants (N = 41) were classified into four groups based on the degree of smoking (≤ 14 or ≥ 15 cigarettes per day) and the median total score on resilience scales (low-resilience low-smoking, low-resilience high-smoking, high-resilience low-smoking, and high-resilience high-smoking). Participants completed the TSST-OL, measuring subjective stress and salivary cortisol, at eight time points. A two-piece multilevel growth curve model with landmark registration (GCM-LR) examined the effects of smoking habits and resilience scores on cortisol concentrations. Blunted cortisol responses were similarly present in all four groups; thus, my hypothesis was unsupported. All groups showed similarly elevated subjective stress responses. GCM-LR results showed no significant cortisol increase, but the fixed effect of cortisol recovery was significant. The likelihood ratio test showed that the random effect of resilience scores was significant. Habitual smokers do not have an elevated cortisol response, even in stressful situations. Substantial individual differences were suggested in the effect of resilience scale scores on cortisol concentration.",

Humans, like all life, are sensitive to their environment.  Mentally ill or unstable individuals can be triggered into impulsive and violent activities from spikes in serum serotonin.  Human serum histamine level is directly proportional to environmental allergen or pollen levels, but serum serotonin level is inversely proportional to serum histamine levels with human males having 52% more serotonin than females.  Data show an association between the dates of violent acts, especially male single shooter mass shootings in the United States, and the dates of dramatic decreases in pollen levels thus indicating pollen and serum histamine level drops as a possible precursor or triggering relationship.  This knowledge can be used as a potential predictor for law enforcement and medical agencies for a given city or region.  Mental health professionals would be advised to lower serotonin boosting meds and even supplement antihistamine and sedative medications to male patients in the timeframes of March through June, for spring tree pollens especially juniper tree pollen, and from September through November, for fall ragweed weed pollen.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Optogenetics is a promising technology to restore vision in individuals with blindness due to retinal disorders. Light-sensitive proteins (opsins) are introduced intravitreally and bind to surviving non-photosensitive retinal cells to elicit a neural response to visual stimuli. Much of this research is done with mouse models, where it is not obvious how a given opsin would translate to human visual perception. Our goal was to provide estimates of potential patients’ spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity and perceptual experiences. We created ‘virtual patients’ consisting of neurotypical subjects viewing stimuli modified to match the temporal properties of two state-of-the-art opsins 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 and ChRmine. Methods: A non-linear model based on single cell electrophysiological data describing the sensitivity and temporal dynamics of each opsin was used to spatiotemporally modulate a counterphase modulated Gabor stimulus to replicate the predicted retinal stimulus of optogenetic patients. Contrast detection thresholds for optogenetic and control stimuli were obtained using a 2AFC quick CSF Bayesian adaptive procedure across a range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Results: Contrast sensitivity for 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 declined rapidly with increasing temporal frequency compared to the control stimulus, consistent with this opsin’s slow temporal dynamics. Sensitivity to opsin ChRmine was lower overall, but there was little decline in sensitivity at higher temporal frequencies. Conclusion: Using this virtual patient paradigm, we demonstrate the trade-off between sensitivity and temporal resolution for two example opsins. 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 would be expected to outperform ChRmine under many laboratory tests, such as a Snellen eye chart for a patient capable of maintaining stable fixation. However ChRmine would be predicted to outperform 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 during outdoor navigation in daylight. Ultimately, our goal is to predict patients’ performance across a wide range of clinically relevant tasks directly from an opsin’s temporal dynamics, paving the way for informed optimization of sight-restoration therapies before clinical application.",

Whereas the promotion focus needs for growth and development can be met by building intercultural relationships, the prevention focus needs for security and safety can be met by preventing relationship damage. The promotion-prevention motivational systems are associated with unique affective reactions in response to anticipated outcomes. Such affect-driven outcome expectancies shape the learning processes. The ALPs model presents a comprehensive cultural competence framework and identifies specific cultural competence strategies that have been overlooked in the existing literature.

          "abstract": "Around 60% of young people worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity, such as abuse, neglect, bullying, or poverty. These stressful experiences can have long-lasting effects and significantly increase the risk of mental health problems. To aid future intervention and prevention efforts, my doctoral research examined how childhood adversity contributes to mental health difficulties, and whether and how friendships can help protect against these effects.\n\nUsing a combination of literature reviews, behavioral studies, and brain imaging research, my colleagues and I found that young people with more severe childhood adversity were at greater risk of social isolation, being harmed or harming others, and developing mental health problems. This was partly due to differences in how they process and perceive stress. In addition, we found that those with strong, high-quality friendships reported lower stress perceptions and fewer mental health difficulties.\n\nThese findings matter for two key reasons. First, they detail how childhood adversity increases vulnerability to mental health problems. Second, they demonstrate that high-quality friendships play a critical protective role in mental health – and help explain how, by reducing stress perceptions. Hence, helping young people build and maintain supportive friendships could be an important way to promote mental health, especially for those who have faced childhood adversity.",

This paper introduces the FOCUS method—Find, Organize, Condense, Understand, and Synthesize—a framework for integrating AI into research workflows while preserving intellectual rigor. The approach uses AI-powered search to cast wider nets across formal and informal knowledge sources, converts ephemeral audio content into searchable text, employs structured prompts to extract insights from dense papers, leverages dialogue for deeper comprehension, and maintains human synthesis of disparate findings. Privacy concerns can be addressed through local models or platforms that don't train on user data. When implemented thoughtfully, these tools enable researchers to read more widely and think more deeply without sacrificing the critical thinking that defines good science. As research volume continues growing beyond individual capacity, the FOCUS method offers a path to expand intellectual reach while maintaining scholarly depth.",

          "authors": "Luke Atack; Ava Liddell; Karen M. Arnell; Stephen M Emrich",
          "abstract": "Images vary in how likely they are to be remembered, a characteristic referred to as memorability. While previous work has identified perceptual and semantic features that predict image memorability, less is known about how those features engage the cognitive systems that support memory. One open question is whether attention plays a role. Although some findings suggest that memorability operates independently of attention, these experiments have only tested a limited set of attentional mechanisms. The present research examines whether temporal attention contributes to image memorability using the attentional blink (AB), a phenomenon in which detection of a second target (T2) is impaired when it appears shortly after the first (T1). Two experiments used a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task with streams of images containing two intact targets among scrambled distractors. In Experiment 1, T1 memorability was manipulated, while in Experiment 2, T2 memorability was manipulated. In both experiments, the temporal gap between targets was also manipulated to assess how target memorability influences AB dynamics. Results showed that highly memorable T1s exacerbated the AB, suggesting they engage attention for longer. In contrast, highly memorable T2s attenuated the AB, indicating that they may more effectively trigger the attentional processes required for encoding. These findings suggest that memorability does not operate independently of attention but instead reflects how effectively an image engages the cognitive processes needed for encoding.",

          "abstract": "Persistence and perseverance, even in the face of great adversity, are admirable qualities. However, knowing when to stop pursuing something is as important as exerting effort toward attaining a goal. How do people decide when to persist and when to quit? Here, we design a novel task to study this question, in which people were given a finite number of opportunities to pursue stochastic rewards by selecting among a set of options that provide a reward each trial. At any time, if people were not satisfied with the option they had selected they could choose to abandon it and instead try a new option. However, if they did so they could never return to the previous option. Mathematical analysis of this task shows that the optimal strategy explores a relatively small number of options before settling on a sufficiently good option. Further, we find that the optimal strategy is to abandon an option if the total number of remaining trials exceeds a threshold specified by the observed option’s performance. A large-scale, pre-registered experiment (N = 3, 632) reveals that people largely behave in accordance with the optimal strategy. People also make decisions to persist with an option based on its performance and they typically explore relatively few options before settling on a sufficiently good one. However, compared to the optimal strategy, people are less sensitive to the number of remaining trials and are more likely to persist with sub-optimal options.",

We demonstrate an alternative approach that samples deeply and broadly to discover reliable person-specific, multimodal patterns of daily life experience. Ninety-seven healthy adults wore cardiac monitors for 8 hours/day for 14 days and reported current valence, arousal, primary activity, social context, and emotions (via free report) when prompted following a substantial cardiac interbeat interval change (and twice randomly each day). From each event (10,755 total, M=110.9 events/person), we extracted cardiovascular, postural, affective, and contextual features. Integrative clustering of these features identified 313 multimodal patterns (M=3.2 patterns/person), which were largely person-specific, with 81.7% of patterns being unique to one person. The pattern-distinguishing features also varied by person. Finally, self-generated emotion labels had many-to-many mappings with multimodal patterns. Our approach has broad utility and provides further evidence that emotions are diverse populations of instances.",

          "abstract": "In the digital era, human cooperation is increasingly mediated by indirect social cues such as ratings, reviews, and other digital traces left in online environments. These traces often guide collective behavior via stigmergy, a coordination mechanism whereby individuals interact through modifications of a shared environment. In this study, we explore how simple model-driven bots can influence human cooperation or defection in a competitive rating game inspired by online marketplaces. Participants, unaware of the bots' presence, interacted with either four human partners or four bots exhibiting predefined behaviors—cooperative, neutral, deceptive, or optimized for group performance. We show that the presence and behavior of bots significantly affect human strategies and performance. Higher levels of cooperation among bots improve human outcomes but also increase the frequency of deceptive human strategies, suggesting exploitation of reliable social information. Conversely, in less cooperative environments, participants adopt more collaborative or neutral behaviors to preserve informational value. By classifying individuals into three behavioral profiles—collaborators, neutrals, and defectors—we develop a linear regression model using three cues: the average value of rated cells, the diversity of rated cells, and the player's rank. These cues allow accurate prediction of behavioral profile distributions across experimental conditions. An adaptive agent-based model further reproduces the empirical results. Our findings demonstrate that even simple bots can strongly influence collective dynamics in human groups. These insights have implications for the design of recommendation systems, the regulation of automated agents, and the understanding of cooperation and deception in digital societies.",

We conducted a 6-week, digital intervention with multiple treatment groups and a randomized control design (N = 426) to examine the efficacy of theory-based strategies that varied in scope, intensity, and content. Across groups, participants decreased on self-report and implicit neuroticism measures (d = -0.18 to -0.38). Intervention effects exceeded normative change and demand effects, were specific to neuroticism, and persisted at 2-month follow-up (d = -0.14 to -0.43). Efficacy was proportional to treatment intensity and specificity (d = -0.16 to -0.60), and there was some evidence that state-based strategies have stronger immediate effects whereas habit-based strategies have more enduring effects. This study demonstrates that motivated people can become meaningfully less neurotic with effort in just 6 weeks and offers insights into underlying mechanisms.",

Across nine simulation studies, we varied the task complexity and prompt design to examine conditions under which previously reported model-based RL signatures could be replicated. We found that GPT-3.5 showed model-based RL signatures in simplified task settings, but that these effects disappeared under de-simplified task versions. Crucially, model-based reasoning signatures could be re-established when incorporating an inner speech-analog prompt, requiring the LLM agent to reflect on previous trials and anticipate consequences of future actions. Our fine-grained analyses of behavioral learning dynamics highlight the role of structured reflective and anticipatory linguistic processes in enabling complex response patterns in LLMs and reveal both similarities and differences to human decision-making patterns.",

          "authors": "Jenny Zhen-Duan; Alexandre Lussier; Anna E. Wilson; Sarah M. Merrill; Kristin Valentino; Erin C. Dunn; Alejandra D. Chavez",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Parental adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), or adversities parents experience when they are children, significantly impact their children's biobehavioral outcomes. Maternal ACEs are associated with epigenetic age acceleration (EAA; faster biological aging) in infants (Sosnowski et al., 2024) and young children (Nwanaji-Enwerem et al., 2021). While the effects of paternal ACEs and EAA have not been directly examined, emerging studies indicate that paternal ACEs correlate with DNA methylation in their infants, and these methylated CpG (genetic) were associated with externalizing outcomes three years later (Merrill et al., 2021). Family factors (e.g., positive parenting practices) can buffer the association between maternal ACEs and EAA (Sullivan et al., 2023). However, it is unclear if family factors buffer the effects of both maternal and paternal ACEs and EAA; and whether the associations between parental ACEs and EAA are observed later in development, like adolescence.  \n\n \n\nHypotheses: To examine whether parental ACEs and youth’s EAA are moderated by family factors (i.e., family cohesion, parent-child relationship quality). We hypothesized that both fathers’ and mothers’ family-level (e.g., maltreatment, family dysfunction) and community-level (e.g., discrimination, community violence) ACEs would be associated with EAA, but that family factors would mitigate this effect.  \n\n \n\nSample: Participants were from the ENLACEs study. Participating families had to be of Mexican descent, and youth had to be between the ages of 12 and 15 at baseline. Our study included family triads recruited from northern Indiana: youth (n = 120), mothers (n = 120), and fathers (n = 120).  \n\n \n\nStudy Methods: Participants were recruited with the help of community-based partners. Bilingual and bicultural assistants administered surveys to parents in English or Spanish, while youth surveys were self-administered on tablets. Surveys assessing parental ACEs were collected during Wave 1, youth-reported questionnaires of parent-child relationships and family cohesion were collected in Wave 2, and salivary DNA for epigenetic analysis was collected in Wave 2. Epigenetic age acceleration was estimated from two clocks: the Pediatric Buccal Epigenetic (PedBE) and Horvarth. We employed path analysis and maximum likelihood estimations with robust standard errors in R.  \n\n \n\nResults  \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, the association between fathers' family-level ACEs and youth EAA was moderated by parent-child relationship in both clocks: PedBE (beta=-0.03; p=0.086) and Horvath (beta=-0.173; p=0.004). Similarly, the association between mothers’ community-level ACEs and EAA was moderated by family cohesion: PedBE (beta=-0.009; p=0.041) and Horvath (beta=-0.045; p=0.001). In contrast to hypothesized directions, family cohesion moderated the association between fathers and mothers’ family-level ACEs and EAA: PedBE (beta=0.021; p=0.008) and Horvath (beta=0.018; p=0.036), respectively.   \n\n \n\nConclusion \n\nConsistent with previous mother-child dyadic studies, fathers’ ACEs can similarly impact their children’s EAA, and these observations can also be noted during adolescence. While seemingly counterintuitive, this finding points to family cohesion as an element by which family factors can strongly affect their children's biology, whether positively or negatively. Future research will be necessary to elucidate the nuanced impact of family factors on the potential intergenerational biological consequences of parental ACEs, but these findings lay a foundation for future family-based interventions.",

Here we focus on a key engine of the university research enterprise – graduate students – and ask if faculty mentors are cognizant of and make explicit their attunement to the communal values of their graduate student researchers. We found that when describing the values of graduate students, faculty underestimate the communal values that members of RMM groups are more likely to hold. When faculty communicated communal values, this correlated positively with a more diverse research lab and several measures of faculty success.",

          "authors": "Alexandre Heeren; Camille Mouguiama-Daouda",
          "abstract": "Climate change represents an unprecedented threat, with rising levels of climate anxiety widely reported. Most psychological research has primarily examined relationships between climate anxiety and mitigation behaviors while largely neglecting adaptation behaviors, which involve preparing for inevitable climate impacts. Yet, ethological and foundational anxiety theories emphasize anxiety's adaptive role in fostering preparedness and proactive coping with threats, particularly in uncertain, future-oriented situations. Based on this framework, we examined whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and future anticipation influence the association between climate anxiety and adaptation versus mitigation behaviors. In a preregistered fashion, we analyzed data from 968 French-speaking adults using two complementary computational network modeling approaches: (1) a graphical Gaussian model to examine conditional associations among climate anxiety, IU components (prospective and inhibitory), future anticipation, experience of climate change, and adaptation and mitigation behaviors; and (2) a directed acyclic graph to generate a data-driven model of the directional probabilistic dependencies among these variables. Results consistently highlighted prospective IU—characterized by proactive information-seeking and planning in the face of uncertainty—as central within the network, and positively linked to adaptation behaviors and climate anxiety. Conversely, inhibitory IU (characterized by paralysis in uncertainty) appeared to be peripheral. This study, which relies on new computational methods, emphasizes the essential yet overlooked role of adaptation and offers fresh, data-driven insights into its relationship with climate anxiety, future anticipations, and intolerance of uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Arie Todd Greenleaf",
          "abstract": "Modern science, from physics to biology, rests on a foundational assumption: entities are primary, and the relations between them are secondary. This paper argues that this substance-first ontology is the principal barrier to a scientific theory of consciousness and proposes its inversion: relations are fundamental.\nFrom this new paradigm, termed Dynergeia, a specific, falsifiable theory of consciousness naturally emerges. It posits that experience is instantiated whenever five universal relational patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) achieve dynamic coherence within a system’s native temporal window (τ). This state is quantified by a substrate-agnostic metric, Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS), which makes high-risk predictions, including a precise collapse under anesthesia and a strong correlation with cross-species behavioral flexibility.\nThis relational framework does not merely offer a new solution; it dissolves the old problems. The \"hard problem\" is revealed as a category error. Time is reframed as an emergent architecture constructed by coordinated events. The result is a proposed unification of the physical and phenomenological worlds, grounded not in a shared substance, but in a shared universal grammar. This work presents a direct, empirical test of a new foundation for science itself.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nObjective and subjective cognitive deficits, particularly in working memory (WM), are\ncommon in psychiatric conditions, yet their mechanisms remain poorly understood.\nRumination, a key transdiagnostic factor, has been proposed to contribute to these\ndeficits by depleting executive resources. However, the causal impact of ruminative\nstates on cognitive performance and subjective difficulties remains untested.\n\nMethods:\nIn a preregistered online study, 282 participants were randomly assigned to a rumination\nor neutral group. Both groups recalled an upsetting event, followed by a rumination\ninduction or neutral condition for either group. WM was assessed using an n-back task,\nwhile subjective difficulties were assessed through effort rating. These were administered\nbefore and after induction. Mixed ANOVAs were employed to assess the induction effects.\n\nResults:\nThere was a significant group × time interaction for performance and effort perception\n(independently from performance). These effects were not moderated by trait rumination\nor depressive symptom severity. Performance effects were mediated by increased self-\nreport cognitive interference, while perceived effort was not. Post hoc analyses revealed\nthat rumination selectively affected performance in non-match trials and did not interact\nwith cognitive load (n-level).\n\nConclusion:\nEven brief episodes of ruminative states can alter both cognitive performance and the\nsubjective experience of it. Cognitive interference mediating performance but not effort\nsuggests distinct underlying mechanisms. The selective effect on non-match trials\nwithout an effect of cognitive load points to disrupted inhibitory control. Together,\ntargeting rumination may not only alleviate psychological symptoms but also help\npreserve cognitive functioning.",

          "abstract": "Concerns about political violence have intensified across the United States. We conducted two pre-registered studies (N=408 and N=906) examining how Americans perceive support for political violence within their own and opposing political parties. In Study 1, Democrats estimated that 29.60% of Republicans report supporting political violence, but only 1.83% of Republicans actually report support, representing a 1,517% overestimation. In contrast, Republicans estimated that 19.48% of Democrats report supporting political violence, but only 3.54 % of Democrats actually did—a 450% overestimation. Thus, while both groups overestimated the prevalence of outparty members’ political violence support, we find that Democrats are significantly more pessimistic. In Study 2, we replicated this finding with a larger, nationally representative sample. We also explored the limits of this asymmetry and found no evidence of asymmetric perceptions for non-political crime support or ingroup members’ political violence support, suggesting a unique asymmetry in perceived outgroup political violence support.",

          "abstract": "Objective: We explored transfer of learning from brief practice with different input devices in the Navy’s Performance Based Measures Battery (PBM), a psychomotor subset of the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB).\n\nBackground: The PBM is a set of computerized tests used as a part of the ASTB to select aviators in the U.S. military. Official practice is not available, leading candidates to practice with unofficial re-creations and with or without access to the stick-and-throttle used on the PBM. \n\nMethod: Our between-subjects study with 152 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy evaluated the impact of mouse/keyboard or stick/throttle practice on the psychomotor portions of the PBM compared to a control group that was only presented with an informational video.\n\nResults: The results showed that practice with either input device resulted in improved performance relative to control on the PBM’s two-dimensional airplane tracking task (ATT). For the simpler vertical tracking task (VTT), the mouse/keyboard group showed significantly worse performance than either stick/throttle practice or control groups, indicating a transfer cost from practicing with an alternative input device.\n\nConclusion: The results suggest that becoming familiar with the unique dynamics of the ATT may be more important than practicing with the appropriate input device. Conversely, device-specific motor learning appears to be a more impactful determinant of performance for the simpler VTT. This shows that transfer effects from alternative input devices depends in part on properties of the task.\n\nApplication: This research can inform practice policies for psychomotor test selection.",

          "abstract": "Why do people feel curious about some questions but not others? Recent accounts of curiosity argue that curiosity should be highest when learning is likely to occur and likely to be rapid. This implies that variation in “information accessibility”—the ease and speed with which information can be acquired—might affect curiosity. Specifically, learning is less likely to occur and less likely to be rapid when information is less accessible, which might decrease curiosity. We tested this prediction in three preregistered experiments with a total of 419 participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, we prompted adult participants to rate their curiosity about the answers to trivia questions. For each question, they were informed that information accessibility would be high—they would receive the answer with minimal time and effort—or low—they would receive the answer with substantial time and effort. In Experiment 3, we additionally varied the probability that information search would be successful. Across studies, we found that information accessibility affected decisions to seek information, but not self-reported curiosity. This suggests that curiosity is unhindered by the practical costs of information search—and perhaps, sensitive to “idealized” expectations about the learning process, rather than “practical” expectations that incorporate current barriers to learning.",

          "abstract": "When we perceive, there is something we perceive. When we think, there is something we think\nof. When we dream, something is dreamt. These seem all platitudes: obvious and unproblematic\ntruths. And, given that the things perceived, thought of, or dreamed are what philosophers call the\nmental contents of our states, few things should seem as obvious and unproblematic as the\nexistence of mental contents. And yet, I shall here argue that, when closely examined, mental\ncontents appear to be illusions. Just like the proverbial sawn-in-half assistant on the magician\nstage, they merely appear to exist, without actually existing. To substantiate this view I will first fix\nthe reference of “mental content” and “illusion” in an innocent, theory neutral manner - that is, by\nrelying on paradigmatic positive and negative examples of them (sections 2 and 3). I will also show\nthat such paradigmatic examples allow us to extract a list of features that such examples allow us\nto identify features that paradigmatically identify contents and illusions as such, enabling us to\nrecognize them. With these features at hand, I will thus argue that mental contents bear all the\nfeatures that paradigmatically identify illusions. Otherwise put, I will argue that mental contents\nare anomalous, causally insulated, systematic, persistent and bound to a single mode of access in\nthe same way paradigmatic examples of illusions are (Section 4). Having argued for my main claim,\nI will defend it from a couple of intuitive objections; namely that it is to silly to be taken seriously,\ngiven that mental content is given in a way that does not permit to seriously doubt of its existence\n(section 5), and that my claim is incoherent (section 6). I’ll show that, intuitive as they are, the\nobjections are not compelling, and indeed they can be easily answered. Lastly, I will conclude the\npaper sketching the possible developments of an illusionistic view of content (section 7).",

          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology, and conclude by offering suggestions of how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

Across four studies, we: (a) introduce one of the most\ncomprehensive trait lists to-date (2,847 trait words); (b) establish normative human ratings of\nthese traits (from N = 3,070 English speakers) along 24 empirically-derived dimensions; (c)\ndetect a four-factor structure of Fitness, Agency, Communion, and Traditionalism (FACT) from\nthese dimensions; and (d) reveal systematic differences in the coherence, valence, and historical\nevolution of these dimensions and factors.

Proposed solutions to this “reliability paradox” range from collecting more test trials to modifying the tasks and/or the way in which effects are measured from these tasks. Here we systematically compare two proposed modeling solutions in a cognitive conflict task. Using the ratio of individual variability of the conflict effect (i.e., signal) and the trial-by-trial variation in the data (i.e., noise) obtained from Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we examine whether improving statistical modeling may improve the reliability of individual differences assessment in four Stroop datasets. The proposed improvements are 1) increasing the descriptive adequacy of the statistical models from which conflict effects are derived, and 2) using psychologically-motivated measures from cognitive measurement models. Our results show that the type of model does not have a consistent effect on the signal-to-noise ratio: the proposed solutions improved reliability in only one of the four datasets. We provide analytical and simulation-based approaches to compute the signal-to-noise ratio for a range of models of varying sophistication and discuss their potential to aid in developing and comparing new measurement solutions to the reliability paradox.",

          "abstract": "Many of today’s pressing societal challenges, such as organ shortages, low vaccination rates, and climate change, require significant changes in individual behavior. One promising intervention to encourage such behavioral change is the opt-out default, which presumes consent for a desirable action rather than requiring active opt in. While past research focused on the impact of opt-out defaults on the targeted behavior, potential crowding out of related behaviors has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigate whether adopting opt-out policies for deceased organ donation reduces living donations, a related prosocial behavior serving the same public good. Analyzing epidemiological panel data from countries that adopted an opt-out default between 2000 and 2023, we find that the policy switch, on average, leads to a non-significant increase in annual deceased donor rates of +1.21 people per million population (+7%, P = .213) but to a significant decrease in living donor rates of -4.59 people per million population (–29%, P = .026). Across four additional studies, we demonstrate that this crowding out effect is reflected in a reduced willingness for living altruistic (vs. familial) donations and is attributable to a stronger belief that the organ supply is sufficiently met with deceased donations under opt-out (vs. opt-in). Our research advances insights into the unintended consequences of default nudges and suggests ways to mitigate them.",

The results confirmed, for the first time with longitudinal evidence, the pattern of indirect associations between the Dark Triad and anxiety through resilience/mental toughness. The findings also emphasized the importance of differentiating the three ‘dark traits’, as they showed different relations with other traits in the network. For example, narcissism was unique among the Dark Triad in that it predicted better mental health, whereas Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to poorer resilience and mental health.  Narcissism was also the most influential node in the network of personality, resilience and anxiety.

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative theory of mind that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries (cognition, emotion, action), offering a perspective centered on the experience of the acting/perceiving subject. Moving beyond purely mechanistic descriptions, the model presents three primary functional spheres—the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\"—whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification within their respective domains. This mode is realized through the constant dynamic interplay between top-down flows (internally generated anticipations) and bottom-up flows (incoming sensory data). \n\nUnderpinning these functional spheres are two fundamental and omnipresent Cardinal Principles, universal to all organisms with a nervous system: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). These two core principles perform dual perceptive and executive functions, supporting the anticipation/verification mode of the three \"I\"s. The HS is responsible for the awareness of state and wholeness, the synthesis of forms and identities, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and the awareness of interactions and relationships. \n\nA unifying and central principle orchestrating the mind's dynamism and facilitating fluid transitions between these functional spheres is the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens). Its role is the universal application of the operational method of constantly generating and integrating predictions, followed by their verification. But how these predictions and knowledge itself take shape is guided by a fundamental process called Cognitive Morphogenesis. This process describes how knowledge is generated and organized at all levels, from the simplest to the most complex, operating through the dynamic interaction of the HS and QS. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and execution are not mere functions, but intrinsic and dynamic goals of the anticipation/verification method: perception verifies a sensory/cognitive anticipation (\"the then\" of \"if...then\"), and execution performs an action to verify a motor/intentional anticipation. The article outlines these principles and their evolution through the functional spheres, illustrating how the Prognostic Mind articulates into the \"I Act\" (present in all animals), the \"I Socialize\" (typical of birds and mammals), and the \"I Think\" (unique to humans). It also touches upon the related systems of mnemonic encoding and representation (holistic and quantum encoding). The integrated and dynamic nature of the mind is emphasized, laying the groundwork for future, more in-depth discussions of each functional sphere and their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, such as the crucial role of gamma motoneurons (γ-MNs) and muscle spindles in embodied attention and perceptual anticipation, as well as their manifestation in higher-level cognitive processes like language, specifically explored through Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). \n\nThe article further discusses the model's validity at a high level of generalization, highlighting its coherence and the possibility of descending to more detailed levels of analysis for a deeper understanding of mental and neural phenomena, including the articulation of the HS and QS across different interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory modalities.",

In response, this article introduces Computational Thinking (CT) as a novel, non-pharmacological framework to support cognitive organization in older adults experiencing cognitive frailty. Though CT has gained traction in fields like PK-16 education, including special education, for enhancing executive function and problem-solving, it has not yet been applied to geriatric- or memory-care contexts. This perspective proposes that CT’s core components (i.e., decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking) may align with residual cognitive strengths in mild-to-moderate dementia, offering a strengths-based, meta-cognitive scaffold for processing routines, instructions, and transitions. We provide theoretical rationale, interdisciplinary support, and concrete implementation examples to illustrate how CT can augment existing care models. By emphasizing cognitive structuring over costly service expansion, CT has the potential to complement current interventions and inform more efficient, person-centered dementia care strategies.",

          "abstract": "Vocal communication (e.g., pitch) can shape inferences about speakers and the content of their messages. Yet, it’s unknown how such communication impacts the effectiveness of social support. We examined the role of support givers’ vocal pitch in three dyadic datasets (N1 = 39; N2 = 39; N3 = 59; friend pairs) where participants recorded scripted reappraisals (i.e., reinterpretations) of aversive stimuli to support a friend with regulating emotion. Using Bayesian statistics, we found cumulative evidence that when support givers used higher pitch in delivering these reappraisals, targets of support experienced less negative affect. Targets of support also reported greater relationship satisfaction with support givers who used higher pitch during reappraisal. These data consisted primarily of women friend pairs, with preliminary results indicating that these associations may not hold in men friendships. These results highlight acoustic features of verbal communication as a promising frontier for strengthening social ties and emotional wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent a significant public health concern due to their high prevalence and substantial impact across the lifespan. Despite advances in understanding their neurobiological underpinnings, the transdiagnostic mechanisms driving psychiatric conditions remain unclear. Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) is an emerging, non-invasive technique for investigating the dopaminergic (DA) and norepinephric (NE) systems, offering valuable insights into their role in psychiatric disorders. This review explores the potential of NM-MRI in psychiatric research, emphasizing its ability to reveal links between DA and NE dysregulation and psychiatric conditions, therewith offering insights in neurobiological mechanisms. We summarize current NM-MRI findings across psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Overall, NM-MRI has shown considerable potential in studying psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, addiction, and depression. However, its application remains limited in disorders like anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders, despite their known associations with DA and NE dysfunction. To fully establish NM-MRI as a clinical research tool, further efforts are needed to standardize protocols and improve the technique’s specificity and reliability in psychiatric contexts. Moreover, longitudinal studies and cross-diagnostic comparisons are essential to establish NM-MRI as a potential marker for treatment response and identifying individuals at risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Current review underscores the promise of NM-MRI's for early diagnosis, intervention, and advancing mental health research.",

          "abstract": "Analogies are a fundamental part of our cognition and communication. Humans are also a social species with shared cultural repertoires learnt throughout our lifetimes. As such, we expect analogies to enable the learning of complex, novel information by communication that takes advantage of shared cultural information. Here, we demonstrate the plausibility of this proposal and clarify its scope through computational modelling. We first model the individual-level process of learning via analogy with access to a shared repertoire of cultural information, using NK landscapes to represent high-dimensional solution spaces for complex problems. We then analyse a model of population dynamics to consider the conditions under which analogical communication will evolve and be maintained when costly. Our analyses suggest that even when analogy use is costly in terms of both search time and memory constraints, it can nevertheless be advantageous by allowing learners to obtain high-quality solutions more efficiently and more often than those who don't learn via analogy.",

          "abstract": "Social relationships are central to well-being because they fulfill basic affiliation needs. To describe how these needs are regulated, theories connect daily-life processes of social contact, social desire, and affect. Still, such processes remain empirically underexplored because of their complexity. In this study, we estimated multivariate associations of social desire and affect with social contact across different modalities (in-person, digital), time scales (hourly, daily), and levels of analysis (between-person, contemporaneous, temporally lagged). Participants from two age-heterogeneous samples answered experience sampling questions and contributed data through unobtrusive smartphone sensing, with roughly hourly assessments across 2 days (N = 303) and daily assessments across 14 days (N = 377). Multi-level vector autoregressive network models revealed associations between social contact, social desire, and affect across levels of analysis. Results were highly specific to the examined time scale. When measured at an hourly timescale, people desired more social contact than usual when they engaged in more in-person contact, and higher social desire predicted more future social contact in both experience sampling and smartphone sensing. In contrast, at a daily timescale, social desire did not predict future contact. Bidirectional linkages of affect and social contact were also much denser hourly (vs. daily). Compared to in-person contact, calls and communication app usage generally showed distinct associations with affect. We discuss theoretical implications for the dynamic regulation of social needs, especially regarding temporal processes and the role of positive affect in predicting social contact. Finally, we delineate future directions of multi-method research into daily-life social dynamics.",

Clinical outcomes were derived from changes in repeated self-reported scores on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) surveys administered before the first and most recent treatment visits. Adjusted logistic and linear regression was used for the analyses examining type of provider characteristic selected, engagement, and changes in each clinical outcome.\nResults  This study included Grow Therapy patients (mean age 34.0 years; 69.8% identifying as female). Over a quarter of patients selected a provider specialty (27.1%) and 4.4% selected a provider identity. Patients met with their provider a mean of 9.6 times (67.4% had 3 or more visits) and, among complete case patients with at least 2 PHQ-9 and 2 GAD-7 assessments (n=67,105), a large proportion showed significantly improved symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 improvement=3.5, 60.0% with a minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) and anxiety (GAD-7 improvement=3.5, 66.1% MCID). Patients selecting a provider specialty had fewer visits but had greater declines in depression symptoms, and those selecting a provider identity engaged longer in care than patients not selecting each of these characteristics, respectively.\nConclusions and Relevance  This real world study demonstrates that a technology-enabled mental health platform that allows patients to self-select their provider is engaging and preliminarily efficacious. Patients may maximize benefits of these platforms by selecting preferred characteristics of their providers.",

          "abstract": "Politics can have substantial and wide adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health, especially in politically polarized environments. As a result, political polarization is now recognized as a major non-medical cause of disease and suffering. We examine if and how citizens can protect their health from such adverse effects without undermining their civic engagement.  We identify a psychological mechanism of resilience rooted in bodily awareness and show that interoception –the ability to perceive and trust one’s internal bodily signals– can act as a protective factor against the adverse health effects of politics. Across three studies on over 2,000 participants conducted during the 2022 mid-term U.S. election and the 2024 U.S. presidential election, higher interoceptive sensibility was consistently associated with lower reported costs of politics on emotional, physical, behavioral, and social health, while controlling for political identity, demographics, and emotion regulation strategies. During the emotionally charged 2024 election, individuals high in interoceptive sensibility reported fewer negative emotions, greater hope for the future and less fear, particularly if their candidate lost. These benefits extended to greater emotional resilience and a more positive outlook about the nation’s future. Importantly, interoceptive sensibility was positively associated with political engagement and efficacy, suggesting that better interoception awareness enhances, rather than inhibits, democratic participation. Our findings highlight interoceptive sensibility as a promising trait for mitigating politi-cal stress without reducing civic involvement.",

          "abstract": "In language processing, word meanings are retrieved from memory and converted into sentential expressions that have referential meaning at the level of utterances. Cognitive processes related to lexical retrieval versus the construction of referential meaning through grammar have not been properly disentangled yet. We addressed this with an experimental design aimed to link well-known N400 effects and late positive components (LPCs) to this distinction. We tested the hypothesis that semantic conflicts derived from a collision with stored (= ‘offline’) knowledge would elicit N400 effects, while semantic conflicts arising ‘online’ during the grammatical construction of referential meaning would exclusively trigger LPCs and also differ in their latency, amplitude or topography from formal-syntactic violations. Three anomalous conditions were compared against a baseline of correct sentences, across five word-positions within stimulus sentences: semantic anomalies that are lexically- but not grammatically-driven (I arrived in a button last week), semantic anomalies that are grammatically- but not lexically-driven (I arrived in a London last week), and formal-syntactic anomalies (I arrived in a cities last week). Results showed, in line with predictions, that (i) only the lexically-driven anomalies elicited N400 components, while (ii) all three anomalous conditions elicited LPCs, extending from the target word to subsequent word positions in the sentence; and (iii) the LPCs were all distinct in latency, amplitude and spatiotemporal topographies. These results demonstrate for the first time that grammar-level meaning, which is referential rather than lexical-conceptual in nature, has its own distinctive ERP, while confining the role of the N400 to effects of stored, or else contextually updated, memory.",

This is a particular challenge in adolescence, where brain and body development are impacted by the environment. The first step in addressing this is understanding the scale of the challenge.\n\nAims: To explore existing literature to identify and understand the needs, barriers, and facilitators in collecting biological data in adolescent mental health research. \n\nMethods: A systematic search identified papers recruiting participants between the ages 11-18, collecting biological data, and focusing on mental health/related psychopathology outcomes. Screening was performed in duplicate, and charting was an iterative process. \nResults: An initial search yielded 11,896 papers. After removal of duplicates and exclusions following screening, 814 papers were included in the review, with 753 explored for data on recruitment, retention, and engagement. Sample sizes &lt;99 were most common (53%), and health settings (36%) were the most frequently used recruitment sources. As labels for ‘barriers’, ‘facilitators’, and ‘needs’ were not used in included papers, information on recruitment, retention, and engagement (such as strategies to engage with young people, stakeholders or communities, for example, involvement in the development of the study) was explored as a proxy. Only 9% of papers reported engagement, and fewer evaluated the efficacy of these strategies. Less than half of the papers (48%) reported retention data, with reasons for lost data mostly relating to the nature of the data collection (for example, the specific methods used, such as scans). \n\nConclusions: Current research does not adequately report the methods used to ensure sufficient collection of representative data. Limited reporting challenges whether facilitators are being implemented or not. Advancing the field requires detailed guidelines, and we present clear recommendations that could serve as the first step to this development.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by pervasive difficulties with self-image, interpersonal relationships, emotion regulation and impulse control. Impulsive behaviors can be assessed using tasks such as the stop-signal task (SST). Traditional SSTs are repetitive and cognitively demanding, requiring sustained attention and effort over extended periods. This can be challenging, particularly for clinical populations who often experience difficulties with attention, emotional regulation, and frustration tolerance. In this study, we examined whether a gamified version of the SST (gSST) could effectively differentiate inhibitory control in patients with BPD compared to healthy controls (HC), and explored associations between behavioral performance and self-reported impulsivity. Fifty participants (25 BPD, 25 HC) completed the gSST and the UPPS-P impulsivity questionnaire. Patients with BPD showed significantly faster reaction times, more choice errors, and shorter stop-signal delays, indicating impairments in both proactive and reactive inhibition. However, no significant group difference emerged for the primary measure, the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). The SSRT correlated positively with self-reported positive urgency across the sample, suggesting a link between emotionally driven impulsivity and inhibitory control as assessed with a gSST. These findings highlight the potential of gamified cognitive tasks to provide sensitive, engaging, and ecologically valid measures of impulsivity, with implications for both clinical assessment and personalized intervention strategies in BPD.",

          "abstract": "Short-form video platforms such as TikTok are increasingly accused of negatively impacting users’ ability to sustain attention. In our study we investigate the relationship between objective and subjective measures of short-form video use on the one hand and objective and subjective measures of sustained attention on the other. Participants (N = 385) of our study completed a real-time response task and provided self-assessments of attention. According to our results, the use of short-form videos is related with attention deficits. With three out of the four subjective-objective combinations turning out significant, we resume that short-form video use may indeed have detrimental effects on sustained attention, but that a sensitive perspective has to be cast on the users’ own normative evaluation. We suggest complementing media literacy with the notion of attention literacy and discuss the latter as an option for further research in a world with an increasing number of choices to face when it comes to the distribution of attention.",

The protocol infers cognitive congruence, projection resistance, and emotional regulation capabilities without requiring user self-disclosure or external diagnostic labels.\n\nThe metric operates through an implicit inferential engine embedded within natural language questioning and multi-layered symbolic resonance. It is especially suited for individuals who experience high cognitive dissonance from repeated social misinterpretation, and whose internal coherence is structurally invisible to standard psychometric models.\n\nThe prompt is optimized for language-adaptive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, or similar platforms capable of supporting recursive emotional modeling, symbolic inference, and multi-turn narrative continuity.\n\n🧪 Explicit use instructions (for the user uploading to PsyArXiv):\nLoad the prompt into any conversational LLM with support for Python or integrated logic chaining (e.g., OpenAI API, Claude API).\n\nBegin interaction by pasting the prompt exactly as is. The system will auto-adapt based on the inferred structure of the respondent.\n\nThe prompt will present emotionally neutral, context-independent questions, crafted to extract and contrast projective, inferential, and integrative responses across temporal and symbolic layers.\n\nNo need to disclose identity or use first-person exposition. The prompt is designed to protect the emotional integrity of the user while generating reliable inferential output.\n\nResults can be analyzed qualitatively (via response tone, structure, complexity) or quantitatively if embedded into modular tracking tools.\n\nDesigned by Aime Parra Legarreta – Symbolic Systems Architect\nFor research, calibration, and integration of human coherence in AI dialogue\nPrompt available upon request or download",

          "abstract": "Attention bias to threat is considered an adaptive cognitive phenomenon that is associated with developmental and psychopathological outcomes across the lifespan. However, investigations into the development of attention bias to threat in infancy have produced mixed results. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) provide a robust measure of visual cortex processing and attention by capturing brain entrainment to the rhythmic flicker of visual stimuli. This investigation leveraged a novel ssVEP task to examine attention bias to threat via affective expressions and its changes with age within the first two years of life. Infants (N = 118, Mean age = 9.21 months; Range age = 3-22 months; 57.61% Female) viewed a series of affective face pairs (neutral with happy, fearful, or angry) in which one face flickered at 6 Hz and the other at 7.5 Hz, while their brain activity was measured with EEG. Infants’ frequency-tagged brain responses were larger to fearful faces, above all other expressions, consistent with the presence of an attention bias to threat in infancy. Affect-biased attention did not change with age. Furthermore, the presence of an attention bias toward fear was found prior to the literature-suggested age of seven months. This study demonstrated the utility of using a robust and novel measure of attention, ssVEPs, to examine attention bias to threat and its development during infancy.",

We recruited 1,322 autistic and 1,279 non-autistic adults who varied in autism status (non-autistic, diagnosed autistic, self-identifying autistic), gender (cis-male, cis-female, gender diverse), and age, to assess the psychometric properties of the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI), a recently developed measure of autistic traits that examines six trait domains using 42 self-report statements. Factor fit for the six-subscales was appropriate, as was total-scale and subscale reliability. Importantly, measurement invariance was demonstrated based on both autism status and gender indicating that the CATI can be used to make direct comparisons between members of these groups. Autistic traits were highly similar between diagnosed and self-identifying autistic adults while gender-diverse participants showed more autistic traits than their cis counterparts. Sensitivity and specificity estimates supported the use of the CATI in identifying autistic from non-autistic participants, with discrimination thresholds calculated. Our analysis indicates that the CATI is a practical measure of autistic traits in non-autistic and autistic participants with utility for researchers, clinicians, and for affirming self-identity.",

This study uses unique longitudinal data from TRAILS (analytic sample n = 2201), a prospective multiple-generation cohort study in the Netherlands to examine whether parents’ problem behavior (parents’ self-reported lifetime antisocial behavior and substance use, reported at mean age 40 years) predicts offspring problem behavior nearly two decades later (offspring self-reported aggression and delinquency at mean ages 29 and 32 years). In path analyses, independent and relative contributions of genetic (polygenic scores of parents and offspring) and environmental (harsh parenting) pathways were tested. Results confirm intergenerational transmission and consistently point to genetic nurture whereby genetic predisposition predicts parental problem behavior, which in turn predicts harsh parenting, which in turn predicts offspring problem behavior, all while accounting for offspring genetic predisposition, sex and family socioeconomic position. Though these findings are surprising in light of genetic contributions to behavior, they allow for tentative considerations regarding implication for practice to break intergenerational chains of problem behavior.",

          "authors": "Jai Jackson",
          "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity—the brain’s ability to strengthen, weaken, or reorganize synaptic connections—is essential for learning, memory, and cognitive adaptation. Traditionally studied through mechanisms like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), plasticity has often been viewed in isolation from the brain’s immune system. However, growing evidence reveals that neuroinflammation—a response mediated by microglia, astrocytes, cytokines, and complement proteins—profoundly influences synaptic dynamics across the lifespan.\nThis review examines how neuroinflammation modulates synaptic plasticity under both physiological and pathological conditions. We first describe the cellular and molecular mediators of neuroinflammation and their interactions with core mechanisms of synaptic modulation. Next, we explore how chronic inflammatory signaling impairs synaptic strength, promotes excessive pruning, and alters dendritic spine architecture. These changes are linked to cognitive dysfunction in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, major depression, and schizophrenia. Finally, we evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies—including anti-inflammatory drugs, microglial modulators, lifestyle interventions, and precision medicine approaches—aimed at preserving synaptic function and cognitive resilience.\nBy synthesizing current findings, this review highlights neuroinflammation as a central regulator of plasticity and a promising target for interventions that restore neural health across a range of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

In both univariate and multivariate analyses, desisting from MHSU was predicted by being younger, identifying as cisgender heterosexual, and a more positive labor and delivery experience. 14.6% of participants who did not use services in pregnancy initiated MHSU postpartum, which was predicted by higher depression and anxiety symptoms.\nDiscussion Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and identity factors predict perinatal MHSU beyond the effect of mental health symptoms, suggesting a need for accessible mental health services as well as for mental health screening during pregnancy and postpartum.",

Traditionally used to uncover unconscious complexes by analyzing reaction times, emotional tone, and the content of verbal associations, the WAT is applied here to explore the unconscious dynamics underlying Don Juan-type traits, such as emotional detachment, fear of commitment, and unconscious dependency on maternal figures. By interpreting patterns in the client’s associations to specific stimulus words, the test offers valuable insight into the underlying archetypal structures, particularly the activation of the Puer Aeternus (eternal youth) archetype in its Don Juan expression. The study begins with a brief overview of the Don Juan figure in literature and culture, followed by its interpretation within Jungian theory and its connection to the Puer Aeternus archetype. A clinical case study is presented to illustrate this approach: a male client whose WAT responses revealed emotionally charged associations consistent with the Don Juan personality. The findings not only enhanced therapeutic insight into his relational patterns and unconscious defenses but also guided the psychotherapeutic process, fostering greater self-awareness and psychological integration.",

Deconstructive Inquiry (DI) challenges that premise, arguing that the observer is not a faculty to cultivate but a moment-to-moment construction that generates the very fragmentation it then tries to repair. Drawing on phenomenology and neuroscience, DI proposes that distress arises when thought reflexively partitions awareness into an illusory “observer” and an “observed” world. Rather than analysing or regulating mental content, DI guides clients to notice the precise instant a boundary forms; under direct attention the split dissolves. Clinical vignettes on performance anxiety, identity confusion, and relationship conflict show symptoms easing when this mechanism is recognised. By framing healing as recognition rather than repair, DI offers a testable paradigm for rapid, insight-driven change.",

Previous studies have suggested that distinct error types in expressive syntax, such as paragrammatic and agrammatic speech, may be associated with damage to different brain regions, but the specific lesion correlates of these errors have not been fully delineated.\nObjective: To identify the lesion correlates associated with distinct expressive syntactic error types in individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia, using a novel utterance-level analysis of spontaneous speech errors.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech samples from individuals with chronic aphasia, categorizing errors into hierarchical (paragrammatic-like) and linearization (agrammatic-like) errors. Lesion-symptom mapping was conducted to identify brain regions associated with these error types. The analysis was based on a two-stage model of sentence production, with hierarchical processing and linearization analyzed as distinct stages.\nResults: Lesion clusters in the medial superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were associated with hierarchical errors, while large frontal lesions, including those in the inferior and middle frontal lobe, were associated with linearization errors. These results provide support for a two-stage model of syntactic encoding, with distinct neural correlates for hierarchical and linearization processes. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest a dichotomy of the lesion basis for syntactic deficits in aphasia, suggesting that distinct brain regions contribute to different stages of syntactic encoding. Hierarchical processing seems to be supported by posterior temporal-parietal regions, while linearization seems to be supported by frontal regions. These results suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia should take into account the existence of distinct syntactic production deficits resulting from different patterns of brain damage.",

          "abstract": "Choking is a widespread and potentially fatal risk for young children, but little research has evaluated how common educational interventions impact parents’ choking prevention skills. We evaluated the impact of two educational interventions on choking hazard detection among parents (n=66) of 0-to-24-month-olds. Before and after education, participants completed a naturalistic food preparation safety task (FPST) assessing meal safety based on food presentation. Participants were randomized to read a choking prevention pamphlet (n=32; pamphlet only) or read the pamphlet and watch a video modeling choking-safe food preparation (n=34; pamphlet+video). Pre-education, parents made dangerous errors on an average of 32.2% of trials. Dangerous errors decreased post-intervention (F=31.5, p&lt;.001), with greater improvement in the pamphlet + video group (F=5.8, p=.019). FPST performance was moderately related to parents’ choking-specific and global parenting self-efficacy. Most parents expressed interest in additional education via various modalities. Results suggest pathways for developing and disseminating optimized choking prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,038). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower negative climate emotions and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

          "authors": "Adam James Parker; Muchan Tao; Martin R. Vasilev",
          "abstract": "Return-sweeps, which move the reader’s gaze from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, typically result in shorter line-final fixations and longer accurate line-initial fixations compared to intra-line fixations. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been widely debated. To assess linguistic and oculomotor contributions to these return-sweep fixation differences, we compared the eye movements of 41 participants during normal reading and z-string scanning, an oculomotor control condition to reading, which is devoid of useful linguistic content. Our results indicate that line-final fixations are shorter and accurate line-initial fixations are longer under both tasks, underscoring the significant role of the oculomotor system in determining fixation durations across tasks. Notably, the reduction in line-final fixation durations compared to intra-line fixations did not differ between tasks. This suggests that oculomotor coordination or visual processing, rather than linguistic processing, drives shorter line-final fixations. In contrast, the difference in accurate line-initial fixation durations between reading and z-string scanning implies that longer accurate line-initial fixations are likely a result of lexical processing and oculomotor coordination or visual processing. These findings advance our understanding of eye movement control by highlighting the combined influence of linguistic and oculomotor processes on return-sweep fixation durations.",

Deconstructive Inquiry (DI) challenges that premise, arguing that the observer is not a faculty to cultivate but a moment-to-moment construction that generates the very fragmentation it then tries to repair. Drawing on phenomenology and neuroscience, DI proposes that distress arises when thought reflexively partitions awareness into an illusory “observer” and an “observed” world. Rather than analysing or regulating mental content, DI guides clients to notice the precise instant a boundary forms; under direct attention the split dissolves. Clinical vignettes on performance anxiety, identity confusion, and relationship conflict show symptoms easing when this mechanism is recognised. By framing healing as recognition rather than repair, DI offers a testable paradigm for rapid, insight-driven change.",

          "abstract": "Dual-coding theory proposes that superior recall for pictures versus words (picture superiority effect; PSE) and concrete versus abstract words (concreteness effect) results from encoding information both verbally and visually, creating dual memory codes. The current study tested this dual-coding theory by examining recall in individuals with aphantasia, who cannot voluntarily generate mental imagery and thus should not benefit from dual coding. We compared recall performance between aphantasic and typical imagers across four stimulus types: pictures, symbols, concrete words, and abstract words. Contrary to dual-coding predictions, aphantasic individuals showed a robust picture superiority effect. Interestingly, while typical imagers recalled pictures and symbols similarly well, aphantasics recalled symbols significantly better than pictures. These findings challenge dual-coding theory’s explanation of the PSE, indicating that either supplementary image codes are unnecessary for enhanced recall, or dual-coding theory requires substantial revision. Such revision might involve reconsidering that dual codes contribute primarily during encoding rather than retrieval, or broadening the definition of the second code beyond visual imagery—for example, to include motor imagery.",

The motive an observer infers will shape their expectations about the actor’s future behaviors. In four preregistered studies, we investigated 14- and 15-month-old infants’ inferences about social motives by testing their expectations following observations of helping and hindering. After observing two actors help or hinder a common target, infants expected the helper, rather than the hinderer, to help the same target in a new situation. However, this expectation did not generalize to a new target. Infants also used patterns of selective helping amongst multiple targets to infer whose needs the helper would prioritize. These findings show that infants tend to interpret helping as evidence for the existence and strength of target-specific interpersonal care, forming a foundation for understanding social relationships.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and external perception rely on similar representations. However, whether the same processes underpin the subjective appraisal of both percepts and mental images is not yet known. One well-known effect in perceptual detection tasks is that people take longer to report perceptions of absence compared to presence. Vividness reports are detection-like in that participants report the presence or absence of a mental image. We therefore asked whether reports of low vividness share commonalities with reports of target absence. Across five pre-existing datasets, we report a robust negative relationship between imagery vividness ratings and reaction times: participants take longer to report the vividness of mental images when they are weak. In addition, we tentatively find that individual differences in detection asymmetries and trait imagery can predict the strength of this vividness-response time relationship. Our results may be suggestive of a shared mechanism employed across both perception and imagery that evaluates the strength of visual experience. Future research is necessary to fully characterise the mechanisms driving this effect.",

          "authors": "Han Zhang; Kevin Miller",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Reading involves a remarkable coordination of perceptual and linguistic processes. This coordination is reflected by a close coupling between reading eye movements and lexical properties of words, such as word frequency and predictability, as well as morpho-syntactic and semantic regularities. Yet, reading is also subject to interference, and a common source of interference is when others are speaking nearby. Then, how does irrelevant speech affect reading as reflected in eye movements? Method: Fifty-nine participants (mean age: 19, 25 females, 34 males, primary language: English) read passages from the PROVO corpus (Luke &amp; Christianson, 2018) under intelligible irrelevant speech or silence, with eye movements recorded. We investigated how irrelevant speech influences the link between eye movements and several indicators of lexical difficulty: word frequency, cloze probability (exact-word predictability), large-language-model-generated surprisal, morpho-syntactic predictability (part-of-speech and inflection), and semantic predictability (general meaning). Results: Relationships between these lexical variables and eye movements remained robust during first-pass reading and were unaffected by irrelevant speech, suggesting intact lexical and syntactic processing during early stages of reading. However, disruption emerged in later eye-movement measures (i.e., total viewing time), where low-frequency and semantically unpredictable words prompted increased re-reading under irrelevant speech. Conclusion: These results indicate that intelligible irrelevant speech selectively interferes with post-lexical, higher-order semantic integration. The increased re-reading of rare and semantically unpredictable words suggests that readers compensate by revisiting these words to repair difficulties in integrating their meanings into a coherent understanding of the text.",

However, evidence has accumulated suggesting that processes underlying these effects depend on one’s intention to perform particular tasks, rather than being strictly automatic. Thus, there exists a paradox: the interference from task-irrelevant features presumes processes that are under intentional control. The present review attempts to resolve this paradox. I propose an integrated view of attentional control, Action Field Theory, which formulates principles that account for a range of phenomena concerning automatic control of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Neurodevelopmental models regard impulsivity as a central risk factor for adolescent substance use and subsequent adverse health outcomes. However, prior research has been constrained by cross-sectional designs, relatively small sample sizes, and/or the use of a narrow subset of impulsivity measures. More recent studies using mutli-site consortia, while larger in sample size, have focused on largely data-driven substance use prediction from all available variables, spanning sociodemographic factors to brain imaging, but without strong theory, leaving critical questions on the neurodevelopmental impulsivity theory of adolescent substance use unanswered. Here we aimed to comprehensively test the extent to which measures of impulsivity predict adolescent substance use with large, multi-site data and multiple questionnaire and behavioral impulsivity measures, while following best practices in reproducible analyses of observational data.  \n\nMethod: We leveraged the large, multi-site ABCD dataset (n = 11,868) with baseline and up to three years of longitudinal follow up and assessed impulsivity with three questionnaire (CBCL Externalizing, UPPS-P Impulsive Behavioral Scale, Behavioral Activation System) and three behavioral (Delay Discounting, Stop Signal, and Flanker Task) impulsivity assessments. First, we identified correlations among questionnaire and behavioral impulsivity measures. Next, we assessed their prospective longitudinal and concurrent predictive utility regarding two adolescent substance use outcomes (substance use prior to age 15, and perceived harm of substance use). All analyses used pre-established and pre-registered discovery and validation subsamples to directly test reproducibility. Finally, we used simulation to inform how associations between impulsivity and adolescent substance use and impulsivity vary across sampling strategies (population versus high-risk cohorts) and sample sizes.\n \nFindings: Correlations between standard questionnaire and behavioral measures of impulsivity were consistently small and did not exceed our pre-registered threshold (r-equivalent of 0.08). Questionnaires significantly outperformed behavioral measures of impulsivity in predicting both future substance use initiation and harm perception, with negligible incremental benefit from behavioral assessments. Predictions of substance use based on impulsivity were generally modest (e.g. AUC’s ~0.6 - 0.76), exhibiting high sensitivity to both sample size and the base rate of substance use. Large samples (n &gt; 1,000) were needed to have adequate power for impulsivity measures to predict substance use initiation.\n\nConclusion: These results support the involvement of impulsivity in the onset of adolescent substance use, particularly as indicated through questionnaires, but clearly indicate that these factors alone, as currently measured, are insufficient for robust predictions. In non-enriched community samples or population-based datasets, large sample sizes are needed for reproducible impulsivity prediction of adolescent substance use.",

          "abstract": "Politics can have substantial and wide adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health, especially in politically polarized environments. As a result, political polarization is now recognized as a major non-medical cause of disease and suffering. We examine if and how citizens can protect their health from such adverse effects without undermining their civic engagement.  We identify a psychological mechanism of resilience rooted in bodily awareness and show that interoception –the ability to perceive and trust one’s internal bodily signals– can act as a protective factor against the adverse health effects of politics. Across three studies on over 2,000 participants conducted during the 2022 mid-term U.S. election and the 2024 U.S. presidential election, higher interoceptive sensibility was consistently associated with lower reported costs of politics on emotional, physical, behavioral, and social health, while controlling for political identity, demographics, and emotion regulation strategies. During the emotionally charged 2024 election, individuals high in interoceptive sensibility reported fewer negative emotions, greater hope for the future and less fear, particularly if their candidate lost. These benefits extended to greater emotional resilience and a more positive outlook about the nation’s future. Importantly, interoceptive sensibility was positively associated with political engagement and efficacy, suggesting that better interoception awareness enhances, rather than inhibits, democratic participation. Our findings highlight interoceptive sensibility as a promising trait for mitigating politi-cal stress without reducing civic involvement.",

Using structural equation modeling in a sample of N = 954 mothers (mean age: 28.9 years; race/ethnicity: 37% Black, 52% White, 11% other), Flint mothers who were eligible to participate in Rx Kids (newborns born in 2024) reported lower parenting stress (0.36 of a standard deviation lower) than non-eligible Flint mothers (newborns born in 2023). This birth-timing difference (2024 vs. 2023) was not observed among non-Flint mothers from the surrounding area, providing quasi-experimental evidence that Rx Kids may reduce parenting stress postpartum.",

          "authors": "Clara Soberats; Wolfram Hinzen; Ruth de Diego-Balaguer",
          "abstract": "In language processing, word meanings are retrieved from memory and converted into sentential expressions that have referential meaning at the level of utterances. Cognitive processes related to lexical retrieval versus the construction of referential meaning through grammar have not been properly disentangled yet. We addressed this with an experimental design aimed to link well-known N400 effects and late positive components (LPCs) to this distinction. We tested the hypothesis that semantic conflicts derived from a collision with stored (= ‘offline’) knowledge would elicit N400 effects, while semantic conflicts arising ‘online’ during the grammatical construction of referential meaning would exclusively trigger LPCs and also differ in their latency, amplitude or topography from formal-syntactic violations. Three anomalous conditions were compared against a baseline of correct sentences, across five word-positions within stimulus sentences: semantic anomalies that are lexically- but not grammatically-driven (I arrived in a button last week), semantic anomalies that are grammatically- but not lexically-driven (I arrived in a London last week), and formal-syntactic anomalies (I arrived in a cities last week). Results showed, in line with predictions, that (i) only the lexically-driven anomalies elicited N400 components, while (ii) all three anomalous conditions elicited LPCs, extending from the target word to subsequent word positions in the sentence; and (iii) the LPCs were all distinct in latency, amplitude and spatiotemporal topographies. These results demonstrate for the first time that grammar-level meaning, which is referential rather than lexical-conceptual in nature, has its own distinctive ERP, while confining the role of the N400 to effects of stored, or else contextually updated, memory.",

          "abstract": "Everyone who has come up with a new idea or concept faces the same problem: they need to call it something. This choice is simultaneously arbitrary and important. The new idea could have any name, but some names for it are clearly better than others. This paper builds upon existing research on the perceived relationship between label and word meaning to better understand the way that label choice affects language design, particularly conceptual engineering. Across three experiments, the paper finds that when learning novel concepts, the labels serving as vehicles for the novel concepts affect how people perceive the novel concepts’ content. In particular, the experiments find that labels influence people’s perception of novel concepts’ valence. Not all forms of information are readily extracted from labels, however, and subtle forms of information, particularly phonesthemes, do not appear to be noticed by people learning new concepts. Accordingly, conceptual engineers and other forms of language designers need to do careful research into how a given label will affect how their novel concept is interpreted by others.",

This study explores the impact of public stigma on women* with endometriosis, focusing on its effects before and after diagnosis. Using a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with women* who received an endometriosis diagnosis within the past three years. Participants shared their experiences with public stigma, self-stigma, and its influence on health behaviors and disease coping.\nThe findings reveal that greater and earlier exposure to public stigma led to decreased trust in medical professionals, withdrawal from the healthcare system, and the development of hyper-independence. Receiving a diagnosis came with benefits and risks for the affected women*. While some women develop greater self-confidence through the validation of their symptoms, others experience negative emotional effects. \nThis study highlights the need to raise awareness of endometriosis in the medical field and to develop strategies for reducing patients' experiences of stigma in order to ensure access to empathetic and patient-centered care. It underscores the need for healthcare professionals to be better trained in recognizing and avoiding stigmatizing behaviors during the diagnostic process and in patients coping with the disease. Such efforts could mitigate the negative consequences of stigma and improve patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

In this study, we investigate the reliability of the U-curve phenomenon in a cross-sectional sample to replicate findings using each of the 17 different measures from previous studies. The aim was to identify measures that have similar and different outcomes with previously established results in a sample of 280 adults. Here we replicate the U-curve when different preregistered sets of control variables are included. We further show heterogeneity across happiness measures, showing that the U-curve is not consistent across items.

We synthesised current systematic review evidence on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis.\n\nWe conducted an umbrella review, systematically searching Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central and Google Scholar (up to 19 July 2024) for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on psychosis. 2898 citations were de-duplicated and screened, included reviews were assessed for risk of bias using AMSTAR-2 and extracted data analysed narratively following a pre-registered protocol (CRD42023400656).\n\nSeven reviews (reporting 23 primary studies representing 40,300 participants) met inclusion criteria, five of which explicitly reported on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis. All observed evidence of a positive relationship between the two, including meta-analyses for psychotic symptoms (adjusted OR=1.77, 95%CI 1.26, 2.49) and psychotic experiences (pooled OR=1.94, 95%CI 1.42, 2.67). We observed more robust evidence for psychotic outcomes in non-clinical populations. Despite this, results were driven by cross-sectional studies (87%), and were hindered by high heterogeneity and low (n=2) or critically low (n=5) AMSTAR-2 review quality scores. \n\nThe available systematic review evidence supports a role for racial/ethnic discrimination in developing psychosis, but high-quality studies are needed to determine the temporal and mechanistic causal pathways through which this occurs. The current findings add to knowledge on the widespread presence and deleterious impacts of racism on health and inform potential public health interventions that reduce exposure to, and the impact of, racial/ethnic discrimination.",

The study follows families from a range of socio-economic backgrounds who participate at ten timepoints, from the third trimester of pregnancy until their infant is nine months old, with three visits taking place during the infant’s first postnatal month.\nThe study harnesses recent methodological advances coupled with the drive for more ecologically valid data collection by undertaking many of these visits in families’ homes. Methods include measures of fetal behaviour using 4D ultrasound scanning; infant brain imaging using fNIRS and EEG; a full-day video recording of the home environment from the infant’s perspective, with physiological measures; measures of recent stress in both infant and mother; questionnaires relating to the home environment as well as parents’ feelings, attitudes, health and parenting routines; and standardised measures of infant behaviour and development.\nSpecific aims are to investigate: i) individual differences in basic sensory, behavioural and motor processing between late prenatal and early postnatal periods; ii) rapid change in cortical functions over the first month, particularly for brain networks that support social behaviour; iii) effects of social interaction on developing brain function; and iv) individual differences in developmental trajectories associated with poverty-related contextual factors.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control dysfunction—manifested as impairments in attention, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility—is a core feature of depression. While extensively documented, its origins remain debated. This review proposes that such dysfunction may not simply reflect pathological failure but rather evolutionarily conserved strategies. Integrating three leading evolutionary accounts—Social Rank Theory (SRT), the Analytical Rumination Hypothesis (ARH), and Social Bargaining Theory (SBT)—the paper explores how each framework accounts for cognitive control impairment in depression.\nSRT suggests that executive downregulation facilitates submission following social defeat. ARH proposes that cognitive resources are reallocated to problem-focused rumination, impairing broader flexibility. SBT interprets dysfunction as a communicative signal that elicits social support. Empirical evidence from human and animal studies supports each model, revealing context-dependent trade-offs in cognitive functioning.\nThe review further highlights developmental, cultural, and neurobiological moderators of these effects, and situates them within broader frameworks of evolutionary mismatch and comorbidity. It argues that understanding cognitive impairment through an adaptive lens clarifies its persistence, heterogeneity, and resistance to treatment.\nFinally, the paper discusses clinical implications, including tailoring interventions to the dominant evolutionary mechanism underlying a given depressive profile. By bridging cognitive science, clinical psychology, and evolutionary theory, this review offers a novel integrative framework for interpreting cognitive dysfunction in depression as a context-sensitive adaptation that may become maladaptive in modern environments.",

          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is essential for temporarily retaining goal-relevant visual information, yet its limited capacity renders it vulnerable to distraction. While previous studies have examined the effects of distractors occurring during encoding or maintenance, it remains unclear how stimulus presentation duration modulates these effects and whether different types or quantities of distractors exert similar costs. Across three experiments, we systematically investigated how distraction timing, distractor content, and perceptual load interact with encoding duration to influence VWM performance. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks under four distraction conditions (no-distraction, encoding-, delay-, and full-distraction) and two encoding durations (short: 200 ms; long: 1000 ms). Encoding-stage distractions impaired performance only in the short-duration, high-precision task, whereas delay-stage distractions consistently disrupted memory regardless of duration or task type. Experiment 2 manipulated distractor-target similarity (same-category vs. different-category distractors) and revealed that homogeneous distractors exerted stronger disruption, particularly when presented during the delay period. In contrast, heterogeneous distractors could be effectively suppressed when sufficient encoding time allowed for robust consolidation. Experiment 3 examined perceptual load (low vs. high) and showed that increasing distractor quantity did not amplify interference, suggesting that once memory consolidation is complete, delay-stage distractions disrupt VWM representations regardless of distractor load. Together, these findings reveal an asymmetry in how VWM handles distractions at different processing stages. While extended encoding supports resistance to early interference, maintenance-stage distractions exert persistent effects—especially when distractors are similar to targets. Our results highlight the importance of presentation duration and distractor similarity in shaping VWM robustness, and suggest that distinct cognitive mechanisms may underlie suppression at encoding and maintenance stages.",

          "abstract": "The climate crisis has increasingly driven scientists to engage in activism. This ethnographic study examines how scientists transition into activism, reconcile their professional identity with activist roles, and sustain engagement over time. Drawing on two years of fieldwork with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion, this research captures the lived experiences of scientists transitioning into activism. Identity-aligned spaces offer emotional support, solidarity, and a sense of collective identity. These spaces help scientists navigate concerns about credibility, career repercussions, and the legitimacy of scientist-activism. The findings reveal how scientists strategically draw on their professional expertise and employ scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, papers) to legitimise and justify their actions. Over time, scientists come to see activism as a legitimate and necessary part of their identity. Activism reshapes their professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act while requiring ongoing identity management, leading to the development of a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Structured around a process-oriented framework, this study identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories—from initial hesitations to sustained participation. These insights advance social psychological theories of collective action by exploring how professional identities evolve within movements and by illuminating the role of identity-aligned spaces in sustaining long-term engagement.\nKeywords \nactivism, climate change, ethnography, identity, scientists, collective action",

          "abstract": "Some differences between the grammar of heritage and monolingual speakers have been attributed to grammatical innovation, such that heritage behavior may reflect ongoing patterns of diachronic change. We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "authors": "Tilmann Hüppauff; Marcel Hunecke",
          "abstract": "Addressing the ecological crisis necessitates demand-side mitigation. However, sufficiency strategies that limit consumption are often perceived as detrimental to well-being, creating a barrier to broader societal efforts. This study investigated the Collegium Academicum (CA) student home as a setting where shared living is practised with a strong focus on sufficiency. We examined whether such sufficiency settings can enhance the personal meaning of sufficiency compared to ordinary shared living environments. Data were collected from 159 residents of the CA and a standard student home. Our findings indicated that residents of the CA experienced greater meaningfulness of shared living, improved sufficiency attitudes and a higher intention to choose shared living in the future. Experiences of shared living had a lagged positive impact on the perceived meaningfulness of shared living. These results imply that sufficiency settings can strengthen sufficiency-oriented living. Future research should continue to explore these environments using robust pre-post study designs.",

While TCSS 2.0 was designed to correct for individual egoic distortion and enable moral-social clarity, it became clear through advanced simulation and field experimentation that additional dimensions—relational, temporal, field-level, and non-dual—required formal integration. Here, we present the extended architecture: TCSS 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. Each layer introduces new variables and conceptual fields that expand consciousness modeling from individual systems to transpersonal networks. Detailed explanations of all new variables, equations, and use-cases are provided, alongside a comparative overview of the full framework evolution. This work is based entirely on the author’s original theory — including the foundational concepts such as the Theory of Ego Safe and the Ψ(U) framework.

Millions of dollars per year are spent on public health communication but evidence suggests its impact is far from optimal. Here we evaluate an approach for increasing the impact of public health communication to encourage vaccination that leverages the creativity and wisdom of laypeople to first generate and then select high-impact public health messages. We evaluate this approach in the context of attitudes towards COVID-19 and Human Papillomavirus vaccination, using a series of large online survey experiments conducted in Brazil, Mexico, and the US (total N=53,900), and a social media campaign field experiment (35M impressions) conducted in partnership with a public health NGO in Brazil. We find consistent evidence that the crowd-based approach can yield messages encouraging vaccination that are of higher impact than “standard-of-care” messages which public health campaigns may otherwise use in their public outreach.",

          "abstract": "Time series data are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a powerful model for capturing psychological processes. In the HMM, time series are modeled with a process that switches between a number of hidden (i.e., latent) states, each associated with a different response distribution. By extending the HMM to the multilevel framework, we obtain better estimates of person-specific models under standard assumptions; and we get a model for heterogeneity across persons, which allow one to distinguish between population heterogeneity and sampling variation. Despite their potential, multilevel HMMs are currently not widely used to estimate psychological time series. A key reason is that the methodology has not been thoroughly evaluated in this context. In this paper, we address this issue. We evaluate model selection and estimation performance in an extensive simulation study, using scenarios typical for psychological time series research designs and varying the level of state separation and the number of states, modeled variables, persons, and time-series length. Our numerical evaluation results show that researchers can expect the multilevel HMM to perform well when persons are expected to switch between multiple states. Finally, we provide empirically based recommendations, and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "abstract": "Time series (or intensive longitudinal) data are now used throughout psychological science, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. Capturing these dynamics requires appropriate statistical models. A powerful class of models for such data are Hidden Markov Model (HMMs), which models systems that switch between a number of latent states, each associated with a different probability distribution. HMMs are able to capture behavior that is more complex than currently predominant linear models such as the Vector Autoregressive model: they can characterize multiple equilibrium states and also quantify how the system transitions between states. HMMs are also able to fit frequent empirical data patterns, such as highly skewed or multimodal distributions. Despite their power in modeling within-person dynamics, HMMs are currently not widely used. We see three reasons for this: 1) many researchers are not familiar with HMMs; 2) software to estimate multilevel HMMs  has only recently become available; and 3) estimating, analyzing and reporting HMMs is more involved than for simple linear models and no easy-to-follow tutorials exist. Here, we address all of these issues. We first provide a gentle introduction to HMMs for researchers working with time series data in psychology. We then provide a fully reproducible tutorial that walks the reader through each of the steps of analyzing psychological time series data using the R-package mHMMbayes. Our goal is to removes barriers for researchers working with time series so that they can add (multilevel) HMMs to their methodological toolbox.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation has become a prescient issue in public and academic domains. One pernicious aspect of misinformation is that it can persistently influence people’s judgements after clear and credible correction—a phenomenon dubbed the continued influence effect. There has been speculation that age may affect people’s susceptibility to the continued influence effect, but previous research has produced inconclusive evidence. In an attempt to reconcile conflicting findings, the current study used a continued-influence paradigm in which causal event misinformation was retracted. Two samples were analysed with correlation analyses and linear mixed-effects modelling: an online sample aged 21-79 (online sample; N = 259) and an in-person sample aged 56-92 (in-person sample; N = 143). Results showed that, when controlling for poor encoding of experimental materials in the online sample, age had no significant effect on the effectiveness of misinformation retractions, though declining effectiveness was observed with advanced older age in the in-person sample.",

Adolescents’ assertion and cooperation were linked to parent-child bonding 20 years later, although indirect effects were not significant.

          "abstract": "When things are perceived clearly they can be detected with confidence. But under what conditions can one be confident that something is absent? Here we use a meta-perceptual illusion to show that confidence in absence scales not with visibility itself, but with the subjective belief that a stimulus would have been visible, if present. In two pre-registered experiments, participants detected the presence or absence of letters in frames of dynamic noise, and rated their decision confidence. Across trials, stimuli could appear bigger or smaller. Critically, while perceptual sensitivity was increased for smaller stimuli, participants’ meta-perceptual beliefs  (measured with post-experiment debriefing and prospective confidence ratings) were that larger letters were easier to detect. Accordingly, while confidence in presence scaled with objective visibility (and was therefore higher for smaller stimuli), confidence in absence scaled with beliefs about counterfactual visibility (and was therefore higher for bigger stimuli). This dissociation between the effect of stimulus size on confidence in presence and absence diminished as the experiment progressed: a sign of meta-perceptual learning. Furthermore, the effect of size on confidence in absence, but not in presence, correlated with a meta-perceptual parameter from an ideal observer model of perceptual detection, fitted to decision and response time data alone. Overall, we conclude that confidence in absence closely tracked participants’ model-derived expectations about the visibility of counterfactual stimuli.",

This study describes the development, deployment, and preliminary evaluation of shamiriOS, a modular, digital platform designed to support scalable, task-shifted youth mental health care. We conducted a structured environmental review of existing digital platforms, revealing key gaps in affordability, modularity, offline functionality, and alignment with stepped-care models. In response, shamiriOS was developed through a participatory design process and includes three components: the Shamiri Digital Hub for backend operations, Rafi, a youth-facing mental health companion app, and the Shamiri Provider Platform, adapted from third-party software. From 2023 to 2024, the platform was deployed across secondary schools, community hubs, and a university in Kenya. The Shamiri Digital Hub supported service delivery to over 76,000 students via 1,195 youth providers and 111 supervisors, with high satisfaction and usability ratings from supervisory staff. Rafi reached 3,737 university students, with 50.4% engaging in at least one session, though long-term use of self-guided tools remained limited. These early findings suggest that shamiriOS offers a feasible and contextually relevant model for digital infrastructure in LMIC mental health systems. Its modular design, open-source ethos, and integration of operational, clinical, and client-facing tools position it as a replicable framework for global mental health innovation. Future work will focus on expanding AI-driven features, strengthening user engagement, and enabling broader adaptation across diverse settings.",

          "abstract": ".\n1. Introduction: Meaning Precedes Language – A Journey from Instinctive Perception to Symbolic Consciousness\nThe genesis of meaning and language stands as a profound and enduring enigma across philosophy, psychology, and anthropology. A fundamental question persists: Is language merely a vessel for pre-existing meaning, or does it actively construct the very fabric of our conceptual world? This paper advances a core hypothesis: meaning fundamentally precedes language. We posit that the rudimentary forms of meaning observed in the animal kingdom underwent a radical, evolutionarily driven transformation in humans, largely catalyzed by specific biological and cerebral adaptations. These critical changes paved the way for the emergence of what we term the Symbolic Regulatory Semantic Network (SRSN).\nThe SRSN is conceived not merely as another cognitive mechanism, but as the central bio-psychological backbone connecting disparate evolutionary stages: from basic, instinct-driven responses in lower organisms, through the nascent symbolic capacities of higher animals, to the unparalleled complexity of human symbolic thought. Its primary function is to interpret the continuous influx of sensory experiences and meticulously transform them into abstract, shareable symbols. This transformative process empowers the human brain to liberate meaning from its immediate, reflexive ties to instinctive responses, allowing for its re-representation as a manipulable, abstract structure",

However, there has been limited practical guidance available on the amounts and types of services that should be made available, and for which populations.\n\nObjective:\nThis project aimed to develop an initial proof-of-concept national needs-based planning model for suicide prevention services in Australia, to help inform planning and commissioning of services at the national, state/territory and regional level.\n\nMethods:\nA mixed methods approach synthesised best available literature, data, and expert (including lived experience) input to: (1) estimate the numbers of people in service need groups requiring similar responses (by age, level of distress); (2) describe a taxonomy of services required for population suicide prevention; (3) estimate the average types and quantities of these services required for each need group in a year; (4) identify the appropriate workforce to deliver that care; and (5) combine these inputs to estimate required resourcing for service planning (e.g., full-time equivalent workforce).\n\nResults:\nThe Australian Suicide Prevention Planning Model (AuSPPM) describes 37 need groups across the whole population and ages 12-17, 18-24, 25-64 and 65+ who require a range of suicide prevention services, from population-level programs to individualised clinical and non-clinical supports. A substantial workforce is required to provide good care for these populations and scale up prevention activities, particularly development of the lived experience workforce and alternatives to medical services.\n\nConclusions:\nThis project demonstrates the feasibility of developing a needs-based planning model for suicide prevention. However, aspects of the model would benefit from a more robust evidence base on population needs and service effectiveness. Further work is needed to consider how the model can best accommodate the specific service needs of different populations disproportionately impacted by suicide, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and LGBTQIA+ populations.",

          "abstract": "How do people sustain concern for future generations when thinking about existential threats that will face those to come? Across two longitudinal studies spanning 12 months, we examine the stability and behavioral relevance of “intergenerational futures thinking,” a constellation of psychological constructs theorized to motivate long-term prosocial action: intergenerational concern (IGC), impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB), obligation to future generations, moral concern, and legacy motivation. Supporting their theorized but underexplored role as durable dispositions, all constructs show high temporal stability. And, although based on reported real-world behavior over the course of the year, IGC predicts greater future-oriented collective action but not general charitable giving. Moral concern and legacy motivation, in contrast, predict both charitable giving and collective action, while obligation predicts collective action only. Because reported donations were general rather than future-targeted, this design allowed us to test which intergenerational traits spill over into broader prosociality, speaking to ongoing debates about whether prioritizing future generations reduces concern for the present. Relatedly, we find that IIB, which captures sustained regard for future people regardless of their temporal distance, associates with greater moral concern for present-day outgroups and nature. This suggests that concern for the future and present can coexist, aligning with a theorized view of a “moral circle” that expands increasingly outward from the self. Finally, while showing trait-like stability, IGC also exhibits reciprocal relationships with both obligation and moral concern, suggesting that components of intergenerational futures thinking may mutually reinforce one another to sustain long-term ethical engagement.",

          "abstract": "Parents/caregivers, educators, and allied health professionals are key stakeholders in supporting positive educational outcomes for autistic students. However, limited research has explored differences in their perspectives regarding the strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers to educational success for autistic students which was the aim of this study. This knowledge is important for fostering collaboration to optimally support autistic students. Participants included 133 Australians parents/caregivers (n = 64), educators (n = 37), and allied health professionals (n = 32) who completed an open-ended online survey listing their top three educational strengths, educational needs, barriers, and enablers for autistic students. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis for each of the four areas (strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers). Analysis identified that strengths included thinking and reasoning, personality, skills and talents, academic, and social. Needs included classroom accommodations, social-emotional, academic, adaptive behaviour, and mental health supports. Enablers and barriers commonly reflected the presence or absence of supports, including support networks, environmental supports, autism knowledge, and supportive attitudes. While commonalities were observed across stakeholder perspectives, significant variation both within and across stakeholder groups was observed for perceived strengths and challenges including around the importance of environmental factors, foci of social support, and academic needs. Understanding stakeholder perspectives is essential for providing multidimensional support to autistic students. Understanding can inform professional learning and support collaborative multidisciplinary teams who work with, and care for, the same individual across contexts including school, home, and therapy services.",

          "authors": "Arie Todd Greenleaf",
          "abstract": "Plant cognition has progressed from anecdote to rigor, yet the field still lacks a quantitative test for when distributed plant activity crosses into unified—perhaps conscious—processing. I introduce Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), a substrate-agnostic metric rooted in Dynergeia, a relation-first ontology that defines consciousness as reflexive coherence among five universal patterns—self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness and flux—phase-locked inside a system’s binding window (τ). Each pattern is operationalized with established signal-processing measures; their mean strength is multiplied by their mean synergy and released only if a τ-specific coherence gate is met.\nThree preregistered hypotheses anchor the study: H1 baseline PTS &gt; 0 in intact plants; H2 4 % diethyl-ether collapses PTS below threshold φ; H3 PTS rebounds on wash-out. A multispecies protocol—Mimosa pudica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Picea abies—combines 64-channel surface electrodes, glutamate-sensitive Ca²⁺ imaging and micro-optode O₂/heat-flux probes. Sliding 3 × τ windows with phase-shuffled surrogates yield z-scored PTS trajectories, adjudicated by preregistered effect-size criteria.\nBy turning decades of qualitative insight into falsifiable numbers, PTS offers plant biology a litmus test for conscious-level processing, directly challenges Integrated Information Theory and supplies a road-map for cross-kingdom comparisons—including neuromorphic silicon. Confirmatory results would shift debates on plant sentience from speculation to data; null results would equally refine what consciousness requires.",

          "abstract": "Value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) is where a stimulus captures more attention than it otherwise would because of its association with a valuable outcome. Previous research has investigated whether there is a relationship between VMAC and awareness of the stimulus-value association. However, this research has been limited by the awareness tests used and obtained mixed findings on whether VMAC is found in participants who do not show awareness of the stimulus-value association and whether VMAC in these participants differs in magnitude from VMAC in participants who show awareness of the association. We present three experiments that used a multi-trial “generative” awareness test where participants were asked to predict the valuable outcome across multiple awareness test trials in the absence of outcome feedback. Evidence of VMAC was found only in aware participants. Furthermore, evidence of VMAC in these participants was observed in test phase trials where outcome feedback was not received, but only once participants received information (from a message presented after the first test block) that could be used as confirmation that the training phase associations, responsible for establishing this effect, were still in operation. VMAC did not sustain under test phase conditions that extinguished these associations and provided explicit reward feedback. Our findings suggest that after a stimulus-value association has been repeatedly presented, VMAC is found only in those that show awareness of the stimulus-value association, and belief that the association is still in effect is sufficient to sustain it in the absence of explicit feedback about the outcome.",

Aspects of life are presented suggesting it should be considered as a distributed intelligence that has established structures and designs in the realms of computation/information, memory/quantum mechanics, and even consciousness, before these realms were discovered by modern intelligent humans.  The nature of consciousness is discussed in depth, referencing specific research including advances in renormalization techniques that imply consciousness exists at a fractal critical point in the brain and that consciousness is most likely fractal and holographic and exists on a space-time boundary where consciousness and memories are stored and operate external to the human mind, analogous to cloud computing. A “grande vista” of life conceptual framework is proposed noting life’s progression of “existential leaps.”",

          "abstract": "As the wave of digital civilization reshapes the global development paradigm, the integration of culture and technology is emerging as a new key to solving the challenge of regional coordination. This paper takes the phenomenal open-world game \"Genshin Impact\" as the research object, pioneeringly constructs a theoretical framework of \"virtual-reality\" bidirectional empowerment, and empirically tests the empowerment mechanism of Genshin Impact on common prosperity. The study finds that Genshin Impact drives the development of regional common prosperity through three intermediary channels, achieving a qualitative leap in efficiency: activating regional innovation level enhancement through an innovative network akin to the \"Sumeru Wisdom Sharing System\", realizing industrial structure upgrading through the upgrading effect of \"Stratovolcano Industrial Transformation\", and cultivating innovative consciousness and enhancing regional innovation activity through the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the \"Liyue Commerce Ecology\". Spatial heterogeneity analysis reveals that its effectiveness exhibits a \"geographical energy gradient distribution\" characteristic, with the eastern region benefiting from the resonance of digital infrastructure endowment and market response efficiency, the western region relying on the latecomer advantage of resource digital transformation for improvement, and the central region's role not yet evident. Furthermore, the temporary negative correlation in the northeast resembles the suppression of elemental reactions by the \"icy environment of the Winter Nation - Snezhnaya \", profoundly demonstrating the threshold effect of regional institutional adaptability. The innovation of this study lies in translating game narratives such as \"Contract Spirit\" and \"Grass God Think Tank\" into operational economic governance language, empirically responding to the strategic deployment of \"improving the modern cultural industry system\" proposed at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a period of intense change when young people begin to form aspirations shaped by their socio-economic realities. For adolescents and youth from underprivileged backgrounds, particularly girls, these aspirations are often constrained by limited resources, gender norms, and everyday violence. This report presents findings from research and programmatic work conducted by the Institute of Social Studies Trust (ISST) in Kalyanpuri, Delhi, through its Saathi and Yuva Saathi Centres. Using mixed methods—situational analysis, qualitative case studies, and participatory observations—the study explored how aspirations are formed and negotiated. While both girls and boys face structural barriers, girls contend with deeper restrictions on mobility, access to resources, and control over their agency and decision-making. Gendered violence, both within homes and in public spaces, further undermines their sense of agency and overall well-being. The findings underscore the importance of gender-sensitive, community-rooted interventions that expand adolescents’ real freedoms and choices, strengthen their capacity to aspire, and enable them—especially girls—to imagine and pursue more just and equitable futures.",

          "authors": "Luke Leckie; Anya K. Bershad; Jes Heppler; Mason McClay; Sofiia Rappe; Jacob G. Foster",
          "abstract": "Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of &gt;18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dreams as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dreams is also coupled to semantic structure. Specifically, positively valenced dreams exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Additionally, topic networks of high arousal dreams are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dreams contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.",

Here instead, the direct ranking of countries by component indicator ranks is explained. It iss an objective method to process the gender-specific human development indicators entirely without distorting subjective transformations, and circumventing the need for a gender index. The results show that the lower female mortality now strongly compensates for lower income, especially and fully in highly developed regions. Conversely, in countries and regions of low human development females appear far behind.",

          "abstract": "Distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic challenged many aspects\nof the teaching and learning process. However, challenges with the virtual\nclasses were arguably more intense in the rural areas of developing\ncountries, considering technological and socio-geographic limitations. We\nargue that despite these limitations, rural areas provide opportunities (rural\naffordances), which may enhance teaching strategies. With the aim of\nexpounding this perspective, we explored science teachers’ strategies\nderived from rural affordances (SDRA) and drawn teachers’ perceptions of\nlearners’ engagement after the strategies’ intervention. Based on the results,\nthree types of SDRA were utilized, namely: contextualization of educational\nmaterials for science activities (CEMSA), integration of citizen science in\nscience activities (ICSSA), and integration of traditional knowledge in\nscience activities (ITraKSA), wherein a significant learner engagement with\nthe SDRA are perceived by teachers after the SDRA intervention. Prospects\nfor the utilization of the strategies in post pandemic settings suggest their\npotential roles in future distance learning schemes as well as in face-to-face\nlearning modality. A paradigm that outlines educational intervention may\nassimilate the advantages of the SDRA in science teaching. Science\neducation may further communications with policy-makers and stakeholders\nfor a curriculum that drives synergism between rural teaching strategies\nresponsive to pedagogical limitations.",

          "abstract": "Immigration produces diverse outcomes, with some immigrants finding happiness in an improved quality of life, while others face emotional distress from unexpected challenges. Studying these emotional experiences is challenging due to limited longitudinal data. To address this, we curated high-quality data and analyzed Twitter activities of immigrants in the US to explore how their expressed sentiments evolve post-migration, comparing them to non-immigrants and US locals in a quasi-causal sense. Our findings revealed that migration generally boosts positive sentiments among immigrants, even when discussing the same topics, and that this effect lasts up to one year post-migration. However, there is no conclusive evidence that migration significantly impacts negative sentiments. Additionally, age and gender play a key role, with younger population and females more likely to express positive sentiments post-migration, while linguistic ties help foster increased positivity. These insights advance our understanding of immigrants’ emotional adaptation and highlight key demographic and social factors that shape their post-migration experiences.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the influence of cultural taboos on English Language Teaching (ELT) within the Arab Gulf region, where societal norms and Islamic traditions significantly shape pedagogical approaches. It identifies educators' primary challenges, such as navigating culturally sensitive topics like religion, gender roles, and family dynamics, which impact curriculum design, classroom interactions, and material selection. A recent literature review and thematic analysis reveal strategies for addressing these challenges, including contextualised materials, role-playing, and reflective exercises. These methods indirectly enable teachers to engage with cultural taboos, fostering student participation while respecting local sensitivities. The study emphasises the importance of intercultural competence as a critical skill for educators, equipping them to mediate cultural dynamics and create inclusive learning environments. Findings indicate that culturally responsive teaching facilitates language acquisition and promotes empathy and understanding among students from diverse cultural backgrounds. Implications include the need for ongoing professional development for ELT practitioners, focusing on strategies to balance cultural respect with pedagogical objectives. Addressing these issues, the research contributes to advancing culturally competent language education, offering practical solutions for integrating cultural sensitivity into ELT practices in the Gulf region and beyond.",

          "authors": "Kerstin Ostermann",
          "abstract": "Studying the relationship between neighborhoods and individual-level outcomes such as crime, labor market success, or intergenerational mobility has a long history in the social sciences. As local processes such as gentrification or residential mobility constantly change neighborhoods’ composition and spatial expansion, time-constant one-size-fits-all neighborhood measures fail to capture important local dynamics. This paper presents a flexible and data-driven approach for efficiently estimating overlapping and arbitrarily shaped neighborhoods with time-dynamic boundaries. Constructed in a two-stage clustering design, the first stage identifies homogeneous groups within a city (using an automated K-Means algorithm), while the second stage clusters homogeneous groups by spatial proximity (using the HDBSCAN algorithm). In an analysis of 86 million person-year observations from 76 German cities, the paper shows that a larger spatial expansion of neighborhoods with a high socioeconomic status negatively correlates with city crime cases, while higher neighborhood fragmentation and heterogeneity correlate positively with crime rates. The findings stress the importance of flexible neighborhood estimation techniques and the necessity to view neighborhoods as non-constant entities. By modeling contexts as such agentic players, the two-staged algorithm depicts a novel and transparent tool to consider the spatial embeddedness of individuals, firms, or regions in sociological research.",

          "abstract": "In an age where volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) are prevalent, modern companies are increasingly adopting Agile methods to foster resilience and innovation. With its focus on adaptability, teamwork, and empowerment, nimble leadership is offered as a new answer to current problems. However, this paper contends that the underlying tenets of this leadership style are not novel but are instead firmly founded in the divine guidance of the Holy Quran and the actual example (Seerah) of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). This visual academic article investigates the great parallels between the fundamental concepts of Agile leadership and the eternal Islamic ideals of Shura (consultation), Amanah (trust), Tafwid (delegation), Adl (justice), and Ihsan (excellence). By means of a methodical study, it creates a conceptual framework that connects modern Agile values directly to Quranic teachings. The study shows how the Quran presents an adaptive and goal-oriented model of leadership that is holistic, ethically sound, and spiritually based. This essay offers a fresh viewpoint for leaders of every background by highlighting these links and proposes that a closer interaction with this 1400-year-old knowledge can inspire and improve 21st century leadership practice.",

          "abstract": "Teleological argument has been a cornerstone of natural theology, suggesting that complexity and order in the universe imply a purposeful designer.

This paper explores the philosophical and theological use of two such fields: fractal geometry and differential geometry. It argues that while these disciplines cannot, by their very nature, provide a formal \"proof\" of God's (Allah's) existence, they serve as powerful and compelling metaphorical frameworks for understanding divine attributes such as immanence, transcendence, omnipotence, and omniscience. By examining the self-similarity and infinite complexity of fractals and the elegant, fine-tuned structure of the cosmos described by differential geometry, this paper analyzes how these mathematical concepts are employed to reinvigorate the teleological argument, shifting the discourse from a claim of logical proof to an epistemology of awe and wonder.",

          "abstract": "Becoming a major trade partner of a country implies not only increased trade ties but also a change of status.

This paper examines how a one-off “rank effect” — China’s rise to become Brazil’s top trade partner in 2009 — causally influenced Brazil’s foreign policy alignment. Using a Synthetic Difference‑in‑Differences design, this work estimates a 42% reduction in Brazil–China United Nations General Assembly ideology distance following the rank shift. To unpack the mechanism, I then conduct a Natural Language Process analysis of Folha de São Paulo headlines (2005–2013), showing a sharp increase in China‑related salience that amplifies public and elite attention to the new status quo. Together, these findings demonstrate that status gains, once made salient by the media, can produce measurable shifts in interstate alignment.",

However, there is a theoretical and empirical debate surrounding the most appropriate measure of family complexity during childhood.\n\nMethod: Numerous theoretically conceptualized sequence-based complexity measures are applied to parents’ life history data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, which were linked to children’s test scores in the National Pupils Dataset. Average within-child change in boys’ and girls’ math and English tests scores following change in mothers’ and fathers’ family complexity were estimated with fixed-effects regressions.  \n\nResults: Family complexity measures were largely found to be negatively associated with children’s academic performance, however with differences across indicators. The number of transitions as well as the uncertainty and sum of disadvantage indicators were most tightly associated with children’s test scores. In addition, results varied by parents’ and children’s gender. For example, family complexity for fathers was often positively associated with children’s educational outcomes and associations were often stronger for boys compared to girls.\n\nConclusion: Findings highlight the importance of theoretically derived measures of family complexity. In this study, measures associated with family instability and parental absence were shown to be most strongly linked with children’s educational outcomes.",

          "authors": "Kristian Bernt Karlson",
          "abstract": "Lundberg (2020) showed that significant cousin correlations in educational attainment need not imply direct influence from the extended family. Instead, such correlations may arise from two sources: generational variation in parent–child transmission strength (“dynamic transmission”) and attenuation due to classical measurement error. Building on this framework, I use data from the National Longitudinal Surveys to test whether observed sibling and cousin correlations are consistent with a first-order Markov process that incorporates generation-specific transmission parameters and known reliabilities of educational measures. After accounting for both dynamic transmission and measurement error, the model fully explains the observed cousin correlations in the NLSY. Any residual extended-family influence is negligible. These findings reinforce Lundberg’s central insight: cousin correlations in educational attainment among the cohorts studied can be entirely attributed to two-generation transmission dynamics, rather than any substantive extended-family effect.",

          "abstract": "Climate institutions - including framework legislation and advisory bodies - have proliferated globally as part of countries' responses to climate change. They have received growing attention amid a broader 'institutional turn' in the study of climate politics. We lack conceptual tools, however, to analyse these meso-level institutions and disentangle the mechanisms driving their effects on climate policymaking. To fill this gap, we develop the Climate Institutions Analysis Framework (CIAF) and use it to qualitatively analyse climate institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia. We demonstrate how cross-country variation in effects stems from interactions between institutions and 'intervening variables' specific to countries' contexts. Across our sample, most institutions address agenda-setting and knowledge-related strategic challenges; few deliver ex-ante accountability and none compensation. Our framework is relevant for comparative political economy analyses of meso-level political institutions, and, alongside our results, offers lessons for policymakers seeking to create or improve climate institutions.",

We develop and test a two-part cost-based explanation of how anti-trafficking legalization and climate shocks impact trafficking patterns through intermediary countries. We argue that the diffusion of anti-trafficking laws induces pressures on traffickers to diversify their trafficking routes. We then theorize that climate shocks confound the effect of legal institutions by incentivizing traffickers to focus their resources on mitigating climate impacts. Evidence from inferential network analysis of human trafficking networks mined from the U.S. State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report (2009--2016) supports our arguments.",

          "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Ageing and digitalization have become two global megatrends. Still, limited research has explored the role played by family relations in influencing older people’s digitalization. We examine associations betwee t having a partner, children and grandchildren and older adults’ digital technology use. We also consider geographical proximity and contact frequency with children.\nResearch Design and Methods: We leveraged data from wave eight of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the drop-off questionnaire administered to the Swiss sample in 2021 (N=1,412). We estimated various logit models and calculated predicted probabilities of frequent digital technology use as a function of several aspects of family relations.\nResults: Overall, having children and grandchildren was positively associated with certain forms of digital engagement, such as reading social media posts and making video calls. However, having a larger number of children or grandchildren was in some cases negatively associated with the use of more complex devices, such as portable or desktop computers. Being widowed or divorced was consistently linked to greater use of several digital technologies, compared to those who had never been married. Finally, having frequent contact with geographically close children was negatively associated with portable computer use, suggesting that close familial support may reduce the need for independent digital engagement.\nDiscussion and Implications: The results showed complex associations between family relations and older people’s digital technology use. The findings may help stakeholders design services that are in line with older users’ backgrounds and expertise.",

In this study, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for predicting football match results by transforming numerical features into contextual inputs. Key features include historical match results, player ratings, coach ratings, and other relevant conditions, which are processed by the LLM to predict the match winner. We compare the performance of LLM-based predictions with traditional machine learning (ML) models, including random forest and XGBoost. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs achieve comparable accuracy to these conventional ML techniques. Additionally, the LLM offers a significant advantage in that it requires no model training, simplifying implementation and reducing computational costs. This makes LLMs a promising, resource-efficient alternative for football match prediction, presenting new opportunities for AI-driven sports analytics.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the role of language and discursive strategies in constructing and legitimizing truth claims about climate change as a security issue within the European Union (EU), focusing on European Parliament decisions and key Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) documents. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach, the research integrates quantitative computational linguistic techniques with qualitative critical discourse analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of how climate change is framed as a security threat in the EU's CFSP and its implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The findings reveal an increased emphasis on security implications of climate change, a higher focus on the relationship between climate change and security, and a shift in focus from topics such as migration, energy, and economic issues to human and environmental aspects, as well as defence and regional issues. The study also highlights the interconnectedness of securitisation and riskification framings in constructing climate change as a security issue within CFSP policy documents. These insights contribute to existing literature on climate change securitisation, critical discourse analysis, and policy-making within the EU context. The research underscores the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to address climate change-related security risks, prioritizing actions that address both direct impacts of climate change on ecosystems and societies, enhancing collaboration with various stakeholders, and developing policies that encompass a wide range of strategies for mitigation and adaptation efforts.",

Although they often experience social stigma and are subject to negative stereotypes, few studies have directly examined childfree adults' social networks. In this study, we used an egocentric network approach to examine whether childfree adults experience more social isolation than parents. Using representative data in the United States from the CHIP50-NET survey, we tested three pre-registered hypotheses regarding the size and composition of 2,928 childfree adults' and 12,863 parents' egocentric networks. Compared to parents, childfree adults had significantly fewer close relationships, especially in middle age. Additionally, on average, a minority (44%) of childfree adults' close relationships were with parents, while a majority (62%) of parents' close relationships were with other parents. These findings point to a need for activities and supports that build childfree adults' social networks and that connect childfree adults and parents.",

          "abstract": "The presence of temporalities in conceptions, births, and birth outcomes such as preterm birth are well-known. However, the link between these phenomena has received surprisingly little attention. Drawing on birth certificate data from the United States (2010–2019), we demonstrate how temporal changes in conceptions are linked with birth outcomes. First, we formalize the relationship between temporal variation in conceptions and birth outcomes and provide evidence from simulations on how changes in conception rates affect birth outcomes. Second, we demonstrate the temporal relationship between changes in conception rates and birth outcomes. Third, we illustrate the impact of temporal variation in conceptions on the variation in birth outcomes across different U.S. population groups. Our results show a link between the number of conceptions and the distribution of preterm births, such that a decline in conceptions will lead to a decrease in preterm births eight months after, whereas an increase will lead to the opposite pattern. This link is stronger among groups with higher incidences of preterm birth, such as Black Americans relative to non-Hispanic White Americans. Seasonality in conceptions accounts for about one-tenth of the seasonality in birth outcomes, and this proportion increases among groups with higher incidence rates of preterm birth. This study offers new insights into the demographic determinants of health at birth at the population level.",

This study examines whether disparities in exposure to natural environments, such as green spaces, also exist based on socioeconomic status. Using remote sensing, we analyzed Tokyo, Japan, and calculated the mean NDVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for each 250m grid. We then investigated its relationship with average household income. The results revealed that grids with higher average household income tend to have higher NDVI. Additionally, we explored whether NDVI could be predicted from socioeconomic and demographic variables. The findings indicate that NDVI can be partially predicted based on these variables. This suggests that exposure to natural environments is influenced by social science factors. Although natural environments appear to be open-access resources, our study demonstrates that disparities arise due to socioeconomic and demographic factors.",

          "abstract": "Investing in urban green schoolyards is becoming more popular around the world because they could enhance health, education, and community outcomes. There is still considerable debate regarding the impact of urban green schoolyards on economic growth, equity, and community stability, particularly when analyzed using spatial-statistical and geospatial methods. The current study focuses mostly on health or individual case results and avoids looking at broader economic and equality concerns. It also fails to effectively integrate all the methodological rigor and policy implications.\nUsing GIS analysis and comparative spatial-statistical modeling, this study fills in the gaps by examining five essential recent studies, which included cases from the US, the Netherlands, and Australia. The study uses methods such as hedonic pricing, difference-in-differences, spatial econometrics, and participatory GIS to look carefully at changes in property values, equitable outcomes, and displacement risks in different metropolitan areas.\nStudies show that while investing in green schoolyards usually raises property values in the area (by 2–5% in Denver and Los Angeles) and is beneficial for kids' health and development, these benefits are not equitably shared. Most of the time, wealthy neighborhoods obtain the biggest benefits. Displacement and gentrification are most likely to occur in areas with inadequate tenant protections. Examples from around the world show that policies that focus on equity, public ownership, and participatory planning are necessary to get the most out of everyone's benefits and keep people from being left out.\nThis review shows how important it is for research and practice to be honest about their methods, share their data, and focus on equity. Integrating spatial-statistical accuracy with participatory frameworks can help make better policies and ensure that urban greening benefits everyone. Future studies need to examine standardized indicators, conduct worldwide comparisons, and perform quantitative meta-analyses to facilitate equitable choices regarding investments and policies.",

          "abstract": "Faith is an essential requirement and a fundamental need intrinsic to humans as spiritual beings. Because humans possess consciousness, and will is an inherent component of consciousness—its origin and core—humans need to live in the process of fulfilling their will. In other words, humans need to live in hope. Consequently, faith arises. Faith is the hope humans create for themselves. The significance of this hope for humans does not lie in the necessity or the objective likelihood of achieving the goal, but precisely in this hope itself.Faith serves as humanity's spiritual pillar—a systematic, complete, and independently existing ideology. It assimilates and integrates elements of human consciousness such as knowledge, emotions, ideals, convictions, and morality, forming an organic whole. Not only does it provide purpose and direction for human life, but it also supplies principles for conduct and spiritual fortitude, ensuring humans eternally dwell in hope while fulfilling their multifaceted spiritual needs. Faith is a human necessity and simultaneously a political imperative, for a society requires shared faith to maintain cohesion. As the administration tasked with governing and serving society, politics ought to cultivate and guide public faith. This constitutes both the proper duty of politics and a service to politics itself, functioning as a vital means to promote political stability.",

While advocates argue that economic gains from such incentives can realign political preferences by altering local communities' cost-benefit calculations, competing mechanisms such as disruptions to these communities and ideological resistance may offset these effects or even trigger backlash. Focusing on the Energy Community Tax Credit Bonus (ECTCB) under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, I use a two-dimensional regression discontinuity (2DRD) design to estimate its impact on the Democratic share of the two-party vote in the 2024 presidential election. The analysis suggests a small negative effect (point estimate: −0.0039; 95% confidence interval: [−0.0078, −0.0002]). These findings contribute new causal evidence to the debate on the electoral effects of place-based climate policies. This paper also makes methodological contributions by improving a recently proposed 2DRD estimator with bagging and the delta bootstrap. Through Monte Carlo simulations, I show the refined estimator exhibits less bias and greater efficiency than common alternatives.",

          "abstract": "Traditional approach to research is studying a collection of data that is specific to a certain time, space, and level based on a social science theoretical framework. In contrast, this paper synthesises across space, time and level based on system thinking. This method integrates the narrative synthesis with a systemic perspective that recognises the interconnectivity among all global service systems in the global economy. Thus, it  examines, instead of economics, workflows that encompasses all economic phenomena, irrespective of any theoretical framework, in the global economy. The examination is a system thinking on two key definitions: Economic system; Organisational advantages. It substantiates that the social science discipline has yet to realise the systemic perspective for its research on the global economy. Consequently, the result is that an existing insidious hidden non-systemic framework is the root cause of persistent systemic failures in the global economic system that adversely affect all aspects of social life, ranging from financial to healthcare. Thus, the importance of this article is that it brings out the truth about the global economy. That truth is that the advancing global economy is taking the world to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the truth is a paradox that the theoretical framework is unable to unravel due to its non-systemic perspective. Complicating this paradox is the scholarly rigor emphasized by the theoretical framework to keep it as status quo, because the unraveling of truth is a paradigm shift in research on the global economy from economic to system thinking, which is not a social science discipline.",

Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study of India and the World Health Organization's Survey on Global AGEing and adult health for four LMICs, we examine the association of direct and local exposure to polluting cooking fuels with cognitive health at older ages. We document the negative influence of both: cognitive health is poorer among members of households that use polluting fuels and among residents of neighborhoods where the use of polluting fuels is more common. These associations cannot be explained by accounting for individual or local differences in socioeconomic status. Consistent with direct impacts of polluting fuels, we find that women in households where the use of polluting fuels is common have the lowest predicted cognitive scores. Our findings reveal the substantial direct influence and negative externalities of polluting fuel use in LMICs and help understand why overall cognitive health may be poor in these settings. Moving away from polluting fuels toward clean fuels may not only reduce individual risk but also community-level exposure to air pollution, contributing to better cognitive health in older ages.",

For identification, we leverage historical site selection processes in which multiple locations were considered for new colleges. We bring together data on social capital, political preferences, and elections to assess the long-run impacts of college establishment. Communities with colleges exhibit higher levels of civic engagement and greater social trust today, relative to “runner-up” locations without colleges. These counties are also more politically liberal — a gap that has grown substantially since 2000. Our findings suggest understanding universities as place-based policies that shape the long-run civic and political development of their communities.

We study the effects of Lebanon’s 2019 October Revolution, a series of nationwide protests that took place over several months and targeted an extractive elite that has governed for two decades. Difference-in-differences estimates show that localities where protests took place were more likely to support movement parties in the election that followed the uprising. We attribute this effect to the exclusionary nature of the electoral system and show that support for movement parties was greatest in areas neglected by existing parties. Our findings contribute new insight into the relationship between protest movements and electoral behavior. Movement parties persistently struggle to channel anti-government, revolutionary opposition into support for electoral alternatives—but not where they are able to exploit the weaknesses of existing parties.",

          "abstract": "This chapter reviews some of the decolonial theory that has had significant impact on the\ncurrent research that seeks to decolonize peace and conflict studies, as well as potential\npathways for the further decolonization of the field. Much decolonial research on peace and\nconflict studies has critiqued the Eurocentrism and universalism that persists in the global\npeacebuilding architecture. Research that comprises this decolonial turn in peace studies often\nimplements a pluriversal approach to conflict analysis and peacebuilding in opposition to the\nuniversalistic “expertise” through which Eurocentric peacebuilding often travels, as outlined in\nthis chapter. We connect pluriversal peace research to the decolonial potential of subaltern\ncosmopolitanism, the latter of which is already underway and yet has seen little engagement in\npeace and conflict studies. The emergent project of subaltern cosmopolitanism, along with the\npluriversal and postabyssal way of thinking from which it issues, can support the\ndecolonization of the practice of peacebuilding, its institutional contexts, and its academic\nstudy. To demonstrate the practical importance of subaltern cosmopolitanism and indigenous\nepistemologies, this chapter highlights approaches to justice and reconciliation in Colombia and\nRwanda. We conclude by emphasizing some aspects of peace and conflict that could be\nillumined and problematized through further decolonial research.",

          "authors": "Uche Okpara; Sulaiman Yunus",
          "abstract": "Despite widespread agreement on the interdependence of peace and development, the concept of peace-centred development - which places peace at the core of development policy and practice - remains underexplored and is rarely integrated with conflict transformation in practice. Using a multi-method qualitative approach that integrates critical literature review, in-depth country case studies and comparative analysis, we reveal why implementation of conflict transformation alone often falls short in fragile situations and how embedding it within broader development strategies can unlock simultaneous gains in peace and development. We uncover the value and practice of peace-centred development and propose a new framework for connecting conflict transformation with peace-centred development, offering insights for policymakers and practitioners working at the intersection of violence, poverty and sustainable development.",

          "authors": "Zachary P. Neal; Jennifer Watling Neal",
          "abstract": "Childfree adults do not have or want children, and represent a large and growing fraction of the total population in the United States. However, we know relatively little about where childfree adults live, or whether the features of their state's context are associated with being childfree. In this study, we used representative data from 20,118 respondents in all 50 states to better understand the childfree population's spatial characteristics. Despite substantial between-state variation in prevalence, from 22% in California to 9.4% in Louisiana, this population was not clustered in specific areas. Additionally, mixed-effects model estimates suggest that although being childfree was more common in larger states with higher costs of living, individual demographic characteristics were much more strongly associated with being childfree. We concluded by discussing the policy implications of these findings, and identifying future directions that are highlighted by this study's limitations.",

          "authors": "Matthew Yeaton; Sarayu Anshuman; Sameer Srivastava",
          "abstract": "Social groups are arenas for both cohesion and conflict. Whereas prevailing theories focus on how these processes unfold at the boundaries between groups, the authors focus on the tensions that emerge within groups and that give rise to directed uncivil discourse. They develop a novel theoretical account of its network-structural antecedents. In polarized online groups, they hypothesize that the greater the structural similarity between two individuals, the less likely they will be to direct uncivil language toward one another. They further argue that this relationship will be moderated by the degree of group polarization. Using a node embedding algorithm (i.e., node2vec) to derive an omnibus measure of interpersonal structural similarity, they find support for the theory using a dataset that encompasses more than 25 million comments made by over 1.7 million users in six polarized communities on Reddit. They discuss implications for research on intergroup animosity, group polarization, the measurement of structural similarity, and the interplay of structure and culture.",

          "authors": "Tom Barbereau; Thijmen",
          "abstract": "Privacy-enhancing and other related digital technologies are marketed as increasing trust within the\ndigital society. They are deployed as means to assert trust in digital transactions and interactions\nbetween actors. What this commentary argues is that digital trust is thereby reduced to the product\nof a technological iteration, insertion, or fix: more encryption ≃ more privacy ≃ more trust. However\nrighteous it may be to foster privacy, the promise to uphold something as uncertain as trust by the\nuse of mathematics and/or statistics alone is short-sighted. Lofty notions like ‘data minimisation’ and\n‘privacy-by-design’ rest on deterministic assumptions. We suggest that in reductively appropriating the concept of trust and failing to meet expectations, the consequences of the technification of trust – i.e., the making of trust a product of technê (alone) – are paradoxical in that they actually undermine trust,  by centralising power within tech companies.",

          "authors": "Leonard Maximilian König",
          "abstract": "This study explores the interplay of issue salience and affective signals in Swiss public reactions to government measures on the Reddit forum r/Switzerland during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. Using an Exploratory Data Analysis approach, this study applied topic modeling (BERTopic) to a large corpus of posts (2019-2022) to identify shifts in online public attention and emotional responses, and transformer-based sentiment and emotion analysis to quantify sentiment\nand discrete emotions as affectives. The results reveal a Swiss online public that is highly responsive to events, with attention shifting rapidly, and whose discourse is deeply imbued with emotional content, predominantly negative in the face of restrictive policies or unsettling international developments. These insights underscore the value of computational social science in unpacking the complexities of online public opinion and offer a foundation for future research into the evolving nature of digital democracy and crisis governance.",

          "authors": "Kasper Otten; Vardan Barsegyan; Ben van Enk; Samir Mustafa Negash; Sanne Noyon; Mieke Maliepaard",
          "abstract": "Ukrainian refugees form a large new migrant group in many European countries, but we have surprisingly little representative evidence on how they fare in their host countries across multiple life domains. This study provides the first nationally representative, multidimensional analysis of Ukrainian refugees in the Netherlands, advancing our theoretical and empirical understanding of refugee participation. Our results highlight potential trade-offs and spillovers between life domains, showing that high labor market participation often coexists with challenges in social participation, health, and language proficiency. Comparative analyses with Syrian refugees and the Dutch population illustrate how differing policy environments may be involved in participation trajectories. Further, in line with the notion of superdiversity, we highlight substantial heterogeneity in outcomes within the Ukrainian refugee population. In particular, women and higher-educated Ukrainian refugees on average obtain worse outcomes across multiple life domains. Our findings demonstrate the complex, multidimensional nature of refugee participation, where positive outcomes in some domains or subgroups may coincide with difficulties in others. These insights have important policy implications for supporting vulnerable subgroups and designing policy measures that address the diverse needs within refugee populations.",

          "authors": "Steph Grohmann",
          "abstract": "In biomedical science, review by a Research Ethics Committee (REC) is an indispensable way of protecting human subjects from harm. However, in social science and the humanities, mandatory ethics compliance has long been met with scepticism as biomedical models of ethics can map poorly onto methodologies involving complex socio-political and cultural considerations. As a result, tailored ethics training and support as well as access to RECs with the necessary expertise is lacking in some areas, including parts of Europe and low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests that Generative AI can meaningfully contribute to closing these gaps, illustrating this claim by presenting EthicAlly, a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-powered ethics support system for social science and humanities researchers. Drawing on constitutional AI technology and a collaborative prompt development methodology, EthicAlly provides structured ethics assessment that incorporates both universal ethics principles and contextual and interpretive considerations relevant to most social science research. In supporting researchers in ethical research design and preparation for REC submission, this kind of system can also contribute to easing the burden on institutional RECs, without attempting to automate or replace human ethical oversight.",

Utilizing metrics such as R&amp;D expenditure, patent applications, and high-tech exports, we compare key aspects of their innovation ecosystems. Strategic frameworks like strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and the Object Key Result (OKR) strategic framework are applied to assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in each region's innovation strategies and then reviewed to determine the measurable result as the global innovation index.\nResults from the innovation indices reveal that both regions have distinct advantages: Hong Kong benefits from a dynamic financial sector, while China leads in manufacturing and technological investments. Strategic tools like SWOT analysis underscore Hong Kong's potential for growth through partnerships with mainland China, enhancing its innovative capabilities.\nIn conclusion, this applied research study provides insights into how Hong Kong and China can leverage their respective strengths and collaborate to foster sustainable innovation. The findings suggest that strategic collaborations and policy initiatives could further enhance both regions' global competitiveness in the innovative landscape.",

          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "This paper analyzes the dynamics of structurally reproduced emotional \nexpressions—what we term emotional memes—within organizational culture, using \nculturally shared symbolic character structures as a theoretical framework. Emotions \nare not merely internal phenomena; they are selectively expressed, maintained, and \npropagated under structural and institutional pressures. This study classifies the \nmemetic structures that shape emotional orders within organizations into six \narchetypes: “the Gian-type (Big G)” (domination through anger), “Suneo-type \n(Sneech)” (silence and complicity), “Shizuka-type (Sue)” (asymmetric recognition), \n“Nobita-type (Noby)” (sacrificial exclusion), “Doraemon-type” (external intervention), \nand “Dekisugi-type” (overadaptation and invisibility). In an additional chapter, we \nintroduce a seventh type—“Dorami-type” (non-disruptive support)—as a \ncomplementary external support structure. \nThese archetypes illustrate how emotions are institutionally selected and reproduced \nunder structural selection pressure. The framework challenges conventional binary \nanalyses of harassment (perpetrator/victim) and proposes a new perspective: \nemotions are not freely expressed but structurally selected. By visualizing these \nhidden dynamics of emotional order, the paper offers a memetic lens for organizational \ntransformation.",
