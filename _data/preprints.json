          "authors": "Muhua Huang; Xijuan Zhang; Christopher J. Soto; James Evans",
          "abstract": "This research introduces a novel methodology for assigning quantifiable, controllable and\npsychometrically validated personalities to Large Language Models-Based Agents (Agents)\nusing the Big Five personality framework. It seeks to overcome the constraints of human\nsubject studies, proposing Agents as an accessible tool for social science inquiry. Through a\nseries of four studies, this research demonstrates the feasibility of assigning\npsychometrically valid personality traits to Agents, enabling them to replicate complex\nhuman-like behaviors. The first study establishes an understanding of personality\nconstructs and personality tests within the semantic space of an LLM. Two subsequent\nstudies—using empirical and simulated data—illustrate the process of creating Agents and\nvalidate the results by showing strong correspondence between human and Agent answers\nto personality tests. The final study further corroborates this correspondence by using\nAgents to replicate known human correlations between personality traits and\ndecision-making behaviors in scenarios involving risk-taking and ethical dilemmas, thereby\nvalidating the eﬀectiveness of the psychometric approach to design Agents and its\napplicability to social and behavioral research.",

          "title": "Actor, Partner, and Similarity Effects of Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance on Well-being and Health in Romantic Couples",
          "authors": "Rebekka Weidmann; Hyewon Yang; Mariah Purol; William J. Chopik",
          "abstract": "Romantic attachment orientations are important predictors of individuals’ and their partners’ well-being and health. However, less is known about whether similarity in attachment between partners predicts better well-being and health outcomes. In two studies (total Ncouples = 1,602), we tested with actor-partner interdependence and dyadic polynomial regression models if partners’ attachment and their similarity were linked to their well-being and health (i.e., life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, self-rated health, medical conditions). Results revealed significant actor effects between anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), self-rated health (both studies), and medical conditions (Study 2 only). For avoidance, significant actor effects were found for life satisfaction (Study 1, female partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). Partner effects emerged for anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2) and depressive symptoms (Study 1 only) and for avoidance and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). The results of dyadic polynomial regression and response surface analyses, however, provided no evidence for any similarity effects of romantic attachment on well-being and health in both studies. In sum, the findings suggest that lower anxiety and avoidance in both partners is generally associated with higher well-being and health. However, similarity in partners’ attachment seem unimportant for concurrent well-being and health. Implications of the findings are discussed considering attachment theories and relationship processes.",

          "authors": "Ruoying Zheng; Chujun Lin",
          "abstract": "Trait impressions are ubiquitous and shape consequential decisions. Prior work investigated what information people used for trait impressions using artificial designs. To advance a naturalistic understanding, we applied novel computational tools to quantify comprehensive cues based on prior theories (facial, bodily, clothing, environmental cues) (Study 1) and manipulate individual cues realistically (Study 2) in naturalistic images. Across two pre-registered studies (N1 = 2,435 U.S. representative; N2 = 569), we found that with rich information available, the cues predicting trait impressions were sparse. We confirmed for a subset of cues that these predictions were causal. Predictive cues carried unique information beyond the consistent information shared with other available cues. Unpredictive cues played a role by shaping the utilization of predictive cues through interactions. Together, our findings suggest that the mind may have evolved to utilize the naturalistic relations between cues to simplify what information to attend to when forming trait impressions.",

          "authors": "Mika Asaba; Jessa Stegall; Emily Hembacher; Michael C. Frank; Hyowon Gweon",
          "abstract": "Praise is not only rewarding but also informative. It can provide children with information about their competence, especially when they are uncertain or unable to judge for themselves. Not all praise is equally meaningful, however: Praise from someone who praises only high-quality work is more informative than praise from someone who praises indiscriminately. Across four experiments, we find that 4- to 5-year-old U.S. children—from both in-person preschool and on- line samples—can infer the informativeness of others’ praise based on the statistical dependence between praise and the quality of work evaluated. Participants were more likely to endorse praise from a teacher whose previous praise covaried with the quality of work over a teacher who praised indiscriminately or a teacher who praised only lower-quality work (Experiment 1). Although chil- dren did not show such a preference when seeking out praise for themselves (Experiment 2), they sought out praise from different teachers on behalf of another learner depending on the learner’s goal (Experiments 3-4). Collectively, these findings show that even young children understand that praise is more than just positive reinforcement. Rather, they can reason about a speaker’s inferred informativeness and use this to guide whose praise to seek out and endorse.",

          "authors": "Ya-Wen Chang; Ian Sotomayor; Erica Szkody; Kathryn Fox; Jessica L. Schleider",
          "abstract": "In the United States, the experience of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth varies across regions with high and low levels of stigma (e.g., laws, policies and cultural norms that limit the lives of individuals with stigmatized identities). Some evidence suggests that stigma can undermine response to individual-level psychosocial interventions among youth, creating a need to identify factors that may buffer against minority stressors’ effects in high-stigma contexts. Social support may be one such factor. Therefore, among LGBTQ+ youth who received a digital, single-session intervention (SSI) focused on minority stress, we investigated whether structural and internalized stigma and social support predicted intervention response, independently or interactively. Specifically, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth in environments characterized by high stigma would report weaker SSI responses. Further, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth who perceived higher social support would report stronger SSI responses. We also tested structural stigma and social support as moderators. Using data from a previously-completed randomized evaluation, we analyzed data from 244 LGBTQ+ adolescents, aged 13 to 16 years, across 181 counties in 46 U.S. states, who engaged with the SSI. We created a factor representing structural stigma using confirmatory factor analysis at the county level. No evidence emerged for structural stigma or social support as a moderator of intervention effects on internalized stigma, identity pride, or mental health-related outcomes, either at post-intervention or at two-week follow up. Results speak to the potentially broad utility of the SSI tested in this trial for LGBTQ+ youth with limited access to mental health support.",

          "abstract": "Scientific journals play a crucial role in promoting open science. The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines identify a range of standards that journals can adopt to promote the verifiability of the research they publish. We evaluated the adoption of TOP standards within health psychology and behavioural medicine journal policies, as this had not yet been systematically assessed. In a cross-sectional study on 19 health psychology and behavioural medicine journals, eight raters evaluated TOP standard adoption by these journals using the TRUST journal policy evaluation tool. Out of a total possible score of 29, journal scores ranged from 1 to 13 (median = 6). Standards related to use of reporting guidelines and data transparency were adopted the most, whereas standards related to pre-registration of study analysis plans and citation of code were adopted the least. TOP guidelines have to-date been poorly adopted within health psychology and behavioural medicine journal policies. There are several relatively straightforward opportunities for improvement, such as expanding policies around research data to also consider code and materials, and reducing ambiguity of wording. However, other improvements may require a collaborative approach involving all research stakeholders.",

          "authors": "Jan Ian Failenschmid; Leonie V. D. E. Vogelsmeier; Joris Mulder; Joran Jongerling",
          "abstract": "Psychological concepts are increasingly understood as complex dynamic systems that change\nover time. To study these complex systems, researchers are increasingly gathering intensive\nlongitudinal data (ILD), revealing non-linear phenomena such as asymptotic growth, mean-level\nswitching, and regulatory oscillations. However, psychological researchers currently lack\nadvanced statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture these non-linear processes\naccurately, which hinders theory development. While methods such as local polynomial\nregression, Gaussian processes, and generalized additive models (GAMs) exist outside of\npsychology, they are rarely applied within the field because they have not yet been reviewed\naccessibly and evaluated within the context of ILD. To address this important gap, this article\nintroduces these three methods for an applied psychological audience. We further conducted a\nsimulation study, which demonstrates that all three methods infer non-linear processes that have\nbeen found in ILD more accurately than polynomial regression. Particularly, GAMs closely\ncaptured the underlying processes, performing almost as well as the data-generating parametric\nmodels. Finally, we illustrate how GAMs can be applied to explore idiographic processes and\nidentify potential phenomena in ILD. This comprehensive analysis empowers psychological\nresearchers to model non-linear processes accurately and select a method that aligns with their\ndata and research goals.",

          "abstract": "In an era where entertainment is effortlessly at our fingertips, one would assume that people are less bored than ever. Yet, reports of boredom are higher now than compared to the past. This rising trend is concerning because chronic boredom can undermine well-being, learning, and behaviour. Understanding why this is happening is crucial to prevent further negative impacts. In this Perspective, we explore one possible reason—digital media use makes people more bored. We propose that digital media increases boredom through dividing attention, elevating desired level of engagement, reducing sense of meaning, heightening opportunity costs, and serving as an ineffective boredom coping strategy.",

          "authors": "Arash Sal Moslehian",
          "abstract": "Despite being beloved pets, cats pose significant threats to wildlife through predation and competition. Existing legislation struggle to mitigate these impacts, highlighting the necessity for effective communication strategies. This study surveys a mostly female Swiss sample (150 participants) of university students. We investigate how different visual representations of domestic cats categorized as cute, scary, dirty, or neutral influence participants’ recall of information either positive, negative, or neutral about cats. We hypothesized that negative and dirty representations would enhance recall of negative information and cute representation would enhance the recall of positive information.\nContrary to our expectations, our analysis revealed no significant effect of visual representations on the recall of positive, negative, or neutral information. The results suggest that strong emotional and social bonds with cats, as well as their prevalent positive representation in culture, may buffer against the influence of negative imagery. Exploratory analysis indicated that individual factors, such as having a cat allergy, significantly reduced the recall of positive information. These findings show the complexity of altering public perception about the ecological impact of familiar and positively perceived animals like cats. Our study reveals the limitations of using visual representations alone to influence knowledge acquisition.",

          "authors": "Sergio Cervera Torres",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between dispositional empathy and emotional processing during embodied digital interactions. It builds upon the Spatial Affective Interaction (SAI) framework, which integrates neurobehavioral and cognitive perspectives on affective laterality, affective spatialization, and hand-proximity effects. The research particularly focuses on how lateralized manual interactions with emotional images (“emotional grabbing”) affect users’ pleasantness experiences. A sample of 240 right-handed participants used either their dominant right hand or non-dominant left hand to engage with 40 emotional images (20 pleasant and 20 unpleasant) using ipsilateral (same hand-side) or contralateral (opposite hand-side) interactions in a touchscreen environment. Key findings reveal asymmetries in pleasantness experiences that depend on hand dominance, ipsilateral interactions, and empathy levels. Specifically, participants reported increased pleasantness when using the dominant right hand to interact with right-positioned pleasant images, especially at lower empathy levels.\nConversely, interactions with left-positioned unpleasant images using the non-dominant left hand resulted in heightened unpleasantness among low-empathy participants, with the opposite pattern observed in high-empathy individuals. These findings suggest that “emotional grabbing” may enhance sensitivity to emotional content in less empathic individuals, possibly by compensating for impaired activation of the action-observation network (AON), which integrates sensorimotor and empathy processes. The study underscores the relevance of considering hand dominance, emotional valence, and empathy in the future design of embodied digital interactions, to enhance the emotional experiences of individuals with explicit empathy deficits.",

          "abstract": "Body movements like walking can synchronize with auditory and visual inputs presented within a periodic frequency range, peaking around 2 Hz. The EEG frequency-tagging approach allows to capture the synchronization of beat perception with neural brain oscillations at the beat frequency. This study used EEG frequency-tagging to explore brain dynamics during rhythmic sensorimotor synchronization with auditory (footstep sound) and visual (walking point-light figure) inputs. Sensory inputs were delivered at different rates (1 Hz, 2 Hz, 3.6 Hz) in rhythmic or random sequences while recording EEG activity. The experiment included three conditions: (i) Auditory, (ii) Visual, and (iii) Audiovisual, including data from 22 participants. Results showed a main effect of rhythmic sequences compared to random sequences across all frequencies in all three auditory, visual, or audiovisual conditions. Specifically, at 2 Hz, rhythmic sequences enhanced synchronization in the sensorimotor cortex for auditory and audiovisual conditions. This effect was absent in the visual condition alone. Notably, 2 Hz rhythmic sequences in the audiovisual condition led to synchronization with temporal, sensorimotor, and occipital regions. The study suggests that attention to rhythmic auditory input at 2 Hz can mediate neural synchronization between auditory and sensorimotor brain areas.",

          "authors": "Shriya Gaur",
          "abstract": "Gender is more of a social construct than a biological phenomenon, encompassing\npsychological, social, cultural, behavioral, and expressive aspects of identity. In India,\ngender is often perceived heteronormatively, leaving no room for androgyny and\nexpecting conformity to the gender assigned at birth. This rigid binary system does not\naccommodate those who feel uncomfortable with their assigned gender. Gender\ndysphoria refers to the distress experienced when one's true gender identity does not\nalign with their assigned gender. This condition can be exacerbated by societal labels\nand expectations, such as gender-specific washrooms, which challenge non-cis-\ngender individuals' sense of self. Activities not conforming to gender norms, like a\nmale-presenting individual wearing nail paint, invite judgment and restrict self-\nexpression, leading to a distorted self-identity. This lack of personal expression and\ninsecure self-identity correlates with low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. The\npresent study aimed to highlight the significance of gender dysphoria and societal\nlabels as barriers to self-identity in gender-queer individuals. An exhaustive literature\nreview and purposive sampling of 20 LGBTQIIA+ individuals aged 18-30 were\nconducted. In-depth interviews based on a partially structured, self-made questionnaire\nrevealed that gender dysphoria and binary societal labels significantly hinder the\nestablishment and security of one's self-identity.",

          "authors": "Giovanni Andrade; Patrick Gaudreau; Philippe Pétrin-Pomerleau",
          "abstract": "Perfectionism has been theorized as a risk factor for psychological need frustration. However, past studies on basic psychological needs often reported ambiguous and unexpected findings for perfectionistic standards. The Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP) recently distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of high yet attainable standards (excellencism). This study investigated their distinct associations with basic psychological needs, using measures taken from the need-as-motives and the need-as-nutriments perspectives. Young adults (n=305) completed the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism and various measures of need-related constructs. A multivariate multiple regression supported the hypothesis that excellencism and perfectionism are differentially linked with psychological needs. Excellencism was positively associated with three approach-oriented motives (need for achievement, affiliation, power) and satisfaction with the need for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Conversely, pursuing perfectionistic standards was positively linked to two avoidance-oriented motives (e.g., fear of failure and losing control) and frustration with the three basic psychological needs. These findings reconcile research and theories by showing that pursuing perfection is not associated with adaptive psychological needs. Perfectionistic standards are linked to two avoidance-oriented motives (i.e., fear of failure and losing control) and frustration of basic psychological needs when properly distinguished from excellencism.",

Indeed, leading theories predict that people prefer sets with similar items. We test this with a computational approach that leverages network science to measure a novel form of similarity specific to economic choice. This “preference similarity” is defined as the strength of associations between items derived from correlations in their liking ratings. We find little evidence that people prefer sets with items that are similar to others in the set. Instead, we find that people prefer sets containing individual items that are highly central, i.e., items which generally have stronger associations with other items. Overall, we validate a quantitative tool for measuring similarity and show that while people prefer sets with items that are similar to many other items, they don’t prefer more similar sets.",

By challenging traditional deficit-oriented models, this framework advocates for recognizing the adaptive and context-dependent nature of cognitive abilities. We explore how these approaches collectively validate the diverse experiences of neurodivergent individuals and those from different cultural backgrounds, highlighting their unique strengths. Through an interdisciplinary lens, we emphasize the role of environmental and societal factors in shaping cognitive performance, advocating for more holistic and equitable assessments and promoting perspectives that acknowledge and value a range of skills when attempting to provide developmental support plans. This paradigm shift in psychology moves towards a diversity-oriented perspective, calling for systemic changes in how we assess, support, and value diverse cognitive profiles. We suggest that embracing this comprehensive approach can lead to more effective educational and clinical practices, fostering environments where all individuals can thrive.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Jackson; Ben Bradford",
          "abstract": "The legitimacy of legal institutions, particularly the police, has consistently been linked to questions of obligation and compliance. According to procedural justice theory, when the police enforce the law in normatively appropriate ways, consensual rather than coercive policing bolsters not only their own legitimacy, but also that of the law. On this account, procedural justice promotes compliance by fostering a sense of trust, shared group membership and endeavour, whereby being law-abiding is a central part of one’s identity and self-definition. Yet, other aspects of police behaviour, and other aspects of people’s relationships with police, also promote legitimacy and motivate behaviours in relation to the law. In this chapter, we ask what it is precisely about people’s relationships with police that promotes legal obligation. We argue that legal obligation is partly shaped by consensual policing practices that encourage people to allow legal authorities to “call the shots”. This means (a) conceding and authorising the right to make orders and decisions, and (b) opening oneself up to the risk attached to engaging with police. In providing examples of the empirical processes in play here, we also seek to make links to normative accounts of the importance of fairness and the reasons why people should obey the police and legal authorities.",

          "abstract": "Perceptions of socioeconomic status (SES) can perpetuate inequality by influencing interpersonal interactions in ways that disadvantage people with low SES. Indeed, lab studies have provided evidence that people can detect others’ SES and that they may use this information to apply stereotypes that influence interpersonal decisions. Here, we examine how SES and SES-based stereotypes affect real-world social interactions between people from a socioeconomically diverse population. We used the computer mediated online round robin (CMORR) method to facilitate interactions among 297 participants from across the US. Participants completed a series of dyadic interactions with other participants in virtual rooms in which they discussed a recent negative consumer experience. After each interaction, they judged the interaction partner’s SES, personality traits, and credibility of their consumer experience. Results showed that people perceived SES with moderate accuracy in the interactions, which elicited negative interpersonal stereotypes of low-SES individuals for all 12 of the personality traits measured. People also preferred to affiliate with others with high SES, had more sympathy for them, and found their experiences more credible. SES-based interpersonal stereotypes about personality traits mediated these associations. The perception of SES in real-time interactions thus appears to activate stereotypes that guide social judgments, supporting the hypothesis that interpersonal effects contribute to economic inequality.",

          "abstract": "Background: Noise-induced hearing loss is both irreversible and preventable. However, a minority of adolescents and young adults do engage in hearing protective behaviors that reduce the exposure to noise, such as the use of hearing protection and the use of a volume limiter. To promote hearing protective behaviors in adolescents and young adults it is imperative to know the most relevant, and potentially modifiable, psychological factors that stimulate or hinder these protective behaviors.\n\nObjective: The present study aims to offer a systematic literature overview of psychological correlates of hearing protective behaviors in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 25 years, and identify those correlates that are likely to be the most promising behavioral intervention targets in this age group.\n\nConclusions: A total of 82 studies were included in the present review, of which data of 24 studies could be used to help identify the psychological factors most strongly associated with hearing protective behavior. Taking into account both the strength of the associations and the univariate distributions, the following psychological factors showed the greatest potential as behavioral intervention targets: attitude toward recreational noise, perceived barriers, capacity, perceived norms, and perceived threat susceptibility. The outcomes of the present review may help guide the development of more effective behavioral interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in younger age groups.",

However, little is known about the interplay between such spontaneous normative influence processes within social networks and more formalised top-down norms communicated by institutions (e.g., schools). To test this impact, we conducted a longitudinal four-wave field experiment employing social-network analysis among real groups. Students enrolled in Dutch and international psychology bachelor programmes at a Dutch university were assigned to mentoring groups (N = 288 across 50 groups in the last wave). As the institutional intervention, they watched an online diversity training video (vs. not, between participants) at the beginning of data collection (T1), and attended a diversity and inclusion session (within-participants) before T2. At each timepoint, participants reported attitudes towards outgroup members and (ingroup and outgroup) friendships with students enrolled in the same programme. We examined how peer norms (i.e., friends’ intergroup attitudes) and institutional interventions shape intergroup attitudes, finding that our institutional intervention improved intergroup attitudes and facilitated the spread of positive peer norms within networks over time.",

          "abstract": "One domain frequently assessed in Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) studies is that of daily activities. This is often done with predefined (and unvalidated) categorical items, but can also be done using open-ended items. ESM researchers, however, lack tools and guidance in analyzing the obtained open-ended data. In the first part of this paper, we use data from a 28-day ESM study in which students reported their activities both categorically and open-endedly to compare these two assessment approaches. We additionally present participant preferences and reflections captured in exit interviews. In the second part, we illustrate the qualitative analysis process for open-ended ESM responses. We introduce a Shiny app facilitating the coding of qualitative text snippets and code enabling interactive exploration of (hierarchical) code structures derived from qualitative analyses. Our results highlight the advantages and limitations of both assessment approaches: while categorical items offer simplicity, they often lack specificity. Conversely, open-ended responses provide richer, more personalized data, making them particularly valuable in idiographic clinical applications and exploratory research. A combination of both formats may enable the most effective assessment. We hope the tools we provide encourage the further use and exploration of open-ended ESM assessments.",

Individuals involved in collective action problems are often considered to have two options: contribute towards a public solution or free-ride. But they might also choose a third option of investing in a private solution such as local climate change adaptation. Here we introduce a collective action game featuring wealth inequality caused by luck or merit and both public and private solutions with participants from 34 countries. We show that the joint existence of wealth inequality and private solutions has a consistent effect across countries: participants endowed with higher income choose the private solution almost twice as often as those endowed with lower income; and this finding cannot be explained by different sources of wealth (luck vs. merit) or by cultural or economic factors. We also show that preferences for private solutions undermine support for public solutions, resulting in wealth inequality increasing in every country. In contrast, we identify two universal pathways to successful public solution provision: early contributions to public solutions and conditional cooperation. Our findings highlight the ubiquity of the ‘private solution problem’ and its potential consequences for global collective action problems.",

However, when individuals learn that their opinion-based group is growing or shrinking, they may experience this stress in different ways, i.e., as a threat or a challenge. In a study among Dutch participants, we examined how changes in public opinion on migration (i.e., progressive and conservative changes compared to stability in public opinion) interacted with political ideology to influence cardiovascular reactivity indicative of challenge and threat when reflecting and speaking on the future of relations between migrants and members of the host society. In line with predictions, progressive change (vs. stability) in public opinion led ideological leftists to exhibit a cardiovascular pattern indicative of stronger challenge (low total peripheral resistance; high cardiac output) and caused ideological rightists to display a cardiovascular pattern indicative of stronger threat (low total peripheral resistance; high cardiac output) Additional analyses of self-report measures suggest that progressive change (vs. stability) increased ideological leftists’ resource appraisal regarding the speech and reduced their prejudice towards migrants. However, both progressive and conservative change (vs. stability) increased ideological rightists’ prejudice towards migrants. These findings highlight the role of consistency between the direction of public opinion change and personal beliefs as a resource for coping with the stress of forming and expressing one’s opinion on politically-charged topics.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used for personnel assessment and selection (e.g., resume screeners, automatically scored interviews). However, concerns have been raised throughout society that ML assessments may be biased and perpetuate or exacerbate inequality. Although organizational researchers have begun investigating ML assessments from traditional psychometric and legal perspectives, there is a need to understand, clarify, and integrate fairness operationalizations and algorithmic bias mitigation methods from the computer science, data science, and organizational research literatures. We present a four-stage model of developing ML assessments and applying bias mitigation methods, including 1) generating the training data, 2) training the model, 3) testing the model, and 4) deploying the model. When introducing the four-stage model, we describe potential sources of bias and unfairness at each stage. Then, we systematically review definitions and operationalizations of algorithmic bias, legal requirements governing personnel selection from the United States and Europe, and research on algorithmic bias mitigation across multiple domains and integrate these findings into our framework. Our review provides insights for both research and practice by elucidating possible mechanisms of algorithmic bias while identifying which bias mitigation methods are legal and effective. This integrative framework also reveals gaps in the knowledge of algorithmic bias mitigation that should be addressed by future collaborative research between organizational researchers, computer scientists, and data scientists. We provide recommendations for developing and deploying ML assessments, as well as recommendations for future research into algorithmic bias and fairness.",

          "abstract": "Language is known to play a crucial role in influencing how humans perceive and categorize sensory stimuli, including odors. This study investigated the impact of linguistic labeling on odor categorization among bilingual participants proficient in Chinese (L1) and English (L2).  We hypothesized that L1-like linguistic labels would more robustly propel the learning of new olfactory categories compared to a condition without language, and more familiar labels would better support odor category learning. The analysis focused on comparing learning trajectories and odor categorization performance of four groups, three in which odors were paired with different sets of verbal labels and a control group that categorized odors without any verbal labeling. Following four days of intensive training, the results showed that the groups with verbal labels numerically outperformed the control group, and that the less familiar the labels sounded the more successful categorization became. However, between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. These findings, while not conclusively supporting our hypotheses, provide insights into the complex relationship between linguistic familiarity and odor category formation. The results are nested within Ad Hoc Cognition, highlighting that variations in linguistic familiarity may not induce robust enough contextual changes to differentially affect how odor categories are formed.",

          "abstract": "Calendar calculations, the process of computing the target day or month, exhibit peculiar differences across languages. In systems like English, calendar labels are largely opaque (Tuesday, August), which invites calculations to rely more heavily on verbal listing. In transparent systems, like Chinese, habitual labeling of calendar terms numerically (Tuesday = day two, August = month eight) facilitates fast numerical operations instead of verbal listing. This study examines the effects that different levels of transparency of the calendar naming system may have on calculations in the speakers’ first and second language. Chinese-English bilinguals were tested alongside English and Chinese controls. Forced-choice calendar calculations (day, month, hour, and year) and self-reported strategies were used as tasks to tap into participants’ calculation speed, accuracy, and temporal reasoning. In the calculation questions we manipulated Distance (short/long), Direction (forward/backward), Input (linguistic/numerical) and Boundary (within/across). More complex Month calculations significantly differed across groups while easier day calculations did not. The English group reported reliance on verbal listing, while the Chinese and the bilingual groups preferred numerical reasoning. These findings bring new evidence for linguistic relativity in the form of modulations of calendar processing speed changing as a function of linguistic transparency, input type and task demand.",

          "abstract": "Instance models have been successfully applied to a range of problems including memory,\nlanguage, attention, learning, action, decision making, and categorization (see Jamieson, Johns,\nVokey, &amp; Jones, 2022). According to instance theory, the individual experience constitutes the fundamental unit of knowledge and knowledge of the general emerges during parallel retrieval from memory (Brooks, 1978, 1987). Until recently, applications of instance theory to the problem of language were constrained to small and contrived laboratory experiments (e.g., Jamieson &amp; Mewhort, 2009). However, the approach has now been applied at scale to the large and messy problem of natural language (e.g., Jamieson et al., 2018; Johns &amp; Jones, 2015; Johns et al., 2020). With those demonstrations now in hand, we argue that the framework can present an articulate mechanistic underbelly to the usage-based theory of language that highlights the role of specific language experience in general language behavior (Abbot-Smith &amp; Tomasello, 2006; Tomasello, 2003). Overall, this article argues that instance memory models provide an ability to deepen our understanding of language as a dynamic, contextually embedded process, serving to bridge the gap between cognitive psychology and the language sciences.",

          "abstract": "Adopting physical expressions of emotion has been shown to have feedback effects on individuals’ mood and behaviour. For example, adopting the expansive and contractive body language of dominance and submission can affect individuals’ feelings of power, but the effects are subtle and variable. Part of this variability may stem from the high number of degrees of freedom in body language, with multiple distinct actions and muscular patterns underlying the categorical constructs of “expansive” and “contractive” postures. Using quantitative measures of body posture algorithmically derived from video recordings, we demonstrate for the first time that neck flexion fully mediates the effects of posture on mood in a postural feedback (i.e. “power posing”) paradigm; that is, adopting expansive and contractive body language affects mood by introducing variability in neck flexion. We also investigate several other mediators and moderators of postural feedback, finding that both perceived difficulty of the posture and awareness of one’s body play key roles, and identify a muscular correlate of neck flexion which correlates with mood effects. The present work carries implications for our understanding of the adaptive benefits of expansive and contractive postures, as well as substantial methodological insights for controversial research on power posing.",

Strong therapeutic alliances have been associated with positive clinical outcomes, but much remains unknown about alliance and its physiological basis. Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) – the synchronization of neural signals between interacting individuals – is emerging as a novel lens for studying interactions with relatively objective and time-sensitive neuroimaging techniques. We searched four databases to identify studies of INS in clinical encounters. Our search yielded 161 articles, 46 met criteria for full-text review and 12 were included. The included articles reported INS across a total of 174 dyads, all published since 2018. Despite diverse methodologies, INS was observed in all studies and was often related to therapeutic outcomes. However, results were mixed regarding associations between INS and therapeutic alliance. These results highlight that, while promising, additional research is needed to elucidate the relationship between INS, therapeutic alliance and clinical outcomes. Future studies should aim to standardize methodologies, explore temporal dynamics (e.g., through longitudinal assessments), and include larger sample sizes.",

          "authors": "Yali Pan",
          "abstract": "Processing emotional information is a key ability in human life. However, little is known about how this innate ability affect acquired abilities such as reading. In this study, we recorded eye movements of 43 participants as they silently read 210 one-line English sentences. Each sentence contained a target word manipulated by emotional content (negative/neutral/positive) and word frequency (low/high). All target words were unpredicted, with well-controlled prior sentential context and pre-target words. We found a significant main effect of the target word frequency on the first fixation durations of pre-target words, indicating a lexical parafoveal-on-foveal (PoF) effect, supporting the parallel processing models in reading. Notably, this study is the first to report an interaction between emotional content and word frequency during parafoveal reading, observed in early eye movement measures (i.e., first fixation and gaze durations). This suggests that emotional information can be extracted from the parafovea and influences lexical access. During foveal reading, we found that emotional words were fixated shorter than neutral words, with no difference between positive and negative words. However, this emotional processing priority was found only for low frequency words. Interestingly, the interaction between emotional content and word frequency was observed in the early stage of parafoveal processing but in the late stage of foveal processing, highlighting a dynamic and intricate interplay between emotional processing and lexical access. Overall, our findings suggest that emotion processing is automatic and takes precedence, influencing lexical access even in the “unattended” area like the parafovea.",

This study examines the decline in average reading literacy among primary school students in European countries between 2016 and 2021, as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) documented. This period is characterized by disruptions due to COVID-19-related school closures and changes in student composition, influenced mainly by societal trends across many European countries.\nAims. We estimated trends in reading literacy adjusted for changes in student composition to assess the relationship between the duration of school closures and school-related learning loess.\nSample. We utilized data from 2016 and 2021 from 18 European countries/regions as part of the PIRLS, involving a representative sample of approximately 5,000 fourth graders per year and country/region (N = 187,386; Mean Age = 10.28, SD = 0.86; 49.50% female).\nMethods. Our analytical approach employed propensity score weighting to balance changes in student composition between the 2016 and 2021 cohorts.\nResults. Our findings revealed changes in student composition across most of the 18 countries/regions. First, the average adjusted decline in reading literacy across all 18 European countries/regions was significantly lower than the observed decline, but it remained substantial. Second, the expected decline was associated with the length of COVID-related school closures, estimated at ‒0.0015 SDs per day.\nConclusions. School closures and changes in the composition of student cohorts played a substantial role in the decline in reading literacy observed between 2016 and 2021. This study enhances our understanding of how student composition and school-related factors influence trends in reading literacy.",

          "abstract": "Some ethical committees question whether individuals with a history of self-harm thoughts and behaviours (SHTBs) are “too vulnerable” to take part in Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research and if repeatedly asking about SHTBs could be harmful. Past research has focused on whether participating in ESM research influences SHTBs, and has overlooked participants’ general experience of ESM studies. We explored the relationships between ESM beep disturbance (disruptiveness) and compliance, and lifetime and current SHTBs. N=1507 participants completed baseline questionnaires, including about lifetime history of SHTBs, and N=1788 completed ESM 10x per day for six days, including questions about how much completing the ESM questionnaire disturbed them, and their SHTBs in daily life. There were no significant differences in disturbance or compliance between individuals with no lifetime history of SHTBs, self-harm thoughts, or self-harm behaviours. Individuals reporting self-harm behaviours during the ESM period were more likely to experience the ESM questionnaires as more disturbing. Individuals experienced the ESM questionnaires as more disturbing when more intense self-harm thoughts were reported during the ESM period on average and when their current self-harm thoughts were more intense. Our results indicate that lifetime history of SHTBs does not relate to ESM compliance or beep disturbance. However, ESM may be more taxing for individuals experiencing more intense current SHTBs, and at moments when their self-harm thoughts are more intense. We suggest that a ‘static vulnerability’ approach to ethical evaluation of ESM research based on lifetime history of SHTBs is inappropriate, and that a dynamic approach is preferable.",

          "abstract": "Background: Insomnia is highly prevalent and associated with serious health issues. Despite the negative impact of poor sleep on mind and body, most people do not seek treatment. This study aimed to examine the strategies used to improve sleep in the general population and investigate the characteristics of individuals using music as a sleep aid.\nMethods: A survey was distributed via Facebook advertisements to Danish adults aged 18 and above. Among 3667 responders, a representative subsample of 1195 participants was randomly selected based on age and sex. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Bergen Insomnia Scale. Data analysis involved chi-square tests and logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, education and insomnia status. \nResults: This study found that nearly all participants utilized strategies to aid their sleep, with the most common strategies being “following a routine” (73%), “reducing caffeine in the afternoon/evening” (65%) and “lowering the temperature in the bedroom” (62%). Individuals with insomnia utilized significantly more strategies compared to those without insomnia. Among the participants, 29% reported using music for sleep, with 4.5% using music almost daily. Music users tended to be younger and more likely to suffer from insomnia.\nConclusions: By evaluating a broad range of sleep strategies, this study shows that people do several things to promote sleep in their daily lives. More strategies are used by people with insomnia, but people without insomnia consider specific behaviours to facilitate sleep as well. This research enhances our understanding of sleep behaviour, providing an important fundament for targeting future public health interventions to improve sleep in the general population.",

Statistical and morphometric analyses were conducted on the obtained data. The results showed significant positive correlations between attractiveness ratings across gender, age, and culture. However, the results of the geometric morphometrics revealed that Japanese female participants emphasized linear contours in attractive male images more than Japanese male participants. Additionally, Japanese raters were more likely than American raters to emphasize raised eyebrows for faces in attractive male images and smaller mouths for faces in attractive female images. These results suggest that the specific facial features driving attractiveness evaluations differ depending on gender and culture, offering detailed insights into the culturally diverse standards of facial attractiveness. This study adds to the growing understanding of how cultural and individual factors shape aesthetic preferences, questioning the notion of universal beauty and offering a clearer framework for future cross-cultural research on facial attractiveness.",

          "authors": "Mazidi",
          "abstract": "Alexithymia is characterised by difficulties identifying and describing feelings, as well as a lack of focus on feelings. Alexithymia is a transdiagnostic risk factor for developing a wide array of psychopathologies, such as anxiety and depression, with a key hypothesised mechanism being the impairing impact of alexithymia on emotion regulation. However, no study has tested whether difficulties with emotion regulation mediate the link between alexithymia and clinically relevant symptoms using longitudinal designs. The present study aimed to address this limitation by collecting data from 242 Iranian high school students at two time points, seven months apart. The results revealed that baseline alexithymia levels not only related to future emotion regulation difficulties but predicted increased emotion regulation difficulties in the future. Furthermore, these increased difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the relationship between baseline alexithymia and worsening of psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms) over time. This study, therefore, supports the attention-appraisal model of alexithymia in its theoretical account linking alexithymia and emotion regulation difficulties and highlights the critical role that alexithymia plays in emotional health and illness during adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Touching an object can elicit affective sensations. Because these sensations are critical for social interaction, tactile preferences may be adapted to the characteristics of the human body. Our group has demonstrated that compliance (a physical correlate of softness) increased the tactile pleasantness of a deformable surface until it reaches around the same level as those of human body parts. However, individuals such as those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often avoid being touched by others. Does ASD have atypical affective response patterns to soft objects like human body parts? Herein, adults with ASD and typically developed (TD) adults numerically estimated the perceived pleasantness or softness while lightly pressing urethane rubbers with their right index fingers. The results revealed that pleasantness increased as a function of compliance, but this increase was smaller for ASD than TD, particularly at compliance levels including human body parts. However, the perceived softness increased as a function of compliance similarly between the ASD and TD groups. This result demonstrates an atypical preference of ASD individuals for soft objects, which may explain the avoidance of ASD to social touch.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This critical review examines the application of two commonly-used adaptive functioning measures, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales – Third Edition (Vineland-3) and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System – Third Edition (ABAS-3), to the behavioral intervention context. The review focuses on periodic outcome and treatment planning assessment in people with autism spectrum disorder receiving comprehensive and intensive behavioral intervention (CIBI) programs. Methods: Instrument technical manuals were reviewed and a PubMed search was used to identify published manuscripts that included the Vineland-3 and ABAS-3 as a primary focus with relevance to development, psychometric properties, or measure interpretation. Results: Analysis begins by introducing the roles of periodic outcome assessment for CIBI programs. Next, the Vineland-3 and ABAS-3 are evaluated in terms of their development processes, psychometric characteristics, and practical aspects of their implementation to inform everyday practice. Examination of each measure’s development indicates that they were not specifically designed for use with individuals with autism spectrum disorder or within CIBI programs. Furthermore, the evidence for several key psychometric characteristics is either unavailable or suggests less than desirable properties, while evaluation of practical considerations for implementation revealed weaknesses in ongoing intervention monitoring and clinical decision support. Conclusions: The Vineland-3 and ABAS-3 have significant weaknesses relevant to their application in CIBI outcome assessment. Alternative approaches are offered, including developing and adopting measures specifically developed for individuals with autism spectrum disorder and the CIBI intervention context.",

          "abstract": "Advice-taking plays a critical role in collaboration. Yet people tend to under-utilize advice,\noften to their own detriment. In this chapter, we investigate if people’s utilization of advice\nimproves when they know the advisor has access to different information compared to\nthem. Across four experiments, we examine how individuals integrate advice in an\nestimation task, where the advisee and the advisor have access to different perspectives of\nthe same problem. Experiment 1 evaluates participants’ independent ability to perform the\ntask of estimating the number of objects in a jar from various viewpoints. The results show\nthat depending on the type of objects, some viewpoints provide more accurate estimates\nthan others. Experiment 2 confirms that participants are able to identify these more\ninformative viewpoints. Building on these findings, Experiment 3 examines how individuals\nadjust their estimates when presented with estimates from a human advisor and an AI\nadvisor. Individuals are also given information about the advisor’s perspective. Our\nfindings are consistent with egocentric discounting where individuals exhibit a general bias\ntoward their own information. However, this discounting is lower for AI advisors compared\nto human advisors in our experiment. Our results also show that the advisor’s estimate is\ntaken more into account when the advisor has a more favorable viewpoint – for both\nhuman and AI advisors. This suggests a potential for optimizing advice-taking behavior by\nenhancing people’s understanding of the advisor’s viewpoint. This study furthers our\nunderstanding of advice-taking dynamics with human and AI advisors and the role of\nperspective-taking in decision-making processes.",

          "abstract": "Stereotypes in the real world are complex, varying by perceivers, situations, and intersecting identities. These modifying factors are often overlooked in the literature. We address this gap by having participants freely write stories about how people view 9 different groups across 6 representative situations and of 30 intersectional identities. To identify stereotypes in these stories, we leverage large language model GPT to detect stereotypes. Across two pre-registered studies with U.S. representative participants (N = 1,721), we found that although stereotypes are considered products of social learning, they varied considerably across perceivers. While seen as overgeneralized associations about the groups, stereotypes significantly varied by situation. Multiple categorizations do not shape intersectional stereotypes equally, with Asian showing dominating effects likely due U.S. population’s lower exposure to this group than familiar identities (Black/White, women/men, old/young). These findings highlight how individual experiences, situation norms, and identity representativeness interact to shape stereotypes in naturalistic contexts.",

The emergent communication systems exhibited both discreteness and systematicity. Systematicity, in particular, predicted successful communication.

          "abstract": "While verbal and numeric confidence may similarly predict identification accuracy, there are many challenges to overcome in the use of verbal confidence, despite the criminal justice system’s preference for it. Eyewitnesses could potentially provide scale ratings after verbal judgments or vice versa, if the confidence-accuracy relationship is maintained. In two studies, participants watched one or more mock-crime videos and then viewed target-present or target-absent lineups for the perpetrators. After each lineup, participants provided confidence either verbally (in their own words) and then numerically (0-100%), or numerically and then verbally. For verbal confidence judgments and numeric confidence judgments, neither order nor the interaction predicted identification accuracy. Asking eyewitnesses to provide confidence both verbally and numerically does not negatively impact the confidence-accuracy relationship, regardless of order. However, we show that there is considerable variability in the meaning eyewitnesses assigned to their own word confidence judgments, which suggests asking for own words confidence only is problematic. We caution that the usefulness of verbal confidence to predict accuracy hinges on a systematic approach to its interpretation.",

          "authors": "Orestis Zavlis; Peter Fonagy; Michael Moutoussis; Giles W Story",
          "abstract": "Existing models of personality disorder are statistical models: dispersion patterns of personality facets. Although useful in describing personality differences, such models fall short in terms of explaining those differences. Generative models can address these explanatory gaps by explicating the mechanisms that generate descriptive pathologies. In this paper, we aim to move beyond the former descriptive models and toward the latter explanatory ones. To do so, we formalize personality pathology using a generative model that has four properties. First, it is probabilistic: it outlines how humans leverage uncertainty to make sense of their own and others’ ways of being. Second, it is mentalizing: it posits that personality pathology is about poor ways of experiencing and relating to the self and others. Third, it is hierarchical: it accounts for the multiplicity of self- and other- states (in the here-and-now) and traits (in the long-run). Finally, it is dynamic: it outlines how these properties evolve over time, accounting for the development of personality. Simulating data from this model, we demonstrate how it can account for the generation, maintenance, and treatment of various personality problems (from borderline instability to narcissistic grandiosity) by formalizing them as relational problems: problems with navigating relationships. We thus discuss how our model could be used to address recent debates on what is central to personality pathology by clarifying the distinction between description (what personality ‘is’) and explanation (what personality ‘does’). We conclude the paper with a tutorial on our model and suggestions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal dynamics have long been acknowledged as instrumental to the generation and alleviation of psychopathology problems. Recent computational approaches have been argued to be uniquely suited for investigating such dynamics either with exploratory models (machine learning) or confirmatory models (generative modeling). However, the utility of such models to the study of interpersonal problems has not yet been scrutinized. We thus conducted a systematic review to assess the validity, reliability, and openness of computational models to the study of interpersonal psychopathology problems. Candidate studies (n = 2,944), including peer-reviewed conference manuscripts, were derived from five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to September 2024. A total of 55 studies met inclusion criteria and were assessed for their computational approach, validity, reliability, and openness. Results indicated that Bayesian modeling was the most commonly used approach (k=19), followed by machine learning (k=16), dynamical systems modeling (k=10), and reinforcement learning (k=10). Quality assessments revealed considerable heterogeneity in the validity of these approaches, with some scoring high primarily on empirical validity (reinforcement learning), others on theoretical validity (dynamical systems), and yet others on generative validity (Bayesian models). Finally, and most strikingly, few studies reported comprehensive performance metrics and even fewer studies adopted open science practices (specifically, 2 pre-registered their hypotheses and 8 shared their data and code online). We discuss these matters and conclude with more optimistic messages regarding how, when rigorously and openly conducted, computational approaches have the potential to advance the field of interpersonal psychopathology by enabling us to formalize and examine historically elusive social concepts (like mental representations of the self and others) and their role in psychopathology problems.",

Consequently, interest has increased in how people cope with the effects of politics on their wellbeing. We applied an affective science framework to investigate whether interoceptive sensibility, i.e., attunement to our inner bodily feelings, can attenuate the extent to which politics affect people’s health. In a US sample of Republican (n=311) and Democratic (n=321) supporters, we found that interoception can counteract the adverse effects of political engagement on citizens’ health, irrespective of their political party. Importantly, this protective function of interoception does not impact citizens’ political engagement and participation. If anything, people with higher interoceptive sensibility appear more resilient to the impact that politics can have on their health and are more likely to be politically engaged. These findings pave the way for new studies on the intricate and complex relations between embodiment, emotions and politics.",

However, eye-movement indicators of mind-wandering during reading have not yet been clearly identified. This article presents results from two studies. Firstly, we carried out a meta-analysis to identify eye movement indicators of mind-wandering during reading. From the initial search, abstracts from 140 articles were reviewed for eligibility, and 39 articles were included for full text reading and data extraction. Finally, we identified 16 individual datasets from 19 articles for which we could compute effect sizes. We calculated effect sizes for 9 eye-movement measures: mean fixation duration, fixations count, first-fixation duration, gaze duration, total reading time, saccade length, skipping, blink count, and inter-word regressions. The results indicated that readers skipped more words and made fewer fixations during mind-wandering compared to on-task reading. Following these results, we carried out exploratory analyses with a dataset from our own lab to examine other possible explanations for this eye-movement pattern. Specifically, we investigated readers’ sensitivity to word frequency and length and readers’ use of corrective regressions. Results indicated that readers show reduced effects of word length and frequency on skipping behavior as well as a reduced use of corrective regressions during mind-wandering compared to on-task reading. Results and implications from both studies are discussed in the context of mind-wandering and reading research.",

          "abstract": "Making misleading statements may benefit a politician, for example during an election campaign. However, there are potentially also negative consequences; political misinformation can taint democratic debate, voters may be misled into forming false beliefs, and being fact-checked may damage a politician’s reputation. Previous research has found that correcting misleading statements made by established politicians reduces topical misperceptions, but hardly affects voter feelings and support. Here, we examined the impact of political misinformation and fact-checking when politicians are unfamiliar. Participants (N = 406) were engaged in a simulated election campaign set in an unfamiliar country, featuring statements from fictional candidates. Participants indicated their feelings toward the candidates, cast a vote, and rated their belief in the fact-checked statements. Misleading statements that were not corrected positively affected feelings towards and voting for (right-leaning) politicians. Corrective fact-checks had large effects, reducing belief in misinformation, and fact-checked candidates were viewed much less favorably and attracted far fewer votes. This demonstrates that in the absence of strong pre-existing attitudes, corrective fact-checks can negatively impact misinformation-spreading politicians who are not (yet) well-known.",

          "abstract": "Most of the 7.1 million current global COVID deaths could likely have been prevented if the initial behavioral response in Wuhan, China had been different. Since the virus has spread globally, national death rates have varied from less than 1 to 660 deaths per 100,000. If all countries had responded like neighboring countries in Asia, half of global deaths could have been prevented. The United States with 1.2 million COVID deaths, 17% of the global total, has one of the highest COVID death rates, more than five times higher than expected from age, income, and temperature and more than six times the rate in Japan, which has more elderly. Five-year age-adjusted COVID death rates in US states vary from 66 to 410 per 100,000 in Non-Hispanic Whites, a six-fold difference. The state’s percentage of Trump votes in 2020 explains 51% of these differences, with death rates 69% higher in high vs low percentage states overall and 225% higher in 2021, the year with the most deaths. Residents of states with more Trump votes have been half as likely to be vaccinated and to practice social distancing. If the US had responded to COVID like Japan, almost a million American lives would have been saved. If all states had responded like the best Blue State, Hawaii, more than 900,000 lives would have been spared. In addition, using death certificate data, we estimate that the prevalence of Long COVID is 2.7 times higher in states with more vs less Trump votes (10.5±2.3% vs 3.8±1.2%). We discuss how three mental traits evolved through natural and sexual selection may help to explain such dysfunctional behavioral responses to life threatening danger: the tendency to form dominance hierarchies, rampant ingroup favoritism, and the often lethal combination of risk taking and overconfidence, especially in males.",

          "authors": "Joseph M. Saito; Frida Printzlau; Yvanna Yeo; Keisuke Fukuda",
          "abstract": "Items stored in visual working memory often differ in priority. Typically, observers will shift their internal attention towards items that are relevant for impending behavior and away from those that may become relevant later. These distinct states of priority are theorized to influence bidirectional interactions between memoranda and new visual inputs by modulating their susceptibility to retroactive and proactive biases, respectively. However, prior research has produced limited and conflicting evidence on this topic due to reliance on inconsistent retrodictive cues (retro-cues) that incentivize memory prioritization. To address this, we used a double-serial retro-cue paradigm that incentivized the complete prioritization of one of two unfamiliar shape memoranda for use in a comparison with a perceptual probe before a second, independent cue instructed observers to report one of their two memories (Experiments 1-2) or the perceptual probe itself (Experiment 2). We found that observers reported robust retroactive and proactive biases, but that only retroactive biases were modulated by prioritization. Reports of prioritized memories were more precise and contained smaller attractive biases towards the probe than unprioritized memories, whereas probe reports were biased comparably towards each. These findings reveal an asymmetrical effect of prioritization on the reciprocal interactions between memory and perception.",

          "abstract": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a graph, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at the semantic level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graph perception. Using functional MRI, we indeed found that graph trend judgement recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value which indexes the statistical correlation in the graph. Our work offers a first approach to the neural bases of graph perception. We suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

          "abstract": "People appreciate members of their in-group, and they cooperate with them—tendencies we refer to as in-group love. Being a member of a minority (vs. majority) is a common experience that varies both between groups in a context and within a group between contexts, but how does it affect in-group love? Across six studies, we examined when and why being in the minority boosts in-group love. In Study 1, being in the minority boosted people’s appreciation of various real-life in-groups but not out-groups. In Study 2, a real-life interaction between and within groups, people cooperated more with minority in-group (but not minority out-group) members. In Studies 3-6, we measured cooperation (Study 3, incentive-compatible), appreciation (Studies 4-6), and four mediators: perceived in-group distinctiveness, experienced in-group belongingness, expected in-group cooperation, and perceived in-group status. These four mediators independently and simultaneously explained why being in the minority boosted in-group love. In Studies 5 and 6, we observed two theoretical boundary conditions for the effect. The size of the effect was smaller when the minority in-group had many (vs. few) members (Study 5), and when the imbalance between the in-group and out-group was either low or high (here: 46% minority &amp; 54% majority, or 20% minority &amp; 80% majority) rather than moderate (here: 33% minority &amp; 67% majority). We discuss how these findings align with and build on Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (ODT) and other theoretical accounts.",

          "abstract": "Researchers often want to measure a broad variety of constructs such as anxiety, discrimination, or loneliness in text data from surveys, academic articles, interviews, social media, and electronic health records. In practice, using large language models (LLMs) remain infeasible for many researchers due to concerns around privacy, cost, compute requirements, and computational expertise, and may prefer interpretable models to avoid mistakes in high-stakes scenarios. Lexicons offer a simpler solution by counting relevant words and phrases, making them very popular in the social sciences and as baseline models in computer science.  Existing lexicons are limited because they measure a fixed set of constructs that are unlikely to cover the specific constructs of interest for a given application, resulting in low content validity. Building and validating new lexicons is resource intensive. In this study, we found that GPT-4 turbo was able to automatically create a lexicon for 49 known risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which we release as the Suicide Risk Lexicon. We used the lexicon counts to predict risk levels in crisis counseling conversations. After validating it with experts, our model outperformed the widely-used LIWC lexicon and performed similarly to deep learning models. Through feature importance analysis, we discovered that active suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and direct self-injury were stronger indicators of imminent risk than passive suicidal ideation or depressed mood. To simplify creating and validating new lexicons for any domain of research, we introduce a protocol and Python package, construct-tracker, that works with a variety of generative AI models.",

Across three pre-registered studies (N=1,779 US participants), we explored the relationship between gratitude and self-continuity–our sense of self-similarity across time. In Study 1, higher general gratitude and past-self gratitude (PSG) were associated with increased self-continuity 10 years into the past and future, with the association between gratitude and future self-continuity (FSC) significant when controlling for demographic variables and the alternative temporal dimension of self-continuity. Study 2 replicated these results in a representative US sample, finding that gratitude is linked to FSC up to 25 years ahead. Study 3 demonstrates that expressing PSG causally increases past and future self-continuity, effects not observed for gratitude towards others. Our findings suggest that individuals with higher general gratitude feel more connected to their intertemporal selves, and that promoting PSG could strengthen self-continuity, with the potential to benefit future-oriented decision-making.",

In Study 1, descriptors were developed through semi-structured interviews with 126 student volunteers (Mage=23.63±2.76) and thematic analysis, their efficacy was assessed via self-reports from 52 participants (Mage=18.73±1.50). Study 2 utilized Electrodermal Activity with 32 participants (Mage=20.15±1.98), further validated the corpus and addressed the potential demand effects.

To identify potential strategies to increase the accessibility, actionability, and reach of those resources, this study (1) determined the audiences that online suicide and NSSI resources are written for, (2) evaluated the extent to which those resources include evidence-based prevention strategies, (3) characterized how resources communicate information about suicide and NSSI, and (4) determined whether resource characteristics predicted participants’ ratings of resources. Undergraduate students (N = 366; 68% White) rated subsets of 59 suicide and NSSI resources for personal relevance, understandability, usability, approval, and likelihood of recommending that online resource. The resources were coded for specified audience demographics, evidence-based prevention strategies, and communication techniques. Results showed that most resources were written for a specified audience (61%), included evidence-based prevention strategies (100%), and had a high school or undergraduate reading level (92%). Results from linear regression analyses indicated that specified audience demographics (e.g., youth, adults), prevention strategies (i.e., support networking), and communication techniques (i.e., tone) featured in resources predicted recommendation and approval ratings. Findings demonstrate that while there are many online resources available to the public, they may not be accessible, culturally responsive, or usable. This research can inform the development of more relevant mental health resources for individuals with suicidal ideation and NSSI.",

          "authors": "David Březina",
          "abstract": "Typeface design, i.e. the way the characters from a particular font are drawn, affects the similarity and legibility of character shapes and, consequently, reading performance. Yet, character recognition and similarity studies are usually conducted with stimuli from a single font and script which makes the results difficult to generalise. This paper reports on a study conducted to examine the perceived similarity in a range of common typefaces intended for continuous reading in Cyrillic, Devanagari, and Latin scripts. A new experimental approach (contextual similarity task) was used in order to avoid stimulus presentation that would be detrimental to the quality of typeface designs (e.g. low resolution, small size, short exposure time). Participants were presented with character triplets and asked to pick the odd one out, thus judging the remaining two characters as more similar. The cognitively simple, yet challenging, task was used to obtain data that permit a more detailed and realistic enquiry of internal character representations to better understand character similarity relationships. The diverse selection of typefaces, world scripts, and participants (n=1721) challenged the robustness of the method and illustrated its transferability across world scripts. The results of comparisons across typefaces and with other studies showed that the contextual similarity task is sensitive to the effects of typeface design and elicits similarity judgements that are hard to predict using typical similarity matrices derived from tasks with pairs or individual characters. Comparison across groups of participants with different script expertise showed no significant difference in their similarity judgements.",

However, much less is known about potential costs of social interaction, such as loss of autonomy. Here, we test a potential relatedness–autonomy tradeoff by comparing feelings of connectedness and autonomy when people were socially interacting versus not. College student participants completed experience sampling method (ESM) self-reports (N = 352, 10,046 observations) of their momentary social interactions, feelings of social connectedness, autonomy, and positive affect. We found that people report lower autonomy when interacting with others compared to when alone. This is especially true for people higher in trait attachment avoidance. However, interaction partner matters: people report higher autonomy during interactions with romantic partners compared to when alone. Our study findings provide ecologically valid evidence for a tradeoff between relatedness and autonomy during social interactions with non-romantic others.",

This study investigates the role of psychedelic-induced aesthetic experiences in predicting positive psychological outcomes. Methods: Using a cross-sectional naturalistic survey, participants who had recently used classic psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD, or DMT completed measures assessing their acute experiences, including the novel Psychedelic Aesthetic Experience Questionnaire (PAEQ), the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, the Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI), and the Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). Post-experience psychological outcomes were evaluated using the Psychological Insight Scale (PIS) and general outcome measures, such as depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Results: We found significant positive correlations and predictive relationships between aesthetic experiences and emotional breakthroughs, psychological insight, mystical experiences, and general outcomes, while negative correlations and predictions were observed between aesthetic quality and challenging experiences such as fear and paranoia. Conclusions: These findings suggest that aesthetic enhancements during psychedelic sessions are associated with positive emotional engagement and cognitive shifts, which contribute to lasting psychological benefits. The inverse relationship between aesthetic quality and challenging experiences highlights the potential of optimizing the aesthetic environment during psychedelic therapy to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "While meditation research has primarily focused on mental health outcomes and immediate cognitive and affective benefits, little is known about its influence on higher-order beliefs, such as views on free will and personal agency. Despite substantial references to free will and related concepts in Buddhist philosophy, to our knowledge, there has been no empirical work investigating the relationship between intensive meditation experience and belief in free will. The current study used a quasi-experimental approach to examine the influence of an 8-week intensive meditation retreat and a podcast comparison group on free will belief (FWB; as measured using the Free Will subscale of the Free Will Inventory). FWB was measured both at the beginning and end of the retreat. First, greater experience in meditation (measured in self-reported years meditating) was negatively correlated with belief in free will at the outset, suggesting that individuals with more meditation experience tended to have lower belief in free will. Next, changes in FWB were compared between the retreat group and the podcast comparison group who had access to the same instructional content via audio recordings. Overall, there was a decrease in free will belief for the retreat group, but free will belief for the podcast comparison group remained the same. Thus, the current study provides evidence that intensive meditation is associated with lower beliefs in free will, possibly driven by the influence of meditation on phenomenology of thought and changes in perception of the self. Furthermore, the current results suggest that measuring higher-order beliefs may be especially relevant when assessing mindfulness and meditation practices in applied settings.",

However, there are a number of ways that using machine learning-based face generation and manipulation software can introduce bias into the research process, thus threatening the validity of studies. The present article provides a summary of how one class of recently popular algorithms for generating faces–generative adversarial networks (GANs)--works, how we control GANs, and where biases (with a particular focus on racial biases) emerge throughout these processes. We discuss recommendations for mitigating these biases, as well as how these concepts manifest in similar modern text-to-image algorithms.",

Then, he reviews his group’s research on L1-L2 relationships and IDs in L2 learning, focusing on their longitudinal studies and reporting two new studies that examine the relationship between L1 achievement and L2 aptitude on the MLAT. He posits that the development of L1 literacy leads to growth in metalinguistic awareness, which enhances L1 literacy skills, and that L1 literacy and metalinguistic awareness provide the foundation for L2 aptitude, the ability to use and understand “decontextualized” material.

Theoretical work has failed to note and explore the nature and role of the strong evidence for large and stable IDs in early L1 attainment in all components of language development. Extensive research has also shown that there are strong relationships among IDs in L1 achievement, L2 aptitude, and L2 achievement outcomes. More recent investigations have found that prediction from the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT), the strongest single predictor of L2 achievement, may be due largely to MLAT’s assessment of L1 abilities, reinforcing the position that IDs in L2 achievement are strongly related to and constrained by L1 achievement. Despite the evidence that students’ L2 achievement is closely related to their L1 achievement developed prior to L2 exposure, SLA/L2 researchers have largely failed to consider L1 skills as a factor that explains IDs in L2 achievement. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain why SLA/L2 researchers consider IDs in L1 attainment to be unimportant for L2 achievement.",

First, we choose to annotate all \nmultimodal behaviors (i.e., communication signals and actions) that contribute to the informational \ncontent of the interaction and its overall structure. Second, the code we provide enables multimodal \nannotated interactions to be transcribed into unique sequences, using a method that preserves the \nfollowing information: the units making up the interaction, their order of appearance, their emitter, \ntheir potential overlap (intra- and/or inter-individual) and their duration. Third, the code provides \nautomatic computation of several quantitative measures that describe the overall structure of each \ninteraction, such as overall duration, number of units, diversity of units, percentage of inter?individual overlap, percentage of intra-individual superposition or each individual \"presence\" rate during the interaction. We aim to facilitate the processing of multimodal and multi-agent interaction data, enabling large datasets and species comparisons to be handled.

The studies exploring the impact of CLIL programs on content learning are scarce and produce inconsistent results.\nAims: The current study examines the acquisition of academic content learned in a foreign language in CLIL education, when pupils are tested in the main school language.\nSample: The sample consisted of 725 sixth grade primary and twelfth grade secondary education pupils enrolled in CLIL and in non-CLIL, in French-speaking Belgium.\nMethods: Content learning was examined by collecting the end-of-curriculum official external evaluations for the participants. The external evaluation for primary pupils focused on mathematics, history and geography, sciences, and French, while it focused on history and French for secondary pupils. The particularity of these evaluations is that they are identical for all schools in French-speaking Belgium.\nResults: Although academic subjects are instructed in a foreign, non-dominant language (i.e., English or Dutch), CLIL pupils successfully achieve their school curriculum (just like non-CLIL pupils do) and are able to acquire content in a foreign language, even though the assessment takes place in the main school language (i.e., French). These results remained stable even when controlling for cognitive and demographic confounding variables.\nConclusion: CLIL pupils do not seem to be at a disadvantage for the acquisition of academic content, compared to non-CLIL pupils.",

This study aimed to adapt The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE; Wang et al., 2003) to the Romanian cultural context and to assess its reliability and validity. Employing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on a sample of adult Romanians (N = 466), we obtained a 20-item three-factor revised version that fitted the data adequately. All three scales of the revised SEE have an appropriate level of convergent and discriminant validity, as given by Average Variance Extracted coefficients (AVEs), and good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The scale was invariant across genders and age categories. Ethnocultural empathy, as measured with SEE, exhibited positive and significant correlations with general empathy, the cultural diversity within the respondents’ social network, Agreeableness and Openness to Experience, and negative correlations with Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and behavioral intentions of social distancing towards people from other racial or ethnic groups. We further proposed a 9-item short form of SEE (SEE-SF), which is a more parsimonious measure with a balanced number of items within each subscale. Both scale versions are robust measures of ethnocultural empathy with good psychometric properties. Based on these findings, we discuss the practical implications of ethnocultural empathy skills in a growing multicultural society.",

          "abstract": "Early exposure to poverty may have profound and enduring impacts on developmental trajectories over the lifespan. This study investigated potential links between childhood socioeconomic position, recent economic change, and temporal discounting in a large international cohort (N=12,951 adults from 61 countries). Temporal discounting refers to the tendency to prefer smaller immediate rewards over larger rewards delivered after a delay, and connects to consequential outcomes including academic achievement, occupational success, and risk-taking behaviors. Consistent with multiple theories about the impacts of stress exposure, individuals who reported lower socioeconomic positions in childhood exhibited greater temporal discounting in adulthood compared to peers who did not. Furthermore, an interaction emerged between childhood socioeconomic position and recent economic change, such that the steepest temporal discounting was found among those from lower childhood socioeconomic positions who also recently experienced negative economic change as a result of the COVID pandemic. These associations remained significant even when accounting for potentially confounding factors like education level and current employment. Findings provide new evidence that childhood socioeconomic position relates to greater temporal discounting and steeper devaluation of future rewards later in adulthood, particularly in response to contemporaneous economic change. This suggests childhood socioeconomic position may have longer-term impacts on developmental trajectories. Speculatively, childhood socioeconomic position may shape adult behavior through increased life stress, diminished access to resources, and lower perceived trust and reliability in social systems. These findings underscore the long-term implications of socioeconomic gaps, cycles of disadvantage and economic marginalization.",

Here, we introduce the Global-Local AtteNtional Control Evaluation (GLANCE), a novel framework designed to 1) assess both global attentional control (between-trial inhibition) and local attentional control (within-trial inhibition) in a unified task; and 2) address the task impurity problem via an accompanying computational model. Behavioral results from younger, middle-aged, and older adults (N=100; age range: 18-73) reveal significant age-related differences in global attentional control, with older adults showing less efficient adaptation to rule changes compared to younger adults. Parameter estimates from fitting the computational model to subject-level data further identified reduced error-related memory suppression as the specific mechanism that accounts for age-related differences in behavior.",

          "abstract": "Some wish to mandate preregistration as a response to the replication crisis (Vize et al., 2024), while others caution that such mandates inadvertently cause harm and distract from more critical reforms (Klonsky, 2024). In this context, I offer a three-part vision for cultivating a robust and cumulative psychological science. First, we must know how to produce robust rather than fragile findings. Key ingredients include sufficient sample sizes, valid measurement, and honesty/transparency. Second, we must know how to identify robust (and non-robust) findings. To this end, I reframe robustness checks broadly into four types: across analytic decisions, across measures, across samples, and across investigative teams. Third, we must be motivated to produce and care about robust science. This aim requires marshalling sociocultural forces to support, reward, and celebrate the production of robust findings, just as we once rewarded flashy but fragile findings. Critically, these sociocultural reinforcements must be tied as closely as possible to rigor and robustness themselves – rather than cosmetic indicators of rigor and robustness, as we have done in the past (Klonsky, 2024).",

AGI means that the machine has the ability to approach or surpass human intelligence, and its core elements include super-large-scale neural network system, sensory system and action system, as well as its own life support system to maintain the sustainable interaction of agents in the environment and the motivation system to actively optimize its own viability. The formation process of human intelligence is produced through the interactive evolution process of structure and environment, and this physical structure is abstracted into specific intelligent programs and knowledge data. The method of realizing AGI general artificial intelligence can refer to the physical structure of human intelligence, make an agent system with neural network system, sensory system and action system, and establish an agent support system to ensure the agent's sustainable interaction with the environment. At the same time, it is necessary to manually set or naturally generate an agent's motivation system with the primary goal of improving its own viability. Finally, this paper puts forward an \"AGI general artificial intelligence thought experiment\" as an example to show how to realize AGI general artificial intelligence.\nKeywords: general artificial intelligence; Human intelligence; Evolution; Thought experiment",

          "abstract": "There is growing but inconclusive evidence on the effects of motor imagery interventions in neurorehabilitation. Uncertainty regarding potential impairments in imagery ability in adults with neurological conditions may contribute to this controversy. We summarized the evidence on impairments across different aspects of motor imagery ability following Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Six databases were searched up to February 2024. Studies comparing adults with these conditions to healthy individuals were included. Two reviewers independently conducted the study selection and Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment. Motor imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation, assessed through questionnaires, mental chronometry, and mental rotation tasks respectively, were the outcomes extracted. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were applied. Fifty-two studies with low or moderate RoB were included (Stroke: n=26; TBI: n=1; PD: n=14; MS: n=11). Meta-analyses revealed small-to-moderate effects of Stroke on generation of visual and kinesthetic motor imagery, respectively. A moderate effect of PD was found only for visual motor imagery. For imagery maintenance, qualitative syntheses indicated contradictory evidence for Stroke (although it was stronger towards impairment), with PD and MS showing impairment with moderate to strong evidence. Meta-analyses showed a large and moderate effect on the accuracy measures of imagery manipulation in Stroke and PD respectively, while qualitative analysis also supported this effect in MS. For TBI, a limited number of studies impeded performing a formal synthesis of the evidence. We conclude that impairments in motor imagery ability domains are likely present in people with neurological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Much of the traditional literature on vulnerability to psychopathology is based on the diathesis-stress model. More recently, vantage sensitivity and differential susceptibility were proposed as alternative models, with all three being encompassed in the environmental sensitivity framework. While there are numerous systematic reviews on these models in children, there is limited research addressing their applicability in adulthood. This study aimed to map studies conducted within the environmental sensitivity framework in the prediction of adult mental health. Systematic scoping review reporting followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A forward reference search was employed using eight foundational environmental sensitivity articles through three databases. Thirty-four studies met inclusion criteria, and a narrative synthesis was employed to analyze the findings. The review found variability and inconsistency in testing the models of environmental sensitivity, with most studies not utilizing recommended best practices. All three models of environmental sensitivity were supported, including 53 significant and 80 non-significant interactions. Overall, childhood environments tended to show stronger support for differential susceptibility while adulthood environments showed more balanced evidence for both the differential susceptibility and diathesis-stress models. Most studies focused on genotype and internalizing behaviors, resulting in a limited understanding of person-environment interactions for other individual and mental health factors. Further research is needed to test environmental sensitivity across diverse populations and in a wider range of contexts to guide developmental theory and interventions.",

          "abstract": "Whether exposure to a novel environment in virtual reality improves subsequent verbal memory or not is still debated. The present study aims to replicate previous positive findings. To do so, we assessed whether exploration of a novel virtual environment leads to better word memory in a task performed afterwards than exploration of a familiar environment and whether this effect is related to the exploratory behavior. Fifty-five participants completed three sessions that took place on different days. The first session consisted of assessing the baseline memory performance. Participants encoded a list of 40 words and then freely recalled as many words as possible immediately after a 30-second distraction task and a 24-hour delay. In the second session, participants familiarized themselves with a virtual environment and then explored either the familiar or a novel environment before performing the same memory task with different words. In the third, participants explored the familiar or novel virtual environment (according to the counterbalancing design) before performing the memory task. Like some previous studies, our results failed to find a positive impact of exploring a novel environment (spatial novelty) on memory. Rather, we observed that recall is higher after exploring a virtual environment (regardless of it being novel or familiar) compared to the baseline performance. In fact, the experience of virtual reality might induce another type of novelty, called distinct novelty, which could impact memory too. Furthermore, our results suggest a negative correlation between age and the novelty effect, indicating the future investigation of individual factors.",

          "abstract": "In a recent study, Yu and Katz et al. (2024) argue that face-selective visual activity in the superior colliculus (SC) relies on input from the primary visual cortex (V1), based on the loss of visual responses following a temporary lesion to the lateral geniculate nucleus. We argue that alternative explanations deserve consideration. Research on visual recovery after V1 damage (Blindsight) suggests that subcortical pathways, including the SC, can contribute to face detection without V1 involvement. Additionally, the well-documented Sprague Effect, which highlights interhemispheric inhibition of SC activity following ipsilateral V1 damage, may account for the observed suppression of SC visual responses. Further investigation into these mechanisms could help clarify whether SC face detection can operate independently of V1 input.",

          "abstract": "Is a talented painter also a proficient writer? The ongoing discourse on whether creativity operates through domain-general or domain-specific mechanisms has yielded challenges in our understanding of the creative process. It is admitted that creativity comprises two phases: generation and evaluation. Recent research has proposed a new framework according to which the evaluation phase involves valuation processes upstream selection. In this framework, the value of ideas, i.e., how much one likes an idea, energizes their production and drives their selection. The role of valuation was demonstrated in verbal semantic creativity, and its domain generality remains to be tested. In this study, we assessed whether valuation is a domain-general or domain-specific process. Seventy-three participants engaged in three creativity tasks (producing semantic associations, alternative object uses, and drawings) followed by rating tasks. Computational modelling revealed a consistent valuation mechanism governing idea evaluation across domains with shared value functions and valuation parameters across word associations, object uses, and drawing completions. These findings advance our understanding of the evaluation phase of creativity, portraying it as inherently domain-general. Identifying such core components of creative ideation contributes to elucidating the cognitive mechanisms underlying creativity and provides empirical support for including valuation as a core process in creativity.",

The AQS precision correlates with symbolic mathematics scores, though with mixed findings in the literature. At the same time, there is a robust link between motor and number processing. Consequently, we explored the influence of a motor computation in symbolic mathematics scores, namely choice velocity. Results reveal that faster students in non-symbolic AQS tasks had higher mathematic scores. Moreover, the relationship was qualitatively different at 4th and 6th grade, indicating developmental changes. From these exploratory results we propose that velocity carries a decision-making signal (e.g., confidence) and that such signal may have direct or back-door access to mathematics scores. Not accounting for such signal may explain mixed results regarding the influence of the AQS on symbolic mathematics.",

          "abstract": "In cognitive psychology, simple response times are often modeled as the time required by a one-dimensional Wiener process with drift to first reach a given threshold. This stochastic process's first-passage time follows a Wald distribution, which is a specific parameterization of the inverse-Gaussian distribution. It can be shown that the Gaussian-Gamma distribution is a conjugate prior with respect to an inverse-Gaussian likelihood, albeit under a parameterization different from that of the Wald distribution. This leads to a posterior distribution that does not directly correspond to the core parameters of the Wiener process; that is, the drift-rate and the threshold parameter. While the marginal threshold posterior under a Gaussian-Gamma prior is relatively easy to derive and turns out to be a known distribution, this is not the case for the marginal drift-rate posterior. The present work addresses this issue by providing the exact marginal posterior distributions of the drift-rate parameter under a Gaussian-Gamma prior—something that has not yet been done in the literature. Unfortunately, the probability density function of this distribution cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Thus, different methods of approximation are discussed as an expedient for time-critical applications.",

Meanwhile, international research and policy agendas are targeting the sustainable development of human health and flourishing. Here we argue that these research and policy approaches are too narrow, because they largely position the health and welfare of non-human species and ecosystems as instrumental to human flourishing. In contrast, we propose a novel approach, ‘ecological-collective-flourishing’ (e-co-flourishing), to inspire research and policy that situates human flourishing within the flourishing of non-human species and more-than-human ecosystems. We begin by clarifying what flourishing is, and how it is distinguished from other common concepts in global policy agendas, such as ‘wellbeing’, ‘health’ and ‘mental health.’ We next argue that e-co-flourishing research will require a paradigm shift in research design, to include dynamic, multi-scale and multi-dimensional metrics as well as interdisciplinary hypotheses that bridge the human and non-human sciences. Finally, we motivate and illustrate the incorporation of e-co-flourishing into research and policy through a case study, The Flourish School. Our proposal offers a disruptive research and policy agenda that will require intellectual humility and interdisciplinarity, as well as cross-fertilisation of policy, publication and funding structures to succeed. We invite others to join us in progressing e-co-flourishing for the good of all living things and systems on Earth.",

There is a need to understand the factors that contribute to crash risk on WA rural roads and identify possible treatments, especially lower cost treatments that might be more broadly applied. The project aims evaluate risk factors for crashes on horizontal curves and determine whether predicting sites with future crashes is feasible. Data from crashes that occurred on curves between 2017-2021 on the rural road network were used. Risk factor assessment utilised a cross-sectional design, with 7,291 curved road segments on the State rural network identified by Main Roads. Formal generalised linear models with a negative binomial link function were used to analyse the crash data. Significant predictors of crash rate were traffic volume, curve radius, and length (positive, i.e., longer segments have more crashes). Posted speed limit was an additional significant predictor in the model for all crashes, where 110 km/h sites had a lower crash rate compared to 80 km/h sites. Additional variables found to be significantly associated with risk were carriageway, barriers, pavement width, and rainfall. Limitations with cross-sectional analyses potentially confound interpretations of some statistically significant variables, e.g., there are issues related to endogeneity with treatments like barriers that are often placed on more dangerous segments of road. Predictive ability to identify curve sites at risk at higher crashes was relatively low.",

Alignment accuracy was high for face qualia structures obtained under the fully versus poorly attended conditions but not for the letters and disks.

However, there is a lack of tools for translating verbal theories into DE systems. To facilitate this translation, we introduce SimDE, an open access R Shiny application that allows users to specify a DE model for a multivariate system and then simulate the trajectories of each variable over time. \n\nSimDE provides an interface to simulate a range of DE models, with features such as: 1) first- or second-order DEs (e.g., exponential, oscillatory), 2) models with or without a dynamic error term (ordinary or stochastic DEs), 3) models with multivariate effects (coupling dynamics). Users have the flexibility of plotting these systems in order to see the pattern of changes over time and determine the appropriateness of the model for the phenomenon they are trying to study. The goal of our app is to serve as a tool for researchers who want to explore DE models for their psychological theories before they even collect data. It can also help researchers to study the implicit assumptions of their systems defined with such DEs and further refine them as needed.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies used multi-armed bandit tasks to investigate individual differences in exploration strategies. However, the psychometric properties of these measures remain largely unexplored. We examined the test-retest reliability, convergent and divergent validity, and external validity of model-based estimates of exploration strategies. Our results revealed poor to moderate reliability, with minimal correlations for the same strategy across tasks. By refining the computational models, we identified two convergently valid latent factors representing value-guided and directed exploration. However, these factors showed no significant correlation with self-reported exploration tendencies and only weak associations with mood fluctuations. To improve future research, we suggest simplifying the computational models and using multiple tasks to more accurately model exploration strategies and mitigate spurious correlations arising from task-specific factors. A strong positive correlation with working memory and a lack of significant associations with questionnaire-based measures highlight both the potential and limitations of current behavioral paradigms in capturing exploration behavior.",

          "abstract": "Much has been learned about the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which humans and other animals navigate to reach their goals. However, most studies have involved a single, well-learned environment. By contrast, real-world wayfinding often occurs in unfamiliar settings, requiring people to combine memories of landmark locations with on-the-fly information about transitions between adjacent states. Here, we studied the strategies that support human navigation in wholly novel environments. We found that during goal-directed navigation, people use a mix of strategies, adaptively deploying both associations between proximal states (transitions) and directions between distal landmarks (vectors) at stereotyped points on a journey. Deep neural networks meta-trained with reinforcement learning to find the shortest path to goal exhibited near-identical strategies, and in doing so, developed units specialised for the implementation of vector- and transition-based strategies. These units coded for spatial positions, landmarks, and their conjunction. This suggests that optimal navigation in novel environments relies on an adaptive mix of transition- and vector-based strategies.",

The present study for the first time investigates whether childhood maltreatment is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in the context of unintended pregnancy, an event which is common and linked to a variety of potential stressors. Method: 189 individuals who either terminated (41%) an unintended pregnancy or carried it to term (59%) completed a self-report questionnaire of childhood maltreatment and a clinician-administered interview to assess lifetime trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms in the month prior to and 12 months after the end of the pregnancy. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis, t-tests, and change score analysis were conducted to investigate the interrelationships among childhood maltreatment, trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. Results: Participants most frequently reported sexual violence (25.83%), birth trauma (18.54%), or physical assault (16.56%) as their index trauma. Individuals with childhood maltreatment showed increased lifetime trauma exposure and exhibited greater PTSD symptoms 12 months after the unintended pregnancy. Childhood maltreatment did not predict a change in PTSD symptoms from pre- to post-pregnancy.\nConclusions: Childhood maltreatment is linked to increased PTSD symptoms that persist up to one year after an unintended pregnancy. These results have clinical implications for the inclusion of trauma-informed practices into reproductive care.",

The VTC exhibited axis-based feature coding, and by constructing a neural feature space using VTC neural axes, we observed that MTL neurons encode a receptive field within the VTC neural feature space. This computational framework explains how dense feature-based representations in the VTC are translated into sparse semantic-based representations in the MTL.

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable negative events yield increased stress responses compared to situations over which we have control. Previous studies have assessed the impact of uncontrollability of threat on stress reactivity. Less is known about whether and how acute stress exposure influences how we react to uncontrollable threats. Until now, research has primarily focused on investigating the lack of control despite the idea that losing control may cause greater distress and be more clinically relevant. The current study aims to investigate whether acute stress exposure impacts reactivity to a subsequent loss of control over threat. Ninety-six participants will be equally and randomly allocated to a stress or a no-stress group. Participants will undergo an acute stress induction or a non-stressful procedure, followed by a behavioral loss-of-control task. The loss-of-control task is designed to effectively induce control followed by a subsequent loss of control over aversive electrical stimulation. We hypothesize that participants exposed to acute stress will show stronger biological and psychological responses to the loss of control over threat than those in the no-stress group, as expressed in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase assays, blood pressure measurements, and self-report ratings. In addition, we will assess biological sex, general perceived stress, and childhood adversity as factors that might moderate the relation between acute stress exposure and reactivity to loss of control. Investigating the sensitizing effect of acute stress on the reaction to a loss of control could offer valuable insights into their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",

This systematic review explored the extent to which individual characteristics are examined in AR research as predictors to further review if and how AR research in STEM education follows an ATI approach. Our findings reveal that from 2013 to 2022, k = 38 studies investigated the role of individual variables as predictors with only k = 5 studies considering how individual differences interact with AR vs. non-AR conditions. We discuss possible reasons for this gap and propose solutions, offering a study design framework to conduct AR studies considering the ATI perspective.",

          "abstract": "Background: Residual cognitive complaints are frequently observed in remitted depressed individuals (RMD), which can impair full recovery and increase the likelihood of recurrent episodes of depression. Cognitive control training has shown potential as a preventative intervention in RMD with small to moderate effect sizes, but substantial heterogeneity in effects between individuals exists. \nObjective: This study aimed to identify individual characteristics associated with treatment response to CCT in RMD participants using machine learning models.\nMethods: A sample of 225 RMD participants underwent a CCT regimen of at least ten training sessions. After splitting the dataset into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%), four models were evaluated: logistic regression, random forest classifier, random classifier, and majority class classifier. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were computed. The importance of individual features in predicting preventative effects was assessed using standardized coefficients from the logistic regression model.\nResult: The logistic regression model demonstrated the highest performance among the models, although this was still considered to be low (accuracy: 0.58; AUC-ROC: 0.56). Exploratory feature importance analysis revealed that higher life satisfaction and effective coping strategies were positively associated with preventative effects, while current medication use, age and sense of well-being were negatively associated. \nConclusion: All models performed quite poorly, indicating that baseline RMD participant characteristics did not confidently predict CCT preventative effects. Exploratory feature analysis proposed some variables that increase the likelihood of benefiting from CCT. However, it also indicated that amount of prior depressive episodes and treatments did not affect preventative effects, suggesting that CCT may be suitable for a broad range of RMD individuals. In addition to substantiating our findings with larger sample sizes to improve model accuracy, future research should explore additional predictors.",

Here, we introduce a straightforward method for creating short versions of existing measures that are able to accurately determine participants’ sum scores, subscale scores, or factor scores. Our method, referred to as Factor Score Item Reduction with Lasso Estimator (FACSIMILE) uses lasso regularised regression to select items and weight them such that true scores can be predicted accurately from a reduced item set.

By critically examining how these effects operate within psychedelic experiences, we aim to draw greater attention to the role of suggestion effects as both a source of bias but also as a tool that can be leveraged to maximize therapeutic benefits.

Since post-acute effects are crucial for the therapeutic use of psychedelics, an instrument to systematically assess subacute \"afterglow\" effects is needed.\nAims:\nTo create and validate a questionnaire to quantify subacute \"afterglow\" effects of psychedelics.\nMethods: \nAn international online survey was conducted in English and German. Participants who had consumed a psychedelic (N = 1,323) or another non-psychedelic substance (control group, N = 157) within the past four weeks were included. An initial list of 97 items was progressively reduced to 24 items.\nResults: \nA 5-factor structure best fit the data and showed high internal consistency. The factors included 1) Vitality, 2) Transpersonal Aspects, 3) Inspiration/Creativity, 4) Interpersonal Relationships, and 5) Relationship to Nature. The final 24-item version of the Afterglow Inventory (AGI) effectively differentiated between the psychedelic group and the control group. The overall AGI score positively correlated with the intensity (r = 0.165; p &lt; 0.001) and positive valence (r = 0.251; p &lt; 0.001) of the acute psychedelic effects.\nConclusions: \nThe AGI is a novel scale for quantifying positive subacute (\"afterglow\") effects of psychedelics. The use of the AGI could lead to a better understanding of the interplay between acute, subacute, and long-term effects of psychedelics.

          "abstract": "Decades of research have shown that adversity tends to be associated with lower working memory (WM) performance. This literature has mainly focused on impairments in the capacity to hold information available in WM for further processing. However, some recent adaptation-based studies suggest that certain types of adversity can leave intact, or even enhance, the ability to rapidly update information in WM. One key challenge is that WM capacity and updating tasks tend to covary, as both types of tasks require the creation and maintenance of bindings in WM; links between mental representations of information in WM. To estimate the associations between adversity and different processes in WM, we need to isolate variance in performance related to WM capacity from variance in performance related to updating ability. In this Registered Report, participants from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel completed three WM tasks: two complex span tasks and a task measuring both binding and updating of information. In addition, we estimated participants’ exposure to neighbourhood threat, material deprivation, and unpredictability. We estimated associations between the three types of adversity and latent estimates of WM capacity and updating using structural equation modeling. We did not find consistent associations between adversity and WM capacity or updating, nor did we find evidence that the associations were practically equivalent to zero. Our results show that adversity researchers should account for overlap in WM tasks when estimating specific WM abilities.",

This review synthesizes decades of neuroimaging research that investigated the representational spaces in the visual ventral stream for objects, such as tools, that are specifically characterised by action-related properties. Overall, results reveal a dissociation between representational spaces in ventral and lateral occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). While lateral OTC encodes both visual (shape) and action-related properties of objects, distinguishing between objects acting as end-effectors (e.g., tools, hands) versus similar non-effector manipulable objects (e.g., a glass), ventral OTC primarily represents objects’ visual features such as their surface properties (e.g., material and texture). These areas act in concert with regions outside of OTC to support object interaction and tool use. The parallel investigation of the dimensions underlying object representations in artificial neural networks reveals both the possibilities and the difficulties in capturing the action-related dimensions that distinguish tools from other objects. While artificial neural networks offer promise as models of visual cortex computations, challenges persist in replicating the action-related dimensions that go beyond mere visual features. Taken together, we propose that regions in occipitotemporal cortex support the representation of tools based on a behaviorally relevant action code and suggest future paths to generate a computational model of this object space.",

It plays a crucial role in information processing and is disrupted in various neuropsychiatric conditions. In humans, non-invasive measurements of brain excitability have been mostly limited to the primary motor cortex. Here, the response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is quantified as the magnitude of the muscular contraction. TMS mapping of brain excitability outside the motor cortex, simultaneously across brain areas, and in deep regions is challenging. Indeed, TMS has little depth penetration, and can only probe one cortical point at a time. Furthermore, the measurement of the responses to stimuli outside the motor cortex requires simultaneous neuroimaging, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Possible solutions include the application of stimulation approaches alternative to TMS, and the investigation of resting state properties of electromagnetic and hemodynamic brain activity. We show that, in combination with TMS or alone, neuroimaging will progressively allow non-invasive and accurate mapping of excitability with high spatio-temporal resolution, across the entire brain, and non-invasively.

          "abstract": "Online participant recruitment is a cornerstone of modern psychology research. While this offers clear benefits for studying individual differences in cognitive abilities, test performance can vary across lab-based and web-based settings. Here we assess the stability of normative test scores across popular online recruitment platforms and in-person testing, for three standard measures of face identity processing ability: the GFMT2, CFMT+, and MFMT. Participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) scored approximately 10 percentage points lower in all tests compared to those recruited through Prolific and university students tested in the lab. Applying stricter exclusion criteria based on attention checks resulted in notably higher exclusion rates for the MTurk group (~62%) compared to the Prolific group (~22%), yet even after exclusion, some test scores remained lower for MTurk participants. Given that the GFMT2 subtests were developed using MTurk participants, we provide updated normative scores for all subtests (GFMT2-Short, GFMT2-Low, GFMT2-High) and further recommendations for their use. We also confirm the robust psychometric properties of the GFMT2-Short and GFMT2-High, demonstrating strong test-retest reliability, convergent validity with other established tests, and high diagnostic value in identifying super-recognisers. The GFMT2 subtests are freely available for use in both online and in-person research via www.gfmt2.org.",

First of all, this paper discusses the essence of consciousness, puts forward the theoretical framework of subject angle, and points out that consciousness is the content change of subject angle, which corresponds to the structural change of entity one by one. Then, through concrete examples, such as animal conscious neural network, this paper expounds in detail how consciousness is related to the main structure, neural network structure and the objective world. Finally, this paper discusses the model of conscious intelligence, pointing out that conscious intelligence is a model in which multi-cells cooperate with the whole feedback to record natural change data and form a data structure model, so that changes can be predicted in advance to avoid disadvantages through data structure model reasoning, and the analysis and conception of CIFM(Conscious Intelligence Feedback Model) are put forward.\nKeywords:Consciousness；Subjective Perspective；Conscious neural network；Conscious Intelligent Feedback Model",

We begin by rehearsing the Free Energy Principle and Predictive Processing as foundational frameworks which subserve and inform the thesis that follows. The following sections examine three aspects of archetypes: the affective core rooted in subcortical systems, archetypal imagery emergent in altered states such as psychedelic experiences, and archetypal stories encoded in higher cortical areas. Specifically, we propose a trilogical interplay between high-level cortex, low-level cortex, and subcortical/affective systems in instantiating these archetypal phenomena. We then explore how archetypes may be transmitted between individuals, developing into a collective unconscious through social learning and subsequent attunement. Throughout, we provide syntheses of Jungian psychology with contemporary neuroscience, offering testable hypotheses regarding the neurological bases of archetypal phenomena. We conclude with discussing implications for both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific research. By bridging these disciplines, we aim to lend construct validity to Jungian concepts and encourage further empirical investigation of archetypes and the collective unconscious.",

          "authors": "Yang Xiang; Kevin Matthew Dorst; Samuel J. Gershman",
          "abstract": "The gambler’s fallacy is typically defined as the false belief that a random event is less likely to occur if it has occurred recently, even when the probability of the event is known to be independent across trials. While forms of this fallacy have been documented numerous times, past work suffers from two problems. First, most studies have not actually measured probabilistic predictions (“60% likely to be heads”), but rather point predictions (“Heads”). Second, the few studies that did measure probabilistic beliefs used sequences that were not independent, and therefore not a strong test of the fallacy. To address these problems, we conducted a series of high-powered, preregistered studies. We asked participants to report probabilistic predictions for truly independent sequences. In contrast to point predictions, which (as in previous research) generated a significant gambler’s fallacy, we found no evidence for a gambler’s fallacy in probabilistic predictions. Moreover, the point predictions could not be reconstructed by sampling from the probability judgments. This suggests that the gambler’s fallacy originates at the decision stage rather than in probabilistic reasoning, as posited by several leading theories. In a separate experiment, we replicate the results of a previous study showing a small gambler’s fallacy for probabilistic predictions with non-independent sequences. However, to the extent that the gambler’s fallacy manifests for probabilistic predictions, it seems to be driven by a small proportion of the participants. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the gambler’s fallacy is real and robust for point predictions, but not for probabilistic predictions with independent sequences. New theories of the gambler’s fallacy may be needed to explain these findings.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive impairments have been observed in patients with depression. These include deficits in inhibition, shifting, and updating; cognitive processes that are critical for goal-directed control over behavior (‘model-based planning’). But despite this, research investigating model-based planning in depression has itself been mixed. We aimed to address this by taking a within-person approach, examining model-based planning before and after a range of effective treatments for depression.\nMethod: Across two parallel studies, participants completed a two-step reinforcement learning paradigm before and after antidepressant medication, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) or intravenous (IV) ketamine infusion. In experiment 1, 93 patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to a single dose of IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or IV saline (50 mL 0.9% NaCl). In Experiment 2, 781 participants were followed for four weeks of antidepressant (N=83), or iCBT (N=611) treatment. N=87 participants without any psychiatric diagnosis were followed as a control group.\nResults: In both experiments, depressive symptoms significantly improved in treatment groups compared to their corresponding control groups, but model-based planning did not change. Moreover, individual differences in model-based planning did not predict differential response to ketamine, iCBT or antidepressant treatments. Individual differences in model- based planning at baseline were associated with compulsivity, but not depression symptoms.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that model-based planning is not necessarily compromised in depression and does not improve following treatments. This result provides evidence for the trait-like nature of model-based planning and underscores the specificity of its relation to disorders of compulsivity.",

We used confirmatory factor analysis to assess two theoretically derived factor models, exploratory factor analysis to identify possible alternative factor models, and reliability estimates to assess internal consistency. Neither of the theoretically derived models were a good fit for any of the nine datasets, and we were unable to identify any better fitting multidimensional models. Internal consistency metrics were acceptable in six of the nine datasets, but these metrics are difficult to interpret given the uncertain factor structures.

          "abstract": "Introduction. Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (LTI) is often accompanied by feelings of fear, uncertainty, and loneliness that can severely impact mental health. Relatively few interventions are available to address the existential concerns of individuals facing LTI, while treatment of the underlying physical ailment typically remains the priority of the healthcare system. Research has shown that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAT) holds promise for supporting mental health in people with LTIs. However, PAT’s potential in this population remains curtailed by several limitations, including regulatory and accessibility issues. Novel approaches that could provide some of the benefits of psychedelic experiences, while avoiding associated challenges, would therefore be highly desirable for supporting the mental well-being of people with LTIs. Among such interventions, VR-based experiences have been suggested as a promising candidate. We here evaluate a program that includes weakly representational, multi-user VR experiences based on a design aesthetic previously described as “numadelic”, which has been demonstrated to elicit self-transcendent experiences comparable to psychedelics.\nMethods. A prospective cohort study design was used to assess the effects of “Clear Light” (CL) a group-based, 6-session multimedia program that included VR experiences, video calls, and text chats spanning 3 weeks. Participants were individuals suffering from LTIs that self-selected to participate in the CL program. A total of N=15 participants were evaluated based on assessments one week before and after the program, using self-report measures of anxiety, depression, well-being, and secondary psychological outcomes. \nResults. The intervention was well-tolerated among participants. Significant improvements with moderate effect sizes were observed on self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, and well-being. Secondary measures assessing demoralization, connectedness, and spiritual well-being also showed significant improvements. \nDiscussion. This observational study demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of a group-based VR program that can be delivered at-home to people suffering from LTIs. While conclusions are presently limited by the lack of randomization or a comparison group, our findings strongly suggest further research is warranted, including randomized controlled trials.",

The assumption requires researchers to determine a set of observed covariates which then successfully removes all the confounding bias. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide (automatized) guidance for selecting an adjustment set of covariates. However, before one can select the covariates a valid causal DAG about the presumed data-generating process of the data in hand must be drawn. But published guidance on how to draw a valid causal DAG is at best still incomplete. This article introduces and discusses a stepwise procedure for drawing DAGs for causal inference.",

          "abstract": "Reward processes can reinforce extinction learning and aide cognitive processes involved with inhibitory learning. Anhedonia, characterized by deficits in reward incentivization, hedonic response, and learning, may therefore predict worse treatment outcomes. However, there are few existing studies of reward processes or anhedonia in predicting exposure-based treatment outcomes, and results are mixed. The current study examined associations between pretreatment self-reported anhedonia and several measures of anxiety symptom severity and treatment outcomes among patients who sought exposure-based treatment. Consistent with hypotheses, pretreatment anhedonia severity was associated with higher pretreatment anxiety symptom severity across a wide range of measures. However, inconsistent with hypotheses, higher anhedonia scores were associated with greater symptom improvement across treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Additionally, anhedonia was not significantly associated with disorder-general measures of treatment outcomes, or disorder-specific treatment outcomes for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or post-traumatic anxiety disorder. Thus, pretreatment anhedonia is not an obstacle for beginning exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. More broadly, results highlight challenges in translating laboratory research to naturalistic clinical settings and the need for intensive longitudinal studies that can assess the role of reward processes in exposure therapy systematically across treatment.",

          "authors": "Jovan T Kemp; Dhanraj Vishwanath; Fulvio Domini",
          "abstract": "A major focus of research in sensory perception is the nature and source of errors in perceptual judgements. A dominant assumption in the field, originating in work on 3D perception, is that the variability in perceptual judgements measured by discrimination thresholds is due to sensory uncertainty (random error in the internal sensory estimate), and that cue integration acts to minimise this sensory uncertainty. In three experiments, we use a simple modification to the standard forced-choice paradigm in a sensory discrimination task to show that, contrary to the widespread assumption, variability in 3D perceptual discrimination tasks is determined by sensory bias (systematic error in the sensory estimate) and late-stage task-related uncertainty (random error in processes following the sensory estimate), rather than early-stage sensory uncertainty. Experiment 1 examined depth discrimination for 3D stimuli specified by low- and high-quality texture cues, where the fixed standard and variable comparison stimuli could be specified by either the same or different texture cues. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure for both disparity alone and a combination of texture and disparity. Experiment 3 tested this same discrimination task for motion or disparity while also measuring the perceptual function for each cue. In all experiments, we found that discrimination thresholds were best explained by the combination of sensory bias and task-related uncertainty, and—critically—not by sensory uncertainty. Our results bring into question the role of sensory uncertainty in perceptual error, and, in turn, what characterizes optimal cue integration.",

Some studies have shown how eye movement alterations can be associated with MS, but there are significant differences in methodology between the available studies. \nInclusion criteria: Studies that fulfil the following criteria regarding the participants, concept, and context framework will be included:  recruitment of MS patient over 18 years of age, any eye-tracking paradigm, any context. No restrictions on study design, publication type, or data will be applied at the very beginning of the literature search.\nMethods: This scoping review will be performed in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases will be searched up to October 2024. Additional papers will be detected by searching the grey literature and reference lists of all pertinent studies included in the review. The decision to include or exclude studies will be made by two reviewers working independently. The reviewers will undertake a thorough examination of all titles, abstracts, and full-text studies. The research team will endeavour to extract the characteristics of the included studies through a data collection form that has been created for this purpose.

Our findings reveal that even at this early age, children’s drawings indicate an accurate differentiation of several functions, including linear and non-linear ones, and an understanding of linearity and curvature. Furthermore, both age groups displayed intuitions of compositionality by distinguishing, for example, sinusoid functions with an increasing amplitude from those with a decreasing or a constant one. All children had difficulties with more complex patterns, such as those involving changes in both amplitude and frequency, as in stair-like patterns. Our results highlight children’s early understanding of proto-mathematical concepts and the potential of drawing as a powerful tool to assess them in a concrete context.",

Despite their pervasive nature, multi-scale dynamics are poorly understood. We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision maker’s ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence-accumulation process with sub-second range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus-history, error-related, and hard-easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multi-scale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.",

The task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with MAIN are modulated by a range of tasks, and we present seven here. For each task, we report: (1) highly specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing MAIN from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with MAIN across a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to MAIN as follows: (1) Left-Lateralized Upper Triangle, (2) Left-Lateralized Lower Triangle, (3) Right-Handed Crab Claw, (4) Found a Peanut. Evidence for MAIN was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes for following tasks: autobiographical event simulation, verbal working memory, non-verbal working memory, thought generation, task-switching, self-reference, and semantic association. Inspection of the task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with MAIN, over the range of tasks mentioned above, consistently supported the cognitive mode interpretation of maintaining attention to internal mental representations.",

Not surprisingly, more experience correlates with higher salaries.\nAcademic Degree: A university degree is often required in the U.S. and France, though less so in the other countries. A degree generally enhances salary prospects, but work experience has a larger impact.\nSalary Transparency is inconsistent, with only one-third of ads including salary details, mostly from NYT and CNN. Annual salaries range from $16k for entry level to $300k for a senior producer at CNN.\nDiversity: U.S. and Australian outlets are leading in addressing diversity, with many job ads including statements about inclusivity across gender, ethnicity, religion, and disability.\n\nThe report provides a guide for aspiring journalists, educators, and news professionals, offering insights into the industry’s expectations.",

          "abstract": "From self-checkouts to self-driving cars to social media newsfeed to surveillance systems, artificial intelligence (AI) is part of our lives whether we know it or not. Recent scholarship is attempting to explore how different places and people are involved in the development of AI. This chapter builds on this scholarship to extend the debate around the hidden and opaque networks of sub- contracting practices for AI training. In particular, it examines the ways in which lead firms develop their AI systems by tapping into a complex network of suppliers, platforms, and human workers doing data work in some of the most marginalised parts of the world. The chapter shows that despite their touted nature as autonomous machines (i.e. without human control), AI is dependent on a global army of human labour performing a wide variety of data enrichment tasks. It then concludes by discussing implications of this data work on workers and places where AI gets trained.",

          "abstract": "Current approaches to engaging First Nations peoples in urban policy and planning are placing an unreasonable and unsustainable burden, especially on Traditional Custodians, new AHURI research finds. A change of relationship with Traditional Custodians and a rethinking of current engagement approaches could create a more responsible process.\n\nThe research, ‘Voicing First Nations Country, culture and community in urban policy’, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from University of Sydney, RMIT University and University of NSW, examines the relationship of First Nations peoples in Australia to urban policy, and is designed to centre First Nations sovereignty, authority, knowledge, governance and agency as the starting point toward a more responsible relationship.\n\nUrban places, from large metropolitan areas to small towns in regional areas, are sites of intensive dispossession at the same time as being dense networks of community and ongoing cultural practice and connection. Nevertheless, urbanisation and the density of population settlement, private property and the miasma of legislation, policy and regulation imposed on Country hasn’t destroyed First Nations Traditional Custodians connection to ancestral lands or their cultural obligations and rights to lands and waters.\n\nGovernments are asking local planners and developers to consult with First Nation Traditional Custodians with some level of engagement. This has the effect of intensifying pressure on Custodians, with short timeframes and often unrealistic expectations imposed upon First Nations communities.\n\nUrban policy planning can be a tool for healing and repair between First Nations people and the broader Australian community. Engagement can be used to create new opportunities—but current engagement approaches require rethinking and need to include building longer term relationships, long before a project requires engagement. Building and sustaining relationships and creating new processes and models must be supported with resources structures that are secure, ongoing and transcend piecemeal project-by-project funding.",

          "abstract": "This study explores whether procedurally just interactions between police and citizens enhance perceptions of police legitimacy in high-crime environments. We conducted a representative in-person survey across five major Colombian cities, covering about 7 million residents. The survey included a vignette experiment presenting respondents with one of four scenarios that varied police officer respectfulness—characterized by clear communication of intentions—and neutrality. Our findings reveal that respectful behavior from officers significantly boosts citizens' perceptions of police legitimacy. In contrast, neutrality alone, or even combined with respect, does not affect these perceptions. This suggests that respect is an important component of procedural justice in fostering police legitimacy, while the standalone importance of neutrality is questionable. Policymakers should note that emphasizing respectful interactions in police training can foster greater trust and cooperation within communities, aiding effective crime prevention and community policing efforts. Conversely, focusing solely on neutrality without ensuring respect may be insufficient, possibly due to citizens' biases toward specific stereotypes.",

Our analysis points to strong complementarities between more and better policing: more interactions that lack good behavior or good behavior without increased interactions do not improve trust. We find no impacts on officers’ trust in citizens or beliefs about public trust, implying that institutional change may require more profound efforts.",

          "authors": "Francesco Molteni; Arianna Pellicciotti",
          "abstract": "Perceived discrimination is the feeling of belonging to a group targeted by discrimination. This paper examines three mechanisms identified in the literature that contribute to this perception among migrants: exposure to actual discrimination through social contacts, language proficiency and awareness, and unmet aspirations. Using a subset of the European Social Survey dataset, which includes approximately 45,000 first- and second-generation migrants, we analyse the effects of individual characteristics (migrant generation, language skills, social contacts, education, and training) and contextual characteristics (integration policies) on perceived discrimination. Our findings reveal the existence of an \"Integration Paradox,\" particularly for Muslim migrants. More integrated Muslim migrants, especially those from the second generation, report higher levels of perceived discrimination. We also find that the integration setting does not have a direct effect but moderates the relationship between migrant generation and perceived discrimination. Notably, second-generation Muslim migrants feel most discriminated against in countries with \"intermediate\" levels of integration policies, suggesting short-term unintended consequences of such policies. These findings underscore the importance of paying close attention to this group in the present and near future, especially given their steadily increasing presence in European societies.",

Based on video-recordings of mealtimes, a mixed-method approach was adopted to analyze 539 moments of educator-child interactions. The results suggest diverse educator-child interaction patterns mediating children’s inclusion. In educator-child interactions, children’s diverse agency for participation is considered by educators. Educators’ approaches to diversity suggest their open attitudes towards inclusion which are not limited to ethnicity but relate to children’s individual needs. During moments of tension within educator-child interactions, children’s agency contributes to transform educators’ attitudes towards inclusion. However, there seems to be a tendency to understand equality as uniformity which contradicts the core principle of equity of social justice in multicultural inclusive education.",

          "abstract": "Social disasters, whether natural or human-made, disrupt daily life and create opportunities for competing ideological movements to assert themselves. This study examines these dynamics in the context of anti-Asian hate speech and counter-hate speech on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the COVID-HATE dataset comprising approximately 2.5 million tweets shared between January 15, 2020 to March 26, 2021, we develop and test a framework for analyzing racial framing contests between movements and counter-movements. Through a mixed-methods approach, we find that: (1) the WHO's pandemic declaration triggered a significant increase in anti-Asian hate tweets, with counter-hate tweets emerging in response; (2) hate frames deployed racial projects characterizing Asians as public health and national security threats, while counter-frames either directly challenged these characterizations or bypassed them to focus on systemic racism; and (3) hate and counter-hate movements often \"spoke past\" each other rather than engaging in direct frame-counterframe dynamics as prevailing theories would predict. Counter-movements did not consistently produce opposing frames for each hate frame but rather developed independent messaging focused on combating racism itself. This study advances our understanding of how both hate and resistance operate through racial projects, with implications for theories of social movements, political communication, and racial formation. Our findings highlight the need to examine not just the temporal relationship between movements and counter-movements, but also the underlying racial projects that shape their strategic framing.",

Including stepfather families with coresident children, most prior research has studied the role of (step)parent-child relationship quality (e.g., closeness). This study compares the relevance of biological parent and stepparent involvement for children’s well-being, including stepmother and stepfather families, while accounting for children’s residence. Multiple regression analyses were conducted using the New Families in the Netherlands (NFN) survey, large-scale data collected among divorced and separated parents with minor children (2015/16; N = 3218). Involvement in routine activities was not associated with children’s well-being. Biological parent and stepparent involvement in interactive activities was positively associated with well-being, except when biological parent involvement was (too) frequent. Children, on average, benefited equally from the interactive involvement of both parent types. Biological parent involvement had a stronger positive association with child well-being than stepparent involvement only when involvement was rare. Yet, when involvement was (overly) frequent, stepparent involvement was related to better well-being, with the opposite effect for biological parents. These findings are consistent between stepmother and stepfather families. This study, overall, indicates that interactive activities are important to the well-being of most children, whether undertaken by biological parents or stepparents.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics and factors affecting immigrant residential segregation in Japan between 2000 and 2020, a period marked by Japan's emergence as a global immigrant destination. Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants. The results provide support for this dichotomy in segregation trends, underlining the integration challenges for minority groups in global new destinations and the pronounced self-segregation among elite skilled minorities.",

The aim is to explore how gaga feminism’s aesthetics of\ncollapse, creative anarchy and experimentation can construct new constellations of\nageing, sexuality and gender. We have conducted a critical, contextualised reading\nof a selection of cultural artefacts that express various elements of a gaga aesthetic.\nOur analysis reflects on the three central principles of gaga, specifically (1) new\nforms of social relations and sexualities, (2) more fluid articulations of gender and (3)\ncreative anarchy; and on what they can mean for an anti-ageist project in media and\nvisual culture. In this way, this article offers insights into the creative and unruly ways\nin which ageism, heteronormativity and sexism can be subverted and destabilised in\nrepresentations.",

The prevalence of these groups were shown across waves, then waves were pooled and multinomial regression models were used to show age-adjusted differences in demographic, socioeconomic, health and care characteristics across the five care groups. \nResults: 2% of the UK adult population provide sandwich care . Parents caring for someone in the generation above were generally employed in professional/managerial occupations and cared less intensively outside the household while parents caring for a disabled child or partner were disadvantaged in terms of education and income, and tended to care intensively inside the household. \nConclusion: It is important to recognise circumstances of care groups are heterogenous when designing policies and practice to support family carers.",

          "abstract": "This article develops an analytical and methodological field guide for analyzing the practices and politics of machine learning. Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), it seeks to move beyond the opacity/transparency dichotomy that often characterizes discussions of algorithmic systems. In doing this, the article hones in on actors’ mundane practices of constructing machine learners, and develops an analytical stance based on four empirical moments: feature extraction, vectorization, clustering, and data drift. By making visible actors’ work, tinkering, and negotiations involved in these processes, the article aims to demystify the supposed magic of machine learning. This approach allows us to ask: How do actors decide what constitutes a good machine learner? How are things, people, and phenomena translated into the mathematical worlds of machine learning? Through ethnographic attention to these questions, we can begin to grapple with the practices and politics of machine learning in earnest. Thus, the article contributes to ongoing discussions about the societal implications of AI by providing analytical and methodological tools for understanding how the politics of machine learning is assembled in practice.",

This study examines Finnish primary classroom teachers’ perceptions of inclusive education and its relationship relative to separate special education settings in Finland. Thematic analysis is used to analyse interview data collected from five mainstream classroom teachers and five special education classroom teachers working in two regular schools and one special education school. Results suggest that “education for all” in the same class is a shared value among classroom teacher participants. However, mainstream and special education classroom teachers’ views are in conflict in terms of inclusive practices. While mainstream classroom teachers are concerned with pupils’ academic learning, special education classroom teachers are relegated to pedagogies of differentiation in separate and segregated settings. For education to become truly inclusive, more expertise on inclusive pedagogies must be integrated into future teacher training programs, in order to improve mainstream classroom teachers’ commitment to inclusion.",

In this research note, I provide an updated analysis using two independent data sources: the 2018 Guatemalan Census and annual estimates of undocumented Guatemalan arrivals to the United States from The Center for Migration Studies (CMS). Using descriptive and regression analyses, findings show a close alignment between apprehensions, household migrations reported in the Guatemalan census, and Guatemalan arrival estimates. Together, these results indicate that apprehensions remain a reliable indicator of migration flow despite recent changes in migration dynamics along the southern U.S. border.",

With a qualitative content analysis of the guidelines of ANP, AP, Reuters, NPPA and WPP and interviews with image editors of ANP, WPP, De Volkskrant, NOS and De Correspondent, two questions are answered: 1. What are the functions of image editing guidelines in journalistic organizations, based on the guidelines themselves and the explanations given by the authors? 2. What are the possible consequences for photojournalists and the public if these functions conflict? The analysis shows that the boundary work function strongly conflicts with the governance function and accountability function. Guidelines for image editing in photojournalism reinforce the myth that ‘news photos are objective’ for the purpose of defining the field of photojournalism (boundary work). As a result, guidelines do not function as well as a quality assurance tool and as a media accountability system, with adverse consequences for photojournalists and the public.",

          "authors": "Helen Tibboel; Kevin Pijpers; Gwen de Bruin; Semiha Denktas",
          "abstract": "The distribution of research funding in academia is not equitable. There is a disproportionate allocation of funding benefitting an academic elite, whereas researchers from different marginalized groups have fewer opportunities to obtain funding. This can be changed by exploring alternative ways to allocate research funding. One way in which funding agencies have tried to stimulate research based on more equitable principles is the sandpit model. A sandpit is an intensive, multi-day brainstorming event during which different consortia are formed. These consortia are subsequently required to compete to obtain research funding. Very little research is done on how and whether such models work. There is some evidence that, under the right circumstances, models such as the sandpit can stimulate multidisciplinary research with societal impact. However, no attention has been given to the question whether these models contribute to equity within the academic world, or whether they sustain the inequities that are prominent. Within this paper, we critically examine possible mechanisms of exclusion through an in-depth study of a sandpit event, and we discuss which groups are disadvantaged by these events. Furthermore, we suggest ways in which sandpits and other funding initiatives can be made more equitable.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between income and voter turnout is crucial to understanding U.S. democracy. Previous research finds that richer people tend to vote at higher rates than lower-income people. But this research relies on survey data and is subject to response and social desirability bias, producing widely varying estimates of the size of the income-based turnout gap. Using data with official, geocoded, precinct election results for the entire nation, we examine how precinct-level income is associated with changes in voter turnout between the 2016 and 2020 elections. We find a dramatic income gradient in precinct voter turnout, and that this inequality became larger in 2020 compared to 2016. When comparing top decile precincts to bottom decile precincts (&gt;$121k vs &lt;$38k), we estimate a turnout gap of 17 percentage points in 2016 and 27 percentage points in 2020. These results are robust in regression analysis controlling for critical features and spatial dependence.",

          "authors": "Amanda Hughes; Elisabeth Grey; Alice Haigherty; Fayth Shepherd; Fiona Gillison; Rebecca Langford",
          "abstract": "Introduction\nWeight is the most common reason for being bullied at school - far more common than other targets for bullying such as ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Research suggests weight bias and stigma - including negative beliefs, attitudes, and discriminatory behaviours related to a person’s weight - is prevalent in educational settings among both pupils and staff.\nMost schools have anti-bullying policies with best practice suggesting policies should explicitly identify forms of unacceptable behaviour, such as racism or homophobia.  \nWe conducted an audit of secondary schools in southwest England to determine if/how they mention weight-related bullying in their policies. \nMethods\nWe obtained lists of all secondary mainstream state, private, and specialist schools in seven local authorities and downloaded anti-bullying policies from their websites. Policies were searched for key words related to weight and size. We also recorded whether policies mentioned appearance or other key targets for bullying, such as race, religion, sexuality etc. We obtained school level data including size, gender mix, academic performance and quality ratings. \nResults\nFrom 255 schools with an available bullying or behaviour policy, only 6.7% specifically mentioned weight-related bullying. Just under half (48.6%) mentioned bullying in relation to appearance. Bullying was most often mentioned in relation to race/ethnicity (94.5%), sexual orientation (93.3%), gender (85.9%), religion (84.9%), or gender identity (67.5%). Private schools (N=40) were more likely to mention weight-based bullying (17.5%) than mainstream state schools (N=148, 6.1%).  No specialist schools, whether state (N=41) or private (N=26), mentioned bullying in their policies. There was no strong evidence that other school characteristics made a difference, but small numbers limited the power of these comparisons. \nConclusion\nThere is a significant mismatch between the prevalence of weight-related bullying in schools and its representation within school anti-bullying policies. Some types of school are more likely than others to mention weight-based bullying in their policies. We recommend that schools explicitly recognise weight-related bullying in their anti-bullying policies and explore how to support staff and pupil to take action.",

          "abstract": "Man and his wealth are catalysts for consumption of resources that we refer to as commodities. While this was understood since Engel, who first tabulated these expenditures, the nature of the demand function itself remained unresolved. Economics of consumption is redefined here in terms of its basic variables, income and expenditures, in a self-consistent universal hierarchy. The analyses so far did not take into account a correction for income though the preference for consumption is primarily hierarchical. Using data from National Sample Survey Organization of India, we demonstrate the universality of the rectangular hyperbola that defines the consumption for each commodity on the basis of residual income, by deducting expenditures of higher preference based on elasticity coefficients. Since different commodities show a hierarchy of hyperbolic functions, both in the rate at which the saturation is achieved as well as the saturation itself, we needed a commodity for which the critical time constant (accounting for the hyperbolic function) is known and invariant, viz., educational expenditures. The year-wise income classes of parents that reflect the relevant expenditures for education of Brazilian children, compiled earlier by Costa Ribiero, uniquely show a constant hyperbolic function for all the years when analyzed in terms of ‘residual income’. The study corrects long-standing errors of commission and omission in relevant econometrics and biology of work-calorie relationship.",

With immense conflicts and inequality of global development, the underlying power distribution and institutional evolution in the South, however, are not fully elucidated due to the dualism-driven disagreements. With the duality of structure, our research investigates the dialectical structure-agency relationship in socio-political interaction, mediating dualism into the power structuration process, followed by a case examination of the Peiyang Republic of China 1912–1928. The results illustrate that the duality-oriented framework settles the limitations on account of static power structure and convoluted agency. The findings reveal the evolving nature of political settlements, whereby institutions are used and reconstituted by the praxes of agents. Analysing the interaction between power agents and structures, this research reinterprets political settlements as dynamic reproduction of power systems for broader development and conflict studies.",

          "title": "Improving Functionalist Arguments",
          "authors": "Andrés Castro Araújo; Nicolas Restrepo Restrepo Ochoa",
          "abstract": "Contemporary sociology finds itself in an awkward position. Despite having declared the death of functionalism, some form of functionalist argument still remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that this inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this article has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating a distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction. This allows us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. Importantly, these forms of argument are not burdened by the weaknesses associated with the discredited organicist framework most sociologists have in mind when they think of “functionalism.” Instead of trying to eliminate all traces of “function talk” from sociology, we should be more explicit about the functional ascriptions we do make. This framework enables us to better evaluate, challenge, and improve upon much of the sociological research that currently relies on these forms of argument.",

          "abstract": "When do autocrats replace their ministers? Research suggests that failed coup attempts lead autocrats to remove disloyal ruling elites. While this is an important and intuitive finding, failed coup attempts are very rare events and hence leave large amounts of variation in minister removal unexplained. It also portrays autocrats as reactionary, whereas previous work suggests that they are anticipatory and survival-seeking. We argue that autocratic leaders are strategic actors who take preemptive action against potentially disloyal elites, rather than risking a coup attempt being realized. Using structural coup risk as a lower estimate of a leader's own perception of coup risk, we find that it significantly contributes to the prediction of minister removals. Contrasting its effect to that of failed coup attempts, we find that it substantially improves predictive performance across a number of metrics. Our findings contribute to nascent research on government stability and autocratic leader survival.",

          "abstract": "Spatial mobility plays a crucial role in shaping social stratification processes. While previous research focused on adult workers’ monetary returns from commuting or relocating, early career gains in occupational status may be more significant from a life course perspective. We examine whether spatial mobility yields status returns for labor market entrants and, if so, how such returns might be stratified by young people’s local opportunity structures and their level of schooling. We use longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study merged with fine-grained regional information and focus on transitions from school to Vocational Education and Training (VET). As a novel approach to address the methodological challenge of self-selection into spatial mobility, we propose incorporating young people’s occupational aspirations into the regression analysis. We show that mobile young people are more likely to get higher-status VET positions. Yet, being spatially mobile only pays off if young people commute or move away from structurally weak regions and for those with higher levels of schooling who are already privileged in status attainment. We conclude that young people can potentially overcome regional disadvantages through spatial mobility, while spatial mobility also tends to widen the gap in status attainment between educational groups.",

          "authors": "Ellery Frahm",
          "abstract": "Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) exists in a somewhat liminal state as a technique in the archaeological sciences. On one hand, pXRF is essentially energy-dispersive XRF (EDXRF) condensed to fit into a handheld instrument. On the other hand, it is still often defined by a few strident critiques more than a decade ago, the focus of which were pXRF users, not the instruments. There were three themes in those critiques: perceived weaknesses in (1) research design, (2) element quantification, and (3) publishing, especially as it relates to data evaluation. Recently, Johnson et al. (2024) sought to address the third critique, by both surveying the literature and proposing a checklist of 18 variables that, they argue, should be published to “result in better science” from pXRF users. While this is an important topic, the study and list are flawed and, thus, will not achieve their goal. We do, though, share the aim of aiding archaeologists in becoming effective pXRF users. Here I adopt a different tack. Drawing on 24 years of X-ray spectrometry experience, my intent is to share knowledge that can help the expanding community of pXRF practitioners. Ranging in topic from safety to research design and common pitfalls, I aim to share my experience in a way that can, I hope, be useful to those beyond my own students.

          "title": "The Feasibility of National Inference Under the NSCAW IV L-State Sample Design",
          "authors": "Paul P. Biemer; Dan Liao; Darryl Creel; Stephen J Tueller",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this Feasibility Analysis Study (FAS) was to evaluate methods for producing valid national estimates under the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) IV sample design. The NSCAW IV design is a stratified two-stage, unequal probability design that restricts the sample to within L purposively selected states, where L is a number between 8 and 12. (L = 10 was assumed for most the analyses in this document). The design is fully consistent with the NSCAW IV’s primary objective (i.e., to provide detailed, precise state-level estimates for the L key states selected for the survey). However, an important secondary objective is to provide for valid national estimates, even though the sample design itself is not nationally representative. The FAS was conducted to determine whether the NSCAW IV L-state design could achieve this secondary objective. FAS confirmed that national estimates are indeed feasible. This report provides a summary of the FAS results and offers detailed, statistical evidence as to the NSCAW IV L-state design’s ability to produce valid national inferences. \n     State estimates can be produced from the NSCAW IV design by applying classical survey estimation techniques; however, national estimation requires nonprobability or so-called quasi-random estimation and modeling techniques. The FAS investigated two such estimation approaches: quasi-randomization weighting (QRW) and superpopulation modeling (SPM). Data from prior NSCAW cohorts—NSCAW I and II—were analyzed to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Fortunately, the NSCAW I and II designs are quite similar to what is proposed for NSCAW IV in that they both include a purposive selection of states—L = 8, in total. The key difference between their designs and NSCAW IV’s design is that the two prior surveys also included a random sample the “remainder” stratum (i.e., the combination of states that were not purposively selected). This remainder stratum provided for the unbiased national estimation in NSCAW I and II without the needed for nonprobability estimation approaches. However, the remainder stratum was initially ignored in application of the QRW and SPM to NSCAW I and II states to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Later in the analysis, the remainder stratum provided a mechanism to assessing the biases in the QRW and SPM national estimates. This was critical in order for the FAS analysis speculate on the potential bias risks for NSCAW IV national estimates using the sample estimation approaches.\n     As the results in the report convincingly show, both the QRW and SPM approaches are capable of producing valid national estimates from the L-state design envisioned for NSCAW IV. QRW is recommended for the estimating the means of the vast majority of questionnaire characteristics; however, in situations where QRW may fail to produce accurate results, the SPM approach can then be implemented to produce more accurate results. One drawback of SPM is that it requires more effort and a higher level of statistical expertise to implement. \nThe research reported in this document initially addresses the question of whether the QRW method can be feasibly applied to the NSCAW IV data to obtain valid national inferences based on a small number (8 ≤ L ≤ 12) of purposively selected sample of states. Variations of QRW were applied to the NSCAW I eight-state sample and then, using the combination of the state and remainder stratum samples, the quality of the QRW national estimates was evaluated by comparing them to the full sample, unbiased national estimates. A number of key quality indicators were analyzed for national estimates related to 26 NSCAW characteristics—23 variables that overlap with the NCANDS data and three Child Behavior Check List (CBCL)  characteristics from the survey questionnaire. Four types of estimates based solely on the eight-state data were computed: (1) unweighted estimates, (2) estimates based on the unadjusted NSCAW weights, (3) estimates derived from Method 1 weighting, and (4) estimates derived from Method 2 weighting. Estimates (1) and (2) were computed primarily to gain insight around the degree to which approaches (3) and (4) affect the bias of the unweighted and unadjusted eight-state estimates. Finally, the NSCAW I full sample estimates were computed, which provided the “gold-standard” estimates used to evaluate the quality of estimates (1) through (4) for national inference. Because the NSCAW IV design will use three domains—the eight NSCAW I domains were collapsed to create the three NSCAW IV domains and the quality analysis was repeated for these “ad hoc” domains.\n     The NSCAW I QRW analyses demonstrated the success of these methods for extend inference from the NSCAW IV purposively selected state sample to the national level. Although some bias could remain in the estimates after weighting, the biases were significantly reduced from their unweighted counterparts for the vast majority of estimates. For substantive characteristics such as the CBCL variables, the biases in the QRW estimates were slightly larger but still acceptable for many research purposes. The results for the NSCAW I analysis were essentially confirmed using NSCAW II data: both data sets produced very similar results.\nSPM offers an alternative to QRW for creating national estimates from the L-state design. Because it incorporates specific covariates that are the most highly correlated with the outcome variable, it can achieve much greater estimation accuracy than is possible with the more general QRW methodology. A key distinction between SPM and the QRW is that, although the latter can be applied to any outcome variable, SPM must be tailored to each specific outcome variable of interest; i.e., each questionnaire variable represents a dependent variable in its own customized model. Nevertheless, for questionnaire variables where the QRW estimates have, or are suspected to have, unacceptably large biases, SPM offers a less biased alternative and can be used to produce higher quality inferences. \n     The SPM analyses used the eight-state strata to project national estimates and then evaluated those estimates by comparing them to the corresponding national sample estimates that served as the gold standard. The results showed that, at least for the variables considered from NSCAW I and II, SPM produces excellent results, with very small biases in most instances. Based on these results, we believe the SPM approach is quite feasible for the NSCAW IV L-state design. Thus, its use is recommended for NSCAW IV, particularly in situations where QRW estimates are shown or suspected to be unacceptably biased.",

We used the ROAD database, managed by the ISSN International Centre, as a reference database which indexes 62,701 OA active resources (as of May 2024). Among the 62,701 active resources indexed in the ROAD database, the Web of Science indexes 6,157 journals, while Scopus indexes 7,351, and OpenAlex indexes 34,217. A striking observation is the presence of 25,658 OA journals exclusively in OpenAlex, whereas only 182 journals are exclusively present in WoS and 373 in Scopus.\nThe geographical analysis focusses on two levels: continents and countries. As for disciplinary comparison, we use the ten disciplinary levels of the ROAD database.  Moreover, our findings reveal a striking similarity in OA journal coverage between WoS and Scopus. However, while OpenAlex offers better inclusivity and indexing, it is not without biases. WoS and Scopus predictably favor journals from Europe, North America and Oceania. Although OpenAlex presents a much more balanced indexing, certain regions and countries remain relatively underrepresented. Typically, Africa is proportionally as under-represented in OpenAlex as it is in WoS, and some emerging countries are proportionally less represented in OpenAlex than in WoS and Scopus.\nThese results underscore a marked similarity in OA journal indexing between WoS and Scopus, while OpenAlex aligns more closely with the distribution observed in the ROAD database, although it also exhibits some representational biases.",

          "authors": "Dongjin Kim",
          "abstract": "The population of Seoul had exploded from 1 million to 2.45 million in 7 years right after the end of the Korean War (from 1953 to 1960). Many parts of Seoul were converted into slum areas and aimless urbanisation lowered the quality of life in the Seoul metropolitan area. Pupils were excluded from education due to the lack of school infrastructure while citizens were exposed to crime and unemployment. In the middle of the population crisis, the metropolitan government of Seoul and the central government of South Korea paid attention to the potential of Gangnam as one of the candidate regions for the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. This review presents how Gangnam has transformed from an “empty land” to the “symbol of wealth” in the history of the Gangnam development and the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. The initial development plan tried to solve immediate housing problems derived from the lack of urban space and facility. After 20 years of the intensive development, Gangnam has transformed from a poor countryside region into the new economic centre and financial hub. Gangnam has become a symbol of wealth in South Korea where citizens and private companies would like to reside. On the other hand, many evictees lost their home and disappeared as nameless citizens behind the scenes of the development. The Gangnam-style development, the expertise of urban development acquired in Gangnam, can be thoroughly studied and transferred to other regions in South Korea and developing countries in the world, thus establishing Gangnam as a model case of metropolitan area expansion.\n\nKey words: construction, eviction, Gangnam, housing crisis, metropolitan area, Seoul, shantytowns, urban development",

Im Zuge der gesellschaftlichen Modernisierung ist das meritokratische Modell, nach welchem begehrte Güter auf Basis individueller Leistung zugeteilt werden sollen, zum dominierenden Legitimationsprinzip geworden („Leistung soll sich lohnen“). Durch die enge Verknüpfung mit dem Arbeitsmarkt übernimmt hierbei das Bildungs­ und Ausbildungssystem eine wesentliche gesellschaftliche Selektionsfunktion, indem es den Zugang zu unterschiedlich bewerteten Positionen vorstrukturiert.",

          "authors": "Daniela Alejandra Pastor",
          "abstract": "This work analyzes data obtained through a public request in 2021 of the highest academic level and gender in the career of CONICET support staff, which are scientific personnel in charge of a wide variety of highly qualified tasks such as: responsible of: equipment, techniques and laboratories, as well as administrative. There are other types of hiring this role in science, which are not contemplated in this analysis, such as: Article 9, contracted, outsourced personnel, dependent on universities with functions in CONICET, among other possible still unidentified.\nIt was determined that there is a balanced composition of personnel from the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate studies levels. By incorporating the gender variable, it can be seen that at the undergraduate and graduate training levels (non-university tertiary, intermediate and basic) are masculinized, while at the postgraduate training levels are feminized. In the analysis of the distribution of CPA personnel by career, we can see that there are more personnel in the Professional category: 1864 people vs 951, and that it is balanced in gender but this is not the same for the Technical career. Analyzing the Technical and Professional careers separately, it was found that there are people with a high level of training retained in the Technical category, a situation that affects women more than men. It can also be seen that in the Professional category, an analogous process occurs, in which the people who access this category with a level of training less than a bachelor's degree are mostly men, which confirms that there is greater pressure of training for women. In this work, this is not considered to be a strict demonstration of “overqualification” or “underqualification,” since for this it is necessary to investigate more about the nature of the tasks they perform, how the bureaucratic incorporation and promotion mechanisms influence them, as well as the subjectivities put into play in the interpretation of which tasks are Technical and which are Professional. It is necessary to continue researching the reasons that produce these inequalities in order to propose reparatory solutions.",

          "authors": "David Hajo Kreitmeir",
          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, violence against land and environmental activists has been on the rise, besetting even stable democracies. Using a unique, fine-grained data set on social conflict events in Peru and exogenous variation in world mineral prices, I document a strong link between local mineral rents and violent state repression of socioenvironmental protests in a democratic institutional setting. I show that the increase in the use of excessive force cannot be explained by changes in protester behavior. Empirical findings highlight the role of local authorities: the election of a pro-mining mayor is associated with a higher prevalence of state repression and corruption in the constituency. The legal and democratic accountability of local authorities is, however, found to be limited. The reported increase in corruption does not translate into more investigations against pro-mining mayors for corruption offenses nor are reelection results of incumbents found to be negatively affected by state violence against protesters. Finally, I show that violent state repression is successful in forestalling conflict resolution agreements that acknowledge protesters’ demands.",

          "authors": "Dani Dagan; Matthew Tyler James Brownlee; Cait Henry; Spencer A Wood; Samantha G. Winder",
          "abstract": "Managers of parks and protected areas estimate the number of people who visit the lands and waters they steward to protect natural resources, improve visitor experiences, and communicate the value of public lands. However, the practice of visitor estimation is complex, challenging, and the methods are highly varied. While researchers and practitioners have spent decades improving and testing visitor estimation methods, determining the best approach for a specific situation remains difficult. As new methods have emerged in recent years, the need to evaluate them in the context of existing methods has become apparent. However, there has been little synthesis of this knowledge. Beginning with a systematic literature review and concluding with a Delphi approach, we review trends and themes in the research to develop a synthesized decision tool to aid in the practice of estimating visitors. We find that the volume of publications and variety of methods present in the literature has increased in recent years. Additionally, some methods are more prevalent in peer-reviewed journals than agency manuals, suggesting the connection between research and practice could be improved. We also identify three themes in the literature: all methods have benefits and shortcomings; emerging technologies create viable data; and these novel data require calibration. We synthesize our findings in table that we call the comparability matrix, which distills 30 attributes about 18 visitor estimation methods into one decision tool. This tool is hosted in an interactive online format for practitioners and researchers. Overall, we found that this two-phase approach, a systematic literature review followed by a Delphi method, is effective for subjects such as visitor estimation that are vast in scope and diverse in application.",

          "abstract": "This paper studies the estimation of wealth distribution using estates left at death. We establish formal conditions for adopting a simplified version of the classic estate multiplier method, using only minimal information on estates and mortality. We empirically validate these conditions and apply the simplified approach to produce novel long-run top wealth share series for Belgium, Japan, and South Africa, where estate data have not yet been exploited. This approach may vastly expand the range of countries and years for which wealth inequality can be estimated, where estate data exist but the standard method cannot be applied.

          "authors": "Stijn Conix; Leander Vignero; Olivier Lemeire; Pei-Shan Chi; Li Lin",
          "abstract": "In light of growing calls to demonstrate the societal value of academic work, this paper explores whether peer review is a reliable method to evaluate the societal relevance of humanities research. It also offers an estimate of how relevant published journal articles and books from five humanities fields are to society. By modeling two evaluation tasks involving many raters and documents, we estimate how various reviewer characteristics (such as their chauvinism and strictness) and document characteristics (such as their field and content) affect societal relevance ratings. We then compare the influence of both reviewer and document characteristics on these ratings and provide an estimate of the societal relevance of humanities research where the factors contributing to peer review unreliability are filtered out. Our results suggest that, even according to humanities scholars themselves, a substantial portion of published humanities research is not relevant to society at large. Furthermore, our results also suggest that when using peer review to decide whether a particular piece of research is societally relevant, the selection of reviewers plays a more significant role than the content of the research.",
