          "authors": "Annika Lutz; Michael T. Schmitt; Julian Fernando; Yoshihisa Kashima",
          "abstract": "Collective future thinking—imagining possible futures for society—plays an important role in shaping responses to climate change. Experimental studies have demonstrated that imagining a sustainable future increases pro-environmental intentions and support for environmental activism. However, the impact of these imagined futures depends on subjective appraisals—individuals who view a sustainable world positively are more likely to act. Additionally, emphasizing “co-benefits” of sustainable futures, such as stronger communities and increased well-being, enhances support for climate solutions. Other key features determining the effectiveness of interventions are a sense of collective efficacy and hope in creating the imagined future, and a sense of identification with a movement striving towards positive change. By highlighting the psychological mechanisms that connect future thinking to action, this work contributes to understanding how visions of the future can be leveraged to inspire climate action.",

          "title": "Designing Psychometric Measures for LLMs: Framework and Application to Racial Bias",
          "authors": "Mouhacine Benosman",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of large language models (LLMs) or chatbots, has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human–machine\ninteraction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we\nrigorously measure these biases?\nWe address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test &amp; Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling,\npre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks. We illustrate STAMP-LLM on racial bias using one explicit and two implicit measures.",

          "authors": "Mathew Herbert; Brian Blanco; Dimitri Perivoliotis; Jason B Luoma; Gisele Fernandes-Osterhold; Andrew Bismark; Joshua Woolley",
          "abstract": "There is promise for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted\npsychotherapy as a highly effective and durable treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD). However, the Food and Drug Administration rejected MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in\nits current form, expressing concerns about the lack of standardization and empirical basis of\npsychotherapy methods. This highlights the need to consider alternative psychotherapeutic\napproaches to integrate with MDMA for the treatment of PTSD. We propose that the evidencebased cognitive behavioral therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), is particularly\nwell-suited to be paired with the administration of MDMA for PTSD. Specifically: 1) the\nsubjective effects of MDMA directly support key ACT processes; 2) ACT methods could help\nprepare patients for MDMA administration, increasingly the likelihood of efficacy and\ntolerability; 3) ACT provides a “process-directed” approach to assist the therapist and help the\npatient during MDMA administration sessions; and 4) ACT may help optimize the integration of\nMDMA experiences to shape adaptive functioning and promote quality of life following\ntreatment. We provide examples of how ACT methods could be used for many of these goals. In\nsum, we believe ACT provides a highly scalable, structured yet flexible, evidence-based\nframework well-suited to be integrated with MDMA as a new treatment approach for PTSD.",

          "authors": "Marne White; Yanli Lin; Todd Samuel Braver",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM) are distinct mindfulness practices that produce unique psychological effects. Prior research has frequently investigated the neural correlates of FA and OM states utilizing electroencephalographic (EEG) methods, focusing on changes in spectral power within theta and alpha bands. Yet the functional significance of these neural changes has remained unclear. Here we utilized a fully-within subject state induction protocol to more directly test whether EEG spectral power during FA and OM is differentially associated with subjective ratings of state mindfulness.  \nMethods: While continuous EEG was recorded, participants engaged in audio-guided FA and OM practices, as well as an active control condition (C), and then self-reported their state mindfulness afterwards. Linear mixed effects models were used to rigorously assess how condition-level variation in spectral power predicted state mindfulness scores across the three inductions. \nResults: Validating the approach, participants reported higher state mindfulness and decreased theta power during both FA and OM relative to C; additionally, reduced alpha power was found in OM relative to FA. Most importantly, increased theta power was associated with higher state mindfulness in FA and even more strongly in OM, whereas reduced alpha power was linked to higher state mindfulness selectively in OM. \nConclusions:  These findings add to the growing literature suggesting that FA and OM represent distinct mindfulness states. We further establish that the functional significance of theta and alpha power is context-dependent, clearly linking these neural measures to the subjective quality of specific meditation states and practices.",

          "abstract": "Changes in temporal context have been shown to impact episodic memory of the 'boundary' items involved in creating this temporal context. However, in most prior studies, changes in temporal context have been operationalized explicitly, typically through perceptually obvious visual or auditory stimuli that form a boundary between the previous and current context. In this work, we explore how recognition of items is impacted when temporal context change is operationalized implicitly through the order of presentation during the study phase. 57 participants, were exposed to a rotation judgment cover task for 15 randomly generated polygon items. Around half of the participants were presented with these items in a random order. The other half were presented with items such that 6 items formed ‘boundaries’ that led in and out of 3 temporal clusters. Similar to findings where boundaries are explicitly operationalized, we show that implicit boundaries are also better remembered than non-boundary items.",

          "authors": "Florian Hintz; Ariel N. James; Leah Nieber; Oliver C. Schultheiss",
          "abstract": "The present study investigated predictors of individual differences in linguistic knowledge and spontaneous language use in adults. Specifically, we examined the role of domain-general cognitive abilities—working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and processing speed—alongside implicit motivational factors, including achievement, power, and affiliation motives and activity inhibition. Linguistic knowledge was assessed through multiple tests covering receptive and productive vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and comprehension of fixed expressions, whereas language use was examined through participants’ written narratives in the Picture Story Exercise (PSE), analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework. Network and path analyses revealed that auditory working memory positively predicted linguistic knowledge and analytic language use, highlighting its role in the sequential organization and consolidation of verbal material. Visual working memory was unrelated to knowledge but predicted more authentic language use, suggesting a link to imagery-based and self-referential expression. Nonverbal reasoning supported knowledge but was negatively related to authenticity, indicating a trade-off between systematic abstraction and spontaneity. Processing speed, while crucial in early language development, did not predict knowledge in adults and was negatively associated with narrative word count, suggesting that efficiency may reduce elaboration in spontaneous production. Contrary to our predictions, implicit motives and activity inhibition were unrelated to both linguistic knowledge and language use. Together, these findings underscore how distinct domain-general abilities shape static linguistic knowledge and dynamic language use, highlighting the need for integrative models of adult language skills.",

          "abstract": "The development of clinical and research competencies is central to readying the next generation of psychologists for professional practice. To meet emerging professional demands, training programmes must also now consider skill development beyond traditional research and clinical practice to equip graduates with contemporary competencies, including skills such as science communication. In this chapter, we discuss an Irish perspective on approaching this challenge, drawing on innovative methods we use to optimise competency development in undergraduate and postgraduate psychology education related to clinical topics. We explore how capacity-building in evidence synthesis methods and science communication can prepare students to facilitate the responsible and informed use of research evidence by others. Alongside this, we examine the clinical competency framework through examples and critically appraise considerations for training future psychologists. The discussion will highlight recommendations for training psychological scientists for the evolving professional landscape.",

          "title": "How Trait Confidence and Communication Shape Dyadic Decision Outcomes and Confidence Matching",
          "authors": "Matthew Blanchard; Eugene Aidman; Lazar Stankov; Sabina Kleitman",
          "abstract": "When individuals collaborate, they often rely on momentary estimates of their own and their partner’s confidence (decision confidence) to guide collective decisions and achieve their goals. Through interaction, these confidence estimates tend to align over time. This  process is known as confidence matching. More stable, dispositional trait confidence is also emerging as a key factor shaping the dynamics and outcomes of collaborative action. We examined how trait confidence and type of communication impact the accuracy of dyadic decisions, decision confidence, and the dynamics of decision confidence, including confidence matching. \n\nIn this study, 210 participants completed general knowledge tests individually and collaboratively, forming 105 dyads. The tests were completed under three communication conditions: isolated (no interaction), passive (viewing the partner’s response and numeric confidence rating), and active (verbal discussion). Participants assessed as high-trait or low-trait confidence (controlling for cognitive ability) were allocated to three types of dyads: low-trait (two low-trait members), mixed-trait (one low-trait and one high member), or high-trait (two high-trait members) confidence dyads.\nTrait confidence moderated decision accuracy and decision confidence gains: dyads with mixed-trait or high-trait confidence showed greater decision accuracy improvements in the active than the passive communication condition compared to their individual decisions. Whereas low-trait confidence dyads benefited equally from active and passive communication. Collaboration increased decision confidence overall, especially for high-trait confidence dyads under active communication. Confidence matching occurred rapidly in both passive and active communication but predicted decision accuracy gains only in the passive condition where participants had limited social information. \n\nAlthough active verbal communication led to the greatest overall decision accuracy, these gains were not driven by confidence matching. Our findings highlight the critical role of trait confidence in shaping collaborative outcomes in dyads and extend previous research by showing that confidence matching occurs naturally during verbal communication.",

          "authors": "Matthew Blanchard; Eugene Aidman; Lazar Stankov; Sabina Kleitman",
          "abstract": "A collective intelligence factor (CI) was introduced by prior research to characterize the cognitive ability of groups. Surprisingly, individual intelligence did not predict CI. Instead, it correlated with individual social sensitivity, the equality of conversational turn-taking and the proportion of females in a group. However, these findings may depend on the type of tasks completed by groups. Our study re-examined these relationships by (1) testing the robustness of the CI factor in dyads using well-structured tasks guided by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence; (2) exploring the relationship between dyadic CI and metacognitive confidence, which is known to influence group processes and outcomes; and (3) identifying the psychological characteristics of distinct dyad types using Latent Profile Analysis.\nWe measured CI in 105 undergraduate dyads using three group tasks aligned with the broad abilities of the CHC model. Individual intelligence was assessed using Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices. We also measured social sensitivity, proportion of females, equality of turn taking, working memory, and personality.\nResults indicated that individual intelligence and confidence were the strongest predictors of dyadic CI for well-structured tasks, contrasting with previous findings emphasizing social factors. While we replicated the relationship with social sensitivity, we did not replicate the findings for equality of turn taking or gender composition. Latent Profile Analysis identified three psychological profiles: dyads performing consistently high individually and collectively, those performing consistently low, and those performing better collectively than individually. Our ‘smarter’ dyads consisted of intelligent and confident individuals with higher social sensitivity.\nThese findings suggest that, in dyads performing well-structured tasks, individual cognitive abilities and confidence play significant roles in CI. This challenges the emphasis on social factors and underscores the importance of task selection.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

          "abstract": "Fairness is typically assumed to be in the moral domain, yet recent work shows that young children may not view unfairness as a moral transgression. We investigated whether this may be because the harm caused by unfairness is less salient than the harm caused by more prototypical moral transgressions. We found that both 4-year-olds and adults rated unfairness more seriously when the harm caused by the unfairness was emphasized rather than not emphasized. When asked to categorize unfairness as either moral or conventional, 4-year-olds did not systematically choose either category. Most adults, on the other hand, categorized unfairness with conventional transgressions. These findings suggest that perceptions of unfairness exist along a continuum and are influenced by the salience of the harm caused by unfairness. Highlighting the harm inflicted by unfairness may be an important way to move people, from an early age, to notice and correct it.",

          "authors": "Paul L Nunez",
          "abstract": "To address the reference issue, a refined conceptual framework, a parallax view, clarifies how multi-scale electric potentials, electric fields, current sources, and reference strategies interrelate. Electric potentials, introduced historically to simplify mathematics, are physically meaningful only when expressed as differences. The so-called zero potential at infinity is clarified physically by focusing on the electric field, an unambiguously real physical entity.\nMeasures of functional connectivity like coherence are affected by reference, volume conduction, and the spatial scale of description. Nonetheless, the common average reference (CAVE or CAR) yields robust information, even though coherence between specific electrode pairs is uncertain. CAVE’s strength lies in treating all electrode sites equally, without prior assumptions about brain sources or volume conductor models. \nCAVE may benefit more from increased electrode density and reduced inter-electrode spacing than from extending electrode array coverage to lower head locations. With average center-to-center spacing below about 2.5 cm, CAVE accurately represents recorded potential relative to the average potential over the underlying scalp—without implying that this average is zero. Electric field measurements can usefully supplement CAVE measurements, the proposed parallax view. \nHigh-density recordings enable accurate estimation of scalp tangential electric fields, an extension of simple bipolar recording to the entire array. Such measure provides estimates of electric field magnitudes and directions, expressed as contour maps and streaming vector maps, respectively. Field magnitude maps sometimes resemble Laplacian maps depending on sources; streaming vector maps provide directions and strengths of scalp currents.  Because electric fields are inherently reference-free, only volume conduction remains as a barrier distorting coherence and other measures of dynamic source behavior.",

We curated dictionaries of terms spanning familial, cognitive, peer, personality, and substance-related factors, among others. Using these, we systematically collected scientific articles and measured co-occurrence probabilities to generate data-driven profiles of risk factors. This large-scale dataset enables the exploration of key associations, comparative analyses, and novel insights into how risk factors interact across behavioral and social contexts.

          "authors": "Seungju Kim; Weiman Xu",
          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While a growing body of literature has sought to understand factors connected to LGBQ+ acceptance and support by religious individuals, these factors remain understudied in religious leaders. Extant findings on LGBQ+ support among non-religious and even religious individuals may not directly apply to religious leaders, given leaders’ unique roles as religious and spiritual authorities. METHOD: Using a nationally representative sample of religious leaders from the 2020 National Survey of Religious Leaders (N = 1,600), we tested preregistered hypotheses to examine overall levels of LGBQ+ support and psychosocial, religious, and spiritual correlates, as well as potential congregational moderators. RESULTS: Results reveal overall low LGBQ+ support among U.S. religious leaders, with psychosocial factors (e.g., identifying as White, woman, higher education, income) and religious/spiritual struggles associated with greater support, while greater religious fundamentalism and prayer are associated with lower support. Religious fundamentalism emerged as the strongest predictor of lower LGBQ+ support across all analyses. Although congregation size did not moderate this relationship, congregational racial composition and religious tradition did influence the strength of the fundamentalism and LGBQ+ support association. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Religious leaders represent a key stakeholder group in the pursuit of increased rights and support for LGBQ+ people, yet this study reveals a significant disconnect between their attitudes and broader population trends toward acceptance. Community and policy stakeholders should collaborate with religious institutions, denominations, and theological seminaries to promote interpretive frameworks that encourage theological nuance, which emerged as the primary barrier to LGBQ+ support.",

In two studies (NS1 = 238 with spoken sentences, NS2 = 88 with spoken words) university students engaged in exposure, rating, and validation tasks. We observed increased liking of voices with 8 initial repetitions for the sentences. Voices initially presented 2 and 5 times were liked less than unfamiliar voices and recognised as familiar with less confidence than voices initially presented 8 times, forming an inverted “U” in likeability and familiarity. Less experience with the speaker’s accent weakened the inverted “U” in liking. Our words data are insufficient for inferential conclusions, but the sentences results indicate an uncanny valley of “familiarly unfamiliar” voices, which are more familiar than never heard stimuli but not familiar enough for the mere exposure effect of increased liking.",

Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) procedures could also affect in trial results due to electrode location, current strength, and stimulation duration. Because of the small sample size and lack in the follow-up, more study is needed. Due to the disparity, tDCS and approaches need more research. Future ASD, tDCS research should include larger sample numbers, longer follow-ups, and more subpopulations.

Contradictory evidence shows that consistent and accurate tDCS outcomes require well-established techniques.

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is to dissociate perception from awareness using\nrigorous, bias-free methods. Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight.

Across two preregistered studies (N = 504, 158) and a re-analysis of previously published data (N = 50), we rigorously examined outcome-irrelevant learning under conditions of explicit instruction and extensive training. In both cases, automatic value updating persisted even when participants clearly understood which features were non-predictive of reward, and reliance on these irrelevant values led to suboptimal choices. Moreover, working-memory capacity, known as a key regulatory resource, predicted the magnitude of this automatic outcome-irrelevant learning. Collectively, our results broaden the concept of automatic cognitive processing beyond the selective-attention literature to encompass reinforcement-learning mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Igor Radun",
          "abstract": "In this article, I raise serious ethical concerns about the integrity of the peer-review process surrounding a recent virtual special issue (VSI), which features updated and shortened versions of chapters from a book published almost simultaneously. Both the book and the VSI are largely authored, peer-reviewed, and edited by individuals affiliated with an NGO. A central issue addressed throughout the paper is the rationale for transforming book chapters into articles for a peer-reviewed journal. The motivation, perhaps, can be found in the editors’ own words, expressing their intent to use this “peer-reviewed and published” evidence to influence “policy-makers and practitioners across the world.” It is evident that articles published in peer-reviewed journals carry significantly more weight in shaping public policy than a book released by an NGO. This does not imply that the book or the special issue contain research of poor quality; however, it raises important questions about the transparency and rigor of the peer-review process.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain is a complex and persistent condition that is influenced by psychological, behavioral, and social factors. Emerging research suggests that long-term pain is not only driven by nociceptive inputs, but also by maladaptive cognitive processes, emotional dysregulation, and unhelpful behavioral patterns. Additionally, patient expectations and clinician communication significantly influenced treatment outcomes. This scoping review synthesizes interdisciplinary findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and empirical studies published over the past two decades and identified through databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Only English-language studies involving human subjects were included. The findings reveal that cognitive distortions, such as catastrophizing and attentional bias, along with affective disturbances, such as anxiety and depression, are consistently associated with heightened pain perception and poorer recovery. Maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and reduced activity further contribute to disability. Patient satisfaction and treatment efficacy are strongly influenced by the alignment of expectations and the quality of provider communication. Integrated theoretical models, including the biopsychosocial model, fear-avoidance theory, and mindfulness-based approaches, offer a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing chronic pain. These psychosocial mechanisms highlight the importance of patient-centered strategies that address cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal dimensions. Future research should prioritize underrepresented groups, such as older adults, low-income populations, and culturally diverse communities, and focus on scalable theory-driven interventions tailored to their needs.",

The findings suggest that multi-method interventions\ntend to have moderate-to-strong effects on well-being and stress reduction, though improvements\nin job satisfaction appear somewhat more restrained. While each of these components has shown\npromise individually, their combined impact remains relatively underexplored in both academic\nliterature and applied practice. Neuroawareness is introduced here as an attempt to fill that gap,\noffering a more coherent, cross-disciplinary approach to cognitive intervention.

We accessed the contents of these thoughts using a free association paradigm combined with natural language processing techniques to examine how happiness is associated with what people think about and prioritize in daily life. Our analyses revealed that participants (n = 210 from the US/UK) with higher subjective well-being, particularly those with more frequent positive affect, generated thoughts semantically more similar to 'friend,' but not to 'money.' A similar pattern was also found in an independent sample (n = 350 from South Korea), showing consistency of the findings across different cultural contexts. Notably, the semantic similarity of participants’ generated thoughts to 'friend' predicted the extent to which participants prioritized social relationships over monetary gains in a realistic dilemma task. By exploring individuals’ minds with a computational approach, our work elucidates how the value of social relationships is manifested in spontaneous thought contents and everyday decisions, providing significant insights into the sources of happiness.",

          "abstract": "Personalization is increasingly emphasized in behavioural public policy, yet traditional approaches to tailoring interventions remain costly and difficult to scale. Synthetic twin agents—AI-generated counterparts of real individuals—offer a novel, scalable approach. This study evaluates whether synthetic twins generated by large language models (LLMs) can replicate human responses to personality-tailored advertisements. We recruited 373 human participants and created matched synthetic twins using four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-5-latest, Gemini-1.5 Flash, and Gemini-2.0 Flash). Participants evaluated advertisements for three consumer products, each tailored to Big-Five personality traits. Both human participants and their synthetic twins demonstrated personality-congruent responses for Agreeableness and Extraversion. Synthetic twins additionally showed congruence for Conscientiousness and, in some cases, Neuroticism, depending on the model and product. Trait-level comparisons showed partial alignment: Gemini-1.5 Flash most closely replicated human patterns, followed by GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash; GPT-5-latest showed the weakest alignment. Despite trait-specific divergences, aggregate correlations between human and synthetic responses were high (r = .81-.91), indicating strong consistency in relative patterns. These findings provide early evidence that prompt-based multimodal LLMs can approximate human psychological responses. Synthetic twins may serve as low-cost tools for pre-testing personalized behavioural interventions, while also raising critical ethical concerns around privacy, governance, and hyper-personalization.",

Consistency effects pose a problem for the rule-based pronunciation of the DRC. Serial effects pose a problem for the purely parallel PDP models. Phonological effects pose a problem for all models save CDP. All models suffer from the distribution problem, weakening each model’s ability to learn spelling-to-sound relationships. LEX is the only model that handles polysyllabic words. As none of the models provide a complete answer to the question of ‘how do we read?’, ‘how do we pronounce?’, or ‘how do we recognize words?’, I outline a set of principles as guidelines for future model development.

We review common mediation models and discuss various approaches for estimation and inference, including their implementation in software packages. Moreover, we present robust alternatives, thereby clarifying different notions of robustness. We further consider a setting where the mediation model holds in a latent space but where measurement issues create deviations from normality assumptions in the observed variable space, which is a setting not commonly considered in the literature on robust mediation analysis, and we obtain preliminary results via a simulation study.

To address this limitation, the present study applied a person-centered approach using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify distinct parenting profiles and explore their associations with child socioemotional skills. Based on reports of parenting behavior from parents of N = 254 kindergarten children (51.2% female, M = 6.0 years, SD = 0.62), three parenting profiles emerged: supportive (66%), engaged-disciplinary (22%), and harsh (12%). Associations with teacher-rated outcomes showed that children exposed to engaged-disciplinary parenting displayed more peer problems. In comparison, children assigned to the harsh parenting group showed more behavioral problems and, unexpectedly, stronger emotion regulation skills. The findings underscore the need to tailor support to specific subgroups of parents with distinct parenting behaviors, to strengthen positive parenting behaviors, and, in turn, promote the development of children.",

          "abstract": "To navigate the ever-changing and information-overladen environment it is crucial to selectively process relevant information and ignore distraction. Recently, the salient-signal-suppression hypothesis has stimulated much research and theoretical debates in attention research. It claims that – under certain conditions – salient distractors are suppressed at the search-guiding priority map and therefore speed-up search as compared to neutral (non-suppressed) non-targets. An alternative interpretation claims that these salient distractors are simply ignored. Using a novel paradigm to control search order and measure search speed, we here provide evidence that this speed-up is neither due to suppression on the priority map nor simple ignoring, but instead due to speeded processing and rejection of the salient distractor relative to each non-target. In particular, we show that the speed-up occurs only when the distractor is processed before the target and that distractor processing takes less time than processing a non-target. These findings not only call into question the predominant explanations of the distractor-speed-up effect and thereby shed new light on the attentional-capture debate, but also provide striking evidence that not all searches are guided by the priority map.",

          "authors": "Julian Ustiyanovych; Dario Krpan",
          "abstract": "Personalization is increasingly emphasized in behavioural public policy, yet traditional approaches to tailoring interventions remain costly and difficult to scale. Synthetic twin agents—AI-generated counterparts of real individuals—offer a novel, scalable approach. This study evaluates whether synthetic twins generated by large language models (LLMs) can replicate human responses to personality-tailored advertisements. We recruited 373 human participants and created matched synthetic twins using four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-5-latest, Gemini-1.5 Flash, and Gemini-2.0 Flash). Participants evaluated advertisements for three consumer products, each tailored to Big-Five personality traits. Both human participants and their synthetic twins demonstrated personality-congruent responses for Agreeableness and Extraversion. Synthetic twins additionally showed congruence for Conscientiousness and, in some cases, Neuroticism, depending on the model and product. Trait-level comparisons showed partial alignment: Gemini-1.5 Flash most closely replicated human patterns, followed by GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash; GPT-5-latest showed the weakest alignment. Despite trait-specific divergences, aggregate correlations between human and synthetic responses were high (r = .81-.91), indicating strong consistency in relative patterns. These findings provide early evidence that prompt-based multimodal LLMs can approximate human psychological responses. Synthetic twins may serve as low-cost tools for pre-testing personalized behavioural interventions, while also raising critical ethical concerns around privacy, governance, and hyper-personalization.",

          "abstract": "The integration of GenAI into academic workflows marks an epistemological inflection point. While these tools can amplify productivity, they risk eroding the cognitive foundations of expertise by simulating the very tasks through which scientific competence is developed, from synthesis to experimental design to writing. Uncritical reliance can lead to skill atrophy and AI complacency. To counter this, we propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills—strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration—that constitute a new form of scientific literacy distinct from traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we propose how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy. Proactive development of this AI-augmented expertise is necessary to shape a future where technology amplifies, rather than attenuates, scientific thought.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that anorexia nervosa (AN) may be characterized by subtle alterations in learning that could relate to symptom maintenance and treatment outcomes. However, findings in this area have been mixed, and there have been few efforts to date to summarize this literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to analyze existing literature that tested different facets of learning in samples of individuals with AN compared to other groups. In line with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an initial search in April 2024 on PSYCInfo and PubMed and an updated search in July 2025, yielding an initial sample of 1,831 articles, of which 194 were fully assessed for eligibility. Our final review included 130 articles; coding, extraction, and synthesis of results occurred from April 2024 to August 2025. Included studies predominantly were cross-sectional in nature, tested group differences between those actively ill with AN and control subjects who had no history of psychopathology, and used neuropsychological tasks primarily gauging episodic learning (e.g., verbal or visuospatial learning) or associative learning (e.g., reversal learning). Qualitative synthesis of these findings suggests that while there appear to be alterations in learning among individuals with AN compared to controls, the significance and specific pattern of learning differences is inconsistent. It is likely that heterogeneity exists within AN and other eating disorders across development, stage of illness, and clinical phenotypes. Future research that begins to characterize meaningful heterogeneity and adopts methods such as computational modeling may offer promising methods for improving the characterization of and treatments for this devastating condition.",

          "abstract": "A person’s gaze can be highly informative—it can reveal which people, objects, or places interest the person, and it can help observers predict what they might do next. It can also be difficult to understand. Relative to actions for which someone physically contacts a target (e.g., by reaching and touching), gaze may be difficult to understand because of the physical distance between the action and target. Indeed, classic research suggests that before 12 months of age, infants do not readily track the targets of others’ gaze. However, studies on the development of gaze understanding have mostly presented infants with unfamiliar adults acting on inanimate objects. Here, we provide evidence that 8- to 9-month-old infants can track the targets of their parents' gaze when that gaze was directed at a potential social partner: an animate puppet. When infants observed their own parents look toward an animate puppet, they expected them to continue looking towards the same puppet later. Infants did not have the same expectations when their parents looked toward inanimate objects, nor when they observed the gaze of an unfamiliar adult. Thus, before infants track the targets of object-directed gaze, they already track the targets of their parents’ social gaze. These findings are consistent with the possibility that social relevance shapes infants’ understanding of others’ actions.",

          "abstract": "Latent class analysis is increasingly recognized as a powerful approach for identifying unobserved subgroups within heterogeneous populations, particularly in the context of public health surveillance. This report applies latent class analysis to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2015–2020) to examine patterns of subjective cognitive decline in U.S. adults aged 45 and older. Using responses to a structured five-item cognitive function module, three distinct and interpretable subgroups—Mild, Moderate, and Severe cognitive decline—were identified. Each class exhibited unique symptom profiles and socio-demographic associations, with greater severity linked to lower income, lower education levels, and poorer general health. The optimal three-class model was supported by multiple fit indices, including AIC, BIC, entropy, and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test. Conditional response probability tables and profile plots further validated the internal structure of the classes. Additional visualizations illustrated the distribution of socioeconomic covariates across latent classes. This analysis underscores the value of latent class analysis for enhancing measurement precision, revealing hidden population structures, and informing targeted interventions. Future research should focus on integrating LCA with causal frameworks, machine learning techniques, and cross-cohort validation to improve its utility in real-world settings. The approach demonstrated here provides a replicable model for analyzing complex survey data in aging and cognitive health research.",

This report introduces the conceptual foundations and methodological execution of causal mediation analysis, using a population-based study on parity and dementia risk from the HUNT cohort in Norway as a motivating example. The study employed inverse odds weighting to evaluate whether midlife psychosocial, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related factors mediated the observed U-shaped association between the number of children and late-life dementia risk. Despite robust longitudinal data and comprehensive adjustment for confounding, the mediation analysis revealed that these potential pathways did not explain the elevated dementia risk among childless individuals or those with one or four or more children. This suggests that the relationship may be primarily direct or influenced by unmeasured mechanisms. The report highlights key methodological requirements—including proper temporal sequencing, confounder control, and sensitivity analyses—and provides visual and tabular summaries of effect decomposition. It concludes by outlining limitations and future directions, emphasizing the importance of enhancing methodological flexibility to address time-varying mediators and complex causal structures in life-course epidemiologic research.",

The Bakwana Compliance Sheet (BCS) was developed as a behavioral tool incorporating principles of commitment/consistency, reciprocity, framing and choice architecture to encourage timely payments.\nObjective: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, clarity, and preliminary behavioral impact of the BCS in improving fee payment compliance.\nMethodology: The intervention was implemented in four purposively selected private schools in Hotoro ward, Nasarawa LGA, Kano State, Nigeria. Fifteen parents participated for the reliability evaluation, alongside school staff. Reliability was assessed via a 7-day test–retest procedure; face and content validity were established through expert review. Payment data were collected for one term pre-intervention (baseline) and one term post-intervention.\nFindings: The tool reliability yielded r = 0.82 and was rated as clear and user-friendly by most participants. Average on-time payment rates for the four schools increased from 72.74% (SD = 6.65) at baseline to 86.74% (SD = 5.79) post-intervention – a 14% percentage-point improvement t = -7.43, p &lt; 0.05). \nConclusion: The BCS is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective intervention for improving school fee compliance.

Motivated by a recent study on individuals with eating disorders and type 2 diabetes, this report explores the application of computerized adaptive testing as a solution to the limitations of traditional fixed-form assessments. By leveraging item response theory, the adaptive test dynamically selects the most informative items for each respondent, substantially reducing the number of items administered while maintaining high measurement accuracy. Using a comprehensive dataset that included newly developed items for depression, anxiety, and positive affect, researchers evaluated item quality, confirmed statistical assumptions, and validated adaptive scores against a standardized benchmark. Simulations demonstrated strong correlations between adaptive and full-length assessments, with significant reductions in testing time and clear differentiation between clinical and healthy groups. The report presents key tables and figures—including test information curves, item parameter summaries, and validity metrics—to illustrate the technical rigor and practical benefits of adaptive testing. While the approach offers distinct advantages in reducing burden and enhancing comparability, it also requires robust item banks and careful calibration. Future directions include integration with digital health tools and expansion to diverse populations to improve mental health care delivery.",

          "abstract": "People often turn to others for support in managing their emotions. This process of social emotion regulation has become a key focus of research, given its connection to wellbeing and its ubiquity in human relationships. Social emotion regulation often unfolds via language, where a support provider verbally offers perspectives that aim to improve another person’s emotional state. But what linguistic features influence the efficacy of social emotion regulation? Inspired by research showing that emotion reactivity is lower in a bilingual’s second language (L2) than their first language (L1), here we tested whether social emotion regulation is also more effective in a bilingual’s L2 than their L1. We preregistered countervailing hypotheses, as regulation could either be more effective in L1 (due to increased familiarity and fluency), L2 (due to decreased emotional intensity), or equivalent across languages. In this study, 250 Spanish-English bilinguals (~100% women) were presented with negative images before hearing audio recordings either describing the negative contents of the image or reinterpreting those contents to be more positive (i.e., social reappraisal) in either L1 (Spanish) or L2 (English). Social reappraisals lowered participants’ negative affect in both languages, but reappraisal efficacy did not differ across languages. Nonetheless, participants reported lower negative affect overall on English than Spanish trials, extending prior work demonstrating reduced emotional intensity in L2. These results suggest that Spanish-English bilinguals may equally benefit from social reappraisal in both of their languages, guiding basic research on language, emotion, and cognitive control, as well as translational applications for bilinguals.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia, a cardinal feature of depressive disorders, is classically defined as an inability to experience pleasure, but modern definitions also encompass deficits in anticipatory pleasure and motivation. Validated scales and behavioural tasks have evolved alongside these conceptual shifts, and when integrated with computational modelling, may help reveal mechanisms underlying anhedonia. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant computational framework for studying anhedonia, but fails to fully capture anticipation and motivation. We reviewed the operationalization and measurement of anhedonia from a historical perspective, and conducted a scoping review and critical appraisal of 19 computational models using a structured appraisal guide to assess face, construct and predictive validity. We focussed on generative models (i.e., models that can simulate behavioural data) that were paired with measures of anhedonia in both clinical and non-clinical samples. Model types include RL models, RL integrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging, and models of decision making, effort expenditure, and selective attention. Our review suggests that anhedonia-related deficits span not only reward processing, but also executive and sensory processing. Models generally demonstrated face validity, lacked predictive validity, and showed construct validity for cognitive-behavioural, but not neurobiological, domains. We propose an integrative, systems neuroscience-inspired approach, which aligns with multidimensional definitions of anhedonia.",

Data in non-clinical voice hearers suggest that voice hearing may involve sensitivity to speech in degraded stimuli. This has yet to be examined in people with schizophrenia. In this case-control study, we presented sine-wave-speech (SWS; made by replacing the formants in speech with pure tone whistles) to people with schizophrenia (SZ, n=63) and healthy controls (HC; n=27). SWS is typically unintelligible on first exposure. However, once the listener knows that it is potentially intelligible as speech (by exposure to the unaltered speech template, which thus serves as a prior expectation), relatively high levels of comprehension are achieved. Our participants first listened to intelligible and unintelligible SWS and reported whether they heard speech. They were then exposed to the speech templates, and then the first phase was repeated. Compared to HC, people with SZ reported hearing more speech before template exposure. The Reveal increased both groups’ false alarms and reporting of speech, but there was no interaction with group. Change in hit rates after the Reveal correlated with hallucinations, which is consistent with a greater influence of the priors enhancement in SZ patients who hear voices. These findings suggest that people with SZ have stronger expectations of speech. This task has validity for hallucinatory voice hearing. It is also simple and convenient to administer, and may prove useful in detecting prodromal risk, as well as acute exacerbation in voice hearing.",

This study evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of a 30-minute, interactive web-based intervention providing psychoeducation around diversion and non-medical use, practice refusing medication requests, and strategies for medication adherence. College students (Mage=20.42 years; 74% female; 86% White) with current stimulant prescriptions from three US universities were randomized to the intervention (n=128) or attention-matched placebo (n=121) in a single-blind design, with 1- and 2-month boosters and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Primary outcomes were diversion, non-medical use, and diversion intentions; secondary outcomes were perceived norms, perceived risk, self-efficacy to resist diversion and non-medical use, and prescriber communication. Contrary to pre-registered hypotheses, intervention participants did not decrease in number of diversion or non-medical use episodes. There were small-to-medium effects on risk perceptions (d=0.39 [0.12-0.68]), perceived non-medical use norms (d=0.51 [0.24-0.76]), and self-efficacy to avoid non-medical use (d=0.47 [0.10-0.85]), but no effects on other outcomes. Exploratory analyses showed a 76% reduction in odds of any diversion (OR=0.24 [0.08-0.68]) and a 60% reduction of any non-medical use (OR=0.40 [0.21-0.77]) for intervention participants during the 6-month follow-up period. This brief intervention was acceptable and feasible to implement and evidenced some efficacy in increasing risk perceptions and self-efficacy and changing perceived norms. Since the intervention did not decrease number of diversion or misuse episodes, however, future intervention refinements may tailor content to different levels of diversion and misuse risk.",

          "abstract": "The domain of affectivity is broad and complex, with a rich history, albeit one that reflects a\nstruggle to operationalize the target of its focus. Nevertheless, affectivity is the foundation of an\nemerging field referred to as affective determinants of health (ADoH), offering insights into\nemotions, moods, and other subjective phenomena that qualify as affective experiences in human\nhealth and functioning. Presently, the ADoH field lacks a coherent model and assessment\nframework for healthcare and wellness practitioners to translate and leverage the affectivity\ndomain practically and effectively. This work endeavors to offer a practical definition of\naffectivity that allows ostensibly different subjective phenomena as loneliness, pain, depression,\nfatigue, and others to be construed as affective experiences, particularly when considered\nthrough the lens of stress, which can serve as a bridge between the extensive bodies of medical\nresearch on stress and the field of discrete affects more commonly studied by psychologists. This\napproach positions certain affects as risk factors that comprise a foundation for clinical practice\nand research. By reviewing some of the most pertinent literature on stress and other affective\nexperiences, viewed through the lens of stress, this work then argues for the routine assessment\nof key ADoH risk factors, and the use of those indicators as transdiagnostic targets in population\nhealth management, prevention, and point-of-care encounters.",

          "abstract": "Inadequate sex education and online misinformation create fertile ground for the proliferation of incorrect beliefs about sexuality. Despite their potentially harmful consequences for sexual and overall well-being, these sexuality myths remain understudied. In two samples (214 university students and 470 members of the general public), we assessed the prevalence and psychological correlates of sexuality myth endorsement. The most common myth was endorsed by over 60% of students and over 70% of the public. People endorsing more sexuality myths accepted fewer sexuality facts, endorsed more myths in other domains, and had a stronger conspiracy mentality. While virtually uncorrelated with sexual satisfaction and risk behavior, sexuality myth endorsement was associated with less confident sexual communication and, in the general public, lower life satisfaction and fewer safer sex practices. Participants demonstrated limited self-insight into their susceptibility to sexuality myths. These findings highlight the need for psychological research on sexuality myths and their consequences.",

          "authors": "Desiree R Jones; Monique Botha; Noah Sasson",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Autistic adults frequently experience social stigma, which may be compounded by additional marginalized identities such as race, gender, and sexual orientation. Black autistic adults, in particular, may face unique challenges at the intersection of racial bias and autism stigma. However, the experiences of autistic people with intersecting marginalized identities remain underexplored in research, contributing to a limited understanding of stigma’s impact across diverse communities.\nMethods: The current study sought to better characterize the social experiences of autistic people with intersecting identities, with an emphasis on Black autistic adults. 32 autistic adults (16 Black, 16 White) completed a semi-structured interview regarding their social experiences. Participants shared recent stories of peer exclusion, acceptance, discrimination and support that they had experienced, as well as their feelings surrounding these events. We recorded and transcribed these interviews and used an inductive, or data-driven, approach to thematic analysis to identify salient themes in the data. \nResults: We generated three intersectional themes, which encompassed the unique impact of stigma on those with intersecting identities. Specifically, these themes included: 1) identity-based discrimination shaped by race, gender, and LGBTQ+ status; (2) challenges in obtaining and processing an autism diagnosis; and (3) difficulties navigating personal identity, particularly among Black autistic participants. While autistic adults broadly reported stigma experiences, Black participants often described layered forms of exclusion related to both their race and autistic traits. Women and LGBTQ+ participants also reported distinct forms of marginalization and erasure. \nConclusion: These findings highlight how autism stigma intersects with other marginalized identities to shape social experiences. Black autistic adults, along with autistic women and LGBTQ+ autistic people, may encounter compounded barriers to acceptance, identity development, and belonging. These results underscore the need for more inclusive research and supports that attend to the diversity of autistic experiences.",

We investigated (1) migration-related ecological predictors of L1 reading; (2) within- and across-language predictors of reading; and (3) migration-related ecological moderators of cross-linguistic transfer from L1 phonological awareness (PA) to L2 reading. Our sample included 81 Syrian refugees between 10 and 17 years-old who resettled in Canada. Displacement in an Arabic-speaking country, shorter displacement durations, and older ages of L2 acquisition (L2 AoA) were associated with better L1 reading. Cross-linguistic transfer of phonological awareness (PA) to reading was overall greater in the L2-L1 direction, and migration experiences associated with better L1 reading were also associated with greater transfer in the L1-L2 direction. These findings highlight the need to understand refugees’ biliteracy in the context of their migration experiences.",

In this study we combined scientific insights with participatory research (focus groups with youth and interviews with parents and police officers) to identify risk and protective factors in misinformation susceptibility. A total of n = 1980 participants aged 18 to 34 completed the Misinformation Susceptibility Test alongside validated measures of cognitive, social and ideological scales. Results showed that more social media use, more conservative political orientation, and higher bullshit receptivity predicted poorer veracity discernment, while higher education, greater need to belong, more openminded thinking and identifying as male predicted better discernment. Importantly, not all forms of social media use predicted equal veracity discernment, with active engagement (e.g., posting and reacting) being associated with worse veracity, while passive engagement (e.g., browsing) was associated with better veracity. In addition, results from a network analysis suggested that digital maturity may exert indirect beneficial effects on veracity discernment. These findings underscore that misinformation susceptibility is shaped by a constellation of cognitive, social, educational, and ideological factors. Beyond fostering education and analytic reasoning skills, interventions may need to target digital behaviors, peer norms and social motivational needs to build resilience against misinformation in young adult populations.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events worldwide. Using nationally representative survey data from 142 countries (N = 128,093), I found that people who have experienced a climate-related hazard are more likely to consider climate change a very serious threat than people who have not experienced the same hazard within the same country. These effects are consistent across eleven hazard types, with the effect of experiencing a heatwave being comparable in magnitude to that of having a university education. The increase in risk perception among those who have experienced a climate-related hazard does not appear to be clearly amplified or attenuated by a person's resilience, which is calculated by combining individual, household, community, and societal factors. Large differences in the effects are observed across countries for some hazards (e.g., droughts, heatwaves, and floods), whereas small differences are observed for others (e.g., hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires). At the country level, there does not appear to be an association between the proportion of people exposed to climate-related hazards and the proportion of people who perceive climate change as a threat. These results may help us anticipate public concern in a warming world and suggest promising avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "Neuroticism is one of the most consequential personality traits for individuals and society. Interventions that facilitate desired changes in this trait may thus have far-reaching benefits. Initial evidence supports that interventions can foster lasting neuroticism change, but the mechanisms, direction, and timing of these effects remain unclear. Although most personality theories posit that changes in broad, enduring personality traits are mediated via changes in momentary personality states and intermediary trait-relevant habits, there are few direct tests of this theorized bottom-up process. Using data from the Changing How I Live Life Study (N = 446), which examined a digital intervention to reduce neuroticism, we examined 1) the shape and magnitude of intervention-induced changes in neuroticism across three timescales, 2) the associations among these changes, and 3) whether these associations varied across intervention strategies targeting different levels of neuroticism. Changes in momentary neuroticism reliably predicted changes in daily and weekly measures of neuroticism and vice versa, and changes across all three timescales were correlated with changes in generalized trait neuroticism from pre- to post-intervention. Together, these results support the conceptual relevance and causal importance of both bottom-up (i.e., momentary, short-term → enduring, longer term) and top-down (i.e., enduring, long-term → momentary, short-term) processes of personality change. Overall, this study provided a key test of theoretical predictions about the process and directionality of intervention-induced personality change and, in doing so, helped elucidate the mechanisms of intentional personality change and generate insights about how to enhance intervention efficacy.",

However, previous research remained silent about whether these predictive abilities rely on shared cognitive mechanisms. In a highly powered and preregistered study, we investigated whether the ability to predict in social settings is related across different modalities by comparing participants’ performance of predicting others’ actions and action outcomes as well as inferring emotional states. The results indicate that performance on all three tasks is moderately correlated. Principal component analyses underscore these results by showing that all three tasks share a common component. We also examined participants’ confidence in their judgments and found that participants are unaware of how good they are in predicting others’ actions. Taken together, our findings suggest a shared cognitive basis for diverse forms of social prediction, while also highlighting a disconnect between subjective confidence and objective accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sleep problems are linked to negative mental health outcomes, both of which rise in prevalence during adolescence and young adulthood. Existing evidence-based sleep treatments are effective but remain largely inaccessible for this age group. Young people also have lower agency over structural barriers affecting sleep (e.g., home environment, school start times).\n\nMethod: Project Sleep is a digital single-session intervention (SSI) designed with feedback from young people to meet their unique sleep needs. Participants included individuals aged 13-25 with self-reported sleep problems (N=759, Mage=18.7; 48% white, 81% girls, 38% LGBTQ+). Socioeconomic status (SES) ranged from 1-10 (M=6.4, SD=1.7). Structural sleep barriers were reported by 45%: uncomfortable temperature (20%), exceess noise (17%), shared rooms (13%), excess light (10%), nighttime workers in the home (7%), unstable living conditions (2%). Participants rated perceived importance of sleep and making a change to sleep, readiness for change, and perceived control over sleep pre- and post-SSI. Moderation models assessed whether structural factors influenced outcomes. T-tests and correlations tested whether participants’ subjective feedback differed by structural barriers.\n\nResults: Those experiencing structural barriers improved similarly to peers. However, lower SES participants (p = .02) and those in high-noise environments (p = .01) experienced smaller gains in perceived control. Those living with nighttime workers improved less in sleep change importance (p = .002), and those in unstable living conditions (p = .02) and uncomfortable temperature environments (p = .04) improved less in sleep importance. Conversely, participants in shared rooms improved more in perceived control (p = .03). There were no differences in participants’ feedback about their experience of the SSI by structural barrier.\n\nConclusions: This brief, accessible SSI provides proximal support for youth with structural sleep barriers, though could benefit from further adaptation. Future research will work with young people experiencing structural sleep barriers to better address their needs.",

          "abstract": "Personality functioning, or Criterion A of the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders, captures deficits in intrapersonal and interpersonal capacities, is believed to be relatively malleable, and is associated with normal-range personality (e.g., Big Five traits). Questions about changes in personality functioning are of critical relevance for theory development and psychotherapeutic treatment of personality pathology, yet little is known about its longitudinal development. Using a sample of German-speaking young adults (N = 1,440; Mage = 25.57), we examined one-year unconditional and event-related development in self-reported personality functioning across four metrics of change, tested predictors of heterogeneity in event-related changes, and compared findings to self-reported Big Five traits. Generally, unconditional development of all personality constructs was very similar, but there were some trait- and metric-specific differences. Life events accounted for heterogeneity in unconditional development, but almost exclusively for personality functioning, suggesting it has a greater susceptibility to external influences than most Big Five traits. Event perceptions and initial personality levels sometimes predicted individual differences in event-related changes, mostly for mean-level effects, and initial personality functioning frequently moderated event-related changes in the Big Five whereas the reverse was less common. These findings provide further insight into the conceptual (dis)similarity of personality traits and personality functioning, inform joint theoretical frameworks, and may help advance personality disorder treatment by identifying conditions in which changes in personality pathology may be expected or best captured.",

          "abstract": "Haptic perception plays an integral role in how we interact with and make sense of the physical world. As research in this domain continues to expand across disciplines, conceptual ambiguities in terminology and theoretical frameworks persist. In this review, I address several of these ambiguities by proposing a more explicit account of notions often used implicitly. Following a brief overview of the physiological and mechanical foundations of skin-object interactions and the somatosensory system, I introduce working definitions for terms such as haptic cues, stimuli, and perceptual dimensions, along with related assumptions and misconceptions, specifically within the context of haptic perception. I here argue that the distinction between distal and proximal stimuli or cues–more commonly applied in visual perceptual psychology–can serve as a helpful framework in haptic research for distinguishing physical (object-level) and mechanical (interaction-level) inputs. I then review some of the most commonly studied haptic dimensions, including stimulus magnitude, shape, material and texture, motion and time, weight, and size, along with the cues thought to inform them. This is followed by an examination of the notion of stability in haptic perception–often referred to as constancy or invariance–and its relevance for understanding how the sensory system creates consistent and behaviorally relevant percepts under variable conditions and cues. The specific phenomenon of perceptual and sensory metamers is explored as a particularly compelling example of cue integration and perceptual stability. Finally, I consider the various levels at which haptic stimuli and cues can be manipulated in research. By operationalizing some of these more implicit notions, we can reduce conceptual ambiguity in the search for a clearer account of how stable haptic percepts are achieved.",

This review examines the effects of contingent feedback on human vocal development using reinforcement learning frameworks, based on an analysis of 70 empirical studies. A literature search using the terms \"vocal learning,\" \"vocal reinforcement,\" and \"vocal contingency\" identified three study categories: contingent imitation effects (12 studies), other contingent feedback effects (33 studies), and additional contingent feedback effects (21 studies). Analysis using the antecedent-behavior-consequence framework revealed that contingent responses increase vocal production rates and modify vocal quality, with contingent imitation being especially effective. Three effects accompany the increase in target behavior, including phonological change, collateral increase, and preparatory learning. Evidence also demonstrates other effects of contingent feedback, such as enhanced object recognition learning and longitudinal language development outcomes. In sum, empirical studies show that contingent feedbacks on human vocal behavior have reinforcement effects, a positive correlation with vocalization rate, and longitudinal effects on development. Thus, vocal learning is not merely imitative or developmental, but also shaped by structured environmental feedback.",

          "abstract": "When humans interact with artificial intelligence (AI), one desideratum is appropriate trust. Typically, appropriate trust encompasses that humans trust AI except when they either explicitly notice AI errors or when they are suspicious that errors could be present. So far, appropriate trust or related notions have been mainly investigated by assessing trust and reliance. In this contribution, we argue that these assessments are not sufficient to measure the complex aim of appropriate trust and the related notion of healthy distrust. We introduce and test the perspective of visual attention as an additional indicator for appropriate trust and draw conceptual connections to the notion of healthy distrust.\n\nTo test the validity of our conceptualization, we formalize visual attention using TVA and measure its properties potentially relevant to appropriate trust and healthy distrust in an image classification task. Thereby, we investigate participants’ attentional capacity and attentional weight towards correct and incorrect classifications. \nWe observe that misclassifications reduce attentional capacity compared to correct classifications. However, our results do not indicate that this reduction is beneficial for a subsequent judgment of the classifications. The attentional weighting is not affected by the classifications’ correctness but by the difficulty of categorizing the stimuli themselves. These results, their implications, and the limited potential for using visual attention as an indicator of appropriate trust and healthy distrust are discussed.",

Across four experiments, we investigated a potential solution: using artificial intelligence (AI)—specifically, the large language model-based chatbot, ChatGPT—to generate prequestions.  Experiment 1 found that AI-generated prequestioning enhanced learning of an educational text relative to simply reading.  Experiment 2 found that AI-generated questions and human-generated questions were equally effective at promoting learning.  Experiments 3-4 revealed that prequestioning with questions generated using different AI prompts aided learning relative to studying an AI-generated outline.

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal motor interactions are central to social life, yet it remains unclear how social cues relevant to detecting engagement are encoded in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that regions traditionally associated with mentalizing, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), co-activate with nodes of the Action Observation Network (AON) during motor engagement with others, pointing to a synergistic role in the processing of action features during interaction. Using fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we examined brain responses to reach-to-grasp actions varying in Goal (passing vs. placing), Perspective (2nd vs. 3rd person), and Gaze visibility, creating a gradient of perceived engagement. Our results show that the TPJ and premotor cortices, but not the dmPFC, displayed convergent neural geometry during action observation. Model- and cluster-based analyses further linked TPJ and AON regions in multiple representational spaces: left-hemisphere regions aligned with goal encoding, whereas right-hemisphere regions aligned with an Engagement model capturing first-person interaction. Critically, we demonstrate that the rTPJ and left premotor cortex share representational geometry for action perspective, directly coupling mentalizing and sensorimotor systems in the encoding of directional cues. By contrast, the dmPFC appeared representationally isolated from both TPJ and AON regions, with response patterns showing no similarity to Goal or Engagement models. This is consistent with accounts of its recruitment under richer interactive demands rather than selectivity for abstract action features. Together, these findings support a distributed, sensorimotor account of engagement encoding and reveal new functional links among key social cognition areas.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety is a prevalent and debilitating phenomenon. Although the DSM-5 offers useful classification guidelines, overlapping symptoms across categories of anxiety highlight the need for transdiagnostic approaches. Threat processing, closely linked to anxiety, offers a promising pathway for such exploration. Threat processing involves various neurocognitive and psychophysiological mechanisms, including visual cortical responses, physiological reactivity, and affective ratings. This study examined whether different anxiety subtypes could be identified based on individual differences in threat processing. A total of 211 undergraduate students were recruited, with 198 included in the analyses. Threat-related measures included attentional bias competition indices derived from Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials in the visual cortex, heart rate, skin conductance responses, and arousal/valence ratings. Anxiety-related measures included self-report questionnaires and momentary assessments using experience sampling methods. Latent profile analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Profile 1 (n=114; 58%) was labelled as “low psychophysiological but high psychological affective reactivity”, Profile 2 (n=59; 30%) as “low psychophysiological affective reactivity”, and Profile 3 (n=25; 13%) as “high psychophysiological affective arousal”. However, these different threat-related profiles did not reflect major differences in the anxiety-related measures, either in questionnaires or momentary assessments. These findings offer preliminary insight into distinct threat-processing profiles in anxiety and highlight the need for further research, especially with larger samples and more variance in anxiety.",

          "abstract": "The British Psychological Society (BPS) is the accrediting body for Psychology degrees in the United Kingdom. An accredited degree in Psychology is the first requirement for any student wishing to pursue further training in Psychology professions governed by the BPS (e.g., clinical psychology, educational psychology, health psychology) and confers Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership of the BPS. While most students gain this status through completing an accredited undergraduate degree in Psychology, an alternative route is to complete an accredited postgraduate Master’s programme in Psychology, often known as a “conversion course”. In this chapter, we discuss the demographics of the diverse students who complete these popular programmes and the unique challenges that conversion programmes present to both students and staff. We describe some practical innovations that can be implemented to address some of these challenges and ensure that students graduating from accredited Master’s have a positive student experience.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory formation requires integrating multisensory information. Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

          "abstract": "In the rubber hand illusion (RHI), participants report ownership of a fake hand which is stroked in synchrony with their own concealed hand, with lower ownership ratings for asynchronous stroking. This effect has been historically attributed to multisensory integration. However, such a pattern of results is consistent with experimental demand characteristics, and an alternative theory proposes that the RHI is an effect of phenomenological control (PC; the trait ability to change experience to satisfy goals). To date, support for a PC theory of the RHI has been limited to correlational evidence. Here we conduct a pre-registered causal test of the relative contribution of these two proposed mechanisms in RHI effects. XX high PC participants (top 10%) were tested in an RHI procedure and the classic effects of greater response for synchrony than asynchrony were/were not replicated. The procedure was then repeated following imaginative suggestions for a reversal of the classic effect (i.e. greater synchrony than asynchrony effects). Ratings of ownership and proprioceptive drift were/were not modulated by suggestion. Effects for ownership and drift were/were not reversed.  PC does/does not dominate over multisensory mechanisms in RHI ownership of a fake hand and proprioceptive drift.",

To meet emerging professional demands, training programmes must also now consider skill development beyond traditional research and clinical practice to equip graduates with contemporary competencies, including skills such as science communication. In this chapter, we discuss an Irish perspective on approaching this challenge, drawing on innovative methods we use to optimise competency development in undergraduate and postgraduate psychology education related to clinical topics. We explore how capacity-building in evidence synthesis methods and science communication can prepare students to facilitate the responsible and informed use of research evidence by others. Alongside this, we examine the clinical competency framework through examples and critically appraise considerations for training future psychologists.

This study aimed to determine service-level, user-level and staff-level barriers in accessing/delivering care and service user satisfaction from the perspective of mental health practitioners. Hence, a Staff Perspectives on Service User Satisfaction and Barriers to Help Seeking Scale was created using modifications to validated questionnaires to measure (1) service user satisfaction, (2) service user level barriers, (3) service-level barriers, and (4) staff-level barriers. Results indicated a significant moderate positive relationship between service-level barriers and staff-level barriers. The relationship suggests interconnected challenges, where barriers related to the service may directly impact perceived barriers from staff. Future research should compare service user satisfaction outcomes from both the staff and the service users’ perspectives and gather further insights from service users.",

Currently used screening tools are brief and cost-effective, but there is a lack of understanding of their reliability over time as well as whether responses are influenced by demographic or clinical factors. Aims: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of two commonly used screening tools as well as their associations with current mood states and other participant characteristics. Methods: 331 adult patients with a diagnosis of BD completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Symptom Checklist-32 (HCL-32) as well as measures of mood online at baseline and three months later. Results: The MDQ was found to have low reliability with poor internal consistency (α= 0.531; α= 0.647 at respective timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.582). The HCL-32 was more reliable with good internal consistency (α= 0.815 at both timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.725). MDQ scores were significantly, positively associated with comorbidities and current symptoms of activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age and years since last hospitalisation. The HCL-32 was also significantly positively correlated with activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age, years since diagnosis and years since last hospitalisation. BD-I patients scored higher than other BD-subtypes. Mood state was the only variable with a significant change over time. Conclusions: The HCL-32 appeared more reliable than the MDQ, although all participants needed to exceed an MDQ threshold at baseline to participate in the study, which may have biased our results.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatric assistance dogs may offer a promising form of support for individuals with severe mental health challenges, yet systematic research remains limited, particularly among civilians, as most existing studies have focused on veterans or other uniformed populations. This article reports findings from three complementary studies examining the effects of psychiatric assistance dogs on the quality of life of adolescents and young adults in the Netherlands (16–30 years) with severe psychosocial problems. In a cross-sectional questionnaire study (n = 141), participants who had lived with their dog for more than two years reported significantly higher quality of life than those with shorter partnerships. A six-month longitudinal study (n = 9) showed significant increases in quality of life across 12 repeated measurements among participants who had only recently been matched with their dogs. Qualitative interviews (n = 13) provided further insight, revealing an initial adjustment period followed by improvements in psychological and social well-being. Thematic analysis highlighted hope (seeing a future again), enhanced social participation and independence, and companionship with the dog as the most prominent benefits mentioned in the interviews. Taken together, the three studies provide converging evidence that psychiatric assistance dogs can meaningfully enhance daily functioning, quality of life, and social connectedness for young civilians with mental health difficulties. Importantly, this research demonstrates measurable and robust benefits, showing that the impact of psychiatric assistance dogs extends beyond stories and into demonstrable improvements in people’s lives, provided the dog’s welfare is safeguarded.",

          "abstract": "Objectives:  Research shows that innocent suspects tend to be forthcoming in investigative interviews, often providing truthful accounts even if this involves revealing potentially self-incriminating information. This could leave them vulnerable to being misclassified as guilty. While such behaviour is often attributed to a belief in the exonerating power of truth, little is known about the decision-making processes involved. This study explored the reasoning and expectations of innocent suspects regarding the main verbal counter-interrogation strategy they would use in a specific scenario.\nResearch questions: We had three research questions. First, what verbal counter-interrogation strategy regarding truthfulness do participants expect to use in the situation outlined in the vignette? Second, what is their reasoning behind pursuing said strategy? Third, do participants expect their strategy to be successful in convincing the police of their innocence and why?\nMethod: We conducted twelve semi-structured interviews with university students and members of the general population based in the Midlands, UK. We analysed the data using thematic analysis and identified four overarching themes.\nResults: Eleven of the twelve participants indicated they would provide a completely truthful account. However, their expectations about the strategy’s effectiveness varied. While many discussed reasons aligned with the phenomenology of innocence (PoI) mindset, participants also raised various other aspects in relation to their choice of strategy and their beliefs about its effectiveness, namely considerations around evidence, risks of lying, and perceived credibility. \nConclusions: The findings support the idea that the PoI is prevalent among truth-tellers. However, our results also suggest that additional considerations seem to be relevant in their decision-making. Based on the data, we identified the subjective expected utility (SEU) model as a potentially useful framework for understanding how innocent suspects choose their counter-interrogation strategy, which can also explain findings from previous research, and we propose it be tested in future studies.",

Currently, little is known about childhood predictors for these outcomes.\n\nMethod\nPubMed, PsychInfo, WoS, and EMBASE were searched until June 2024. Eligible studies investigated childhood predictors of persistent ADHD, substance use disorders (SUD), conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and/or anxiety disorders in adults diagnosed with childhood ADHD (PROSPERO #CRD42022320887). Meta-analytic models were tested when N ≥3 for a predictor with similar effect measures, otherwise predictors were discussed narratively when N ≥2. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess study quality. \n\n Results\nThe selected 36 studies included 119 predictors, with 10 predictors eligible for meta-analyses. History of stimulant treatment (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.28-2.75, p = .001) was associated with increased, and higher childhood IQ with decreased (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.00, p =.039), risk of ADHD persistence in adulthood. ADHD persistence was associated with increased risk of SUDs (OR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.53-3.17, p =.004) and MDD (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.71-5.95, p &lt;.001). Narratively reviewed predictors of fair/good quality studies showed potential predictors for ADHD persistence (i.e., ADHD combined type, hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, anxiety disorders, externalizing problems, social dysfunctioning, and socioeconomic status).\n\n Conclusion\nWe confirmed earlier reported childhood predictors (i.e., stimulant treatment history, ADHD persistence) and identified potential new predictors (i.e., childhood anxiety disorders, social problems, socioeconomic status) for psychiatric outcomes of ADHD.

National-level sabre fencers performed a ten-minute assault with eye-tracking technology measuring their gaze behaviour. Results indicated that QE was significantly longer before successful touches compared to unsuccessful ones (t(9) = 2.61, p =.014, dz = 0.83). Additionally, the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations were higher during defensive actions than offensive actions (all ts(9) &gt; 4.34, ps ≤ .001, dzs&gt; 1.37).

          "abstract": "Action cancellation is thought to decline with age, contributing to impairments in executive function and overall motor performance. While age-related deterioration of reactive inhibition (stopping an action in response to an external signal) is well-established, less is known about how ageing affects proactive inhibition (preparatory mechanisms which increase the chance that an action can be successfully stopped). This study examined how proactive and reactive inhibitory processes, assessed via changes in corticospinal excitability (CSE) and behaviour, vary as a function of ageing during a modified stop signal task. Participants made bimanual responses to an imperative signal and attempted to cancel one (selective stopping) or both (global stopping) responses, based on presentation of a stop signal. We compared reactive stopping to proactive stopping where cues informed participants which hand/s may have to stop. Using Bayesian model averaging analyses, we found that proactive cueing increased reaction times in both groups, indicative of proactive slowing. Furthermore, older adults exhibited greater slowing of ongoing action components (unilateral responses) following successful selective cancellation, compared to younger adults. However, there was strong evidence against age difference in CSE modulation. Specifically, both age groups exhibited effector-specific CSE modulation following proactive cues, with reduced MEP amplitudes in the hand that might need to stop, and increased amplitudes in the hand that was certain to respond (contralateral to the hand that may have to stop). These findings suggest that while ageing affects stopping behaviour, proactive inhibitory mechanisms which modulate CSE may remain preserved.",

Spearman’s rank-order correlations showed weak associations between reading measures and generalised or social anxiety, but moderate to strong associations between reading-specific anxiety (general and social) and all reading measures. Grade and gender did not moderate these relationships. Finally, Fisher’s tests provided no evidence that comorbid attention or language difficulties were linked to higher anxiety symptoms among poor secondary school readers.\nConclusions: The findings of study this provide evidence for a moderate to strong association between reading ability and reading anxiety and motivate further investigations into the causal mechanisms that may create and then maintain links between reading and wellbeing in secondary school students.",

          "abstract": "Social identity threat (SIT) is a situational stressor that increases arousal and negative affect, biases memory encoding towards domain-specific negative affect, and impairs performance when women are outnumbered by men.  One consequence of these effects could be that women develop learned aversions towards stigmatized STEM domains. Four studies tested whether stereotypic STEM images (STEMIs) prompt aversive-like responses that predict SIT-like outcomes, including underperformance in SIT contexts and more negative SIT-oriented memories over time.  Using a dot-probe paradigm, Study 1 found that only SIT women exhibited greater arousal responses to STEMIs compared to stereotypic non-STEM images (NonSTEMIs), perceived STEMIs as more negatively arousing compared to men, and underperformed; men in this context showed a similar arousal response to STEMIs and NonSTEMIs and performed better. Study 2 replicated this effect among women STEM majors and linked aversive responses to more negative affect laden memories for the STEM lab experience five weeks later. Using EEG, Study 3 found that enhanced processing of STEMIs presented during an attentional blink task (indexed via increased communication between occipital and prefrontal cortical regions) predicted underperformance on a math test among SIT women but marginally better performance among men. Study 4 mitigated SIT underperformance effects among women utilizing a dot-probe training paradigm that blunted arousal responses to STEMIs; instructing men to attend to STEMIs facilitated their performance.  STEM aversions may thus facilitate SIT-like effects, possibly defining what the “threat” in SIT is, however, blunting aversions can attenuate these effects when women work alongside men in STEM performance situations.",

          "abstract": "Despite increased focus on well-being in the psychological sciences in recent years, cross-sectional and group-level methods fall short of capturing the dynamics of individual people’s well-being in daily life. Such an investigation is especially important for young adults who are in a developmental phase in which they are more likely to experience fluctuations in their daily lives. We used ecological momentary assessment over one week in two samples of first-year college students (Sample 1, N = 103, assessments = 2,535; Sample 2, N = 76, assessments = 1,796) and a dynamic network approach (Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis). This approach estimates, within each person, how well-being elements fluctuate across days and co-vary with one another, recovering both their differentiation (exclusivity) and their interdependence (connectivity). In this approach, elements of well-being—measured via the PERMA framework—are modeled as a dynamic network to address the following research questions: (1) How do elements of well-being in young adults’ daily life form a dynamic network? (2) Does the structure of well-being hold across all young adults, or is there heterogeneity? (3) Is there synchrony among well-being elements, and do they drive a person’s well-being network? Findings suggest that while group-level dynamic well-being networks align with theoretical models, each person’s individual experiences vary significantly, with each person demonstrating unique well-being network structures and synchronous elements. These findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in well-being, highlighting the necessity for personalized approaches to understand and promote well-being among young adults.",

          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "abstract": "Tractography is a key component of efforts to map brain connectivity. As a rapidly-evolving field of neuroscience, current tractography methods are diverse, often varying across research laboratories and different software pipelines. Therefore, it suffers from a lack of standardization leading to inconsistencies in results, which can limit reproducibility, and affect the robustness needed for research and clinical applications of these methods. Variability in data acquisition procedures, inconsistencies in spatial referencing schemes and implementations, and anatomical heterogeneity —at the individual level, across the lifespan, and across species— hinders comparative analyses. Additionally, the lack of consensus on best practices complicates the development of robust automated quality control pipelines and limits the clinical translation of tractography-based procedures. Establishing standardized protocols for acquisition, preprocessing, and tractography reconstruction are critical towards enabling reliable tract-specific analyses, facilitating cross-study harmonization, and supporting replicable large-scale population studies. The present article provides an overview of the current challenges in tractography standardization and identifies the key aspects that require standardization for reliable, reproducible, and robust tractography.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy-supportive parenting is essential for positive developmental outcomes for youth whereas psychological control can have detrimental effects. When parents’ psychological needs are met, they are more likely to show autonomy-supportive parenting; and when parents report greater psychological need frustration, they are more likely to parent with psychological control. We tested how parental psychological needs can predict adolescent internalizing mood through parenting practices in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries for 14 days to rate parental psychological needs, parenting practices, and adolescent internalizing mood. We conducted multilevel mediation analyses (i.e., 1-1-1 and 2-2-2 design) to examine the effect of parental psychological needs on adolescent internalizing mood through parent parenting practices. When parents’ daily psychological needs were met, they practiced more supportive parenting practices in daily life, which in turn was associated with better adolescent mood. Most of these mediation effects were not found when examining long-term characteristics. Our findings point towards the importance of disentangling day-to-day fluctuations in behaviors and experiences than to long-term associations between them in families’ daily lives to better understand family dynamics and adolescent well-being.",

          "abstract": "Although sports-themed video games (SVG) are some of the most popular and profitable video games, there is a lack of research regarding video gaming and gambling behaviors of SVG players. To date, research suggests that sports fandom may drive SVG play, as engagement in SVGs is an extension of sports consumption. Evidence also suggests that sports fandom is associated with more sports betting and other gambling. Despite these findings, research has yet to explore the differences between SVG players and non-SVG (NSVG) players across their video gaming and gambling engagement including measures of problem video gaming (PVG) and problem gambling (PG). The present study addresses this gap in the literature using online survey data from two independent samples from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk: N = 1,990, 53.1% Male; Mage = 40.14, SD = 11.80) and Academic Prolific (N = 2,212, 68.4% Male, Mage = 33.18, SD = 9.94). Results showed that SVG players had higher frequency video gaming and gambling, and greater prevalence of PVG and PG relative to NSVG players. Further, SVG players also reported higher frequency of video gaming-related gambling, such as loot box purchases and e-sports gambling, suggesting a strong overlap of video gaming and gambling among SVG players. This is the first study to show a significant risk for SVG players in terms of PG. The discussion focuses on the next steps for research.",

          "abstract": "The “loot box” (LB) monetization strategy has established itself as a dominant and controversial feature in the world of video games. While numerous studies have found that gambling and gaming behaviors may predict LB purchases, sometimes to problematic levels, there is a dearth of research regarding systematic reviews with non-behavioral predictors. Likewise, while LBs may have become mainstream, there is a notable lack of agreed definition for this microtransaction, with researcher proposing their own definition with nuances that may make it difficult to group findings from different studies. The aim of this study is to review the literature on the definitions of LB, and the sociodemographic and psychological predictors of LB purchases. Following this strategy, 1540 articles were found from SCOPUS, EBSCOHost, PubMed and Google Scholar. After screening and eligibility procedures, 22 articles were included and analyzed. Findings show that while there are some traits from LBs that are reported in several studies when being defined, a discrepancy exists between studies on what characteristics are included in the definitions, which may affect how LBs are used in research. It was also found that few studies use sociodemographic variables as predictors, with results beings mixed. More importantly, psychological predictors found were divided into two subgroups: psychological (e.g., reward sensitivity, impulsivity, self-esteem modification and FOMO) and motivational (e.g., fun-seeking, desire for progression, cosmetics and completion). These results show that there is a wide array of psychological and motivational predictors that may overlap, thus more research on the topic is needed.",

Given the growing recognition of teacher well-being as a critical factor in educational quality, validating reliable assessment tools is essential. To assess the reliability and validity of the scale in this setting, a 16-item Spanish-adapted version of the TWBS was administered online to a sample of 304 EFL teachers working in diverse Chilean school environments. Furthermore, a two-stage validation design was implemented, using independent samples. The results demonstrated that the TWBS exhibits strong psychometric properties, including excellent reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.903, which confirms its high internal consistency. Additionally, both Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) supported the scale’s structural validity, indicating a well-fitting model for the collected data. These findings are crucial for establishing the TWBS as a valid and reliable instrument in the Chilean context, which ensures its effectiveness in measuring key dimensions of teachers’ professional well-being.",

We then collected subjective ratings of semantic similarities between pairs of meanings/senses within a word and investigated their relation with the similarity of the sensorimotor profiles to corroborate that the sensorimotor-based similarity was semantic in nature. Our results speak in favour of sensorimotor information as a component of representations of polysemous senses / homonymous meanings, and advise future norming studies to take into account lexical ambiguity.",

We used nationally representative data from the first wave of the Global Flourishing Study (N = 202,898) to explore the distribution of R/S connection in 22 geographically and culturally diverse countries and identify potential differences in connection to a religion or spirituality across nine sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, employment status, years of education, immigration status, frequency of religious service attendance, religious affiliation, racial/ethnic identity). Our descriptive analysis supported substantial cross-national variation in the proportion of people who endorsed ‘often/always’ feeling a connection to a religion or spirituality, ranging from 23% in Japan to 85% in South Africa. We estimated country-level descriptive statistics for a connection to a religion or spirituality in each sociodemographic category, and then performed a series of random effects meta-analyses to aggregate results across countries. Meta-analytic results provided evidence of subgroup differences in R/S connection for religious service attendance and (to a lesser extent) age, with the highest R/S connection observed among people who attended religious services.",

Sociocultural factors, like religion, urbanization, and affluence, are hypothesized to shape people’s spiritual connections with nature, yet there are no systematic cross-cultural surveys of ecospirituality that can speak to this hypothesis. Study 1 used a sample of religious people from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to assess how these sociocultural factors relate to ecospirituality. Study 2 assessed the same factors in a sample of religious and non-religious Americans (N = 3,329). The overall pattern of results suggested that greater religiosity, urbanization, and affluence contribute to greater ecospirituality across cultural and religious contexts. Some differences in the pattern of results were found in the sample of Americans, suggesting that psychological surveys on this topic conducted in the United States may not generalize across cultures.

This study employs a large cross-cultural sample of religious individuals from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to (1) estimate the link between ecospirituality and three pro-environmental outcomes: behavioural intentions to make sustainable decisions, policy support, and financial donations to a pro-environmental organization; and (2) assess the pathways by which an ecospiritual worldview translates to pro-environmentalism. The results of pre-registered analyses showed that ecospirituality positively predicted each of the pro-environmental outcomes similarly across diverse cultural and religious populations. Even more, the link between ecospirituality and pro-environmental outcomes were consistently mediated by the same variables across cultures. In short, ecospirituality unites diverse cultural worldviews in motivating care for nature by fostering a sense of responsibility, gratitude and efficacy, making it a potentially powerful foundation for global environmental stewardship.",

          "abstract": "Successful communication requires that listeners not only identify speech, but do so while maintaining performance on other tasks, like remembering what a conversational partner said or paying attention while driving. This set of four experiments systematically evaluated how audiovisual speech—which reliably improves speech intelligibility—affects dual-task costs during speech perception (i.e., one facet of listening effort). Results indicated that audiovisual speech reduces dual-task costs in difficult listening conditions (those in which visual cues substantially benefit intelligibility), but may actually increase costs in easy conditions—a pattern of results that was internally replicated multiple times. This study also presents a novel dual-task paradigm specifically designed to facilitate conducting dual-task research remotely. Given the novelty of the task, this study includes psychometric experiments that establish positive and negative control, assess convergent validity, measure task sensitivity relative to a commonly-used dual-task paradigm, and generate performance curves across a range of listening conditions. Thus, in addition to evaluating the effects of audiovisual speech across a wide range of background noise levels, this study enables other researchers to address theoretical questions related to the cognitive mechanisms supporting speech processing beyond the specific issues addressed here and without being limited to in-person research.",

We hypothesized that a six-factor structure of sensitivity would be better supported than more parsimonious alternatives. We hypothesized that sensitivity would be orthogonal to gender and gender socialization, and that there would be measurement invariance between women’s and men’s reports of sensitivity. We found greater support for a multidimensional measure of sensitivity over more parsimonious alternatives. We did not find support for measurement invariance between women’s and men’s reports of sensitivity, challenging assumptions about sensitivity. We speak to the value of using a multidimensional measurement of sensitivity in ongoing inquiries, while also pointing to nuances for what could be important correlated and confounds of sensitivity reports.",

          "abstract": "What role does the study of natural language play in the task of developing a unified theory and common model of cognition? Language is perhaps the most complex behaviour that humans exhibit, and, as such, is one of the most difficult problems for understanding human cognition. Linguistic theory can both inform and be informed by unified models of cognition. We discuss (1) how computational models of human cognition can provide insight into how humans produce and comprehend language and (2) how the problem of modelling language processing raises questions and creates challenges for widely used computational models of cognition. Evidence from the literature suggests that behavioural phenomena, such as recency and priming effects, and cognitive constraints, such as working memory limits, affect how language is produced by humans in ways that can be predicted by computational cognitive models. But just as computational models can provide new insights into language, language can serve as a test for these models. For example, simulating language learning requires the use of more powerful machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and vector symbolic architectures, and language comprehension requires a capacity for on-the-fly situational model construction. In sum, language plays an important role in both shaping the development of a common model of the mind, and, in turn, the theoretical understanding of language stands to benefit greatly from the development of a common model.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

          "abstract": "A Theory of Magnitude (AToM) (Walsh, 2003; Walsh, 2014) attempts to explain a\nvisuo-spatial bias observed across magnitude processing domains (e.g., numerical, temporal).\nIt proposes a generalised processing system which maps mental representations onto space\nwith magnitude increasing with rightwards and upwards perceptions. As early findings\nsuggest linguistic magnitude processing may have an AToM consistent horizonal spatial bias\n(Myachykov et al., 2020), AToM would suggest a similar vertical spatial bias should be\nobserved in linguistic magnitude, wherein upwards space is associated with processing larger\nmagnitudes. This study utilised random word generation upon alternating upwards and\ndownward head nods to assess the presence of a vertical spatial bias in the magnitude of\nrandomly accessed linguistic representations. Participants each produced 50 random English\nwords resulting in a dataset of 2650 words. Syllabic Length, Semantic Size, Plurality and\nCountability were analysed as proxies for linguistic magnitude. Results found vertical Nod\nDirection was not associated with any linguistic magnitude measure. These findings fail to\nsupport AToM’s prediction of a vertical spatial bias in the magnitude of randomly accessed\nlinguistic representations. Further research approaches aiming to explore both a vertical\nspatial component of linguistic magnitude processing and cross-domain interactions between\nlinguistic, spatial and other magnitude processing are suggested to further evaluate how\nsuccessfully AToM explains linguistic magnitude processing.",

          "abstract": "We examined the development of reading comprehension and its neural underpinnings in the context of disrupted education among Syrian refugee children and youth resettled in Canada. One hundred participants  (Mage = 13.78, SD = 2.55) completed standardized assessments of language comprehension, decoding, and reading comprehension, and participated in functional near-infrared spectroscopy while completing a decoding task. Consistent with the Simple View of Reading (SVR), both language comprehension and decoding significantly predicted reading comprehension. However, the relative role of language comprehension and decoding to reading comprehension differed depending on the extent of educational disruptions experienced during displacement and migration. Decoding predicted reading comprehension for children with minimal education disruptions. However, when educational disruptions were longer due to prolonged displacement, the relation between decoding and reading comprehension was limited, and instead, the relation between language comprehension and reading comprehension was greater. These results suggested that in the context of limited formal literacy instruction during displacement, language comprehension may assume a compensatory function for poor decoding ability. Neuroimaging showed that greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) predicted better reading comprehension, suggesting compensatory recruitment beyond the typical left-lateralized reading network. Cluster analyses identified distinct reading profiles that were predicted by neural activation patterns and educational disruption. Children with the highest reading comprehension scores showed greater right IFG activation and lower activation in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG)–a region associated with decoding. Our study extends the SVR by demonstrating that the contribution of decoding and language comprehension to reading comprehension depends on educational experience, and that multiple neural pathways can support reading comprehension after educational disruption. Practically, these results highlight the need for individualized reading interventions and the urgency of minimizing educational disruption for displaced children and youth.",

          "abstract": "When creating art, artists must make constant decisions with each pen stroke in order to achieve their goals of the piece. One common goal is to create something memorable—a piece that will persist in the memories of the observer. However, an open question is how different artistic decisions impact the memorability of a piece as it is being created. To test this question, we utilized a neural network (ResMem) to track the frame-by-frame changes in memorability for 50 videos of the creation of digital art pieces. We tested this neural network’s predictions via a human memory experiment (N=399), finding that ResMem’s predictions significantly correlated with human memory performance across the art creation process. We then collected multiple measures of each piece’s creation process, including low-level visual features, mid-level visual features, neural network-derived features, artistic features, and spatial properties. We find that changes in details and low-level visual features do not contribute to the memorability of a piece; rather more global measures of simplicity and variability relate to the memorability of a piece. Further, larger changes (e.g., blocking, sketching), particularly below the horizon of the image, make the biggest impacts on memorability. Importantly, we find that the memorability of a piece is largely set from the very beginning, and changes that occur later have diminishing impact on the memorability of a piece. These findings have important implications for both artists and psychologists in thinking about the factors that impact memory during the creation of an image.",

          "authors": "MohammadHossein Manuel Haqiqatkhah; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically,  these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates (off by many hours) with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on the same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the practical severity of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

          "abstract": "Facilitation in word processing, identified as faster responses to semantically related words, has traditionally been viewed as evidence of the core cognitive mechanisms that support language processing. However, it remains uncertain whether this facilitation arises from bottom-up spreading activation, top-down prediction, or a combination of both. To address this, we developed a novel semantic priming paradigm that systematically manipulates local contextual buildup and applied drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to differentiate the decision dynamics associated with each mechanism. In our experiment, 20 participants performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one (short condition) or three (long condition) semantically related primes. We found that, as the local semantic context became more enriched (short vs. long condition), participants adjusted their decision strategies, engaging different processing mechanisms. In the short condition, participants relied on spreading activation, as indicated by increased drift rate (faster evidence accumulation), suggesting that a single related prime pre-activated the target's mental representation. In contrast, in the long condition, reduced boundary separation (participants required less evidence before responding) implied greater confidence driven by enhanced predictability from multiple primes, consistent with the predictive processing account. Together, our findings offer new insights into theoretical models of language processing; demonstrate the practical relevance of DDM in language processing and offer potential implications for translational research.",

Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

          "abstract": "Background: \n22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic condition associated with a wide range of physical, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments. This condition is often associated with difficulties in social functioning (SF), frequently exacerbated by psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and psychotic symptoms, which are particularly common in this population. This study adopted a multi-method approach to embrace the complexity of the SF assessment and identify distinct SF profiles in youths with 22q11DS. Association with mental health were examined, with the aim of guiding more targeted and individualized interventions.\nMethods: \nFifty-five adolescents and young adults with 22q11DS and 65 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls were recruited. SF was assessed using a combination of measures in both groups, and a latent profile analysis was conducted on the full sample to identify distinct SF profiles. Mental health was assessed in both groups using standardized questionnaires; in addition, individuals with 22q11DS completed clinical interviews to assess psychiatric comorbidities.\nResults: \nThree distinct SF profiles emerged from a Latent Profile Analysis: An Above profile composed exclusively of TD individuals; an Average profile including both TD and 22q11DS participants; and a Below profile consisting mainly of individuals with 22q11DS. These profiles differed on key SF variables. Within the 22q11DS group, individuals in the Below profile exhibited more pronounced negative and disorganized psychotic symptoms and a greater number of psychiatric comorbidities than those in the Average profile, whose SF was more similar to that of TD individuals.\nConclusions: \nThis study improves our understanding of SF in individuals with 22q11DS by highlighting both inter-group differences and intra-group variability. The identification of three distinct SF profiles (above, average, below) reveals a gradient of SF and underscores that SF difficulties are not solely linked to cognitive impairments but also to psychopathology. The findings emphasize the importance of using a combination of complementary measures to capture the complex nature of SF and to guide more nuanced, individualized interventions.",

We conducted continuous GPS tracking of 171 first-time parents in Denmark during maternity leave and paternity leave, combined with postnatal depression and sleep quality assessments. Using Bayesian multilevel models with zero-inflated distributions, we revealed three key insights. First, parental leave restricted spatial mobility for both mothers and fathers, but with distinct patterns: fathers spent more time at home yet showed greater spatial dispersion when mobile. Second, parental leave coincided with elevated depression scores and poorer sleep quality for the on-leave parent, with mothers showing consistently higher depression levels than fathers. Third, parents with more depression symptoms showed increased probability of staying home entirely and reduced mobility range when mobile. These findings demonstrate population-level associations between GPS-derived mobility patterns and parental depression, even within the constrained spatial context of parental leave.",

In Experiment 3, participants completed the task when 50% or 80% of trials were matches and used the Same/Different or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options.

          "abstract": "Hierarchical models are widely used to estimate group- and individual-level parameters in cognitive and behavioral research. When model parameters are bounded within a particular range, it is common practice to estimate the group-level parameters on the unbounded real line and then map the estimated mean onto the desired bounded parameter range using a nonlinear transformation. We show that the way group-level estimates are commonly computed with this approach can produce systematic biases because it ignores within-group variability. We derive correct expressions for computing the group-level mean that take within-group variability into account. Using formal derivation, simulation, and reanalyses of empirical data, we demonstrate (using cumulative prospect theory as an example) how the commonly used but incorrect approach distorts parameter estimates. In a reanalysis of age differences in risky choice, we find that although the distortions do not alter qualitative conclusions about group differences, they can affect the size of such differences and lead to different psychological interpretations of the groups' behavior. We point out and elaborate that the underlying issue is general and can arise in a wide range of hierarchical models. Our results highlight a subtle but consequential issue in hierarchical modeling and we provide concrete solutions for ensuring the validity of group-level inferences about behavior.",

In this game, the players depend on each other’s ability to make good decisions to succeed. In two studies (N = 87, N = 281), we collected data on the understanding of an artificial agent, operationalized as the ability to predict its actions and the skill at the task itself. The participants improve at predicting the agent’s actions and at their subtasks in the game over time. Following a misunderstanding, the participants’ performance at their subtask was worse, as measured by their actions’ quality, speed, and efficiency.

          "abstract": "As demand for problem-solving skills continues to grow, so does the need for efficient training methods. A potential method of achieving efficient training of problem-solving skills is to design a training programme that maximises transfer of learning between problem domains. However, current models of expert problem-solving make contrasting predictions about the conditions under which cross-domain transfer is possible. While pattern-recognition models using state-action associations allow only limited transfer to tasks with different actions, search-based models using state-value associations can reuse the same associations across tasks, potentially achieving greater transfer. In this study, we consider the case of transformation problem-solving tasks where each task uses a distinct and non-overlapping set of transformation rules. Participants trained using tasks from one taskset over four consecutive days and completed pre- and post-training probes on the untrained set. Training improved participants’ solution rate, efficiency, and decision speed, but there were no reliable improvements for the untrained tasks beyond what could be explained by direct practice during the probe blocks. We also observed a gradual reduction in the association between participants’ solution efficiency and their working memory capacity on the trained trials, suggesting a transition towards a problem-solving method less dependent upon working memory. We note that these findings contrast with the predictions of some search-based models of problem-solving expertise in which a rule-independent state-value function is reused across tasksets to decide actions. We discuss the implications of these results for future models of expert problem-solving and for the training of problem-solving skills.",

However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed. We make recommendations for research and practice to improve how young people in need are identified and supported.",

          "authors": "Erin Michelle Buchanan",
          "abstract": "Accurate numerical estimation underlies many aspects of cognition, from basic quantity judgments to complex decision-making. One domain where numerical reasoning is especially critical is memory, where individuals often must estimate the likelihood that one event or idea is associated with another. In this study, participants completed a free association task across multiple sessions to generate their own individualized word-pair norms. Later, they provided numerical probability judgments (0–100%) of how often they had produced each pair. These judgments were compared to collective free association norms, a matched group evaluating others’ pairs, and a traditional control group. Results showed that participants who judged their own pairs were significantly more accurate in estimating associative probabilities than control or matched groups, reflecting the benefits of expertise derived from repeated interaction with stimuli. However, systematic overestimation bias persisted, especially for weak associations, indicating that metacognitive sensitivity to probability differences remains limited. These findings highlight how expertise improves, but does not perfect, the ability to translate memory associations into numerical judgments, offering new insights into the intersection of numerical cognition, metacognition, and memory.",

          "abstract": "Sacrificial moral dilemmas require individuals to choose between allowing harm to several people or preventing this by actively causing harm to a smaller number of people. These dilemmas have been foundational in studying how people resolve conflicts between competing moral principles, with responses traditionally interpreted as reflecting either “utilitarian” concern for the greater good or “deontological” refusal to enact harm. Existing research relies almost exclusively on hypothetical scenarios. We confronted 794 participants across two studies with real-life consequential dilemmas involving minor but genuine physical harm. Participants decided whether to allow two confederates to receive painful electroshocks or shock a third confederate, and provided motivations for their decisions. Study 1 manipulated physical proximity to potential targets, while Study 2 examined how the gender composition of potential targets influenced decisions. Moreover, each participant faced this choice twice, allowing us to examine how prior outcomes influence subsequent moral decisions.\nResults show that responses to traditional hypothetical dilemmas moderately predict real-life behavior. Physical proximity and target gender had no significant effects on actual choices. When confronting the dilemma a second time, approximately one-third of participants switched their decision, primarily to distribute harm equitably across potential targets. Analysis of participants' motivations reveals a diverse spectrum of moral considerations beyond utilitarian-deontological frameworks, including fairness concerns, responsibility avoidance, and beliefs about shared versus individual suffering. Our findings invite scholars to expand current theoretical models to better capture the nuanced ways people approach sacrificial trade-offs in consequential, real-world situations.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces InterDIFNet, a multilabel classification neural network for detecting intersectional differential item functioning (DIF) in educational and psychological assessments, with a focus on small sample sizes. Unlike traditional marginal DIF methods, which often fail to capture the effects of intersecting identities and require large samples, InterDIFNet models uniform and non-uniform DIF across multiple intersectional groups simultaneously. The method utilizes an optimized thresholding procedure to balance power and Type I error control. A Monte Carlo simulation compared InterDIFNet to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) test and other intersectional DIF methods across varying sample sizes, numbers of groups, and DIF prevalence rates. Results show that when trained using TLP features, InterDIFNet consistently achieved higher power than TLP while maintaining comparable Type I error control, particularly in scenarios with three or more intersectional groups. An empirical application to real assessment data further demonstrated the method’s practical utility. InterDIFNet provides a scalable, data-driven solution for identifying intersectional DIF across multiple small sample groups.",

          "abstract": "Despite advancements in speech recognition technology, questions remain about model generalizability and how much models mirror human comprehension. These questions are addressed by comparing OpenAI's Whisper model and 75 human transcribers on 300 English sentences (20 speakers, half F, half M, half US-accented, half Spanish-accented). Sentences ended in 100 target words: 1⁄3 high-predictability sentences (The farmer milked the cows), 1⁄3 low- predictability (The farmer milked the nose), and 1⁄3 low-predictability+nonword (The marmer milked the nose). Target word transcription error rates were examined both in sentences and in isolation (recordings excised from same sentences). Errors decreased with increasing model size, but remained heightened for Spanish-accented vs. US-accented speech, roughly similar to human transcribers. Both models and humans benefited from higher sentence predictability. However, sentence context affected models and humans differently: humans benefited only from high- predictability sentences, while models benefited from any sentence context. Humans numerically outperformed the (best-performing) large model on isolated words and showed different error patterns, suggesting Whisper may have a restricted distribution of short utterances or may need lengthier acoustic context than humans. More varied training data and better context awareness, including speaker identity and pragmatic context, might improve ASR generalization.",

This approach reliably reveals early ramping activity starting one second or more before movement, but discounts the prior probability of slow ramping. We trained powerful machine-learning classifiers in a sliding window to discriminate between EEG data epochs that either do or do not culminate in a self-initiated movement. We found early ramping signals, but they were not predictive of impending movement. Instead, the ability to correctly classify movement from no-movement epochs emerged abruptly ~100 ms before action onset, while, using the traditional approach, we replicated the spurious finding of early predictability. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy, showing the neural commitment to act is a late-stage process that aligns with results on the timing of subjective experience and the ability to inhibit self-initiated movement.",

We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "abstract": "Background: Globally, many children learn to read exclusively in a second language (L2), but this phenomenon is understudied. Literacy typically reciprocally builds on pre-existing language knowledge, with phonological awareness (PA) and vocabulary predicting literacy outcomes, and themselves being impacted by literacy. Bilinguals demonstrate cross-linguistic transfer (CLT) of language skills from their first language (L1) to reading in L2, but this research primarily covers contexts where children have at least some level of L1 literacy. This raises the question of whether CLT occurs in the absence of L1 literacy, or if the reciprocal relation between language and literacy must be built in L1 before it can transfer to L2 reading.\nMethods: The current study examines the role of L1 and L2 language skills in supporting literacy in emergent readers in rural Côte d’Ivoire (n=1969, females = 912), between first and fifth grade. The broad range of ages both within and across grades allows us to examine how the age of first exposure to literacy impacts this relation. Results: We found robust evidence of CLT of PA, which was not moderated by age of literacy acquisition. Within-language support of literacy was moderated by age of literacy exposure, with literacy more strongly predicted by vocabulary and less by PA for those who started school on time. This effect fully mediated the detrimental impact of a late school start. Conclusions: These results have implications for theories of CLT and sensitive periods for literacy acquisition, and for efforts to reduce illiteracy in the Global South.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies concluded that listeners struggle to discriminate AI from human voices, but these studies used monotone-like speech and did not examine prosodic expressiveness, a key advantage of human over AI speakers. This study explores whether prosodic expressiveness facilitates human-AI voice discrimination. We recorded human prosodic speech with confident and doubtful expressions, trained AI models to replicate these prosodic patterns, had AI models generate new sentences, and then had human speakers produce equivalent prosodic expressions for the same sentences. In Experiment 1, we had 48 listeners rate humanlikeness and perceived confidence in 11,808 audio samples, finding that AI speech was consistently rated as less humanlike regardless of prosody. We selected 768 audios (AI × human, confident × doubtful prosody) for Experiment 2, where 80 listeners completed an identity discrimination task, telling whether two sounds were from the same speaker. Bayesian modeling results revealed near-ceiling performance for human-human/AI-AI pairs, with inconsistent prosodies decreasing accuracy by ~7%, while listeners do not easily categorize AI and human as sharing the same identity (~54% accuracy when prosody matches, dropping to ~36% when inconsistent). We found nonlinear effects of Wav2Vec2 acoustic distance on performance, with accuracy-reaction time synchronization supporting direct matching mechanisms over prototype-based processing. Human-AI/AI-human pairs showed unique patterns where larger acoustic distances prompted listeners to rely less on acoustic distance cues, unlike other conditions. Our study suggests that concerns about voice clone detection may have been raised prematurely.

Although participants rarely used the term ‘contemplation,’ their practices often aligned with Catholic teachings on contemplative prayer, with a shift toward monological and body-based forms such as breath prayer and attention to posture.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Peer feedback plays a critical role in adolescents’ socio-emotional development, shaping emotional responses and social functioning. While positive feedback enhances well-being, negative feedback is often linked to self-criticism and distress. Yet, real-life interactions also include nuanced forms of feedback—such as neutral remarks and constructive input—that are poorly captured by traditional paradigms dichotomizing feedback into positive vs negative. Prior research has also largely focused on global psychological outcomes (e.g., self-esteem, depression), overlooking diverse emotional reactions (e.g., pride, guilt, motivation) that peer feedback can elicit.\n\nMethods: To address these gaps, we developed a novel vignette-based measure to assess adolescents’ emotional and motivational responses to positive, negative, neutral, and constructive peer feedback. The measure was administered to 67 Portuguese adolescents (aged 14–18 years, 51% female) from the general community.\n\nResults: Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant differences across feedback types for all emotions (ps &lt; .01). Positive feedback elicited the highest levels of happiness and pride, and the lowest sadness, shame, and anger. Negative feedback produced the strongest negative emotions. Constructive feedback generated relatively high happiness and motivation but also moderate guilt and shame. Neutral feedback was most associated with indifference and muted emotional responses.\n\nConclusions: These findings support the measure’s sensitivity in capturing distinct emotional responses across feedback types. Notably, it captures the motivational benefits of constructive feedback alongside its moderate elicitation of negative emotions, and the muted, indifferent responses to neutral feedback. This highlights the utility of the measure for advancing understanding of how adolescents process diverse peer interactions.\n\nKeywords: Adolescence, Vignette measure, Peer feedback, response to peer feedback",

          "authors": "Camila Valenzuela-Moguillansky",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a contemplative research framework—the Multidimensional Approach to Presence (MAP)—for the scientific study of lived experience. Building on micro-phenomenological research, the proposal examines how cultivating presence –inhabiting one’s lived experience as it unfolds– can be integrated methodologically and epistemologically into experiential inquiry. Drawing on studies of pain and bodily awareness, it analyzes three moments in the generation of experiential knowledge: contact with experience, the description of experience, and the analysis of descriptions. From an enactive perspective that conceives experience as dynamic, self-referential, and transformative, the discussion addresses the strengths and limitations of the method, particularly regarding evocation and memory, dimensions of lived experience that exceed declarative language, and the intersubjective character of knowledge generation. MAP places the cultivation of presence at the core of the investigative process and operates on two levels: methodologically, by integrating tools that foster familiarity with bodily experience—such as micro-phenomenological interviewing, somatic practices, and artistic expression—and epistemologically, by contending that investigating experience requires transforming modes of knowing and thereby opening a process of self-transformation.

          "authors": "Laura Schneeberger; Vanessa Scarcelli; Alyssa Lynn; Ryan A Stevenson",
          "abstract": "When individuals perceive sensory inputs through multiple sensory modalities, they incur perceptual and behavioural benefits. Older adults have been found to benefit more from such multisensory integration than younger adults. However, such findings have been inconsistent in the context of speech processing. In the current study, we examined age-related differences in multisensory gain using two tasks: a speech-in-noise task and a semantic discrimination task. In the first task, participants identified a single noun embedded in multi-talker babble. Stimuli were presented in auditory-only, visual-only, or audiovisual conditions, and perceptual accuracies were recorded. In the second task, participants identified whether they perceived a red or blue stimulus in either auditory-only (spoken word), visual-only (a red or blue circle), and audiovisual conditions, with response times recorded. Older adults exhibited more multisensory gain relative to younger adults in both speech perception and semantic processing tasks, even when accounting for unisensory declines associated with aging.",

          "abstract": "This study presents the Czech validation of three widely used environmental psychology instruments: the Environmental Concern scale (EC), the Awareness of Consequences scale (AC), and the Environmental Attitudes Inventory (EAI). By collecting within-subject data from a sample of 562 participants, the study also enabled an exploration of the relationships among the three instruments and their associations with selected socio-demographic variables as part of exploratory analysis. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated excellent model fit for the EAI and AC scales, and acceptable fit for the EC scale. Exploratory analyses revealed a strong positive relationship between the AC and EAI scales, as well as between concern for oneself and for others. A negative reciprocal relationship emerged between belief in consequences for oneself and the biosphere. Additionally, environmental perceptions were significantly shaped by sex, political orientation, age, estimated lifespan, education, and parenthood. This study provides a validated methodological foundation for environmental psychology in the Czech context and enhances insight into environmental attitudes and concerns.",

          "abstract": "Understanding human cognition in virtual environments (VE) is essential for improving digital human modeling and creating realistic experiences.  By recognizing how context affects sensory perception, designers can more effectively adapt environmental and task-related elements of experience design. This study compared participants' ability to detect and identify sensory cues, namely, passive tactile and olfactory stimuli, between real-life (RL) and VE. We also examined visual context dependency of sensory awareness in order to understand the contribution of environmental elements on sensory awareness.  This study is designed to measure the feeling of being in a real room, detection, identification, and perceived realism, intensity, roughness, and pleasantness of odor and tactile stimuli in both RL and its VE counterpart. Participants were exposed to sensory stimuli with or without visual cues. During the experiment, participants were given listening tasks. This design aims to understand how visual cues affect sensory perception and how different environments shape sensory performance. \nThe findings revealed that the feeling of being in a real room in VEs was high when all sensory cues (olfactory, tactile, visual) were present. Notably, in VE, odor detection was more accurate, whereas in RL, surface detection and identification were more reliable. When visual cues were present, participants detected olfactory and tactile cues more effectively. These findings shed light on how sensory perception encountered in RL shapes VE experiences and cognitive processes. These insights could enhance VE experiences by guiding the design of more realistic immersive settings and informing the use of sensory elements in VE design.",

          "abstract": "The student selection process is of paramount importance for optimizing the academic performance\nof students and colleges. For effective and evidence-based student selection, factors beyond\nintellectual capacity, such as cognitive style, must be considered. According to the Empathizing-Systemizing theory, individuals can be classified as 'systemizers' or 'empathizers' based on their cognitive style. Systemizers excel at predictable, systematic thinking, which is suited for fields like mathematics and physics. Empathizers are proficient in understanding social phenomena and typically succeed in fields involving significant human interaction, such as language. Individuals with comparable systemizing and empathizing abilities are classified as 'balanced'. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the student selection process in Erbil city effectively directs systemizers and empathizers into their cognitively suited academic fields. A cross-sectional study was conducted to measure the systemizing and empathizing abilities of 518 students from science, medical, and humanities colleges in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan. Students were selected using clustered sampling, and a questionnaire was used to assess their cognitive styles. The final analysis included 93% of the distributed questionnaires. The findings indicated that each academic discipline—sciences, humanities, and medicine—comprised approximately one-third of each brain type (S, N, and E). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of brain types across these disciplines (p = 0.968). This suggests that a student's brain type does not statistically predict their probability of entering a cognitively suitable academic field. The study's results suggest a defective student selection process in the universities examined, which appears unable to direct students with particular cognitive styles to their appropriate fields. These findings can be partially generalized to other state colleges in Slemani and Duhok, as their students have followed similar academic pathways.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatry continues to struggle with the heterogeneity of mental disorders. Classifications such as DSM and ICD catalogue symptom clusters but fail to reveal underlying mechanisms. Recent integrative approaches, including the biopsychosocial model and RDoC, have advanced the field, yet psychiatry still lacks a unifying explanatory principle. We propose the Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis as a conceptual framework—a paradigm rather than a proven theory. It suggests that psychiatric disorders can be understood as variations of a fundamental disruption in the brain’s predictive machinery. From an evolutionary standpoint, the brain’s primary role is not to represent the world accurately, but to anticipate potential dangers in order to ensure survival. When this survival-oriented predictive system becomes miscalibrated, psychopathology may arise. This hypothesis integrates predictive processing and active inference models with clinical psychiatry. Psychosis may be seen as overweighted priors, PTSD as rigid threat models, panic disorder as catastrophic interoceptive predictions, depression as entrenched negative priors, OCD as unresolved prediction errors, autism as overweighted sensory errors, and anxiety as exaggerated threat priors. Like oncology’s unification around disordered cell division, psychiatry may benefit from a unifying lens. The Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis is offered not as a replacement for existing frameworks but as a conceptual paradigm that invites empirical testing and inspires new ways of thinking about diagnosis and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",

Here we investigate how childhood maltreatment shapes control beliefs and their relationship with stress and exploration in adulthood. We used a recently developed task, the Wheel Stopping (WS) task, to measure and manipulate control beliefs and stress, and combined this with a novel self-report measure of exploration in a sample of 477 adults with and without experience of childhood maltreatment (matched on age, gender and socioeconomic status). The WS task utilises two between-subjects manipulations of control: task controllability (high vs low), and performance feedback (relative positive vs relative negative). We show that despite similar task performance, maltreated participants displayed lower levels of control beliefs compared to controls and that while task performance improved over time for both groups, maltreated participants used this less to update their control beliefs. Further, whereas both groups responded equally to the task manipulations, only controls leveraged relative positive feedback to reduce task-related stress and increase goal-directed exploration. We conclude that maltreatment blunts the calibration of control beliefs, informing both stress and goal-directed exploration, likely increasing vulnerability to psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The Cyber Paranoia and Fear Scale (CPFS) was developed in 2014 by Mason et al to measure the perception of information technology-related threats. Given the rapid evolution of digital systems, including artificial intelligence, surveillance, and data sharing, this study sought to revalidate and update the scale, resulting in the Cyber Paranoia and Fear Scale–Updated (CPFS-U). Method: Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) with university students informed the redevelopment of the scale. Eight new items were added, and several were revised. The CPFS-U was administered to 433 adults, alongside validated measures of paranoia, generalised anxiety, online trust, digital confidence, and activity. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure: (1) AI and Digital Dependence Concerns, (2) Technological Risk Awareness and Distrust, (3) Perceived Data Vulnerability, and (4) Surveillance and Monitoring Paranoia. Correlational analyses showed that overall cyber-paranoia and fear were positively associated with generalised anxiety and trait paranoia. Digital confidence and activity showed limited associations with the updated scale, indicating that emotional and cognitive responses to digital systems may be more influential than digital literacy itself. Discussion: The findings suggest that cyber paranoia is a multidimensional construct distinct from general paranoia, shaped by contemporary technological developments. The CPFS-U provides an updated measure for assessing digital mistrust and fear in modern contexts and may inform future research on technology-related anxiety and clinical interventions.",

Currently used screening tools are brief and cost-effective, but there is a lack of understanding of their reliability over time as well as whether responses are influenced by demographic or clinical factors. Aims: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of two commonly used screening tools as well as their associations with current mood states and other participant characteristics. Methods: 331 adult patients with a diagnosis of BD completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Symptom Checklist-32 (HCL-32) as well as measures of mood online at baseline and three months later. Results: The MDQ was found to have low reliability with poor internal consistency (α= 0.531; α= 0.647 at respective timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.582). The HCL-32 was more reliable with good internal consistency (α= 0.815 at both timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.725). MDQ scores were significantly, positively associated with comorbidities and current symptoms of activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age and years since last hospitalisation. The HCL-32 was also significantly positively correlated with activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age, years since diagnosis and years since last hospitalisation. BD-I patients scored higher than other BD-subtypes. Mood state was the only variable with a significant change over time. Conclusions: The HCL-32 appeared more reliable than the MDQ, although all participants needed to exceed an MDQ threshold at baseline to participate in the study, which may have biased our results.",

          "abstract": "Much empirical research over the last thirty years suggests that learning to categorize a set of objects alters the way in which they are perceived or judged, a phenomenon known as learned categorical perception or LCP. LCP has provided key evidence for controversial claims of top-down effects of knowledge on perception and suggested a possible mechanism by which continuous perceptual input is transformed into discrete symbolic representations. LCP may consist of increased cross-category discrimination (\"expansion\"), decreased within-category discrimination (\"compression\"), or both, and some studies fail to show either type of boundary effect. To address these inconsistencies and determine the general robustness of LCP, we conducted separate meta-analyses of expansion and compression on a total of 70 experiments comprising 4,627 participants We found a moderate average effect size for expansion (d = .48) with strong evidence of publication bias, an average effect size of approximately 0 for compression with likely publication bias, and highly significant heterogeneity of effects across experiments for both expansion and compression. Moderator analyses revealed a significant effect of the task used to assess LCP, with same-different judgments tending to produce results consistent with a non-boundary effect of improved discrimination on the category-relevant dimension. However, the sensitivity of the moderator analyses was limited by low statistical power and most of the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies remained unexplained. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of LCP, including suggestions for how future LCP research could be more informative and better support meta-analysis.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a pervasive public health issue with enduring psychosocial consequences. Contemporary, population‑based estimates among young adults and their associations with stress and tobacco behaviors remain undercharacterized.\nMethods: This study employed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data among U.S. adults aged 18–34 (N = 6,252). CSA was measured via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) module and dichotomized (ever vs. never). Primary correlates included self‑reported stress (low/medium/high), cigarette smoking (never, someday, everyday, former), e‑cigarette use (yes/no), and sociodemographics (sex, sexual orientation, transgender identity, race/ethnicity, education, income). Survey‑weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression (survey procedures) estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs.\nResults: In the general population, the unweighted prevalence of CSA was 6.4% (n = 400), while the weighted prevalence was approximately 5.8%. In adjusted model, high stress was associated with a greater odds of reporting CSA (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07–3.48) compared to low stress. Tobacco-related behaviors were also associated with CSA, including daily smoking (aOR = 3.16), former smoking (aOR= 1.99), occasional smoking (aOR =1.82), and e-cigarette use (aOR =1.95). Higher socioeconomic status was found to have a protective effect on CSA. Being a college graduate (aOR = 0.44) and having an annual household income of more than $100,000 (aOR = 0.48) were associated with reduced odds of CSA. Race/ethnicity was not statistically significant after adjustment. \nConclusions: CSA remains common among US young adults and is associated with higher stress, tobacco use, and socioeconomic disadvantage; sexual minority men show elevated odds. Findings underscore the need for trauma‑informed, equity‑centered prevention and integrated behavioral health and tobacco control strategies tailored to young adults and sexual/gender minority populations.\nKeywords: childhood sexual abuse; young adults; stress; e‑cigarettes; tobacco; BRFSS; sexual orientation; health disparities.",

However, previous research has largely focused on Western samples. We examined the Personality Triad across cultures with N = 15,221 participants from 61 countries and one geographic region. Participants reported on one situation from their daily lives. We examined (1) situation characteristic–behavioral state, (2) trait–behavioral state, and (3) trait–situation characteristic associations, as well as (4) trait × situation characteristic interactions predicting behavioral states. We focused on six traits (Big Five, Honesty-Humility), seven situation characteristics (Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Sociality), and three self-reported behavioral states (Agency, Enthusiasm, Self-Negativity). Importantly, we included 15 country-level variables (collectivism, self-construal, cultural value orientations, tightness, independent and interdependent happiness, national socioeconomic status) as moderators that might contribute to country differences in the Personality Triad. Bayesian multilevel models showed sizable and expected situation characteristic–behavioral state and trait–behavioral state associations with a high degree of generalization across countries, some cultural differences, and moderator effects contradicting theoretical expectations. For instance, we found weaker situation characteristic effects in collectivistic cultures and stronger trait effects in embedded cultures. Trait–situation characteristic associations were meaningful but smaller, and trait × situation characteristic interactions were small and less often significant (although we observed some expected interactions). We found little evidence for country differences in the latter two relations. We discuss implications and future directions for cross-cultural work on the Personality Triad, including replications and extensions using intensive-longitudinal designs.",

States of consciousness refer to discrete modes of awareness elicited by normal states of the brain, such as those associated with wakefulness and sleep, and by abnormal factors, including brain lesions, pharmacological agents and other external interventions. Contents of consciousness refer what we are conscious of. In this chapter, we emphasize the dynamic nature of consciousness in terms of both its states and contents. First, we first observe that our life constantly alternates between different conscious and unconscious states, namely, sleep and wakefulness. Then, within each state, we note an inherent dynamism in content, with conscious experience ranging from content-full to content-less. By surveying the variety of conscious experiences across wakefulness and sleep, we highlight the similarities in reported contents across these states. We further discuss how the possibility of having conscious experiences without specific content challenges the idea that being conscious necessarily involves being conscious of something. Finally, by reviewing the literature on the neural correlates of consciousness, we propose a potential convergence in the study of conscious states and contents.",

Skilled players performed the task faster than novices and showed a more proactive VEA: they spent moretime looking at cues related to future passing opportunities while novices looked more at cues related to ball reception. In addition, skilled players made longer scanning movements before receiving the ball, but they did  not perform  significantly  more  head  movements  than  novices. Under  mental  fatigue,  skilled participants preserved their VEA patterns but required longer visual fixations, suggesting a reduced rate of information processing.

          "abstract": "Children’s first words are frequently recorded to be nouns, rather than verbs, but data from some languages (notably some Asian and African languages including Mandarin, Korean and Ngas) and some methodologies (especially spontaneous speech recordings) suggest that verbs can be represented as early as nouns. Variables that potentially impact early verb knowledge include the structure of the language children are learning and whether it is verb production or comprehension that is investigated. \nWe investigated longitudinal data from Kenya of children’s (N=500) vocabulary production and comprehension using Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs). Children’s caregivers completed overlapping inventories designed for younger infants (completed at age 12 months and designed for ages 8-16 months), and for older toddlers, (parallel forms completed at age 18 and 24 months and designed for ages 16-30 months). The inventories were structured to include words acquired at equivalent ages across word classes (e.g. nouns acquired at a median age of 11 months and verbs acquired at the same median age) but the interactions between word classes and children’s age and the modality in which they know the word (comprehension only or production as well) indicate that nouns and verbs do not follow the same trajectory across acquisition. Nouns emerge relatively earlier in production and comprehension while verbs emerge earlier in comprehension and their production increases as children grow older. \nWe conclude that the findings of Goldfield (2000) and of Stolt et al. (2008) are also true for these Bantu languages: that the noun advantage in early words is seen in studies where production is emphasised, and early verb knowledge can be missed if comprehension is not assessed.",

          "abstract": "Surprisingly few intervention approaches have been evaluated for youth negatively impacted by bullying, and only one known study has directly addressed the traumatic nature of these peer experiences. Thus, there is currently little guidance for practitioners working to address the mental health needs of this population in an individual therapy context. The current article presents a case report of an adolescent male with social anxiety and attention problems who had experienced chronic, severe bullying that had resulted in significant posttraumatic stress symptoms. It illustrates the process of implementing an adapted version of the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems (MATCH-ADTC) to address these presenting problems. Results demonstrate the potential utility of a modular cognitive-behavioral approach, as it effectively reduced the patient’s experiences of bullying as well as his symptoms of posttraumatic stress and social anxiety; high levels of treatment satisfaction were also reported by the patient and his caregiver. The current article highlights unique treatment considerations and challenges when providing mental health services for youth negatively impacted by bullying, emphasizing the need to help them develop coping skills and a plan for responding to aggressive peers and then the importance of trauma narration to reduce intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance symptoms and to process inaccurate and unhelpful (i.e., self-blaming) cognitions stemming from these experiences.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research increasingly uses situated measures, requiring intensive longitudinal and within-person methods. Such data are typically examined with multilevel models clustering multiple measurement time points within individuals. The intercorrelation patterns obtained with such multilevel models rely on various homogeneity assumptions that should be, but rarely are, tested before using multilevel modeling and interpreting the results.\nThis study proposes a five-step approach to systematically testing homogeneity assumptions in order to obtain more trustworthy estimates of associations among measures when examining clustered multilevel data.\nTo provide an educational illustration of this five-step approach, 1,028 experience sampling method surveys from 37 students were collected over one semester in one university lecture. Twenty-one items measured motivational components and academic emotions. Multilevel analyses estimated an overall within-person and an overall between-person network of zero-order correlations among motivation and emotion facets. Idiographic within-person networks of the 37 participants revealed substantial heterogeneity in their within-person intercorrelation patterns. Heterogeneity was further indicated by one third of the within-person correlations being bi- or multimodally distributed across individuals. We conclude that heterogeneity in within-person patterns must be examined, otherwise, methods relying on homogeneity assumptions, including multilevel analyses, may fail to describe many if not all individuals’ idiographic correlation patterns. This is crucial for the trustworthiness of measurement and structure models, the generalizability of ESM research, and any research aiming for personalized diagnostics and interventions.",

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

Intimate partner violence (IPV) represents a significant stressor, with high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In a high-adversity South African birth cohort, the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), we prospectively investigated whether maternal exposure to IPV during pregnancy and in the first 2 years was associated with child brain structure at age 2-3 years. \n\n\n\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data was analysed from 171 children (n=70 exposed to prenatal IPV; n=55 to postnatal IPV). Regression modelling explored associations between IPV exposures and measures of brain structure derived using FreeSurfer. Voxel- and surface-based morphometry were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping to explore differences in cortical architecture. Analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical confounding variables. \n\n\n\nBoth prenatal and postnatal IPV exposure were associated with increased mean cortical thickness (β=0.037, p=0.030, 95% CI [0.004, 0.070], and β=0.041, p=0.023, 95% CI [0.006, 0.074], respectively), when compared to unexposed controls. Exploratory analyses identified a prenatal IPV-by-child sex interaction in right medial orbitofrontal cortex thickness (p=0.025, FWE-corrected); with greater thickness in boys (β= 0.14, p=0.008, 95% CI [0.04 to 0.24]), but not girls (β=-0.04, p=0.44, 95% CI [-0.15 to 0.07]).\n\n\n\nEarly exposure to IPV may impact cortical structure in childhood, with potential sex-specific effects.

          "abstract": "Circular clothing production and consumption is necessary to mitigate the environmental harms of conventional clothing production. However, traditional recycling methods cannot process the most common form of textile waste into pure components: cotton-polyester blended fabrics. Chemical recycling offers a promising solution for processing these blended fibers, but industrial-scale production of chemical recycling hinges on how consumers view the recycled products. That is, consumer adoption is critical for widespread implementation of textile recycling in the fashion industry. Consumer purchasing decisions are shaped by an array of individual and contextual factors, as well as product attributes. We identified the factors related to willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes through three complementary studies. In Study 1 (N = 50), we qualitatively examined participants’ evaluative reactions to (chemically recycled) clothes using a thought-listing method. In Study 2 (N = 1,009), we used network analysis to quantitatively measure the association between willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes, and the demographic factors, psychological factors, and evaluative reactions identified in Study 1. Consumers who were younger, higher in income, and more concerned about the environment, were willing to pay more for chemically recycled clothes compared to their conventional counterparts. In Study 3, we experimentally manipulated environmental concern. Watching a video highlighting the environmental impact of conventional and chemical clothing led to (a) [greater/equivalent/lower] willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes in a task with real financial consequences, (b) [stronger/equivalent/weaker] preferences for brands that use chemical recycling, and (c) [greater/equivalent/lower] support for policies promoting chemical recycling.

          "abstract": "Abstract\nPain is a multidimensional experience processed by complex neural networks, including the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG), have advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying pain perception and modulation. This review provides a modality-wise comparative analysis of neuroimaging tools used in pain research, highlighting the key pipelines, brain region specificity, and clinical relevance. We summarize real-time applications such as neurofeedback using fMRI and EEG, as well as emerging machine learning models applied to fNIRS and multimodal datasets. The review also evaluates software frameworks, including SPM, FSL, CONN, DISCOVER-EEG, and custom deep learning approaches for pain classification and prediction. While fMRI offers superior spatial resolution, EEG and MEG provide millisecond-level temporal precision, and fNIRS is a promising option for bedside monitoring. By synthesizing evidence from 32 peer-reviewed studies, we emphasize the growing role of data integration, automated analysis, and real-time feedback paradigms in shaping the future of pain research and clinical intervention.",

          "abstract": "Engaging adolescents in digital environments is notoriously difficult. A common strategy is message personalization, yet most efforts focus on personalizing what is said rather than how it is expressed. This is a missed opportunity, as youth communication that truly speaks their language requires attention to style as well as content. Digital communication environments enable such stylistic adaptation by revealing users’ expression patterns that can be leveraged for personalization. Yet little is known about how adolescents respond to persuasive messages written in a similar linguistic style, or how such similarity is best operationalized. Addressing these gaps, this preregistered study tests whether adolescents prefer social media health messages that are more similar to their linguistic style and identifies which linguistic categories are most effective in eliciting positive responses. We analyzed donated WhatsApp conversation data from 191 Dutch adolescents (aged 13–15) to calculate individual linguistic profiles and design Instagram-style health messages that varied in linguistic similarity. Participants then evaluated 22 message pairs, each manipulating one linguistic category. Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence that linguistic similarity influenced message preference or personalization, and moderate evidence against effects on perceived effectiveness. However, adolescents consistently preferred messages that were positively valenced and low in complexity, regardless of linguistic similarity. These findings suggest that positive, easy-to-read messages may be an effective strategy for digital youth engagement. Furthermore, we discuss the implications for computer-mediated style matching, including algorithmic approaches, large language models, and future theoretical development.",

Moreover, the role of\nsubjective event perceptions—though emphasized in personality research—has been largely\nbeen neglected in research on attachment development. In a longitudinal study spanning 7\nwaves over 2.5 years, we examined how romantic relationship transitions—entering or ending\na committed relationship—predict changes in attachment anxiety and avoidance, and whether\nthese effects are moderated by subjective event perceptions. We analyzed data of N = 1,717\nparticipants (69.6% women aged 18-40, M = 26.5 years) who were single (52%) or in a\npartnership (48%) at the beginning of the study.

Both anxiety and avoidance shifted in response to transitions\n(socialization effects): anxiety decreased after partnering and increased after separation, while\navoidance showed a temporary decrease post-separation followed by a gradual increase.\nThese shifts mirrored average differences between partnered and single individuals,\nsuggesting rapid adaptation to new social roles. Subjective perceptions of the events (e.g.,\nvalence, social status decrease, predictability) showed limited moderation effects.

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",

          "abstract": "Understanding variability is a key focus in many areas of psychological research, with growing interest in modeling individual and group variability. While multilevel models such as heterogeneous variance models and Mixed-Effect Location Scale (MELS) models have been used to capture these dynamics, they typically rely on linear assumptions and temporal change of the variability is restricted to one level. Recent calls for nonlinear approaches in psychology highlight the need for more flexible models that can better account for complex, dynamic processes. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) within the framework of heterogeneous variance models to address these limitations. By incorporating GPs, we allow for the modeling of nonlinear variability across multiple levels, including temporal dynamics at both the individual and group levels. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in two empirical applications. Our findings show that using GPs provide an improved model fit compared to traditional linear methods and highlight the utility of GPs in variance modeling, offering new possibilities for studying dynamic and emergent processes in psychological and social science research.",

The goal is to identify dyslexia characteristics that are independent of bilingual experience and determine the appropriate tests for in bilinguals. Findings indicate that rapid naming and reading impairments remain prevalent in bilingual DRs while phonological awareness appears to be more variably impaired in bilinguals. Differences between monolinguals and bilinguals are more present in DRs than typical readers (TRs), suggesting that bilingual experience might play a more substantial role in populations with deficits. Results from predictive studies do not allow for evidence-based recommendations due to their variability. Overall, fndings suggest that some diagnostic tools retain cross-linguistic validity, while others’ prognostic potential may be modulated by bilingual experience. The results highlight the need for comprehensive assessments, considering linguistic profiles.

Traditional research in creativity psychology minimizes researcher interference to maintain authenticity, primarily using post-factum interviews. In contrast, the RAO approach situates researchers as “obstacles” within the artist’s creative environment, providing close access to the artist’s “creative engine”, the underlying creative dynamic. Researchers intervene in real-time to capture shifts in pre-reflexive gestures and emerging meaning before they become conscious or verbalized. Drawing from anthropology and psychology, this framework emphasizes the value of researcher presence as a structured obstacle. This approach offers researchers a powerful tool for capturing creative processes in real-time, rarely accessible through traditional methods, by granting artists a finer awareness of their creative dynamics. This awareness can also serve as a valuable resource in art-based contexts.",

As a species, humans find uncertainty aversive and excessive. Intolerance of uncertainty is a risk factor for emotional disorders. One way to resolve uncertainty in novel situations is to rely on memories of past similar experiences, yet this process is largely unexplored in social contexts. A novel social decision-making task showed that individuals recruit both memories and incremental experiences of social rewards to guide decisions under social uncertainty. Further, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed better integration of positive social memories if they also had high levels of autobiographical memory specificity. These findings suggest that successfully recalling past positive social experiences improves navigation of social uncertainty, and may confer preventative advantages for those with high levels of affective disorder symptoms.",

This is challenging for children as the underlying skills required to understand irony may not be fully developed. We investigated how 10-year-olds’ working memory, empathy skills, and gender are related to their processing and comprehension of written irony. Data from two previous eye-tracking experiments with 97 children (46 girls and 51 boys) were analysed. Results showed that children with stronger empathy skills had higher irony comprehension accuracy and were less likely to reread ironic phrases. Higher working memory was linked to faster processing of irony but did not lead to higher comprehension. Conversely, lower working memory was associated with more accurate irony comprehension. Child gender was not related to irony comprehension. These results imply that working memory and emotional perspective-taking are important for children's irony comprehension, aligning with theories that take individual differences into account.",

          "authors": "Joar Vittersø; Irene Johanna Elisabeth Teulings",
          "abstract": "The combination of high life satisfaction and frequent experiences of pleasant feelings is\nsometimes called hedonic wellbeing (HWB). We argue that a good life comprises more than\nhedonia and that a taxonomy of wellbeing should also include a eudaimonic dimension\n(EWB). The paper challenges a fundamental premise in research on wellbeing, which states\nthat self-reported life satisfaction provides an unbiased, broad, and reflected evaluation of an\nindividual’s life “as-a-whole.” Countering this assumption, two studies showed that HWB\nindicators differ from indicators of EWB, indicating that HWB does not measure EWB. Using\nsurvey experiments, the paper further demonstrated that, upon reflection, participants\ntypically regard eudaimonic values as more important than hedonic values, proposing that\nliving eudaimonically is important in people’s lives. A third finding showed that gaps\nbetween ideal and actual hedonic values predicted life satisfaction, whereas eudaimonic\nvalues gaps did not. This suggests that life satisfaction is not an unbiased evaluation of all the\nimportant values in a person’s life. Thus, measures of life satisfaction appear invalid (not\nmeasuring what they intend to measure). To get more relevant data on how well people\nconsider their lives to be, both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions should be taken into\naccount.",

          "abstract": "The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a brief, self-administered tool used to measure traits linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although widely used across languages and cultures, it has not yet been translated into Spanish or administered to Latin-American populations. Our aim was to make a cross-cultural translation of the AQ into Spanish, describe its psychometric properties, and determine a cut-off point for the Mexican population. We administered the AQ to typically developing (TD) people and those with ASD diagnosis. We analyzed the factor structure, internal consistency, and three cut-off points: for the general population, men, and women. Group and sex differences were examined. Our AQ version demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency, and a six-factor structure: Social Interests, Theory of Mind, Social Skills, Attention to Detail, Imagination, and Planning. The ASD group scored higher than the TD group on the total score and five subscales. Interactions between group and sex showed that sex differences appeared only within the ASD groups. Cut-off points showed good sensitivity, specificity, and discriminative properties for the Mexican population. Our findings align with reports from other countries, highlighting the relevant traits in a Mexican sample, advancing the understanding of cultural factors in self-reported autistic traits.",

          "abstract": "Concerns that AI will homogenize human thinking—and homogenization evidence when human-AI collaboration is observed—appear at odds with findings that AI-assisted content is judged as highly original. Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas both within and across essays. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation. Paradoxical homogenization appears to have reached a real-world, high-stakes educational context where writing is expressly personal and AI use is explicitly prohibited.",

Across two independent cohorts at elevated suicide risk (Ns=208 and 211; &gt;6 million text entries), both lifetime suicidal thoughts and behaviors and current suicidal ideation were associated with increased frequency of smartphone suicide-related language. Human coding indicated varied language—e.g., serious expressions of active suicidal ideation, jokes, hyperbole, and expressing support for others.

Using data from a combined sample of 775 community and undergraduate participants, exploratory factor analysis initially yielded a 7-factor solution reflecting broad psychopathology domains: Internalizing, Disinhibited Externalizing, Antagonistic Externalizing, Low Positive Emotionality, Eating Pathology, Sexual Dysfunction, and Anankastia. Subsequent elaboration of a lower order structure based on the first three broader domains yielded seven additional factors: Fear and Somatoform, Thought Disorder, Suicide, Negative Affectivity, and Narcissism, resulting in a total of 11factors at the most nuanced level. Sequential hierarchical modeling iteratively traced the factor structure from one global psychopathology factor down to the 7-factor level, and subsequently, 11-factor level. Construct validity of the factor structures was evaluated via correlation and regression analyses using scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-3 (MMPI-3). These results yielded broad support for the convergent validity of the HiTOP-SR structure, as the various factors demonstrated meaningful associations with conceptually relevant MMPI-3 scale scores. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the HiTOP-SR as a promising dimensional assessment tool aligned with key aspects of the HiTOP framework, while also highlighting directions for further replication and refinement.",

          "abstract": "Hyperglycemia affects cardiac activity at rest, but its effect on cardiac reactivity has not been investigated extensively. While glucose increases hormonal stress responses without changing cardiac stress reactivity, less is known about the interaction of glucose and relaxation interventions on cardiac reactivity. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of glucose administration and a standardized massage intervention on psychophysiological relaxation and sustained attention. \nNinety-four participants (age mean = 22.84 years, SD = 2.53 years; 71.28% female) were randomly assigned to consume a drink containing glucose, or pure water before receiving a standardized massage or resting. Directly after the manipulation, they completed the d2 sustained attention test. We repeatedly assessed blood glucose and mood and recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) throughout. Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were used as a measure of parasympathetic activity, and pre-ejection period (PEP) indexed sympathetic activity. \nOur preregistered analyses showed that both relaxation interventions increased PNS activity and decreased arousal. Glucose activated the SNS and prevented SNS withdrawal in response to the massage. However, it did not modulate PNS or affective reactivity to the interventions. While cardiac reactivity was not related to sustained attention, higher blood glucose was linked to higher concentration performance and accuracy in explorative analyses. \nThe results provide further support for the autonomic space model demonstrating independence of SNS and PNS regulation depending on the type of manipulation. They may further our understanding of the links between glucose metabolism and autonomic functioning.",

The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity in this century. Communicating in a way that raises awareness of the risk climate changes poses while at the same time not inducing negative feelings, like helplessness, is a challenge. On one hand research has shown that emphasizing the severity of climate change is related to higher risk perception, which could lead to more pro-environmental behavior. On the other hand, it could trigger higher helplessness which is associated with lower motivation to act climate friendly. Previous research showed that controllability, leads to lower risk perception and lower learned helplessness. In our research we are investigating the impact of induced controllability of the consequences of climate change on risk perception and learned helplessness. To this end, we conducted two experiments with N = 216 and N = 489 (quota-based sample) participants in Germany. Participants received six climate change scenarios that differed only in induced controllability (high vs low). More specifically, we had four conditions: own control, control by government, hopeless, and a control condition. For both experiments results showed that participants’ risk perception increased after they read the scenarios, independent of the conditions. In Experiment 1 learned helplessness decreased, as expected, for the conditions with high controllability. Surprisingly, for Experiment 2 results showed an overall decrease of  learned helplessness independent of the controllability level. When adding participants’ ratings on the pro-environmental behavior scale (PEBS-C) as a moderator variable, results showed that those who had higher ratings on the PEBS-C scale reported higher levels of helplessness for the scenario with the lowest controllability, compared to the control group. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of including solutions when addressing the negative impacts of climate change.",

If you glance at a photo of a person diving into a lake, you will tend to remember them closer to the water than they really were. In seven experiments, we show that this phenomenon transcends motion: Our minds make predictions that distort our memories about changes that involve no motion whatsoever, including changes in brightness, color saturation, and proportion. Additionally, we use representational momentum to map the limits of automatic prediction, showing that there are no analogous effects for changes in hue. Our automatic predictions distort our memories in many domains—not just motion—and the presence or absence of these distortions expose the inner workings of perception, cognition, and memory.",

Following prior definitions of zombie articles that are retracted but continue to be cited affirmatively, we add another category of ‘undead’ articles.

The first condition is demonstrated irreproducibility, which we operationalize and define with the help of a novel typology of replication efforts. We propose a rule of thumb how many failed efforts at replication might be required for each type of replication effort before the original finding is deemed irreproducible. The second condition for a putative vampire article is that it is cited affirmatively in public policy the scientific literature, or private communications, after the first condition is met. We discuss rules of thumb for how many such affirmative citations might lead qualified researchers in that subfield to address the article of concern within the scientific literature. We surmise that a substantial number of vampire articles exist as our two cases resemble those criticized in a growing literature addressing problematic science and the reproducibility crisis. Our first case concerns aerial gunning of coyotes and the second case predicts over-fishing. We discuss the damaging effects of vampire articles and why the melodramatic metaphor has heuristic value and utility. We also discuss lessons from the communication sciences about how to remedy misinformation, offering recommendations to researchers, publishers and editors, all of whom share an interest in rigorous inquiry and public trust in science.",

We identified 4 main themes: (1) Communicating and Understanding the “mind’s eye” in a world of visualisers; (2) The diverse experience of knowing without seeing and search for imagery; (3) The protective &amp; disruptive ways that aphantasia shapes life and thoughts; (4) The search for meaning. The study draws on the voices and experiences of aphantasic people to explore the psychosocial correlates of aphantasia.

We conducted a latent class analysis with a subset of 3883 respondents who completed key measures of imagery (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) and self-reported cognitive experiences (sensory imagery, autobiographical memory, face recognition, spatial navigation). 3 subtypes of aphantasia emerge: 1) a ‘global aphantasia’ subtype with extreme sensory features in most to all sensory modalities; 2) an ‘Aphantasia +’ subtype with both sensory and cognitive features in the domains listed above; and 3) a ‘non-global aphantasia’ subtype with milder uni- or multisensory features. Our findings confirm the heterogeneous nature of aphantasia, with subtypes varying alongside 3 dimensions: number (and type) of sensory modalities experiencing low imagery, the intensity of aphantasia in the concerned sensory modalities (total lack of versus poor imagery), and the presence or absence of additional cognitive difficulties outwith sensory imagery. Together, these findings call for a shift in the theoretical and methodological approaches to aphantasia and imagery research.",

Here, we examined what moral values support altruism that is both equitable (helping others impartially regardless of proximity or group membership) and effective (helping impactfully by maximizing welfare gains). We studied two rare populations: effective altruists (EAs; N = 119), defined by their philosophical commitment to impartiality and maximizing impact, and extraordinary altruists (XAs; N = 65), defined by their real-world decision to donate an organ to a stranger—an act of radical impartiality, though not explicitly impact-maximizing. A demographically similar general population sample (N = 176) served as a comparison group. Participants completed moral measures from pluralistic theories (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q)), along with the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS). They also completed assessments of equitable, effective, and combined altruistic orientations. Both altruistic groups showed elevated moral expansiveness (MES) and impartial beneficence \n(OUS) relative to controls. EAs, compared to XAs and controls, more strongly endorsed utilitarian principles (including instrumental harm on the OUS) and deprioritized traditional cooperative values (e.g., reciprocity, deference on the MAC-Q). Familial loyalty (MAC-Q) negatively predicted altruistic orientations across groups. Surprisingly, group loyalty—conceptualized as parochial by pluralistic moral theories—positively predicted equitable and effective altruism across groups, challenging assumptions that parochial values necessarily constrain prosociality. These findings instead suggest inclusive forms of loyalty may help promote altruism that is both equitable and effective.",

Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "The present is not like the past. People generally tend to think of this as a bad thing. Here we present a helpful step-by-step guide for fame and success in being a researcher who blasts the panic button at whatever new social change or technology has come around. We present an article template and research project that can be adapted to any time and any social change or new technology. By following this handy guide, fame can be yours as well. No one should write empirical papers to try to cause panics about social and technology panics. But if one is going to, this step by step can help demonstrate the tried and true formula for success, from overstating the case, using alarmist language, and questionable practices.",

          "authors": "Andrew Devendorf; David Disabato; Maya Nauphal; Jonathan Rottenberg; Sarah E. Victor",
          "abstract": "The profession of psychology aims to improve societal mental health and well-being. Ironically, psychologists have neglected the study of mental health within the profession. We conducted the first comprehensive assessment of mental health difficulties across psychology disciplines in a sample (N = 1,261) of faculty and graduate students affiliated with U.S. doctoral degree granting institutions. Over 84% of respondents reported a lifetime history of mental health difficulties; 54% reported a lifetime diagnosis; 15% had clinically elevated current depression symptoms; 16% reported clinically elevated current anxiety symptoms; and 51% met Keyes’ “flourishing” criteria. The most common mental health concerns were depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Across all outcomes, graduate students reported significantly greater frequency and severity of difficulties. Clinically elevated current depression and anxiety were 3-4 times higher in graduate students (21% and 22%, respectively) compared to professor-level faculty (6% and 7%, respectively). Rates of flourishing were lower in graduate students than faculty (OR = 2.65, p &lt; .001). Clinical-area respondents (92%) were more likely to report a lifetime mental health difficulty than non-clinical area respondents (83%). Interestingly, while there were no field-level differences in rates of current elevated anxiety, clinical-area respondents had lower rates of clinically elevated depression. Academic psychology is not an exception to the mental health crisis in higher education. Particularly urgent action is needed to improve graduate students’ mental health. We discuss both systemic and practical recommendations for the profession of psychology.",

          "abstract": "To navigate the world, our minds must represent not only how things are now (perception), but how they are about to be (prediction). However, perception and prediction blur together for objects in motion, a classic finding known as \"representational momentum\". If you glance at a photo of a person diving into a lake, you will tend to remember them closer to the water than they really were. In seven experiments, we show that this phenomenon transcends motion: Our minds make predictions that distort our memories about changes that involve no motion whatsoever, including changes in brightness, color saturation, and proportion. Additionally, we use representational momentum to map the limits of automatic prediction, showing that there are no analogous effects for changes in hue. Our automatic predictions distort our memories in many domains—not just motion—and the presence or absence of these distortions expose the inner workings of perception, cognition, and memory.",

          "authors": "Alexis Bolds; Maeve Gavagan; Lee Mason",
          "abstract": "Background &amp; Aims: Access to specialized healthcare for children with autism spectrum disorder has long been hindered by limited availability of qualified clinicians, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these disparities, overwhelming traditional healthcare models and highlighting the need for innovative solutions. Telehealth emerged as a critical tool during the pandemic, facilitating continued access to care, particularly for underserved populations. We aimed to investigate the extent to which functional language deficits can be identified and assessed in children with autism, and ruled out in neurotypical children, via telehealth. \nMethods: This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of using telehealth for assessing verbal behavior deficits in children diagnosed with autism, comparing them to neurotypical peers, and exploring the potential for telehealth to expand access to specialized intervention. Twelve children, seven of whom had an autism diagnosis, participated in telehealth-based functional analyses of verbal behavior. \nResults: Results indicated that children with autism exhibited statistically significant differences in across functional language domains, whereas no such differences were identified in neurotypical peers. No false positives or false negatives were detected. At follow-up, participants with autism showed statistically significant improvements in verbal language skills. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that telehealth is a reliable and valid method for assessing the verbal behavior of children with autism. This research supports the use of telehealth to bridge healthcare gaps for families in remote or underserved areas. By providing an accessible platform for functional language assessment, telehealth offers a promising avenue for enhancing early intervention and improving long-term outcomes. \nImplications: Our findings highlight the importance of individualized interventions to address verbal behavior deficits of children with autism. Future research is necessary to explore the scalability of these findings and their application in broader, more diverse populations.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the role of International Posture as a predictor of key individual difference variables in foreign language learning, specifically foreign language enjoyment (FLE), foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA), willingness to communicate (WTC), and self-perceived communication competence (SPCC). Using data from n = 368 international multilingual adult language learners, a structural equation modelling approach tested both direct and indirect effects of International Posture on WTC and SPCC through FLE and FLCA. Results indicated that International Posture positively predicted FLE, WTC, and SPCC, while negatively predicting FLCA. Furthermore, both FLE and FLCA partially mediated the effects of International Posture on WTC, and FLCA also mediated the relationship between International Posture and SPCC. These findings highlight the importance of learners’ global orientations and affective experiences in shaping communicative behaviour. The study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the nomological network of International Posture and the inclusion of affective variables within this network.",

          "authors": "Maryanne Brassil; Éimear Duncan; Brian Mac Síthigh; Ciara Greene",
          "abstract": "In recent years, many eyewitness misinformation studies have moved from face-to-face to online data collection. However, the impact of different data collection contexts on misinformation susceptibility has not yet been investigated. In Study 1, we compared results from the same experiment conducted in two different data collection contexts – in person in a Laboratory and online via the recruitment platform Prolific – and found that Prolific participants were both less accurate overall and more susceptible to misinformation. Furthermore, we replicated a previous finding that increased visual perceptual load in a scene reduces eyewitness recall accuracy, but observed this effect in the Laboratory group only. In Study 2, we added a General Online group to test whether these differences extended to all online data collection, or if they were specific to Prolific participants. Misinformation susceptibility in the General Online group was similar to the Laboratory group, and significantly lower than that in the Prolific group. However, perceptual load effects were also absent in the General Online group. Ultimately, these findings indicate that different data collection contexts yield varying results in eyewitness misinformation studies. Researchers should exercise caution when selecting recruitment approaches, as attentional engagement and experimental control differ across contexts.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Consciousness science is fragmented, and empirical investigations are confined within each theory of consciousness’ (TOC) framework. Proliferating ToCs accumulate anomalies without progress, operating orthogonally. The principle of recurrency – functional and architectural – offers a unifying, mechanistic scaffold for consciousness to arise. We show that all theories tacitly invoke feedback loops and can be re-expressed along a single axis of recursion. Four nested levels, viz., cellular, local inter-areal, global, and lateral, map onto state, phenomenal content, manipulative access, and experiential similarity, respectively, thus tying evolved anatomy to phenomenon. The traditional phenomenal-versus-access stand-off dissolves into a graded cascade wherein deeper recursion expands the set of reportable, behaviour-driving variables. Recurrence is favoured evolutionarily, and ontologically, rebutting feed-forward, “unfolding” objections, while brain-body loops ground selfhood, and complete action loops with the environment. Furthermore, clinically, targeting recurrent pathways promise new biomarkers, and alleviation, in disorders of consciousness (DoCs). The field urgently requires this conceptual unification that is biologically plausible, mechanistic, and empirically testable.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Being able to interpret emotional expressions is fundamental to social interaction. Although \ndeficits in emotion recognition are well-documented in dementia, they have received less \nattention in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Due to the overlap in neural processes supporting \nemotion and cognition, early disruptions in emotion recognition may indicate broader functional \ndecline. This study examined behavioral and neural responses to emotional faces in patients with \nMCI using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. For that aim, N=60 \nparticipants were recruited, including 30 patients with MCI and 30 healthy controls. During fMRI, \nparticipants completed a facial emotion recognition task with expressions of anger, fear, sadness, \nhappiness, and neutral faces. Behavioral assessments further included measures of cognitive \ndomains (attention, memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial skills), face \nprocessing, emotional intelligence, and emotional interference. Patients with MCI showed \nimpaired recognition of negative emotions, such as anger (β=–0.37, p&lt;0.05), fear (β=–0.37, \np&lt;0.05), and sadness (β=–0.85, p&lt;0.001), whereas recognition of happiness remained intact. \nSadness recognition was predicted by face processing ability, and overall emotion recognition was \nassociated with memory performance. fMRI results showed widespread, emotion-specific \nactivation in healthy controls, particularly in occipital, frontal, and subcortical regions. Patients \nwith MCI showed reduced activation and less differentiated patterns, though group-level BOLD \ndifferences were not statistically significant. In summary, patients with MCI demonstrated \ndifficulties in recognizing negative emotions, which may impact social functioning, while neural \nmechanisms supporting emotion recognition appear largely preserved at this stage of cognitive \ndecline.",
