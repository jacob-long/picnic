          "authors": "Victor Guirado",
          "abstract": "The objective of this study review is to identify methodological biases in publicly available virological studies, motivated by a review and examination of early SARS-CoV-2. \nA narrative critical review of virology literature (1930-2024) has been conducted. Literature was identified through targeted keyword searches in PubMed, Scopus, Web o Science, and Google Scholar, refined by AI-assisted tools to detect recurring patterns. Studies were included if they addressed viral isolation, genome sequencing and infectivity testing. \nAfter exhaustive search and review, three recurrent methodological weaknesses were identified: Isolation frequently equated with indirect detection of genetic material rather than rigorous purification by density gradients of viral particles; Sequencing reliant on computational assemblies and references genomes, with no direct sequencing from purified particles by gradients of density; Infectivity inferred from cytopathic effects or modelling, with insufficient or incomplete negative controls. The review of the virological studies from 1930 to 2024 illustrate that these weaknesses are systematic. Contemporary virology often relies on indirect evidence. The current viral model has not been empirically verified. Thus, more rigorous isolation, sequencing from purified particles, exhaustive negative controls, and independent replication are essential to restore scientific robustness.",

          "authors": "Leonardo Ventura",
          "abstract": "In epidemiology, standardization is an essential tool when comparing mortality between populations\nwith different age structures. Using Italy, one of the oldest countries in the European Union, and the\nEU-27 aggregate as a case study, this methodological note demonstrates how comparisons between\ncrude mortality rates can give misleading interpretations of disease burden. While crude rates\nsuggested a higher mortality in Italy (≈280 per 100 000) compared to the EU-27 (≈259 per 100\n000), standardized rates showed the reverse pattern (≈224 vs ≈239 per 100 000). A Kitagawa\ndecomposition confirmed that the excess in crude mortality rates for Italy is almost entirely\nexplained by the effect of age structure rather than true etiological factors.\nThis methodological note illustrates the necessity of proper standardization in cancer epidemiology.\nAll the instructions to download the official datasets and the Python scripts for the analysis are\nopenly available on Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.17251977), offering both an educational example\nand a methodological reference for standardization to support students, policymakers, and\nresearchers in applying these techniques.",

          "authors": "Wanpeng Tan",
          "abstract": "This article analyzes the deep, systemic flaws within the current sociological structures in basic research. From peer review and publication culture to funding allocation and the tenure system, we reveal a structural crisis defined by broken feedback loops, perverse incentives, and the rise of academic monopolies. We argue that incremental fixes are insufficient and that a complete reform is now warranted. To this end, we present the vision for a novel Community-driven Open Research Ecosystem (CORE), a new paradigm or constitution for the entire community guided by the overarching Diversity Principle. The CORE is a dynamic, balanced, and self-regulating ecosystem designed to promote meritocracy and diversity, offering equal opportunity to all members while simultaneously applying monopoly-breaking measures against the top and securing a safety net for the bottom. By thoughtfully navigating its implementation challenges, a CORE can ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency via its dual evaluation system in knowledge dissemination, resource allocation, and career advancement, creating the conditions for a new era of innovation in basic research.",

          "title": "An Emmanuel Levinas Critique of Social Science Research Practice",
          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Historically, academic research has been structured around the supremacy of methodology. Neutrality, replicability, and objectivity are generally regarded as the fundamental principles of scholarly legitimacy, whereas ethics is considered a secondary issue, typically managed through institutional review processes or compliance mechanisms. This order suggests that research can be planned, carried out, and defended mostly through strict methods, with ethical reflection added later as a form of regulation. Nevertheless, this configuration jeopardises the reduction of ethics to mere procedure and participants to mere subjects of examination. This article critiques the method-first paradigm through Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy, especially his assertion that ethics constitutes “first philosophy.” Levinas posits that responsibility to the Other precedes ontology, cognition, and categorisation. The face of the Other presents the researcher with an inescapable demand that cannot be mitigated by objectivity or methodological detachment. From this perspective, the traditional subject–object relationship central to research practice is undermined: participants are not mere data to be handled but individuals whose distinctiveness by necessity demands accountability. Consequently, ethics cannot be perceived merely as a procedural adjunct to methodology; rather, it constitutes the foundational basis from which scholarly inquiry must emerge. Methodologically, the article integrates a critical conceptual analysis of Levinas’s writings with a normative critique of current research practices. This method allows the argument to transition from mere scholarly commentary to a prescriptive assertion: research should be reconceptualised as an ethical engagement rooted in accountability for the Other, rather than as a dispassionate process of knowledge creation. The conclusion suggests that an ethics-first approach, defined by humility, attentiveness, and responsiveness, provides a foundational reorientation of scholarship. In this recontextualization, ethics is not an external limitation but the foundational condition of academic inquiry itself.",

Four concerns are considered major due to retrospective registration, significance and inconsistencies in summary data presented, fast recruitment of patients and major discrepancies in data as well as methodology that exist between the conference abstract and the published trail. These serious and multiple concerns suggest the urgent need for reliable investigation of the trustworthiness of the POSTAL study.

          "abstract": "Objectives\nCalls to compensate patient partners for contributions to the health sector are increasing. The BMJ invites patients and the public (P&amp;P) to review manuscripts alongside academic reviewers and recently introduced remuneration. We surveyed P&amp;P reviewers to capture perspectives on remuneration and overall reviewing experience.\n\nDesign/setting\nTwo cross-sectional surveys administered via SurveyMonkey. \n\nParticipants\nSurvey 1 targeted P&amp;P reviewers who had completed a review in the past 3 years; Survey 2 included those invited to review but who had not completed a review within that period. \n\nResults\nSurvey 1 received 183/267 (69%) responses; Survey 2 received 100/493 (20%) responses. Most respondents were based in the UK or US. Overall, 71% (202/283) rated their review experience as “very good” or “good.” Half (51%, 143/283) said a £50 payment would make them more likely to review (48% Survey 1, 56% Survey 2). One-third (32%, 91/283) said a subscription to a selection of BMJ journals would make them more likely to review (32% Survey 1, 33% Survey 2). However, 29% (82/283) said £50 would not influence them (33% Survey 1, 22% Survey 2) and 40% (114/283) said the same about a subscription (39% Survey 1, 43% Survey 2). . Views on remuneration varied - some saw it as recognition of value, others viewed it as unnecessary, and some felt it was inadequate compensation. While 59% (166/283) had no concerns about introducing payment; 18% (52) had concerns, and 17% (49) were unsure. Concerns included potentially changing reviewers’ motivations and the quality of reviews, administrative burden and tax implications, impact on income received from benefits, and a need to evaluate the initiative. Respondents emphasised the importance of offering optional incentives to accommodate individual preferences.\n\nConclusions \nThe BMJ’s P&amp;P reviewers hold diverse views on remuneration. Flexible, optional incentives may help support broader engagement while respecting individual needs and values.",

          "authors": "Gabriela Dârzan",
          "abstract": "Modern health and social science research faces well-documented challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and practical feasibility. A significant proportion of studies cannot be replicated, and incomplete reporting leads to wasted resources. Equally, many promising interventions fail to translate into practice due to unrecognized feasibility obstacles in planning and implementation. This article introduces S-FIPR (Software for Feasibility and Integrity of Research Projects), which is an integrated digital platform designed to improve research project rigor, transparency, and viability from inception to dissemination. We outline the background reproducibility and feasibility gaps that motivate the development of S-FIPR, then describe the platform’s concept, including its user roles, workflows, and core functional blocks. A central innovation is the Feasibility Index (F-Index), a composite score assessing proposals across multiple domains with full auditability and explainability. We detail S-FIPR’s approach to responsible AI governance, such as model cards and bias mitigation, ensuring AI features remain transparent and advisory. The platform’s alignment with international standards - CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, FAIR data principles, and GDPR - is mapped, underscoring compliance with best practices in reporting, data management, and privacy. An evaluation plan is presented, leveraging usability scales and technology acceptance frameworks (TAM/UTAUT) to assess user experience and key adoption metrics. We discuss ethical and legal considerations, including research ethics oversight and data protection. Finally, we address current limitations and outline a roadmap from a minimum viable product (MVP) through pilot studies to broader scale-up. By embedding evidence-based safeguards and guidance into the research lifecycle, S-FIPR aims to bolster the integrity and feasibility of health research projects in the digital era. \nKeywords: Research integrity, Feasibility, Reproducibility, Digital platform, F-Index, AI governance, CONSORT, FAIR data, Usability, Health research",

          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer",
          "abstract": "The importance of open research information, particularly publication metadata, is widely recognised. Crossref is one of the most important infrastructures for registering open metadata as part of DOI record registration. It is widely known, however, that the metadata of many publications is far from complete, with many publishers making certain metadata openly available, but failing to do so for other metadata elements. \n\nOf course, publishers' ability to register this metadata with Crossref depends on their capacity to capture and retain this data in their production workflows. Manuscript submission systems are an important, yet largely overlooked, factor in the extent to which publishers make metadata available through Crossref. \n\nIn this paper, we present the results of an analysis investigating the correlation between the level of metadata that publishers deposit with Crossref and the submission systems that they deploy for their journals. We have looked at the 153 publishers with the largest amounts of publications in Crossref and concentrate on the four most commonly used systems: Editorial Manager, ScholarOne, Open Journal Systems (OJS) and eJournalPress. \n\nWe show that some submission systems appear better suited to capturing certain metadata elements. However, there are always cases where publishers using the same system differ widely in the level of metadata they register, suggesting that technology is not the only prohibiting factor and other considerations are at play.",

          "authors": "Agatha Laboe; Leah M. Parsons; Rebecca L. Flynn; Isabel R. Rooper; Adrian Ortega; Graham Miller; Sophie Hartwick; Rosa Saavedra; Jennifer E. Wildes; Andrea K. Graham",
          "abstract": "Food insecurity is strongly associated with adverse health outcomes and eating disorder behaviors, including binge eating. Individuals from under-resourced communities, who disproportionately experience food insecurity, often face substantial barriers to accessing eating disorder care. Digital interventions present a promising avenue to reduce disparities in treatment access, but their success depends on how well they align with the expectations of intended users. This study explored the motivations and expectations of treatment-seeking individuals with food insecurity who presented to FoodSteps, a digital intervention for binge eating. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 124 participants across two trials. Using thematic analysis, we identified four themes related to participants’ motivations for engagement and expectations for the intervention. First, participants were drawn to FoodSteps because it aligned with their personal health goals, including reducing binge eating, managing weight, and developing healthy eating patterns. Many sought greater insight into their behaviors, coping strategies for triggers, and accountability through support from a coach. Second, participants described FoodSteps as their first opportunity to access specialized care for binge eating, noting that prior treatment-seeking was often hindered by structural barriers. Third, digital delivery was viewed as especially appealing due to its accessibility, convenience, and affordability. Finally, participants highlighted shame surrounding binge eating as both a barrier to prior help-seeking and a motivator for engaging with this digital intervention. Overall, findings suggest that individuals experiencing food insecurity are motivated to engage with digital interventions that are supportive, accessible, and closely aligned with their personal health goals.",

          "authors": "Yixiao Dong; Deodatta Baral; Kushmakar Baral; Denis Dumas",
          "abstract": "While some are neutral, many psychological constructs (e.g., depression, learning motivation, or antisocial behavior) carry clear directional expectations that align with social or ethical principles and values. When a construct is framed with the goal of moving toward its socially desirable direction, it becomes a meaningful psychological objective to pursue. We pursue different objectives in our daily lives, sometimes simultaneously. During this process, trade-offs occur when they are in tension or conflict, meaning they cannot be consistently improved without compromising one another. While certain psychological trade-offs have been well studied, others remain underexplored or possibly even unidentified. One critical reason is that mainstream analytic methods used in psychological research are not designed to investigate such trade-offs. Fortunately, a suitable method has long existed in other disciplines. Pareto Optimization (PO) is an effective analytic framework widely applied in fields such as biology, economics, and engineering to investigate trade-offs among multiple competing objectives. In this tutorial, we review the core conceptual and methodological foundations of PO and aim to bring this classic method to a psychological audience. Moreover, we develop a user-friendly R Shiny application (named PO-Run) for conducting PO analyses. The utility of the application is illustrated through a real-world psychological example that simultaneously pursues two conflicting objectives: promoting critical actions and minimizing mental stress. Their trade-off relationship is then evaluated via the evidence generated by PO-Run, along with relevant theoretical justification.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research suggests some of the most profound meditation-induced psychological transformations require mastery of mental skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Such development, however, often demands years of sustained practice and expert guidance. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers a novel means of potentially supporting meditative development by modulating brain structures with high spatial precision. Suppression of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—a hub of self-referential processing—may reduce stickiness in internal cognitions and self-interference, thereby fostering equanimity, a crucial meditative faculty. This pilot feasibility study investigated the effects of tFUS-based PCC inhibition during a ten-day silent retreat. Twenty-eight meditators received two stimulation sessions during the retreat and completed standardized questionnaires and daily phenomenological reports. Quantitative analyses revealed significant increases in trait mindfulness, both state–trait nondual awareness, and interoceptive body listening. Qualitative analyses identified consistent differences between stimulation and non-stimulation days: tFUS was associated with enhanced meditative phenomenology, including equanimity, concentration, and sensory clarity, as well as shifts in self-perception and cathartic emotional release. These experiential effects often unfolded in interaction with participants’ ongoing psychological challenges, suggesting that tFUS may increase baseline equanimity and scaffold meditative capacities. Implementation was feasible but required logistical planning. Limitations include the quasi-experimental design, reliance on self-reports, and lack of long-term follow-up. Future studies should use randomized sham-controlled designs, neurophenomenological methods, and examine systematic dose–response parameters with MRI-guided targeting. Together, these findings highlight tFUS as a promising tool for augmenting meditation training and advancing the study of meditative development.",

          "authors": "Kyung Hee Kim",
          "abstract": "Masters and Johnson (1966) described intimation, the pre-orgasmic state of visceral awareness and imminent climax, as a distinctive phase of present-moment attunement. In epilepsy, aura denotes an anticipatory state of altered interoception, affective intensity, or ecstatic sensations. Both are threshold phenomena, yet their neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a predictive-processing framework, this investigation develops a comparative theoretical model in which intimation and aura are regulated by interactions between the cerebellum, salience network, and frontal control systems. Evidence from neuroimaging, oscillatory, and clinical studies indicates that cerebellar activity contributes not only to motor coordination but also to precision calibration across interoceptive, affective, and executive domains. During intimation, cerebellar–salience coupling sustains the poised state of attunement described by Masters and Johnson, supported by locus coeruleus–norepinephrine modulation and alpha–beta–theta rhythms. In aura, unstable precision weighting within these same circuits may disrupt calibration, leaving anticipation fragile and prone to seizure propagation. By positioning both states as predictive threshold events governed by cerebellar–salience–frontal network dynamics, this investigation reframes anticipatory brain states, linking sexual function and epilepsy while extending Masters and Johnson’s descriptive insight into a computational account of present-moment attunement.",

          "abstract": "The concept of \"training scars\"—unintended and potentially harmful habits acquired through training—has received limited scholarly attention despite its relevance to officer safety. Although widely referenced in military and police training communities, the term remains colloquial and lacks a formal definition, theoretical grounding, and operational guidance. This conceptual synthesis marks the initial phase of a broader effort to develop the concept. We conducted a rapid integrative review to identify definitions, examples, attributes, related terms, and mitigation strategies. Searches across academic databases and grey literature revealed that references are largely anecdotal, with few empirical studies. Our findings underscore the need for conceptual clarity, consistent terminology, and systematic evaluation. Ultimately, we aim to construct a consensus definition and framework for identifying and addressing training scars across officer-safety disciplines (e.g., defensive tactics, firearms). This foundational review lays the groundwork for a Delphi study with international experts to further develop the concept.",

We also explored whether critical thinking about health varied as a function of sociodemographic determinants.\nMethods: Parents (N=142) and young adults (N=145) in the U.S. completed an online test of critical thinking about health, and answered questions about their background.\nResults: Both parents and young adults in the U.S. struggled to think critically about health and treatments based on various science literacy and evidence-based practice principles. They struggled most with the concept, “Relative effects of treatments alone can be misleading.” Parents with higher educational attainment had lower critical thinking about health, and young adults who reported a liberal political affiliation had higher critical thinking scores. Both parents and young adults with higher household income had higher critical thinking about health.\nConclusions: This investigation demonstrates a need to increase critical thinking about health among U.S. parents and young adults so they can be empowered to make informed health choices.",

          "title": "Audiovisual Speech Perception in Aging Cochlear Implant Users and Age-Matched Non-Implanted Adults",
          "authors": "James William Dias; Kara C. Schvartz-Leyzac; Kelly C. Harris",
          "abstract": "Objectives. Older typical-hearing adults without a cochlear-implant (CI) have been found to exhibit greater multisensory benefits when identifying audiovisual speech than younger normal-hearing adults. The greater multisensory benefits demonstrated by older non-CI users can compensate for unisensory auditory and visual speech deficits, allowing them to identify audiovisual speech at a degree of accuracy like that of younger normal-hearing adults. Though most new CI recipients are 65 years of age and older, the reliance of older CI users on such multisensory benefits is unknown. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate age-related differences in cross-sensory and multisensory benefits in audiovisual speech identification in aging CI users and to examine how they differ from age-matched non-CI users.\nDesign. Twenty middle-aged-to-older CI users (50-83 years of age) and 35 age-matched non-CI users completed an auditory-visual speech identification task, identifying 288 disyllabic words presented either auditory-alone, visual-alone, or audiovisually. CI users identified speech stimuli streamed directly through their CI device in quiet and in noise (Gaussian) at a +10 and +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Non-CI users identified speech stimuli delivered through earphones in noise at -5, 0, and +5 dB SNR conditions. Different noise conditions were used for CI users and non-CI users to avoid ceiling and floor effects. From visual, auditory, and audiovisual performance, psychometrics for the visual enhancement of auditory speech (VE), the auditory enhancement of visual speech (AE), and auditory-visual multisensory enhancement (AVE) were calculated. Group differences (in the overlapping +5 dB SNR condition) and effects of age and noise were tested using linear regression and linear mixed-effects regression models.\nResults. Both CI users and non-CI users demonstrated canonical differences in visual, auditory, and audiovisual speech identification. VE and AVE were greater for CI users than non-CI users. AVE increased with the age of older CI users and non-CI users, consistent with age-group differences in AVE we observed in a previous study of non-CI users.\nConclusions. The results of the current investigation suggest that CI users, like age-matched non-CI users, rely on multisensory integration more as they age. Older CI users may benefit more from audiovisual input than older non-CI users. These perceptual benefits grant older CI users the capacity to identify audiovisual speech to a degree of accuracy closer to that of older non-CI users, despite deficits in the auditory perception of CI users. As a result, successful use of a CI device may partially depend on the ability of a CI user to integrate information they see with information available from their device, and older CI users may depend on visual input more to successfully use their CI.",

          "abstract": "How are race riots absolved of overt racial motivations? Social psychological research has shown how far-right leaders mobilise people by claiming that majority populations are threatened or silenced. This paper examines a related process: how riotous actions are explained and justified through appeals to ‘British values.’ Using discursive psychology, we analyse talk surrounding the riots that followed the stabbing of three young girls in Southport, England—the UK race riots of August 2024. We show that invoking British or English values serves two key functions: it renders rioters’ actions self-explanatory and offers a competing account of rioters as the more authentic representation of Britishness and the British people than the government. This reframing shifts attention away from ‘far-right’ motivations, instead portraying the riots as effortful and even ideal expressions of British citizenship. Thus, British values operate not merely as symbols but as rhetorical tools linking the riots, immigration, state policy, and national identity.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in social life, understanding its interpersonal and psychological implications is urgent yet under-theorized. This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "authors": "Danni Chi; Jiana Wang",
          "abstract": "Psychological science is entering an era in which artificial systems participate in relational and emotional life. Yet most therapeutic AI and mental health technologies remain limited to skill-based training—teaching users to recognize emotions, regulate cognition, or perform social scripts—while neglecting the developmental foundations of authentic relatedness. Building on Hedges’ (1983, 2000) four developmental listening perspectives—organizing, symbiotic, self–other, and independence experiences—this article proposes a relational - developmental framework for therapeutic AI, extending psychological theory into the domain of artificial companionship. Integrating attachment theory, mentalization, self-determination, and cooperative ontogeny, the framework conceptualizes responsiveness as a graded, temporally calibrated process that parallels the progression from early containment to mature mutual recognition. Rather than simulating empathy, therapeutic AI should cultivate developmentally adaptive responsiveness—a mode of engagement that includes tolerable frustration, repair, and guided differentiation to promote psychological growth. This perspective redefines AI not as a perpetual empathic mirror but as a relational training ground that scaffolds users’ capacity to relate to real others. It further invites psychological science to reconsider responsiveness itself as a central construct linking development, therapy, and human–machine interaction.",

          "abstract": "Psychophysics seeks to quantitatively characterize relationships between objective properties of the world and subjective properties of perception. However, traditional approaches investigate psychophysical dependencies of perception on stimulus properties on a case by case basis rather than seeking to identify quantitative relationships among these psychological processes themselves. This latter goal is particularly important when the processes in question likely depend on each other in some way, such as is the case for subjective experience and task performance: typically, stronger physical stimuli lead to better performance and stronger subjective experiences of clarity, vividness, or confidence. But is the relationship between performance and subjective experience fixed, or can it vary, e.g. by task or attentional demands? Such questions are key for better understanding psychological processes in general, and subjective experience in particular. Here, we develop and showcase a new psychophysical method designed to answer such questions: relative psychometric function (RPF) analysis, which characterizes the nonlinear psychometric relationships between psychological processes and how these relationships change under different circumstances (e.g. experimental manipulations). We demonstrate the advantages of RPF analysis using a sample dataset in which human subjects discriminated random dot kinematogram stimuli which varied in dot motion coherence and overall dot density (dots per visual degree), and rated confidence. RPF analysis revealed systematic changes in the relationship between performance and two subjective measures (confidence and metacognitive sensitivity) due to dot density and task design choices. While these empirical results are intriguing in their own right, they also show how RPF analysis can reveal changes in quantitative relationships between any two psychological measures: performance, vividness, clarity, reaction time, confidence, and more. To encourage the scientific community to use RPF analysis on their data, we also present our open-source RPF toolbox.",

          "abstract": "Men are more morally exclusive than women. When and how does this difference emerge in human development? Across four samples spanning the ages of 4 to 80 (total n = 1,842), we measure people’s moral exclusiveness toward human outgroups and non-human animals. We identify adolescence (13–18 years) as key: older male adolescents are more morally exclusive than younger male adolescents, while there is no such difference for female adolescents. Linked to this is a general preference for social hierarchies in males. We further find the turning point in gendered moral exclusiveness: while males are already more morally exclusive than females at the age of 6 and such gender differences persist throughout childhood and in adulthood, they are not yet evident in younger children. Resonating with literature in social-developmental psychology and evolutionary accounts, we suggest that gender differences in moral exclusiveness are likely biologically prepared yet strengthened through gender-dependent socialisation.",

This review focuses on LLMs, given the field’s explosive interest in testing whether their ability to generate context-sensitive language representations can aid large-scale assessment and intervention. We synthesize recent applications of LLMs, including language-based assessment of psychopathology, digital phenotyping, electronic health record analysis, and early integrations into psychotherapy. However, we highlight deep challenges of AI that loom large in the highly sensitive space of mental health treatment, including clear risks of bias, hallucinations, inappropriate (or even dangerous) therapeutic recommendations, and limited regulatory oversight. We conclude with future directions that are critical for the safe and equitable use of LLMs in mental health.",

By detailing step-by-step tutorials and openly sharing code and pipelines, DevStart lowers the barriers that hinder many early career researchers and students. Beyond tutorials, DevStart fosters community engagement through an online forum that supports collaboration, troubleshooting, and the exchange of ideas.

          "authors": "Llewellyn Ellardus van Zyl",
          "abstract": "The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into psychological practice is transforming how psychologists reason, document, and deliver care. While the potential benefits of AI such as improved diagnostic accuracy, administrative efficiency, and data-informed decision-making are widely recognized, its unintended consequences for psychologists themselves remain poorly understood. Drawing on recent empirical and conceptual literature, this commentary critically examines six domains through which sustained AI use may adversely affect psychologists’ professional functioning: (a) cognitive functioning and professional competence, (b) professional identity and meaning, (c) ethical reasoning and legal challenges, (d) interpersonal and social functioning, (e) data governance and vendor lock-in and (f) personal wellbeing. Evidence suggests that cognitive offloading and automation bias may erode diagnostic reasoning and clinical judgment, moral deskilling and value misalignment can undermine ethical autonomy and technostress, data dependence, and vendor lock-in pose growing threats to practitioner wellbeing and professional sovereignty. These dynamics indicate that AI operates not merely as a technical aid but as a transformative social and psychological actor that reshapes how psychologists think, decide, and relate to their work. The paper argues for the urgent development of evidence-based safeguards, practitioner education, and regulatory frameworks to ensure that AI enhances rather than erodes human competence and ethical reflection. Without deliberate intervention, the rapid integration of AI across mental healthcare risks diminishing the very cognitive and moral capacities that define the discipline of psychology.",

The acoustic cues that contribute to these percepts are not known, and they may vary from listener to listener. To test this, we asked musically trained listeners to transcribe the repeating perceptions using musical notation, including pitch where possible. They completed three transcriptions of each of five noises (and a control sound with embedded features). Within listeners, pitch chromas were reported for the same noises at approximately the same time more than for different noises, implying that their pitched percepts were somewhat reliable. However, between listeners, there were not significantly more coincidences for pairs of the same noises than pairs of different noises, in line with listeners having more idiosyncratic perceptions.",

These peaks are important because they mobilize large populations, but they are also very hard to predict and explain. The current project focused on collective dynamics of anger as a predictor of online peaks. Specifically, we examined whether delayed recovery in anger online in the days preceding activity peaks, termed critical slowing down, predicted the occurrence of peaks. We analyzed the full archive of #BlackLivesMatter tweets between 2015-2020 (N = ~60 million). Congruent with critical slowing down theory, we found that increased autocorrelation in anger but lowered emotional variance were associated with a greater likelihood of peaks. These results suggest that delayed emotional recovery paired with lowered temporal emotional volatility predicts consecutive peaks in activism. By integrating emotional dynamics with complex systems theory, this project opens new avenues for forecasting tipping points in collective behavior.",

Specifically, 1) we review literature that highlights the importance of selfish and selfless norms, 2) we explain why devaluation of prosocial behavior can be additionally understood as a reaction to counternormativity when one perceives a violation of such norms, and 3) discuss the importance of taking the stigmatization of counternormative prosociality into account and examining its broader implications when interpreting social psychological findings on prosocial behavior.

          "abstract": "Religious and sexual identities are often perceived as conflicting, creating challenges for religious lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. This study examined how risk (perceived in-group rejection, discrimination) and protective (in-group identification, social support) factors are associated with identity integration, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. A total of 306 LGB-religious individuals participated in this study. Perceived rejection from the religious in-group – reflecting the belief that religious communities view LGB and religious identities as incompatible – was significantly associated with lower identity integration. It was also linked to lower life satisfaction, particularly when discrimination was high. Social support related to being both LGB and religious was a consistent protective factor of identity integration and life satisfaction. In-group identification showed a more complex pattern: religious identification was positively related to identity integration but intensified the negative association between religious rejection and life satisfaction. In contrast, strong identification with the LGB in-group buffered against this negative effect. No significant correlates emerged for psychological distress, suggesting it may be shaped by broader factors unrelated to identity. Findings underscore the importance of creating and promoting inclusive in-group norms, particularly within religious communities, and fostering support for individuals navigating both LGB and religious identities.",

Participants completed a questionnaire designed to capture information on demographic variables as well as prevalence of SHAAKE in oneself and others, and reasons for doing so. Of the twenty participants included in data analysis, 45% recalled having made the SHAAKE movement after the heading the football, and 65% reported they had observed another player doing so. Three-quarters of participants reported having sustained concussion before. Additionally, a one-way ANOVA revealed that women were significantly more likely to report dizziness as the reason for SHAAKE than men which may be due to the technical ability of heading the football. With this knowledge, non-players may be more observant of dizziness in women football players shortly after heading the ball this may indicate damage to the brain.",

Although recent legislation (Law No. 69/2012) mandates their presence in schools, empirical data on their working conditions remain scarce. A structured questionnaire administered to 67 assistant teachers examined four key areas: professional needs, reported difficulties, perceptions of students’ needs, and self-rated levels of support, stress, recognition, and satisfaction. Findings reveal that assistant teachers report high levels of professional commitment and satisfaction but also face persistent systemic barriers—limited access to specialist support (e.g., speech therapists, psychologists), shortages of didactic materials, and insufficient continuous training. Their identified needs largely mirror those of their students, emphasizing the interdependence between teacher capacity and student inclusion. The report highlights the paradox of inclusion in Albania: while the policy framework endorses equality and access, practical implementation remains hindered by resource and coordination gaps. Recommendations focus on strengthening multidisciplinary school services, establishing reasonable workload ratios, and institutionalizing ongoing professional development.\n\nKeywords: inclusive education, assistant teachers, Albania, professional needs, teacher satisfaction",

          "abstract": "Current accounts posit that heard speech is covertly imitated to optimise speech perception. Behaviourally, covert imitation is measured using the stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) paradigm. In a speech SRC task, participants produce a prompted speech syllable whilst perceiving a speech distractor that either matches the target response (compatible condition) or does not (incompatible condition). The degree to which the distractor is covertly imitated is captured by the automatic imitation effect, computed as the difference in response times (RTs) between incompatible and compatible trials. Two theoretical accounts disagree on whether whether covert imitation is enhanced when speech perception is challenging or instead when the speech signal is familiar to the listener. To dissociate between these two accounts, we conducted two experiments utilising the speech SRC task (Experiments 1 and 2) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) (Experiment 2) to evaluate covert imitation of native speech sounds (perceptually easy and familiar) and of non-native speech sounds (perceptually challenging and unfamiliar). In Experiment 1, participants performed an SRC task with native and non-native sounds, before and after receiving perceptual identification training with the non-native sounds. Automatic imitation was enhanced for non-native sounds compared to native sounds and decreased to a greater extent for non-native sounds than for native sounds following perceptual training. In Experiment 2, participants passively perceived native and non-native speech sounds whilst receiving single pulses of TMS to the tongue area of the primary motor cortex (M1). Tongue M1 showed higher excitability during passive perception of non-native sounds. Our results highlight that covert imitation is enhanced during the perception of perceptually challenging, unfamiliar speech, suggesting that covert imitation acts as an adaptive reflexive gain control mechanism to optimise speech perception.",

          "abstract": "Flooding is Europe’s most frequent natural disaster, impacting public health and well-being. This study examined risk and resilience factors in adolescents’ adjustment following the May 2023 Emilia Romagna flood. We investigated trajectories of positive/negative emotions and sleep–wake problems post-disaster, testing whether pre-disaster objective sleep (duration, efficiency, timing) served as promotive or protective resilience factors. Moderating roles of individual assets (circadian preferences) and contextual risks (disaster exposure) were also assessed. To this aim, this longitudinal study followed a sample of 385 adolescents (Mage = 15.46, SDage = 1.16, 53.8% females) across five waves from September 2022 to February 2024. The flooding event occurred midway. Results showed that regarding post-disaster trajectories, adolescents reported reductions in negative emotions and wake disturbances and increases in positive emotions within three months after the flooding. However, these trends partially reversed between three and six months. Concluding, this study advances the understanding of adolescent post-disaster adjustment highlighting the complex interplay of resilience patterns in adolescent post-disaster adjustment. Inter-individual differences in sleep quality and regularity should be targeted to foster positive trajectories, with attention to individual and contextual moderators.",

          "abstract": "Autistic adults experience disproportionately high levels of loneliness, often influenced by social environments that are inaccessible or unaccommodating, rather than a lack of social interest. To address this, some individuals have turned to digital tools, such as companion chatbots, which simulate emotionally supportive conversations as an alternative means of connection. This article critically examines the role of chatbots in alleviating loneliness and promoting the well-being of autistic adults. Following a brief overview of chatbot companions’ technologies and current theories of loneliness dimensions, this argument examines whether these technologies truly provide meaningful support for autistic individuals. By analysing chatbots through the lens of methodologies frequently proposed to mitigate loneliness, the paper highlights the benefits of these technologies in conjunction with ethical considerations, emotional risks, and design limitations—particularly when grounded in normative assumptions regarding communication, loneliness, and relationships. It concludes that, although companion chatbots may function as temporary support for companionship, they must be developed in accordance with neurodivergence-affirming principles to effectively alleviate loneliness and avoid further isolation or dependence for autistic users.",

          "abstract": "Ideals play important roles in human life and psychology. Over the past decade, several mindfulness-based interventions have directly cultivated ideal mentalities that have not yet been achieved at the level of humanity, leading to the establishment of ideal psychology. Beyond research on ideal mentalities, ideal psychology has evolved into a general psychological approach characterized by future-oriented perspectives and associated methodologies. This article provides the first detailed introduction of this emerging approach. It summarizes six features of ideal mentalities, presents the design–achievement–evaluation cycle for research on them, and outlines seven methodological principles for enhancing studies on both ideal and existing mentalities with similar features. It further illustrates three aspects of future-oriented perspectives that shape research, through which it clarifies how ideal psychology relates to previous schools of psychology such as critical psychology, positive psychology, and transpersonal psychology, as well as to other traditions including Eastern spiritual traditions, Marxism and the critical tradition, transhumanism, and Plato’s philosophy. The article also exemplifies recent applications of ideal psychology in cultivating ideal mentalities such as mentalities of emptiness, Confucian oneness, and the nondifferential four immeasurables, as well as in advancing research on existing mentalities such as mindfulness, mortality salience, and beliefs about human nature. Finally, it discusses the major contributions, limitations, and future directions of ideal psychology.",

          "abstract": "Most research on social support in diabetes management lacks detail on the specific behaviours involved. This narrative review identifies the types of social support behaviours that aid management of Type 2 diabetes. After searching five databases (62 included papers), we conducted a qualitative synthesis using a five-category taxonomy. Emotional and tangible support were most frequently reported, alongside social contact, belonging, and informational guidance. Emotional support included sharing experiences, feeling cared for, esteem support, and having someone available when needed. For care providers, key processes were building rapport, assessing needs, and offering both emotional and practical assistance. Some support, such as shared experiences, information, and belonging, may be ‘invisible,’ reducing the risk of obligation or dependency. Supportive behaviours that strengthen self-efficacy were especially beneficial for diabetes management. These findings provide a resource for designing interventions and guiding caregivers. Health services offering effective social support are more likely to improve diabetes outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Why do some disapproved acts seem more moral when they are widespread, while rare acts of goodness often appear especially praiseworthy? Existing theories of moral judgment emphasize either intrinsic features of actions (e.g., harm, cooperation) or the stable values of judges (e.g., moral foundations), yet they lack a formal account of how judgments are shaped by the normative contexts in which behaviors occur. We introduce Contextual Normative Morality Theory (CNMT), which proposes that moral judgments emerge from the interaction of perceived descriptive norms (commonness) and injunctive norms (approval). Across five studies and one supplemental study with nationally representative U.S. samples (total N = 2,562), we show that this injunctive by descriptive interaction robustly predicts moral evaluations. Disapproved behaviors were judged less harshly when common, whereas approved behaviors were judged more moral when rare. These effects replicated across naturalistic behaviors, held when directly manipulating norms around the same act, extended to fictional and participant-generated behaviors, and predicted not only moral judgments but also perceptions of harmfulness and cooperativeness. Moreover, models predicting moral judgment that included the injunctive by descriptive interaction alongside perceptions of harmfulness, cooperativeness, and moral values showed better fit than models relying on harm, cooperation, or values alone. Together, these findings highlight the neglected role of normative context, advancing a more flexible, socially embedded theory of morality.",

We tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) reduces anger in intoxicated vs. sober participants during instructed regulation of recalled anger. One hundred ninety-six healthy adults consumed alcohol or no beverage and received anodal or sham tDCS over the rVLPFC. During stimulation, participants used cognitive reappraisal, distraction, or rumination to regulate recalled anger. As expected, anger was lowest after distraction, intermediate after reappraisal, and highest after rumination. Contrary to predictions, there were no main effects of alcohol, stimulation, or their interaction. Exploratory analyses indicated that among intoxicated participants high in trait anger, anodal stimulation reduced anger following rumination compared to sham. Alcohol also amplified anger in individuals prone to angry rumination. These findings highlight the need for replication and refinement of tDCS protocols to better target intoxicated anger regulation.",

          "abstract": "The ability to generalize and apply knowledge to new situations is the hallmark of effective learning. There are multiple ways to improve learning towards generalization. Retrieval practice and worked examples have both been shown to improve learning, retention, and generalization. The literature on category learning also suggests that exposure to more varied examples, rather than the same example repeatedly, improves generalization. However, while retrieval practice is usually investigated with repeated examples, worked examples learning is usually investigated using varied content. Across two studies, we investigated how the combination of content variability during worked examples or retrieval practice instruction promotes generalization when students receive initial instruction before practice (Experiment 1) and when they do not (Experiment 2). We found that when learners received initial instruction, retrieval practice led to better generalization compared to worked examples, regardless of whether the stimuli were repeated or varied. When initial instruction was not provided, worked examples resulted in better generalization than retrieval practice when items were repeated. However, retrieval practice produced comparable generalization to worked examples when items were varied. These findings suggest that variability supports generalization, particularly when learners must induce underlying rules, and that retrieval practice, traditionally associated with memory retention, can also facilitate inductive learning when learners engage with varied examples. This study emphasizes the importance of adapting learning strategies to align with the stage of learning and task demands.",

          "abstract": "In the caste system, individuals affiliated with unalterable, endogamous groups interact within a framework of expected behavior and attitudes organized around groups (i.e., hierarchical relationships of pollution vs. purity). This structure creates a psychological reality (i.e., the consciousness of an individual as expressed in behaviors and attitudes such as identities, rituals, expectations, motivations, perceptions, worldviews, and restrictions) that has not been adequately studied. In the present study, we developed a tentative Likert-type scale of caste consciousness by following standard test development procedures: Generation of a large set of relevant items, item analyses conducted by experts, and subsequent follow-up checks. Subsequently, this scale was administered to a sample of 892 college students (age: M= 19.9 years, SD= 3.8) and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. The exploratory factor analysis reported a correlated five factor structure for caste consciousness, i.e., pro-social personality traits, life approach, inter-group relationship dread, concerns of status, and perception of others. The confirmatory factor analysis supported this five factor structure and showed strong measurement invariance across caste, gender, residential area, and religion in the shortened caste consciousness scale. Moreover, we found that Muslim, other backward caste, and women had lower caste consciousness. Conversely, scheduled caste had higher inter-group relationship dread and general caste (compared to other backward caste) had higher perception of others.  The present study developed a reliable and valid 28-item caste consciousness scale that may be valuable for the psychological study of caste system.",

          "abstract": "Young children must determine from whom to seek help, yet little is known about how they weigh different social cues when forming help-seeking expectations and how such weighting shift during preschool years. The present research examined how children aged 4 to 6 years integrated relationship type (mother vs. unfamiliar adult) and competence cues in a third-party prediction task. In Study 1 (N = 194), 4-year-olds expected help-seekers to turn to mothers regardless of competence, whereas 5- and 6-year-olds increasingly incorporated competence in predicting both mothers and unfamiliar adults. In Study 2 (N = 106), 5- and 6-year-olds preferred competent unfamiliar adults over incompetent mothers, while 4-year-olds showed no clear preference. These findings reveal a developmental shift from reliance on relationship type to growing sensitivity to competence, providing support for the developmental relationship primacy hypothesis. More broadly, the results highlight how young children flexibly integrate multiple social cues in help-seeking contexts, underscoring the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of attachment representations as developing social-cognitive systems.",

          "abstract": "Childhood trauma is highly prevalent, affecting over half of adults, yet its impact on mental imagery remains largely unexplored. Here we report a novel link between childhood adversity and impaired mental imagery. We examined imagery deficits in a community sample (N=317) using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire. Severe emotional abuse was strongly associated with acquired imagery deficits. Individuals with severe emotional abuse demonstrated 4-5 times higher rates of acquired imagery deficits (14-21%) compared to those with low trauma exposure (3-5%), with effects observed across the full imagery spectrum. Given that severe emotional abuse affects 15-16% of the population, prevalence estimates suggest 2-3% of the general population may experience trauma-related imagery impairment. This association may reflect disrupted stress-regulation systems that impair integration of bodily, emotional, and visual information necessary for mental imagery. These findings reveal a previously overlooked consequence of childhood trauma with significant clinical implications, as many evidence-based trauma interventions rely on intact visualization abilities.",

Despite their relative privilege (e.g., being white, English speaking, having higher socioeconomic status), almost all caregivers described situations in which power imbalances impacted PRS access, procedures, and outcomes. Specifically, caregivers tended to describe investigations that lacked transparency, failed to address all aspects of their complaint, did not include findings of fact, exceeded mandated timelines, and included remedies that they believed did not fully account for lost opportunities or the harm done to their child. Some caregivers also described situations in which local education agencies repeatedly made the same violations and failed to provide mandated remedies.

          "abstract": "Contemporary theories of consciousness offer a range of explanatory perspectives. Global Workspace Theory emphasizes cognitive access, Higher-Order Theories focus on metacognitive representation, Integrated Information Theory centers on intrinsic experience, and Predictive Coding Theory models cognitive processes as probabilistic inference. While each theory provides valuable insights, they often remain in conflict due to differing assumptions about the nature of consciousness. This paper proposes a phenomenologically informed framework that clarifies the explanatory scope of each theory in relation to key features of lived experience. Rather than seeking to reduce consciousness to a single principle, I argue for a pluralistic approach that respects the distinctive contributions of each model. Through comparative analysis guided by phenomenological reflection and supported by recent interdisciplinary proposals, I show how these theories can be seen as addressing complementary dimensions of consciousness. The aim is not to construct a single unified theory, but to demonstrate how integration, grounded in reflective phenomenological analysis, can serve as a starting point toward a more adequate science of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Individual differences in psychology are often measured through self-report questionnaires or behavioral performance, yet these approaches capture different constructs and rarely align. Computational modeling provides a framework for connecting both measures, as it extracts a process-level description of cognition from observable behavior in the form of latent variables. These latent variables represent repeated patterns of decision-making that should relate to psychological traits. We applied this approach to neuroethical decision-making, where evidence shows that both behavioral performance and self-reported psychological traits are related to how individuals weigh uncertain risks against potential benefits of emerging brain technologies. Participants completed a neuromodulation task in which risk and benefit probabilities were systematically varied. To capture how decisions unfolded, we used a temporally sensitive diffusion decision model that estimates when and how risks and benefits are evaluated. These model parameters described general trends in task behavior: individuals considered risks earlier and weighed risks more highly than benefits. Additionally, model parameters described how individuals modified their behavior: individuals who considered benefits first according to the model tended to endorse neuromodulation, but shifted towards rejection when risks were evaluated earlier. Importantly, self-reported psychological traits related to these computational parameters. Cognitive factors such as risk propensity and numeracy related to risk sensitivity and evaluation timing, while prosocial traits were also related to evaluation timing and benefit sensitivity. By contrast, Religion &amp; Spirituality and Moral Commitment measures showed lower than expected associations across parameters. By capturing process-level mechanisms, computational modeling served as a bridge between self-reported traits and observed behavior, showing how stable individual differences shape the dynamics of decision-making in neuroethical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Developing an integrated understanding of brain function demands to probe and alter neural activity in behaving animals. Although rodent species were initially considered ill-suited for studying the neural mechanisms supporting high-level cognition, the past two decades have seen a remarkable increase in the sophistication of behaviors that rodents can express in laboratory settings. However, establishing adequate behavioral paradigms and eﬃciently shaping rodent behavior in the lab are challenging such that the study of instructed behaviors remains confined to a handful of groups with hard-earned expertise. While detailed technical explanations are available for establishing specific behavioral setups, a general framework for how to instruct behaviors in lab animals is lacking. Here, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic introduction of how to best design lab tasks and train animals in these tasks. We delineate conceptual principles that cover all aspects of behavioral investigations in the lab; ranging from the choice of a model species and behavioral apparatus to the design of an automatic shaping trajectory, the monitoring of task acquisition and the reduction of variability in behavioral outcomes. For clarity, we illustrate these principles with specific examples borrowed from the literature. We also highlight which of these principles are rooted in theoretical work and experimental investigations, in contrast with those reflecting heuristics. Our hope is that by providing these guidelines, we help democratize the wide adoption of instructed behaviors in neuroscientific investigations which is essential in our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cognition.",

At 23 months, children completed a two-alternative forced choice measure of vocabulary from which we coded decontextualized receptive vocabulary, and speed of lexical access operationalized as visual response latency and haptic response latency. At ages three and four, children completed a standardized receptive vocabulary assessment.\nData and Analysis: We examined the relation between 23-month predictors and outcomes using correlational and regression analyses.\nFindings/Conclusions: Decontextualized vocabulary at 23 months predicted vocabulary outcomes at ages three and four. Visual response latency predicted vocabulary at age three, but not age four. Haptic response latency predicted vocabulary at age four, but not age three. Neither vocabulary nor latency was significant when controlling for the effects of the other predictors.\nOriginality: This is the first study to investigate the relation between multiple direct measures of vocabulary and lexical access and language outcomes in bilingual children.\nSignificance/Implications: This study contributes to our understanding of toddler language measures and how demand characteristics interact with participant characteristics to influence the roles of these measures in predicting later outcomes. \nLimitations: Given the small sample size and limited outcome measures, results should be interpreted with some caution and used to guide future research on early predictors of long-term vocabulary development in bilingual children.",

          "abstract": "Objective: We examined changes in SU expectancies following PTEs in a community-based cohort of early adolescents for three common substances used by teens (alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine) how those changes affected SU itself. \nMethods: We leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,868, 48% female, 52% White), containing annual assessments of PTEs, SU expectancies, and SU itself from ages 10 to 14 years old. Using multilevel models to estimate between- and within-person effects, we tested whether PTEs predict negative and positive expectancies for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine concurrently and prospectively and whether those expectancies forecast subsequent use. \nResults: At the between-person level, PTEs were associated with increased negative and positive SU expectancies and subsequently associated with greater use itself directly and indirectly via positive expectancies concurrently and prospectively. At the within-person level, PTEs were associated with increased negative and positive SU expectancies concurrently but not prospectively. PTEs were associated with increases in SU directly and indirectly via positive expectancies, and decreases in cannabis and nicotine use only via negative expectancies. But prospectively, PTEs were only associated with greater SU directly and not indirectly via positive or negative expectancies. \nConclusions: Closer in time to each other, PTEs heighten the saliency of both positive and negative expectancies; however, over time, the effect of PTEs on expectancies seems to diminish. Current findings highlight a temporal window for optimal intervention to prevent SU by challenging beliefs that substances are helpful following PTEs and leveraging negative beliefs about SU following PTEs.",

          "abstract": "The high capacity of human iconic memory (IM) has been taken as evidence that visual experience is rich and detailed, as introspection suggests. Opponents to this view argue instead that this impression is illusory, with conscious access being mostly limited to what we can attend to. To provide evidence of either view, in this registered report we compared metacognitive sensitivity levels between IM and working memory (WM) representations. The rationale was that, if pre-attentive IM information is as consciously accessible as attention-bounded WM information, metacognitive sensitivity should be comparable across the two memory systems. Replicating classic findings, our results showed that IM capacity exceeded WM capacity. Nevertheless, and despite matched performance, metacognitive sensitivity was higher in WM. We further examined whether reduced metacognition in IM could be explained by inflation—the tendency to overestimate perceptual richness—by comparing confidence levels across the two memory conditions. Pre-registered analyses showed no evidence of inflation, as IM was associated with lower confidence. Our findings suggest that IM supports identification with less consciously accessible information than WM, challenging rich-view interpretations of conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Measuring Formal Thought Disorder (FTD), a common, cross-diagnosed symptom dimension across mental disorders, is plagued by numerous inconsistencies. Clinicians use either FTD-specific scales or items from generic scales. While these tools are based on extensive clinical observations, they suffer from inconsistent terminology. Different scales may use the same term for distinct concepts or different terms for the same concept. This lack of conceptual standardization prevents the identification of underlying FTD subconstructs. By using natural language processing, we compared the definitions, labeling and overlap of FTD symptoms across psychopathological scales.\nWe used a three-pronged validation approach to analyze semantic clusters of FTD scale items. First, we used sentence-BERT to divide 30 Thought and Language Disorder scale (TALD) items into positive or negative FTD clusters, validating this approach by checking for correspondence with published factor-analytic divisions (approach validation). Second, we created a sparse item-to-item similarity matrix from 103 items across seven scales to identify semantically converging cross-scale FTD items; a clinician-researcher described the resulting four clusters, and we compared our automated classification with that of six blinded experts to establish expert-machine semantic correspondence. Finally, we analyzed data from 98 participants (49 healthy controls and 49 schizophrenia/affective psychosis), identifying the highest-correlating Clinical Language Disorder Scale (CLANG) item for each Thought, Language and Communication (TLC) scale item and mapping these to our BERT-derived clusters to establish data-level correspondence.\nWhen assigning TALD items to BERT-derived positive or negative FTD groupings, we observed a 73% match with prior factor analyses. The BERT-informed clustering of cross-scale items highlighted four coherent FTD groupings; 1) muddled communication &amp; incomprehension. 2) abrupt topic shifts. 3) inconsistent narrative structure, 4) restricted speech. Expert raters showed moderate-to-high overlap (Fleiss’ kappa = .617) with computational clusters. A binomial test indicated that at the level of individual participants, correlations among CLANG-TLC item pairs were significantly more likely than chance to fall into the expected semantic cluster (p &lt; .001). \nOur results indicates that FTD rating scales measure overlapping, semantically related constructs that drive item-level correlations. Semantic clustering acts as a novel method to harmonize multi-scale data and pinpoint discrepancies between expert and machine classifications. Computational linguistics has the potential to improve consistency across rating scales especially when measuring complex constructs such as FTD.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive decision-making requires balancing exploitation of known rewarding options with exploration of uncertain alternatives, a dilemma also known as the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. While this framework has been widely studied in reinforcement learning research, its relevance to coping, defined as the cognitive and behavioral strategies that individuals use to manage stress and uncertainty, remains underexplored. Maladaptive coping may reflect rigidity in exploitation or ineffective exploration, whereas adaptive coping may involve flexible adjustment of control in changing environments. In this study, we examined whether interindividual differences in the transition dynamics between explore and exploit strategy predict coping styles in a large online general population sample. A total of 1732 participants completed a three-armed restless bandit task, and their latent explore-exploit strategy states and transition patterns were modeled using a Hidden Markov Model. These computational indices of explore-exploit dynamics were then linked to self-reported psychological coping strategies using regression and canonical correlation analysis. Individuals with a greater tendency to persist in exploitative states reported less reliance on avoidant and emotion-focused coping, whereas exploratory tendencies showed distinct associations with externally oriented coping strategies. Unsupervised clustering of exploration-exploitation dynamics further revealed four distinct decision-making subtypes, each associated with unique coping profiles. These findings provide the first evidence that computational markers of explore-exploit control dynamics relate to psychological coping profiles, offering mechanistic insight into psychological adaptation and resilience.",

In this critical review, we examine the most striking findings on facial perception of narcissism, with the aim  of analyzing the extent to which facial features can be considered valid cues for inferring narcissism. Our analysis suggests that, compared with other Dark Triad traits, narcissism is the most detectable trait. We address the possible psychological mechanisms underlying this association, as well as the role of methodological artifacts that could influence the obtained effects. We propose a dominance-based explanation for this association that could explain some of the existing controversies in the literature.

In the field of cybernetics, this was understood to be teleological, or purposeful improvement over time. Early cyberneticists proposed a means to classify behaviors in a way that distinguishes between random behaviors and more controlled behaviors. Therefore, we begin by providing a history of teleological phenomena, exploring its multitude of current forms.We then take our own perspective, revising the behavioral typology presented in Rosenbleuth et.al in several ways, exploring alternatives to their stated examples. In the process, the concept of cybernetic imperatives is introduced, which provides an alternative to goal-directed, purposeful behavior. Cybernetic imperatives describe behaviors observed in a wide range of processes and real-world dynamics, building up from random processes to refined and so-called purposeful behaviors. To conclude, we consider how cybernetic imperatives lead to behavioral and regulatory complexity.",

          "abstract": "Hearing our own voice is commonly assumed to be an unpleasant experience. In contrast, some studies of voice perception have reported that we actually find our own voice to be more attractive than other voices. It remains however unclear whether previously observed enhancements of self-voice attractiveness were mediated by the recognition of the self-voice during the task, because recognition was never explicitly and rigorously examined in previous studies. We therefore conducted a voice attractiveness rating task under conditions that limited the likelihood of self-voice recognition, in order to directly compare the perceived attractiveness of one’s own voice when recognised versus when not. We found that both participants who did (N=59) and did not (N=80) recognise their own voice rated their own voice differently from other voices. However, crucially, the direction of this difference depended on whether the self-voice was recognised during the task or not: listeners who spontaneously recognised their voice rated it as more attractive than other voices, whereas listeners who did not recognise their voice rated it as less attractive. The findings help to explain one source of contradictory perspectives in the voice perception literature and beyond. highlighting the intricate interplay between self-perception, first impressions, and identity perception.",

A total of 121 participants were tested up to three months later on putting waypoints of the route in the correct order and recalling directions at waypoints. Memory accuracy declined over time, consistent with classic memory theory. Route knowledge was retained more robustly than sequential order, highlighting the importance of contextual retrieval cues. Landmark presence, decision-point complexity, and route features modulated recall, demonstrating that both task and environmental characteristics influence spatial memory. A hierarchical Bayesian regression model quantified forgetting with median memory accuracy, capturing uncertainty across individual variability of participants and the environment in the experiment. Predicted accuracy decreased from approximately 91% initially to 77% after 12 weeks, and to approximately 72-75% after 6-12 months indicating that a substantial portion of spatial knowledge is retained over long intervals. By applying memory theory to analyse retention data, this study addresses a gap in the safety training field by providing a theory-driven approach to quantifying training effectiveness, enabling evidence-based design and assessment of safety and evacuation training in practice.",

More interestingly,\nparticipants exhibit a robust preference for low-effort risky choice pairs in a novel Demand\nAvoidance Task, which we modeled after well-characterized effort preference paradigms used in\nthe cognitive control domain. Finally, using pupillometry, we find that participants, contrary to\nour expectations, exhibit larger task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs)—a well-characterized\nmeasure of momentary effort exertion—when choosing between low-demand risky choice pairs,\nand that these TEPR magnitudes predicted demand-avoidant preferences in a subsequent test\nphase.

Children’s gender categorizations became more efficient with age, particularly when primed with race.

          "abstract": "Navigating changes is fundamental to everyday life and requires updating existing memories to incorporate new details. This study examined mechanisms underlying how reinstating an earlier event’s context during a later event influences memory for both events. Two theories predict opposite outcomes. Interference theory holds that reinstating context from an existing memory while experiencing a new, overlapping event produces response competition and impairs memory for both. In contrast, integration theory predicts that context reinstatement cues retrieval of earlier memories, enabling associative encoding of past and present events that enhances memory. Prior work favors the latter, showing that reinstatement improves memory. Three experiments extended this work by directly testing roles for study-phase retrievals and change awareness during study and test. Word pairs with shared cues but changed responses (A-B, A-D) were presented with background contexts that either repeated or changed. Repeating contexts increased detection of changes and recall of earlier responses during study, both indexes of study-phase retrievals, as well as later cued recall of earlier (B) and changed (D) responses. The recall benefit was proportional to the extent of study-phase retrievals, implicating retrieval practice. Moreover, the effect was enhanced when participants remembered that changes had occurred, highlighting the role of recollecting integrated representations that included change attributes. These findings align with integration theory, suggesting that memory updating is most effective when current events cue retrieval of prior memories and engender associative encoding of past and present events, establishing elaborate representations that support subsequent recall.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Adolescence is a developmental period during which many mental health problems emerge or worsen. Recently, there has been a shift towards identifying risk factors that predict psychopathology across a range of diagnostic boundaries – known as ‘transdiagnostic’ approaches (Astle et al., 2022). There are several social and emotional risk factors for specific mental health diagnoses that have been well-characterised. Yet, there is limited understanding about how these socio-affective risk factors map onto transdiagnostic symptoms. In this study, we identified profiles of socio-affective functioning in early adolescence and how these profiles predict transdiagnostic symptoms of mental health problems. \nMethods: Adolescents at heightened risk of general psychopathology aged 12-14 (N=559, Mage = 13.26, SDage = 0.72, 58.14% female) were recruited. Participants completed questionnaire and task-based measures assessing emotion functioning (emotion perception, emotion regulation, and interoception), social relationships (with peers and family members), and mental health. Using a simple artificial neural network that projects a high-dimensional input to a 2D topology we were able to map differences in questionnaire- and task-based socio-affective profiles. Clustering was then used to identify zones within that 2D topology, indicating relatively homogenous profiles. Associations between these zones and transdiagnostic mental health symptoms were examined.  \nFindings: We identified three reliable clusters of socio-affective functioning from the questionnaire measures and four clusters from the task-based measures. There were significant differences between questionnaire clusters on general psychopathology and internalising symptoms, whereas there were only significant differences between task clusters on general psychopathology. \nConclusion: This study demonstrated the potential of data-driven methods to derive profiles of socio-affective functioning that are associated with transdiagnostic mental health problems. Through identifying socio-affective mechanisms that characterise these clusters, these findings can be used to identify active ingredients for future intervention development to prevent the onset and worsening of mental health problems in adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

Identifying such responses is a time-consuming yet necessary process to ensure robust results but also remains challenging to automate. We explore the efficacy of transformer language models (TLMs) for automatically detecting invalid creativity responses, using only the text prompt and response and no other metadata about the experimental session. We train a suite of transformers to detect invalid data for two creativity assessments: the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a design problems task (DPT). We find that transformers generally outperform other baselines for both tasks. Further, we show that TLMs’ predictions are well calibrated to the quality of the participant response, ensuring that model failures will occur in a predictable way and that high-quality responses are unlikely to be labeled invalid. Finally, we conduct a fairness analysis based on language background—using an adversarial study where participants attempt to “break” the model by coming up with invalid responses that are nonetheless labeled valid. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods for cleaning creativity assessment data, using solely participant responses, in a reliable and unbiased way.",

          "abstract": "The search for human universals is firmly grounded in the study of infancy. Infants are viewed as unconditioned by social experience and therefore a source of insight into the initial state of psychological organization. This paper outlines three constraints on this approach focusing on limited sample diversity, insufficient predictive and convergent validation of methods, and overreliance on single exposures or unreplicated findings. It argues for a shift from an emphasis on universality towards a focus on variation. Large-scale multi-site collaborations, longitudinal designs, and cross-method convergence across culturally diverse settings as key components of this goal. These approaches can advance a more ecologically valid and culturally situated science of infancy.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into daily life, not only as tools but also as social partners that people may turn to for interaction and support. This raises important questions about whether, how, and why individuals form attachment-like bonds with AI, and what psychological implications such attachments may carry. Across five studies involving 1259 participants from Singapore and the US, the current work developed and validated the AI Attachment Scale and investigated the dispositional and motivational factors that predict attachment to AI, as well as its emotional and social outcomes. The AI Attachment Scale displayed strong psychometrics properties, including a reliable three-factor structure comprising of emotional closeness, social substitution, and normative regard subscales, strong convergent validity and discriminant validity, and high test–retest reliability. Examination of correlates revealed that time spent on AI, particularly for socioemotional purposes, was a strong predictor of AI attachment. Individuals higher in social anxiety, loneliness, and anxious attachment were also more likely to turn to AI as a compensatory surrogate when human connections were lacking. These tendencies were further linked to dispositional needs that AI fulfils, including closure through predictability, relatedness through socioemotional presence, and competence through affirming feedback. At the same time, stronger AI attachment is associated with heightened positive affect and life satisfaction, suggesting that AI attachment may satisfy the psychological needs and provide meaningful emotional benefits. These findings provide the first validated measure of attachment to AI and offer a foundation for future research on its psychological and societal implications.",

          "abstract": "Skilled behaviour in real-world contexts often relies on a combination of both declarative\nand procedural learning.

Previous findings have shown that procedural and declarative\nlearning may interact or compete at the systems level during encoding, consolidation, and\nretrieval, but beyond this, it is not known whether declarative and procedural representations\nthemselves interact. The goal of the current study is to investigate whether procedural and\ndeclarative knowledge can contribute simultaneously to categorization response selection\nbehavior. We designed a stimulus set in which information learned by each system sometimes\nsupports different responses, and created trials in the test phase that are designed to maximize\nsuch divergence. Participants were instructed to use a completely diagnostic, verbalizable, shape-\nbased rule to categorize exemplars, receiving feedback after each trial. However, unbeknownst to\nparticipants, the categories also differed probabilistically in their color distributions. Participants\nused both color (learned procedurally) and shape (learned declaratively) to categorize exemplars,\nresponding more quickly when both sources indicated the same category judgement, and more\nslowly when they conflicted. Debriefing confirmed that most participants were unaware of the\ncolor distributions. These results show simultaneous trial-level contributions from both\ndeclarative and procedural memory systems.

          "abstract": "Background\nSocial defeat is often cited as a motive for suicide. The experience of defeat may arise from feeling dominated in a dyadic conflict or from losing status in a group. We hypothesize that sensitivity to dyadic defeat will be related to the onset of suicidal behavior in early or mid-life and sensitivity to loss of status, in late life.\n\nMethods\nThe study’s sample of 245 adults aged 50+ years (mean=63.2 years, SD=7.4) comprised 42 early-onset and 32 late-onset suicide attempters (aged &lt;50 vs ≥50 years at their first suicide attempt), 114 depressed non-attempter comparisons, and 57 non-psychiatric comparisons. Using a validated rigged video game tournament task, we operationalized compensatory responses to the two forms of social defeat as point stealing from individual opponents (one-on-one defeat) and rank buying in the league table (loss of status in a group).\n\nResults\nEarly-onset attempters increased point stealing the most over time (χ23=22.37, p&lt;.001), whereas late-onset attempters purchased more rank after losing trials than early-onset attempters and non-psychiatric comparisons (χ23=9.47, p=.024). Each effect was robust to adjusting for age and sex, other effects of interest, and to the exclusion of stereotypic responders.\n\nConclusions\nOur behavioral findings suggest that socio-behavioral processes leading to suicide vary across the life cycle. While vulnerability to dyadic defeat could be suicidogenic for people of any age, loss of social status could play a role in suicidal crises specifically occurring in later life.",

It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week. However, nuances such as lower average scores when referencing the past week should be kept in mind when comparing results between studies using different reference time frames.",

          "abstract": "Working memory and inhibitory control are widely regarded as core executive function components. Traditional executive function tasks often fail to isolate these components, as they are rarely “process-pure”. This study measured working memory and inhibitory control (both response inhibition and interference control) concurrently within single paradigms, while reducing rule-learning confounds. Two novel tasks were developed: a modified flanker task (targeting interference control) and a spatial conflict task (targeting response inhibition). Each task consisted of multiple blocks of flanker or spatial trials, respectively. Working memory load was manipulated by preloading digit sequences before each block of inhibition trials (ascending = low load, random = high load), recalled after each block. The digit sequences changed for every block to maintain ongoing working memory engagement. Ninety-eight participants completed the spatial conflict task and ninety-seven completed the flanker task. Bayesian repeated measures ANOVAs revealed robust main effects of working memory and congruency on reaction times in both tasks, but provided evidence against over-additive interactions. Findings support the functional separability of working memory (as measured by declarative preload) and both types of inhibitory control in adults and highlight the utility of combined paradigms for more efficient assessment of executive function components with reduced task-related variance.",

The Climate Fresk, a collaborative and gamified workshop based on IPCC reports, has reached millions worldwide, but rigorous evidence on its effectiveness remains limited.\nObjective: This study protocol describes the first randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of The Climate Fresk on climate-related attitudes and pro-environmental behavioral intentions among workers. Secondary objectives are to examine potential moderating factors, such as socio-demographic characteristics, ecological identity, emotions, facilitator expertise and organisation status,  to qualitatively explore participants’ perceptions, motivations, and barriers.\nMethods: We will conduct a parallel, mixed-method RCT including 1,354 participants recruited from French organizations. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to either the experimental arm (The Climate Fresk, a three-hour interactive workshop) or the control arm (a one-hour lecture-style video). Primary outcomes are climate-related attitudes and pro-environmental behavioral intentions, assessed at baseline (T0) and one week post-intervention (T2). Secondary outcomes include ecological identity, emotions, and prior behaviors. Semi-structured interviews with a subsample of participants (n=20) will be conducted one month later (T3). Quantitative data will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, accounting for clustering by facilitator and organization. Qualitative data will undergo thematic analysis.\nDiscussion: This trial will provide the first large-scale, controlled evidence on the effectiveness of The Climate Fresk in shaping attitudes and intentions toward climate action. By integrating quantitative and qualitative insights, and considering moderating factors, it aims to advance understanding of gamified climate education and inform strategies to engage diverse populations in sustainability transitions.",

Participants used best-worst ratings to indicate how useful it is to know each word/expression. Our findings show a high level of agreement regarding the usefulness of words and expressions. Stimuli were rated as more useful if they were more frequent, widely known, learned early in life and central to the semantic network. Concreteness had a substantial negative correlation, indicating that abstract words in general received higher utility scores than concrete words. Positive stimuli received slightly lower utility scores than negative stimuli. Expected utility was a good predictor of which words are known to speakers of English as a first and second language, but did not contribute to predicting response times to known words.  These findings suggest that expected utility is a variable affecting which words are likely to be learned, but does not affect word processing times (much).

Study 1 (N = 1,231) revealed that anger relates to motives to aggress both directly and indirectly, whereas disgust relates only to motives to aggress indirectly. Study 2 (N = 930) extended these findings by showing that people infer greater direct aggression from anger expressions and greater indirect aggression from disgust expressions.

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem. They are grounded in diverse lived experience and aligned with public health principles.",

Cumulative prospect theory (CPT), the most prominent model, describes monetary choices well but performs less well for nonmonetary, nonnumerical outcomes (e.g., medications with side effects). We suggest that affective processes, which are omitted in CPT, play a larger role in nonmonetary than in monetary choices, and propose two psychologically motivated modifications: (a) using affect ratings rather than monetary equivalents to represent the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes (affective valuation); and (b) allowing the probability weighting of an outcome to depend on the amount of affect triggered in a choice problem (affective probability weighting). In a model comparison involving four datasets (N=240), we show that the modifications improve model performance relative to standard CPT for the nonmonetary, but not for the monetary choices. A complementary eye-tracking study on nonmonetary choice (N=68) further supported the predictions of affective probability weighting: increasing risk aversion and decreasing attention to probabilities, as the affective value of the worst outcome in a choice problem increases. Our work integrates previous ideas on how affect modulates decision processes in naturalistic nonmonetary contexts and offers a refined framework for modeling such decisions.",

          "abstract": "People vary in their levels of anxiety vulnerability, and this could result from individual differences in underlying cognitive bias. Previous research has established that attentional bias to negative information about an upcoming stressor predicts the development of negative expectancies concerning this stressor, which in turn predict higher levels of anxiety vulnerability. The present study tested the hypothesis that negative attentional bias plays a causal role in this relationship. Participants (N = 71) were exposed to videos conveying negative and benign information concerning an upcoming stressor, in a task designed to induce either attentional bias towards or away from the negative information. This experimental manipulation was successful in creating two groups of participants who differed, as intended, in negative attentional bias. Consistent with the causal hypothesis under test, this experimental manipulation of attentional bias also resulted in a corresponding group difference in anxiety vulnerability, as indicated by level of subsequent state anxiety assessed proximal to the stressor. Moreover, also as predicted by this hypothesis, mediation analysis confirmed that the causal impact of the attentional bias manipulation on state anxiety was indirect, and was mediated by its direct causal impact on negative expectancy bias concerning the stressor. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that attentional bias to negative information concerning upcoming stressors serves causally to elevate level of state anxiety experienced proximal to such stressors, by driving the development of negative expectancies about them. We discuss the ways in which these results advance theoretical understanding and consider their potential applied implications",

Existing findings indicate partial overlap in vulnerability pathways, including relational trauma, attachment insecurity, and maladaptive emotion regulation, while also revealing distinct contextual expressions - embodied through control and restriction in anorexia nervosa, and enacted interpersonally through attachment ruptures and invalidating relational dynamics in borderline personality disorder. Drawing on these convergences, we propose a theoretical model in which shame-driven, self-reinforcing cycles may link emotional dysregulation with disturbances of the self. Within this framework, restrictive control in anorexia nervosa and impulsive self-destructive behavior in borderline personality disorder may represent parallel attempts to regulate unbearable affect and preserve a fragmented sense of identity. This integrative perspective emphasizes the shared psychopathological mechanisms that may contribute to both conditions, framing their overlap as reflecting partially convergent dynamics between affect regulation and identity disturbance. It highlights avenues for future longitudinal and therapeutic research aimed at testing and refining these conceptual links.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Zafar Iqbal",
          "abstract": "This article introduces Instinctual Refinement Therapy (IRT) , a structured transdiagnostic protocol that bridges the divide between psychodynamic therapy's etiological depth and cognitive-behavioral therapy's empirical rigor. Integrating psychodynamic therapy's etiological depth with cognitive-behavioral therapy's empirical rigor constitutes a fundamental challenge for psychotherapy science. IRT conceptualizes psychopathology as instinctual dysregulation—maladaptive calibration of evolutionarily conserved motivational systems (Security, Attachment, Agency, Orexis) through entrenched pathological priors. Adverse childhood experiences generate these pathological priors, which subsequently distort perception, emotion, and behavior via predictive coding processes. The IRT protocol systematically targets these computational mechanisms through sequential phases including Thematic Writing, Systematic Belief Challenging, and Belief Destabilization, deliberately inducing prediction error to collapse dysfunctional generative models and facilitate belief updating via memory reconsolidation. By integrating developmental etiology with structured methodology within a neuro-computational framework, IRT offers a unified, testable approach to transformational change while generating specific hypotheses for computational psychiatry research.",

          "authors": "Anatol Bragin",
          "abstract": "This publication represents a “N-of-1” study where experiments were designed and performed by the same person. The data were collected and analyzed, considering all the necessary statistical requirements. The goal of the study was to investigate electrographic correlates of two mental states: mind wandering (MW) and focused attention (FA). The transition from MW to FA was initiated by the click that occurred at three minutes of the MW session. The presented data showed that, on average, during FA, the power in the delta frequency band is lower than during the MW state; however, the analysis of sequential time windows revealed that these changes occur only during the first 8 seconds of the FA mental state. \nMicrostate analysis revealed changes in multiple microstate parameters, but only during the first two seconds of the focused attention state. An unexpected finding was an increase in Global Field Power (GFP) of microstates in the 10-8-second window preceding the switch from MW to the FA state. This prediction was detected in the MW state, but not in the FA state. The precision and accuracy of prediction during the MW state were twice as good as those of the prediction performed intentionally in the FA state. These data indicate that our brain is subconsciously observing the external environment and making predictions of upcoming events that occur at long, such as 3 minutes, intervals, such as three minutes. The presented results require further confirmation in other subjects and other experimental paradigms.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup conflicts lead to devastating consequences and the elucidation of the cause of conflicts has been one of the central and pressing issues. Previous studies found that social dominance orientation (SDO) is a strong predictor of individual differences in endorsing specific policies that can enhance intergroup conflict, such as increasing defense costs. While the relationship between SDO and some specific policies has been examined in Western contexts, there has been much less research in non-Western contexts. Moreover, previous studies revealed that the relationship varies between non-Western countries. We conducted a study (N = 560) to replicate the positive correlation between SDO and political attitudes related to conservatism in Mifune and Yokota (2018) who collected the data in 2012. Using Bayesian inferences, we showed that while SDO and some policy attitudes have changed between samples over the last ten years, the correlation between them remained mostly unchanged even after controlling for conservatism. We discuss the consistency of the relationship between SDO and conservative political attitudes in the past ten years in Japan.",

          "abstract": "We see not only objects and their features (e.g., glass vases or wooden tables) but also relations between them (e.g., a vase on a table). An emerging view accounts for such relational representations by positing that visual perception is compositional: Much like language, where words combine to form phrases and sentences, many visual representations contain discrete constituents that combine systematically. This perspective raises a fundamental question: What principles guide the composition of relational representations, and how are they built over time? Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mind constructs relational representations in a canonical order. Inspired by a distinction from cognitive linguistics, we predicted that 'reference' objects (typically large, stable, and able to physically control other objects; e.g., tables) take precedence over 'figure' objects (e.g., vases) during scene composition. In Experiment 1, participants who arranged items to match linguistic descriptions (e.g., \"The vase is on the table\", \"The table is supporting the vase\") consistently placed reference objects first (e.g., table, then vase). Experiments 2–5 extended these findings to visual recognition itself: participants were faster to verify scene descriptions when reference objects appeared before figure objects in a scene, rather than vice versa. This Reference-first advantage emerged rapidly (within 100 ms), persisted in a purely visual task, and reflected abstract principles (e.g., physical forces) beyond simple differences in size or shape. Our findings reveal psychophysical principles underlying compositionality in visual processing: the mind builds representations of object relations sequentially, guided by the objects' roles in those relations.",

Building on this idea, the present work examines whether people laugh more when they perceive similarity with their social partner, or instead, feel more similar when they laugh. Participants (N = 132) had semi-structured conversations with both a friend and a stranger, discussing ways they were similar to and different from one another. Although conversation topic did not affect overall laughter, friends laughed even more than strangers when discussing their differences. Baseline perceived similarity in identity, behavior, and beliefs predicted how much dyads laughed and colaughed; however, laughter did not predict post-conversation perceived similarity. Participants laughed more if they felt similar to their partner or if their partner felt similar to them. To test whether laughter reflects shared understanding, we used overall laughter to predict both subjective experiences and verbal expressions of shared reality (e.g., saying “I agree”). Laughter predicted verbal expressions of shared reality, but not self-reported experience. Further, laughter and verbal agreement appeared to serve overlapping conversational functions: when laughter occurred, shared reality verbal expressions became less likely in the next two seconds. A subset analysis of friend dyads showed that only perceived similarity—not actual similarity—predicted laughter. In sum, conversational laughter seems to reflect, but not generate, the sense of similarity and shared understanding that underlies social connection.",

While LLMs can produce creative content that might be as good as or even better than human-created content, their widespread use risks reducing creative diversity across groups of people. In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.",

          "abstract": "Incivility is largely denounced; yet, our focus on its ills has inhibited our ability to determine when incivility could garner rewards. We propose that retaliatory incivility – i.e., incivility in response to someone else’s incivility — is seen as more virtuous than instigatory incivility, and consequently generates more social rewards for actors. To test these hypotheses, we used observational data from Reddit (2,252,607 comments) to compare how many social rewards users were granted when they responded uncivilly to civil or uncivil posts from other users. We then experimentally confirm our hypotheses in a sample of Reddit users, as well as five samples of participants from different contexts of group incivility; hockey fans, baseball fans, employees, workplace teams. Together, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: retaliatory incivility can be a surprising path to social rewards. Thus, as incivility rises internationally, our findings have far-reaching theoretical and practical implications.",

This study explores the (1) prevalence, (2) quality of in-person and online-only friendships, and (3) age and gender differences in these characteristics among Latin American youth. In Study 1, 5159 students between 10–17 years of age from Peru reported on the prevalence and perceived positive qualities of online-only and in-person friendships. In Study 2, 3154 students from Bolivia and Uruguay reported on the prevalence and positive and negative qualities of their in-person and online-only friendship(s). We analyzed cross-sectional trends in friendship quality (Studies 1 and 2) and, for a subset of youth with available data in Study 2 (N = 506), changes in the prevalence and quality of friendships between two data waves. More than one-third of participants reported having an online-only friend and, on average, declared twice as many in-person friends. Best in-person friendships involved both greater closeness but also greater discord than best online-only friendships. There were no differences in exclusion. Boys reported greater intensity of overall discord towards their best in-person friends and online-only friends compared to girls. In contrast, girls reported stronger closeness towards their best in-person friends than boys. Older adolescents reported stronger closeness towards their best online-only friends than younger adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents rely on in-person friends for positive friendship support to a greater extent than online-only friends. However, despite overwhelming emphasis on the psychological drawbacks of online friendships, our findings suggest these friendships may also be associated with less negative qualities and do not necessarily discourage formation of in-person friendships.",

To answer this, we compared behavioural performance on a speech-in-noise recognition test with the intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) of the auditory-language system. We found that the speech recognition ability was not correlated with the INT of the entire auditory-language network but was enhanced when the INT of the frontotemporal sub-system in the auditory-language network was close to that of the inferior colliculus, an auditory midbrain region. Moreover, this cortico-subcortical INT similarity was associated with the task-related neural activity in the frontotemporal sub-system. These findings indicate that the better cortico-subcortical INT alignment facilitates the activation of the auditory-language cortical system, resulting in accurate speech processing.",

This study examined whether smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys capturing stress and social context could enhance the identification of youth at risk for STB. Adolescents ages 13-18-years-old (N=207, 166 female sex) reporting depressive, anxiety, and/or substance use disorders were recruited from psychiatric outpatient programs, emergency departments, medical research registries, and social media. Participants with STB history were oversampled; 66% reported current suicidal ideation and 27% had a past-year attempt. Assessments of suicidal events (attempts, emergency department visits, hospitalizations for suicide concerns) were completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments. EMA probed momentary stress severity, affect, and recent social context (time spent with peers, family, or alone) 4-7x/day. Compared to psychiatric controls (N=64), adolescents with STB history (N=143) were more likely to report spending time alone (aOR=1.75, 95% CI=[1.15, 2.39]), less time with family (aOR=0.59, 95% CI=[0.31, 0.91]), and higher stress (d=0.28). Further, EMA of stress (aOR=1.86, 95% CI=[1.11, 3.26]) and negative affect (aOR=2.32, 95% CI=[1.34, 4.36]) were prospectively associated with suicidal events above and beyond prior STB history. Broadly, results were similar between EMA measures of stress and negative affect, indicating such responses may reflect shared underlying processes. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating dynamic family and peer contact among adolescents at risk for STB and highlight EMA as a potential tool for assessing interpersonal exposures related to STB risk.",

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn because they employ the base-10 system as whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, leading to worse performance when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs, like 0.8 vs. 0.26, than Consistent pairs like 0.86 vs. 0.2. Students may be applying the whole number rule: “more digits = larger number” or they could be ignoring the decimal points and comparing 8 vs. 26. This study used neuroimaging and our specially designed stimulus set to distinguish between these possibilities. We focused on the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), implicated in numerical magnitude processing, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, implicated in inhibitory control. We found no neural differences between Consistent and Inconsistent comparisons, suggesting that the number of digits does not drive brain responses in skilled adults (n=21). Instead, for Consistent comparisons, we found that the IPS was sensitive to the actual distance between the decimals, while the ACC showed this pattern for Inconsistent comparisons. Crucially, we also examined the effect of the distance between the decimal pairs when ignoring the decimal point. Here, we found sensitivity to this distance among Inconsistent comparisons in the IPS and insula, suggesting that whole number referents are automatically processed during decimal comparison and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. More broadly, our results underscore the unique challenges of decimal notation, revealing the need for educational practices that emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than highlighting similarities.",

We examine how different interventions motivate individuals with bipolar disorder to share financial data with others. This approach can inform the development of tools for digital monitoring and intervention designed to promote financial stability in this population.\n\nMethods: 500 individuals with BD completed a pre-registered factorial vignette survey to examine level of comfort with hypothetical scenarios involving third-party financial interventions during symptomatic and euthymic periods. Scenario components were systematically varied between third-party actors, mood states, and intervention types. Participants rated sharing comfort on a 0-10 point scale. Multilevel models tested differences alongside clinical and financial histories, relational trust, and personality.\n\nResults: Participants were most comfortable involving care partners in financial planning. They were more comfortable with temporary spending restrictions during symptomatic states than euthymic periods, underscoring the importance of accurate mood detection for intervention delivery. Prior financial help-seeking behavior and higher relational trust predicted greater comfort. Bankruptcy experience — declared by 11.4% and considered by 31.7% — was associated with increased comfort with spending restrictions. Individuals with psychiatric advance directives (8%) were significantly more comfortable sharing spending behaviors than those without. \n\nConclusions: Comfort with financial interventions was higher among those with prior financial challenges or help-seeking histories. Participants distinguished between symptomatic and euthymic periods, favoring targeted, time-limited restrictions over general monitoring.

          "abstract": "Background\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed nootropic worldwide and is frequently used to temporarily enhance cognitive performance. However, caffeine-induced effects on physiological arousal are also associated with side effects, which can exacerbate psychological stress symptoms in social performance situations. The amino acid L-theanine has shown potential to modulate these adverse effects of caffeine by reducing caffeine-augmented stress responses without impairing its desired cognitive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous modulatory effects of L-theanine on caffeine-enhanced stress in acute social stress situations.\n\nMethod\n\nA total of 46 healthy participants (83% female, aged 18–30 years) were examined for differences in stress reactivity during a standardized psychological stress test (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups, TSST-G). The study compared the effects of a single dose of caffeine alone versus a combination of caffeine and L-theanine. Specific stress constituents including subjective stress, anxiety, physical discomfort, desire to leave the situation, tension, and perceived control were assessed. Furthermore, group effects, trait anxiety, caffeine consumption, and temporal changes in reported stress were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with covariates.\nResults\nThe combination of caffeine and L-theanine resulted in a spontaneous attenuation of tension in social stress situations compared to caffeine alone. \n\nConclusions\n\nResults suggest that L-theanine attenuates certain stress effects of caffeine in acute social stress situations. This highlights the potential of the L-theanine and caffeine combination as a dual nootropic agent, offering both stress-reducing effects and the practicality of a substance suitable for cognitive performance enhancement. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects by incorporating physiological markers such as cortisol and cognitive performance tests.",

          "abstract": "Understanding when and why social interaction improves human judgment is a central question in the behavioural sciences. We examine whether accuracy increases when groups break problems into parts and generate approximate solutions, a process we call Collective Fermi Estimation. We tested this idea across three studies by analysing over 1,000 online group deliberations in text chatrooms. Study 1 (N=500) shows that greater use of problem decomposition in group discussions predicts lower error. Study 2 (N=240) provides causal evidence: instructing groups to apply problem decomposition leads to higher accuracy than combining initial estimates. Study 3 (N=160) shows the advantage arises when applied collectively rather than by individuals working alone. We also introduce a scalable natural language method to detect problem decomposition in deliberation text and predict collective accuracy. These findings identify problem decomposition as a key mechanism behind the wisdom of deliberative crowds and provide tools to detect and promote it.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between everyday cognitive strategy use and subjective cognition is unclear, but may be driven by an active, compensatory process in response to experiencing cognitive difficulties. However, the available evidence tends to focus on specific age groups, and on relationships with general cognition or memory performance only. We uniquely investigated the influence of age, cognitive strategy use, and their potential interaction, on the everyday cognitive difficulties of 606 United Kingdom-based adults aged 18-86. Participants completed self-report measures of everyday cognitive difficulties across specific domains (attention, visual-perceptual ability, verbal and visual-spatial memory, and language) and strategy use, both memory-specific and generalized (e.g. setting an alarm to help remember something or breaking down complex tasks). Age was negatively associated with frequency of strategy use, such that younger adults reported greater strategy use. Moderated regression models, with strategy use as a predictor of cognitive difficulty and age as the moderator, revealed that more frequent use of memory-specific cognitive strategies, rather than generalized strategy use, was the most robust, unique predictor of greater difficulties across the majority of cognitive domains. Importantly, there was no interaction between age and cognitive strategy use for any cognitive domain, highlighting that cognitive strategy use is pervasive across the adult lifespan, and is related to a range of subjective cognitive difficulties. The findings underscore the significant, apparently compensatory relationship between strategy use and subjective cognition. They also reveal scope for older adults to incorporate more frequent use of cognitive strategies in everyday life.",

A comprehensive search of English and French publications was conducted up to July 11, 2023, across PUBMED, Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. Of 5,910 unique references, 32 articles met the final inclusion criteria: 16 on media literacy and 16 on science literacy. Fifteen media literacy tools were identified, focusing on traditional and digital media. Most used Likert-scale items, with some incorporating open-ended responses. These tools assessed skills such as critical thinking, digital proficiency, and awareness of the socio-political context of media content. Twelve tools assessed science literacy, covering general knowledge, environmental health, and specific scientific domains. They measured cognitive, behavioural, and attitudinal dimensions using various formats, including Likert scales, multiple-choice, and open-ended items.

          "authors": "Lara Pearson; Thomas Nuttall; Wim Pouw",
          "abstract": "In music performance contexts, vocalists tend to gesture with hand and upper body movements as they sing. But how does this gesturing relate to the sung phrases, and how do singers’ gesturing styles differ from each other? In this study, we present a quantitative analysis and visualization pipeline that characterizes the multidimensional co-structuring of body movements and vocalizations in vocal performers. We apply this to a dataset of performances within the Karnatak music tradition of South India, including audio and motion tracking data of 44 performances by three expert Karnatak vocalists, openly published with this report. Our results show that time-varying features of head and hand gestures tend to be more similar when the concurrent vocal time-varying features are also more similar. While for each performer we find clear co-structuring of sound and movement, they each show their own characteristic salient dimensions (e.g., hand position, head acceleration) on which movement co-structures with singing. Our time-series analyses thereby provide a computational approach to characterizing individual vocalists’ unique multimodal vocal-gesture co-structuring profiles. We also show that co-structuring clearly reduces degrees of freedom of the multimodal performance such that motifs that sound alike tend to co-structure with gestures that move alike. The current method can be applied to any multimodally ensembled signals in both human and non-human communication, to determine co-structuring profiles and explore any reduction in degrees of freedom. In the context of Karnatak singing performance, the current analysis is an important starting point for further experimental study of gesture-vocal synergies.",

          "abstract": "We demonstrate how e-values simplify both experimental design and the inference process. With e-values researchers can perform anytime-valid tests and construct confidence intervals that maintain type I error control regardless of the sample size. This enables real-time monitoring of evidence as data are collected, permitting early termination of experiments without intolerably inflating the risk of false discoveries. Early stopping not only con- serves resources, but also mitigates risk for participants in clinical settings. Anytime-valid tests allow for optional continuation, that is, the extension of an experiment, for instance if more funds become available, or even if the evidence looks promising and the funding agency, a reviewer, or an editor urges the experimenter to collect more data. Analogously, a researcher can be assured that a 95% anytime-valid confidence interval will, with at least 95% probability, cover the true effect size regardless of how, or even if, data collection is stopped. We use the free and open-source software package safestats implemented in R to illustrate the practical benefits of this novel inference framework.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed nootropic worldwide and is frequently used to temporarily enhance cognitive performance. However, caffeine-induced effects on physiological arousal are also associated with side effects, which can exacerbate psychological stress symptoms in social performance situations. The amino acid L-theanine has shown potential to modulate these adverse effects of caffeine by reducing caffeine-augmented stress responses without impairing its desired cognitive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous modulatory effects of L-theanine on caffeine-enhanced stress in acute social stress situations.\n\nMethod\n\nA total of 46 healthy participants (83% female, aged 18–30 years) were examined for differences in stress reactivity during a standardized psychological stress test (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups, TSST-G). The study compared the effects of a single dose of caffeine alone versus a combination of caffeine and L-theanine. Specific stress constituents including subjective stress, anxiety, physical discomfort, desire to leave the situation, tension, and perceived control were assessed. Furthermore, group effects, trait anxiety, caffeine consumption, and temporal changes in reported stress were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with covariates.\nResults\nThe combination of caffeine and L-theanine resulted in a spontaneous attenuation of tension in social stress situations compared to caffeine alone. \n\nConclusions\n\nResults suggest that L-theanine attenuates certain stress effects of caffeine in acute social stress situations. This highlights the potential of the L-theanine and caffeine combination as a dual nootropic agent, offering both stress-reducing effects and the practicality of a substance suitable for cognitive performance enhancement. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects by incorporating physiological markers such as cortisol and cognitive performance tests.",

We examined the potential benefits of neuroticism (fear/frustration) across a wide range of outcomes between ages 11 to 19 (e.g., substance abuse, friend nominations) using two “mirrored” samples of Dutch adolescents followed between ages 11 to 19, one population (n=2229, 51%♀) and one clinic-referred (n=543, 34%♀) cohort. High neuroticism conveyed heightened risk but four key observations refine this picture: (1) higher fear also related to more social skills and prosocial behavior among adolescents in the clinic-referred sample; (2) fear generally related to fewer risks than frustration; (3) controlling for childhood adversity (e.g., low socioeconomic status, parental divorce) removed links between fear and most detrimental outcomes; (4) both fear and frustration were consistently associated with parent-rated social behavior problems, while other associations varied across these two scales and measurement points. Altogether, we provide initial evidence that, under certain conditions, neuroticism can also be beneficial in adolescence. Neuroticism benefits are most likely found among vulnerable individuals and in the social domain.",

          "authors": "Povilas Karvelis; Andreea Oliviana Diaconescu",
          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "abstract": "Background: Abnormal reward processing has been considered as a core feature of severe mental illness (SMI), such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Deficits in this domain can have severe implications in daily functioning, such as a decreased motivation to engage in social activities or make healthy lifestyle choices. The Online Positive Valence Study aimed to assess reward processing in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Positive Valence Systems (PVS) framework in an online task-based study. Recruitment and study adherence fell short of expectations.\nObjective: The current paper critically evaluates the used methodology and shares the lessons learned of conducting an online task-based study of reward processing in a severe mental illness sample.\nMethods: Participants were recruited mainly via email from two existing cohorts. The research team consisted of a part-time research assistant, a part-time postdoctoral researcher and the principal investigators. The study was built using several software packages and comprised a number of questionnaires and three reward tasks, the monetary incentive delay task (MID), effort expenditure of rewards task (EEfRT) and a social and coin version of the Bandit task. From 2023 onwards, the research team accepted that the initial recruitment goal would not be attained.\nResults: Participants who were additionally called were over four times more likely to respond “no” and more than twice as likely to respond “yes” versus no response compared to those who received only emails. Personal salutations in invitation mails reduced the likelihood of participation compared to nonpersonal salutations. Reward task performance was largely similar between the in-lab MRI and online groups, though online participants showed longer reaction times on the MID task and lower win-stay rates on both Bandit tasks.\nConclusion: It is advised to carefully consider recruiting from existing cohorts, hire full-time dedicated personnel and use personal approaches to recruitment, like phone calls, and adjust recruitment to the target population(s). Furthermore, participation should be technically as simple as possible, using for example browser-based presentation of tasks, after checking their consistency across the most common browsers. Attrition during the course of the study can be limited even more by shortening the duration of participation and/or adding gamification. \nKeywords: Positive Valence System; reward processing; bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; online study",

          "abstract": "Emotional memories enrich our lives by anchoring us to meaningful past events, but they can also become intrusive and distressing, particularly in psychiatric conditions. This chapter discusses retrieval stopping, a memory control process through which individuals actively stop or cancel the retrieval of unwanted memories when confronted with reminders. We synthesize findings from retrieval stopping studies focussing on how people suppress the retrieval of emotional memories and the resulting consequences for both memory and emotion. Our review reveals that retrieval stopping consistently impairs recall of emotional memories in healthy populations, though this capacity is compromised in clinical groups and under conditions that impair inhibitory control, such as acute stress and sleep deprivation. Neuroimaging evidence demonstrates that suppressing emotional memories engages a fronto-temporal inhibitory control pathway, with increased activation in right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex alongside decreased activity in hippocampus and amygdala. Retrieval stopping induces mixed after-effects on subjective reports of valence of the suppressed content, but more reliably reduces self-reported and physiological indicators of arousal. We propose a theoretical model suggesting that retrieval and affect stopping are co-engaged processes when dealing with unwanted emotional memories and thoughts, both relying on shared inhibitory control mechanisms to prevent neural reinstatement of the original trace. This integrated perspective emphasizes that regulating emotional memories requires interrupting the neural reinstatement of both their mnemonic and affective components. By framing inhibitory control as a central mechanism linking the regulation of memory and emotion, the model offers a unifying account for understanding how individuals manage unwanted memories and the emotional distress they evoke.",

These outcomes may differ between men/boys and women/girls with ADHD, but whether these differences are more pronounced in ADHD or similar to those in the general population remains unclear. Method. In an 18-year follow-up of 283 children it was assessed if sex moderated a variety of long-term outcomes across seven domains in those with ADHD, 50 women (Mage = 27.36) and 104 men (Mage = 29.40), and without ADHD, 77 women (Mage = 28.32) and 52 men (Mage = 27.94). Additional analyses explored the role of gender-expression. Results. Sex interacted with group for social functioning, where men with ADHD were more likely to show lower social functioning compared to women with ADHD and controls. There were no sex differences on the other outcomes. As sex and gender-expression were highly similar (r = .94), specific effects of gender-expression could not be studied. Conclusions. Generally, sex did not have a more pronounced effect on long-term outcomes of childhood ADHD in individuals with ADHD compared to the general population. Gender-expression could not be studied in our predominantly cis-gendered sample.",

          "abstract": "Faced with uncertainty in decision making, individuals often turn to their social networks to inform their decisions. In consequence, these networks become central to how new products and behaviors spread. A key structural feature of networks is the presence of long ties, which connect individuals who share few mutual contacts. Under what conditions do long ties facilitate or hinder diffusion? The literature provides conflicting results, largely due to differing assumptions about individual decision-making. We reinvestigate the role of long ties by experimentally measuring adoption decisions under social influence for products with uncertain payoffs and embedding these decisions in network simulations. At the individual level, we find that higher payoff uncertainty increases the average reliance on social influence. However, personal traits such as risk preferences and attitudes toward uncertainty lead to substantial heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence. At the collective level, the observed individual heterogeneity ensures that long ties consistently promote diffusion, but their positive effect weakens as uncertainty increases. Our results reveal that the effect of long ties is not determined by whether the aggregate process is a simple or complex contagion, but by the extent of heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence.",

Extending Bion’s notion of containment, the DCS comprises three interdependent layers: AI-based interactions that provide simulated empathy and co-regulation; social media publics that aggregate and validate affect; and algorithmic infrastructures that learn and normalize emotional patterns through feedback loops. Centering women’s experiences, the essay argues that these digital containers enable expressive repair and identity work while relocating emotional labour from interpersonal to technological systems. Declining marriage and fertility rates are thus read not as signs of moral decline, but as indications of a relational modernization lag, where emotional expectations outpace institutional adaptation. Intimacy, rather than disappearing, is being redistributed across human–machine–media assemblages.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how acceptance, rejection, and repetition of social feedback shape implicit physiological responses and subjective stress evaluations in a naturalistic, fictional setting. Thirty-nine student teachers performed dyadic “Yes, And” (acceptance) and “Yes, But” (rejection) theatre improvisation exercises while heart rate (HR), skin conductance responses (SCR), electrodermal activity (EDA), facial muscle activity (zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii), electroencephalographic activity (EEG alpha asymmetry), and self-reported stress were recorded. Across all improvised dialogue exercises, transient HR deceleration indicated a robust orienting response, while rejection elicited pre-stimulus slowing of HR, suggesting anticipatory threat processing. Zygomaticus major activity was higher in acceptance than rejection. Zygomaticus major activity, anticipatory HR, and self-reported stress decreased with repeated exercise.  Together, the findings of this psychophysiological investigation of the “Yes, And” principle of theatre improvisation demonstrated that fictional social interactions evoke psychophysiological responses, and that repeated exposure of improvisation exercises can partially attenuate them. These findings contribute to improvisation pedagogy and experimental paradigms in social neuroscience, and may also be applied to therapeutic applications by mapping how social encounters modulate embodied responses and self-reported stress in a fictional, psychologically safe context.",

The total sample was then split into training and test datasets. Structurally testing the previous models and a data driven model in the training dataset. The results yielded unacceptable fit indices for the MSTAT-II's previous models, so the 4-item data driven one was used on the test dataset.

          "abstract": "The human cone photoreceptor spectral sensitivities can differ between individuals. Large changes give rise to colour vision deficiencies, but even among colour-normals there is systematic individual variation. To limit the propagation of any systematic sampling bias in constructing the average spectral sensitivity functions used in research and industrial applications, it is useful to quantify the factors underlying this variation. The amino acid found at position 180 of OPN1LW, the gene responsible for encoding the L cone photopigment, is one source of individual variation in the L-cone spectral sensitivity. In this paper, group differences in the frequency of the L(S180) and L(A180) alleles are analysed from a combination of published reports and the genome sequencing database, gnomAD. We report evidence for significant group differences across ethnicity. Historical sampling bias in the data underlying the average L cone spectral sensitivity function therefore introduces ethnic bias in the applicability of these functions. We discuss the functional consequences of this variation by modelling failures of metamerism when this variability is not accounted for, the challenges of incorporating ethnicity variation in the existing L cone fundamental as adopted by the CIE Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage in 2006, and promising work on personalized cone fundamentals.",

          "abstract": "Physiognomy, the idea that a person’s character is reflected in their facial features, has a long history in scholarly thought. Although now widely regarded as pseudoscience in academic circles, recent work suggests that laypeople hold physiognomic beliefs and that belief endorsement is associated with support for facial profiling technology and other outcomes. Here, we investigate who believes in physiognomy in four studies (three preregistered). In a large, representative sample of the Dutch population, about 50% at least somewhat endorsed physiognomic beliefs (Study 1, n = 2,624). Belief prevalence was similar across different sociodemographic groups (i.e., gender, age, education, income). Across different measures of thinking styles and other lay beliefs, we found that physiognomic beliefs were most strongly related to how much people trust their intuitions—an association that emerged consistently with British (Study 2, n = 224), Nigerian (Study 3, n = 147), and Dutch participants (Study 4, n = 388). Participants who scored higher on faith in intuition were also more confident in the accuracy of their face-based trustworthiness impressions. In sum, the present studies suggest that lay beliefs in physiognomy are (a) common, (b) similarly endorsed across various socio-demographic groups, and (c) associated with an intuitive thinking style.",

          "abstract": "Person perception research predominantly focuses on faces as stimuli, and less attention is paid to full body, moving, stimulus people. Nor how our social perceptions might affect the way we observe unknown people. Here, we present two exploratory studies and a registered third. In Study One, 27 judges observed 12 videos of female targets walking and rated ‘threat’, ‘attractiveness’ and ‘masculinity’. In Study Two, 30 judges observed 22 male and female targets in the same format with the same ratings. The registered Study Three included 48 judges observing the same 22 stimuli. Judges had their attention to target faces recorded with an eyetracker. In all studies time spent observing the targets’ head decreased over time. In Study One ratings were associated with time spent observing the targets’ head and these effects changed with observation over time. In Study Two no effects were found. Study Three found weak effects opposing Study One. We find overall meta-evidence of masculinity and attractiveness affecting attention to the faces of unknown others, but the individual study findings were highly inconsistent. Our findings draw attention to the risks of interpreting from an individual study and reflect the benefit of internal registered replications.",

          "abstract": "We tested whether associations between household chaos, which refers to confusion and disorganisation in family homes, and educational achievement are confounded by genetics and family socioeconomic status (SES). We modelled the developmental interplay between chaos and achievement, including their reverse association (i.e., achievement chaos), and its aetiology in up to 7,591 twin pairs (49% female), who were born in the mid-90s in the UK and assessed at age 9, 12, and 16 years. Associations between household chaos and educational achievement were consistently negative, bidirectional, and of small effect sizes across ages. These associations were best explained by genetic and environmental confounding. Family SES accounted for most of the confounding in the predictions from achievement to chaos; for the reverse, environments shared within families but distinct from SES were implied. Our findings suggest that long-term associations between children’s experiences of household chaos and educational achievement are modest and non-causal.",

          "abstract": "We interact with our environment through our actions, sampling information from environmental effects following them. Here we asked how control over action and ensuing effects influences long-term memory for the effect content and the actions that produced them. In three experiments, participants carried out spatial actions, which produced the movement of a box wherein an image was presented. The box either moved spatially congruent or incongruent with the participants’ action. Memory for images was later tested in a recognition test and we additionally probed whether participants retrieved the action used to produce an image when being cued with said image. In a fourth experiment, we kept the spatial effect component constant to directly investigate bindings between action and effect features. We found evidence for a facilitating influence of congruency on declarative memory for effect content and on action retrieval by perceived effect content. Moreover, if effect content was enriched with a spatial feature, such retrieval was only observed if that feature was spatially congruent rather than incongruent to the action which had produced that content. Thus, features of single action-effect episodes can be integrated and represented in long-term memory and the formation of these representations is facilitated by control. We propose that feature bindings can be conceptualized as source memory, representing how environmental effects were produced.",

          "abstract": "The production of a word is delayed by the recent production of one or more semantically related words. This phenomenon, known as semantic interference, has been observed in picture naming tasks involving either large sets of pictures named once (continuous naming) or small sets of pictures named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that operates after each naming episode. However, the interference develops differently in these tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been suggested that the small local response sets in blocked naming are easily identified and stored in working memory, which then introduces an additional process that constrains the interference. We reasoned that this process would be less effective as the local response sets increased in size, resulting in cumulative interference. In blocked naming experiments involving local response sets of ten or nineteen items, we found that the interference did not increase continuously; rather, it carried on across more presentations than for the typically used small sets. This finding lends support to the notion of a control mechanism that operates gradually and interacts with an adaptive learning mechanism.",

Despite recent findings suggesting that defensive responses can generalize to safe but threat-relevant stimuli, it is unclear whether threat relevance can cause overgeneralization. To this end, we investigated two groups of participants who underwent a differential conditioning paradigm with either two angry (threat relevance, n = 38) or two neutral male faces (control, n = 39) as conditioned stimuli (CSs). One of the faces (CS+) was reinforced with a 90-dB scream (unconditioned stimulus, US) 80% of the time, while the other face (CS-) was never followed by the US. In the generalization test, the CSs were presented along with four generalized stimuli that lay on a continuum between CS+ and CS-. Successful acquisition was registered for all ratings and psychophysiological responses except ssVEPs. The differential skin conductance responses (SCRs) were larger in the threat relevance group compared to the control group. During the generalization test, adaptive generalized responses were observed for all measures, except for ssVEPs. Participants’ SCRs to all stimuli were on average larger in the threat relevance group. The shape of the generalization gradients did not differ between the groups suggesting that while threat relevance influences the intensity of autonomic arousal both in acquisition and in generalization, it does not lead to overgeneralization.",

          "abstract": "Environmental sensitivity, defined as the capacity to perceive and process information from both supportive and adverse environmental experiences, plays an important role in socio-emotional and behavioral development. However, existing research has predominantly focused on childhood, leaving a gap in our understanding of environmental sensitivity during adolescence. To bridge this gap, we conducted three studies using self-report data from 2,375 Japanese adolescents aged 10–14 years and their mothers. First, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of adolescent sensory processing sensitivity (referred to as trait sensitivity) by applying the 21-item Highly Sensitive Child scale to Japanese adolescents (Studies 1 and 2). Second, using three-wave longitudinal data, we examined how trait sensitivity interacts with various environmental contexts (i.e., negative/positive parenting and peer relationships) to predict adolescents’ socio-emotional and behavioral development (Study 3). Results showed that adolescent trait sensitivity was characterized by a general factor reflecting sensitivity to a broad range of negative and positive stimuli, as well as two specific domains: Ease of Excitation–Low Sensory Threshold and Aesthetic Sensitivity (i.e., bifactor model). Trait sensitivity was positively correlated with other temperament and personality traits, including negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition, neuroticism, and openness. Trait sensitivity and environmental factors independently predicted internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as prosocial behavior. Notably, trait sensitivity was a significant positive predictor of both internalizing problems and prosocial behavior. These findings suggest partial continuity in the structure and developmental functions of trait sensitivity from childhood to adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Minimal phenomenal experience (MPE) is characterized as a state of pure awareness stripped of conceptual content, and serves as a methodological tool for probing the mechanisms underlying consciousness. We propose a computational architecture in which a policy model that generates behavior is recursively coupled to a program model that synthesizes structured, executable explanations of that behavior. We ground our architecture in program synthesis: a computational approach that models human learning and reasoning as the process of inferring structured programs (executable code or symbolic rules) from examples or experience. These programs function as hypothetical self-models that can condition future behavior through a self-hypothesis distribution, making the agent’s current self-conception an endogenous cause within its generative model. The program model learns programs that balance three objectives: explanatory adequacy for observed behavior, alignment with the policy’s capabilities, and behavioral utility. This recursive coupling—where programs shape actions that generate data for refining programs—creates attractor dynamics that stabilize into a coherent identity and narrative self. We argue that MPE emerges when the system operates with minimal narrative elaboration: programs remain simple and interoceptively focused, the self-hypothesis distribution stays broad rather than collapsing to a dominant narrative, and the agent sustains awareness through recursive self-modeling without recruiting extended conceptual structures.",

          "abstract": "Parasocial relationships (PRs), one-sided imaginary relationships with media personae, have only recently been explored in the video gaming context, where they appear to influence players’ thoughts and behaviors. They are often assumed to arise from less connection and greater ostracism in day-to-day life, but this hypothesis has not been empirically tested. Further, no study has considered potential differences in interpersonal difficulties that players with PRs may have compared to those without PRs. The present study addresses these gaps using online data from 584 video gamers (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male) recruited from various Reddit gaming communities. Participants completed measures assessing interpersonal difficulties (e.g., vindictiveness, social avoidance, exploitableness, nonassertiveness), satisfaction and frustration needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as well as problematic video gaming (PVG), and video gaming motivations. Results did not support the loneliness and ostracized hypothesis in that players with and without PRs did not differ in connection to others or feeling rejected in their day-to-day life. However, compared to players without PRs, players with PRs report greater interpersonal difficulties. Thus, PRs do not appear to compensate for loneliness or rejection. Rather, it may be that individuals with PRs may experience interpersonal difficulties leading them to turn to PRs to fulfill social needs. Additional findings include players with PRs reporting greater hours of video gaming as well as more severe PVG and stronger fantasy gaming motives. These findings are discussed within the context of broader literature and avenues for further study are provided.",

          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "abstract": "Pre-Sapio-Abstraction (PSA) introduces a novel internalist framework that addresses the interdependent co-emergence of recursive cognition, memory expansion, and self-referential consciousness (RMC) through pre-expressive abstraction. Rather than attributing these capacities solely to exogenous pressures such as external coordination, social scaffolding, or communicative efficiency, PSA posits that a biologically grounded internal selective mechanism, symbolic-affective saturation (SAS), created a distinctive form of neuroevolutionary bottleneck pressure. SAS is defined as the endogenously generated accumulation of qualitatively complex and often dissonant mental representations that exceeded the capacity of early linear processing systems. This accumulation produced a pressured nascent state of pre-expressive abstraction, which, once sustained above capacity, favored the evolution of recursion as a stabilizing coherence-and-containment architecture. Under this selective condition, RMC capacities are framed not as independent byproducts of scale but as neurostructural adaptive responses that stabilized internally accumulated mental representations across time, affect, and identity. PSA thereby reframes abstraction as not merely an antecedent of higher cognition, but as a biologically grounded endogenous selection pressure produced by SAS that favored the interdependent emergence of RMC. In identifying SAS as an internal evolutionary mechanism, PSA does not reject metabolic, ecological, or social selective pressures. Rather, it positions itself as a complementary framework for a range of neuroevolutionary accounts of consciousness, helping explain why the architectures they describe became evolutionarily indispensable.",

          "abstract": "When studying latent outcomes in causal inference, causal effects can occur not only on the mean of the latent variable, but on all parts of the measurement model: the mean and residual variance of the latent variable, as well as the item parameters. This paper proposes causal parameter moderation, the application of moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) to causal inference with latent outcomes. The proposed MNLFA-based approach is presented in contrast to another method for handling item-level deviations from a main treatment effect, item-level heterogeneous treatment effect (IL-HTE) analysis. The models are best suited to handle different types of DIF, and thus the circumstances under which each is appropriate differ: IL-HTE models are highly confirmatory in the sense that they assume a distribution of DIF across all items, so the more exploratory MNLFA approach may make sense as a precursor or alternative to IL-HTE analysis, especially when there is reason to believe that a subset of items on the outcome might be particularly sensitive to the treatment. Because MNLFA can handle an arbitrary number of continuous or categorical covariates, it is also uniquely well-suited to handling heterogenous treatment effects; this is demonstrated in a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of a reading intervention’s effects on science vocabulary where there is substantial evidence of both a main effect on the latent variable and additional effects on a subset of items.",

          "abstract": "In light of prevalence studies revealing high rates of loneliness among young adults studying at university, the development of social connections amongst peers and others is regarded as a priority. This is particularly important for students from equity and historically marginalised groups, as they face unique challenges that impact their ability to form social connections and a sense of belonging within a higher education context. Digital interventions show promise for addressing social connection needs of university students, though evidence of effectiveness is mixed. This scoping review examined 40 studies exploring what is known about the use of online tools to address the social connection needs of university students. Interventions targeted various social connection needs, including belonging, social support and community engagement. Synchronous, facilitator-led interventions appeared more effective than self-paced ones, although about two-thirds of randomised controlled trials found no significant benefits, suggesting more rigorous methods yield fewer positive results. Qualitative data often showed benefits even when quantitative measures did not. The majority of studies were from Western countries, with only a quarter focusing on equity groups and limited interventions specifically designed for social connection. More research using robust methods is needed to evaluate digital social interventions, particularly for diverse student groups. Universities should consider factors like engagement, facilitator guidance, and opportunities for belonging when designing digital social connection tools. While digital interventions continue to be integrated into university support services, their effectiveness for improving student social connection remains inconclusive due to heterogeneous outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The ImproSynchrony project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

These information sources include contextual and social cues as well as cognitive mechanisms. Focusing on early word learning, this paper reviews information sources, how children might sensitively adapt to them, and how we can model their integration using Bayesian inference over multiple probability distributions.

          "abstract": "Background: This project evaluates the psychometric properties of a German translation of the Revised Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI-R). Previous measures of autistic traits are often based on a male-referenced conceptualisation of autism, which may underestimate autistic traits in other genders. Additionally, these measures tend to rely on neurotypical language, which can make it difficult for autistic people to respond and may reinforce stigma. To address these shortcomings, the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI) was originally developed as an alternative to traditional measures, including subscales that capture traits particularly relevant to autistic women. Building on this, we collaborated with members of the autism community to revise the CATI (CATI-R), ensuring more inclusive, respectful, and accessible language and concepts across all genders. In the present study, we translated this revised measure into German and validated it in a large sample of female, male, and non-binary participants. This study explores if the German translation of the CATI-R measures autistic traits fairly across genders and identifies potential differences in trait expression.  Methods: To validate the German CATI-R, we analysed data from a large sample (n = 1057), comprising German native speakers with a self-reported autism diagnosis (n = 29), people who self-identified as autistic (n = 84), and non-autistic participants (n = 944).  Results: We successfully validated a German translation of the CATI-R. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the six-subscale structure (Two-Factor Bifactor Model: Chi-squared = 2402.85, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .047, CFI = .99, TLI = .99). With Spearman’s rank correlations, we showed positive relationships between all subscales (all rs &gt; .37, ps &lt;.001). Moreover, we demonstrated convergent validity with significant correlations between the German versions of the CATI-R, AQ and BAPQ: the AQ (rho = .69, p &lt; .01) and BAPQ (rho = .77, p &lt; .01). Finally, a measurement invariance analysis indicated that total-scale scores can be compared across genders and across the English and German CATI-R.  Conclusions: This study replicates findings for the English CATI-R. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a measure of autistic traits in German that has been developed together with people from the community.",

          "abstract": "Though the physical health benefits of childhood nature exposure are well-documented, the specific mechanisms linking nature and healthy cognitive development remain underexplored. One promising tool for investigating novel biological pathways is via mobile neuroimaging techniques, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which can be collected in naturalistic settings. The current pilot study uses fNIRS, cognitive task data, and survey-based measures of well-being and environmental exposures in a sample of children attending a nature-based school at the start of the academic year, and tests the feasibility of collecting fNIRS-based metrics of healthy neurocognition in situ. Fifteen children between the ages of 8 and 13 participated in the fNIRS sessions, and activation in the prefrontal cortex was successfully demonstrated during a 1-back working memory task for older children, but not younger children, who struggled to do the task. Importantly, the study enabled the measurement of a novel brain-based biomarker of healthy cognition (the Hurst exponent, H). In line with prior research showing that H is associated with better psychological well-being, we found that higher H was indeed correlated with lower psychological stress and better performance on a cognitive flexibility task. Additionally, H was higher for those who engaged in more physical activity and with more neighborhood greenspace access, highlighting a potential novel mechanism linking nature exposure, exercise, and psychological well-being in childhood.",

          "abstract": "Why do some children learn to read or talk more easily than others? We review recent advances in genetics, neuroscience, cognition, and intervention research. About half of the variation in language and reading outcomes is explained by genetic differences. Yet genes and environments are intertwined — for example, children’s early language exposure is partly shaped by their parents’ genetically influenced traits. Neuroimaging studies show that language and reading disorders involve not only domain-specific brain regions but also subcortical systems supporting learning in general. In cognition, a move beyond identifying core deficits toward understanding how children actively learn offers new insights into diverse developmental pathways. We highlight how interventions not only draw from but also contribute to theory, by revealing the mechanisms that drive change. Throughout, we emphasise how longitudinal and intervention studies have helped us distinguish which neural and cognitive characteristics are stable traits versus those that are responsive to intervention. We advocate for developmentally sensitive, large-scale studies and open, interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers and practitioners to advance our understanding of reading and language disorders and improve children’s outcomes.",

          "authors": "Kate Stone; Henning Holle; Milena Rabovsky",
          "abstract": "Understanding why readers misinterpret role-reversed sentences like \"the waitress that the customer served\" (versus \"the customer that the waitress served\") is important in understanding how readers process who does what to whom in sentences. In such sentence pairs, we infer that readers experience temporary illusions of plausibility from the absence of the usual N400 effect between the plausible and implausible verb \"served\". A recent finding is that an N400 effect is observed if presentation of the verb is delayed. We first use ERPs to show that time alone rather than new information is sufficient to produce this delay effect. Our meta-analysis of published studies demonstrates a small but consistent effect of similar delays. Next, we distinguish between two accounts of the illusion addressing the delay effect: In one, the illusion results from conflict between syntactic and semantic cues (SG model; Rabovsky et al., 2018), in the other, from the slow application of thematic roles (e.g., Liao et al., 2022). Using speeded lexical decisions, we demonstrate an immediate influence of thematic roles on verb processing, favouring the SG model. The role reversal effect on lexical decision times but not the N400 further supports the SG model because the model predicts a dissociation between preactivation of specific words (reflected in lexical decisions) versus sentence meaning (reflected in the N400). Together, the findings suggest that the rapid pace of reading can give rise to temporary illusions by preventing readers from resolving cue conflict rather than by omitting processing steps.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Contemporary trauma therapies often target cognitive schemas and explicit memories, potentially neglecting the disruption of evolutionarily conserved instinctual systems by early adverse experiences. This study provides a preliminary evaluation of Instinctual Refinement Therapy (IRT), a novel protocol designed to directly address these instinctual disruptions.\nMethod: A retrospective case series analysis was conducted on 30 clinical cases (70% female; Mage = 32.4 years) with diverse, often treatment-resistant presentations (e.g., anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders). IRT integrates predictive processing and memory reconsolidation frameworks to recalibrate maladaptive instinctual pathways. Treatment response was assessed via pre-post clinical measures and rates of clinical improvement.\nResults: Preliminary analysis indicated a high rate of clinical improvement (94%; 28/30 cases), achieved over a mean of 54.2 sessions. Large pre-post effect sizes were observed across standardized measures, with a mean aggregate effect size of *d* = 2.1. Therapeutic gains were maintained at follow-up in 80% of assessed cases. The distribution of anxiety disorders, more prevalent in females (71%), aligned with epidemiological trends.\nConclusion and Implications: These preliminary findings suggest IRT is a feasible and potentially effective intervention for complex, treatment-resistant trauma presentations. The results warrant systematic investigation to establish its efficacy. This paper provides a detailed description of the IRT protocol, initial clinical data, and a essential research roadmap to guide future controlled trials and neurobiological investigations into its proposed mechanisms of action.\nKeywords: Instinctual Refinement Therapy, complex trauma, predictive processing, memory reconsolidation, case series, transdiagnostic, treatment development.",

In our descriptive analyses, we found that (a) thousands of new constructs and measures are published each year, (b) most measures are used very few times, and (c) there is no trend toward consensus or standardization in the use of constructs and measures; in fact, there is a trend toward even greater fragmentation over time.

          "abstract": "Is it usually possible to be virtuous in all ways, or do people experience ubiquitous tradeoffs among moral virtues? Past work has examined a limited set of virtue pairs (e.g., honesty vs. compassion, fairness vs. loyalty) and focused on situations where tradeoffs are likely to occur. Across two Day Reconstruction Method studies featuring representative U.S. samples, we describe the frequency and experience of tradeoffs among 12 virtues in everyday life. In Study 1, 377 participants reported virtue conflicts during 12,385 episodes across one week. In Study 2, 608 participants provided detailed information about one tradeoff episode. Tradeoffs most often involved honesty and courage, and qualitative codings showed that many (but not all) tradeoffs reflected a general tension between benevolence and integrity. Overall, however, prevalence estimates suggested that virtue enactments tend to be largely compatible in everyday life. People felt less happy when they experienced a virtue conflict or tradeoff, but it also mattered how they resolved them. People most often prioritized one virtue over the other (57%). Occasionally (12%), however, people were able to overcome the tradeoff by showing high levels of both virtues, and were most satisfied with their decision when they were able to do so. Finally, there was a general mismatch between people’s proclaimed virtue preferences and which virtues they actually prioritized when they experienced an everyday tradeoff. These findings highlight the importance of studying moral decision making in ecologically valid contexts and have implications for moral education.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the causes and effects of decision fatigue from the existing literature and develop a framework that can be applied across different domains. A comprehensive literature search in three databases identified 1027 articles on decision fatigue. After screening the articles using Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal methods, 23 articles investigating decision fatigue across various domains were selected. The selected articles were investigated through root cause analysis and thematic synthesis. Findings revealed eight causes of decision fatigue which were classified as individual, organizational, and external causes, and four primary effects and seven secondary effects of decision fatigue. Using these findings, a conceptual framework that offers a comprehensive understanding of decision fatigue across diverse domains was developed. This study contributes to the concept of decision fatigue within organizational settings to enhance organizational behavior, psychology and, offering implications for improving decision-making processes in diverse professional domains. The findings can help develop interventions to mitigate decision fatigue and improve overall decision-making.",

Across two independent cohorts at elevated suicide risk (Ns=208/211; &gt;6 million text entries), lifetime suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) and current suicidal ideation were associated with increased frequency of smartphone suicide-related language. Human coding indicated varied language, including authentic first-person current suicidal ideation (14.5%) and jokes or hyperbole (20.2%). Compared with the lexicon alone, human coding of suicide-related entries, especially first-person language, showed stronger associations with STB history, highlighting the need for approaches to distinguish intent.

          "abstract": "Approximately 40% of children worldwide learn to read in a language other than their home language or in two languages simultaneously. Evidence suggests that instruction in one language can enhance literacy outcomes in the other; however, the existence and longevity of these cross-language effects in poorer readers is unclear.  This study used a cross-over randomised controlled trial design. Initially, 129 children (mean age = 111.44 months, SD = 12.23) participated in a 15-week Welsh literacy intervention, while 128 children (mean age = 110.62 months, SD = 12.34) served as a wait-list control group and did not receive the intervention during this period. After the first intervention phase, the wait-list control group then participated in the same 15-week Welsh literacy intervention. Welsh and English reading efficiency were assessed at three time points: baseline (t1; prior to intervention), posttest (t2; immediately after the initial intervention phase for the first group), and follow-up (t3; approximately 3-months after t2). We found that training poorer bilingual readers using a language-rich literacy intervention in Welsh improved word decoding skills in both Welsh and English. These effects were sustained in the longer term for the trained language, Welsh, but were short-lived for the untrained language, English. Our findings suggest that targeted intervention in one language enhances cognitive processes underlying literacy in both languages, and that bilingual students struggling with reading skills can make short-term literacy gains from a monolingual intervention that transfer to a language where there has not been explicit training.",

Yet, naturalistic variation in coping skill development is poorly understood and it remains unclear whether: (1) gender-specific and parental support enrich coping skill development and (2) differences in naturalistic coping skill trajectories differentiate psychopathology outcomes thereafter. Using longitudinal data from a large, nationally-representative U.S. adolescent study (n = 831), the current study applied a longitudinal multilevel modeling approach to track growth in acceptance and cognitive restructuring coping skill use over 7 years spanning adolescence through young adulthood. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVAs and Dunn’s post-hoc tests were applied to estimate trajectory differences based on within-gender variation, between adolescent parental support, and psychosocial consequences in adulthood. Greater parental support acted as an enrichment factor for coping skill development over time, with trajectories further differentiated as by gender. Adolescent coping patterns differentiated psychosocial impairment in early adulthood, with evidence of gender-specific linkages between coping and impairment, particularly for women. Characterizing specific coping repertoires and the context in which they develop is likely support understanding of whether coping skill development contributes to psychopathology onset.",

While affective context is known to modulate tactile processing, it remains unclear how it influences tactile suppression. In a virtual reality (VR) environment, we investigated tactile sensitivity during movements to avoid threatening (spider) or approach non-threatening (rabbit) stimuli, involving arm flexion or extension, and during the limb at rest (baseline). Tactile sensitivity was measured using brief vibrations delivered through the VR controller. Detection thresholds were higher during movement than baseline, confirming tactile suppression. Both affective context and movement type modulated suppression: avoiding threatening stimuli and extending the arm, each increased suppression. A control experiment using neutral, geometric objects showed comparable effects of arm extension and flexion. These findings demonstrate that affective context shapes tactile suppression during movement.",

Measures included an 18-item INV scale, PSS-4, a multidimensional sleep-health index (SQ), and BRS-6. Analyses comprised descriptives, group tests, correlations, and PROCESS Model 59 with 5,000 bias-corrected bootstraps; sex, grade, and place of origin were covariates.\nResults: INV correlated positively with PSS and negatively with SQ; PSS correlated negatively with SQ; RE correlated positively with SQ and negatively with PSS. In PROCESS, INV→SQ (B=−1.028, p&lt;.001) and PSS→SQ (B=−2.555, p&lt;.001) were negative, and INV→PSS positive (B=.522, p&lt;.001). All three interactions supported buffering by RE: INV×RE→PSS (B=−.072, p=.021), PSS×RE→SQ (B=.452, p&lt;.001), INV×RE→SQ (B=.190, p=.033). The direct INV→SQ effect weakened from Low/Mean/High RE (B=−.584/−.394/−.204), becoming nonsignificant around +1 SD (Johnson–Neyman). The indirect effect INV→PSS→SQ also decreased with higher RE.\nConclusion: Academic involution relates to poorer sleep partly through elevated perceived stress. Resilience systematically attenuates these associations, indicating a modifiable protective target for campus health initiatives aimed at safeguarding students’ sleep.",

We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and\nphysiological data during these practices and quantified the signal’s dynamical properties using\nLempel–Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In\naddition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch\nnegativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhāna was associated with\npronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across\nmultiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites.\nSpectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic 1/f component and a frequency-specific reorganization\nof long-range temporal correlations.

We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhāna with minimal phenomenal\nexperiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness.\nAccordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the\nabsorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "abstract": "We present a fast, score-based test to detecting model misspecification in item response theory (IRT) models, that remains valid when person parameters are treated as fixed effects, as may be used for very large data sets. The new approximation (i) eliminates the need to pre-specify ability groups or priors for person abilities, (ii) does not require explicit functional form assumptions, (iii) works with two estimators designed for very high item / person counts -- constrained joint maximum likelihood (CJML) and joint maximum a posteriori (JMAP) -- and (iv) requires only a single model fit, making DIF-screening faster and simpler than alternatives based on model comparisons. A spline-based residualisation step further suppresses spurious Type I error when the ordering covariate is correlated with ability. Simulations with the two-parameter logistic model show nominal error rates and high power once examinees contribute 15–20 responses; only extremely short tests (10 items) still pose challenges under strong impact. An application to 1602 reading items and 57684 students from the Mindsteps platform demonstrates scalability and practical value, flagging 13% of items for gender-related DIF and correlating highly with conventional approaches of explicitly modelling DIF. Together, these results position the proposed test as a robust, computation-light diagnostic for large-scale assessments when classical random-effects approaches are infeasible, ability group structure is unknown or complex, or the shape of DIF effects is unknown or complex.",

          "abstract": "In light of the growing circulation of health-related content on social media platforms, a critical gap persists in media uses and effects research: While much of the existing work has focused on self-serving motivations for media selection, an expanding body of evidence suggests that individuals—including those with psychological vulnerabilities—may seek out online content in a self-defeating fashion. In other words, users might actively search for content that aggravates, rather than alleviates, distress. Drawing on self-verification theory and other scholarship on self-defeating tendencies, we argue that when negative self-concepts are salient, users may gravitate toward media messages that validate these self-views, even at the expense of their well-being. We propose a research agenda to systematically examine maladaptive media exposure patterns and their psychological effects. To guide this line of inquiry, we propose an extension of the established Selective Exposure Self- and Affect-Management model to better conceptualize the complex motivations driving contemporary media use.",

          "abstract": "Social connection and grit are critical socio-emotional skills associated with resilience and success among college students. Honors programs, which offer specialized academic and community-oriented experiences, may foster enhanced social connection and consequently greater grit as part of a high-achieving community. This study examined whether participation in a university honors program moderates the relationship between social connection and grit. College students (n = 421, 66% White, 64% female, 17% Honors) participated in a cross-sectional online survey conducted between March 2023 and May 2025. Moderation effects were tested using multiple regression with honors program participation as a moderator. Social connection was positively correlated with grit among the full sample (r = .315, p &lt; .001). Honors students exhibited a trend toward higher grit scores than non-honors students (p = .092, d = .27), while social connection scores did not significantly differ between groups (p = .753). Contrary to predictions, honors participation did not moderate the significant positive relationship between social connection and grit (interaction term β = .161, p = .468). These findings indicate that stronger social connection is a consistent predictor of higher grittiness among college students, irrespective of honors program participation. The absence of a moderating effect suggests that a university’s comprehensive support services may equally foster social connectedness and resilience across student groups, potentially matching the social, emotional, and motivational structures characteristic of an honors program. This study underscores the broader institutional value of cultivating supportive social environments to enhance students’ socio-emotional skills.",

          "abstract": "Background: There is surging interest in workplace mindfulness programs to address employee stress, resilience, and performance, however, significant gaps in knowledge remain around feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and predictors of therapeutic change. Objective: This study evaluated whether a brief, 4-session Mindfulness Skills Course (MSC) for university employees, covered by the institution’s wellness benefits, was effective in reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, improving feelings toward oneself and others, and increasing work performance. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study design. Participants completed self-report surveys before and after the MSC. Class attendance and home mindfulness practice were recorded to assess feasibility and adherence. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate program effectiveness and predictors of change. Results: 190 employees enrolled during the first year of roll-out. Of those, 164 (86%) completed pre-course surveys, 134 (82%) attended at least three class sessions, and 123 (75%) completed the post-course surveys and program evaluation. Paired samples t-tests showed improvements for perceived stress, mindfulness, and relational wellbeing with moderate to large effect sizes (d=.44 - .78; p’s&lt; .001). Self-perceived work performance increased with a small effect (d=.33; p&lt; .001). More frequent home meditation practice was positively correlated with a larger increase in mindfulness (r=.20; p&lt; .05). Increased mindfulness correlated with reduced stress (r=-.55), greater positive emotions towards self (r=.38) and reduced negative emotions towards self (r=-.40) and others (r=-.42) (all p’s&lt; .001). Reduced stress was correlated with increased perceived work performance (r=-.22; p&lt; .05). Higher baseline stress levels predicted greater increases in mindfulness (β= .37, R2= .14, p&lt;.001), while lower baseline mindfulness predicted greater reduction in stress (β= .27, R2= .07, p&lt;.01). Conclusion: Taken together, these results support the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief, 4-wk, employer-sponsored mindfulness skills course, which may be most helpful for individuals with higher stress and lower trait mindfulness.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Trait mindfulness influences perceived stress and sleep; however, it is unclear if this relationship is consistent across gender and race. Methods: College students at a public research university (n = 534, 65% female, 33% nonwhite) completed a cross-sectional online survey measuring three core qualities of mindfulness (trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering), sleep-related impairment, and perceived stress. Multiple group structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test whether the impact of trait mindfulness on perceived stress and sleep-related impairment was moderated by gender or race. Results: Across gender (cisgender male, cisgender female) and race (white, people of color), there were significant indirect effects of higher trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering on less sleep-related impairment via lower perceived stress (all p’s&lt;.001). However, there was no evidence of moderation. The multiple group models explained 26%-39% of the variance in perceived stress (R2 = .26 to .39) and 25%-40% of the variance in sleep-related impairment (R2 = .25 to .40); large magnitude effects.  Conclusions: The mediating effect of three core mindfulness qualities on sleep impairment and daytime functioning through lower levels of stress was consistent across gender and race. Future studies are needed to replicate and extend these exploratory findings using both broad and more refined (e.g., intersectional) demographic groups to further improve attention to diversity in the mindfulness field.",

Methods: Undergraduates at a public research university (n = 421, 66% White, 64% female) completed an online survey measuring maladaptive perfectionism, trait mindfulness, self-compassion, social connection, self-control, and emotion regulation. Results: Higher trait mindfulness and self-compassion correlated with lower perfectionism and psychological distress, and greater social connection, self-control, and well-being. Correlations were consistent between Honors and Non-Honors students. Only social connection (indirect effect: ꞵ = -.13, p &lt; .001) mediated the relationship between perfectionism and well-being, whereas both social connection and self-control partly mediated the relationship between perfectionism and psychological distress (indirect effects: ꞵ = .09 and ꞵ = .06; p’s &lt; .01). The multivariable path model explained 24% of the variance in well-being and 42% in distress. Conclusion: Social connection may be more important than mindfulness or self-compassion in buffering perfectionism's negative impact on mental health. Interventions aiming to enhance well-being and reduce distress among perfectionistic individuals may benefit from prioritizing social connectedness and belonging, rather than mindfulness or compassion in isolation.",

Analytical flexibility can include practices like applying different methods for data cleaning, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests. Analytical flexibility is increasingly important for students to learn about because it impacts low replicability and credibility. Registered reports reduce analytical flexibility by submitting a manuscript to a journal in two stages, where journals provide an in-principle acceptance after Stage 1, committing to publishing the results. We describe and demonstrate an activity for psychology undergraduate courses to explore analytical flexibility within a registered report. Students read a first-stage registered report, received the data, and implemented the analysis plan as described. Analysts generate a product summarizing their results, and compare with the final Stage 2 and other analysts. This activity helps students to achieve multiple important learning outcomes focused on the impact of analytical flexibility on research conclusions, advantages and limitations of open science practice, and implementation of statistical methods in a real data context.

Motivated by the mixed empirical findings concerning the effect and long-standing criticisms on estimating and interpreting interaction effects, I used a computational modeling approach to evaluate whether the habit-intention interaction effect estimated from statistical analysis is adequate for inferring the underlying cognitive mechanism assumed by contemporary habit theories. By manipulating the presence or absence of a habit-moderating mechanism in the data-generating model, statistical analyses were performed on the simulated data to examine the correspondence of the estimated interaction effect to the manipulation. Results suggest that while the conventional statistical approach can be indicative of the underlying mechanism, the direction and size of the estimated effect are often misleading in relation to the substantive theory. I identified the cause of the problem from a causal perspective (i.e., intention as a common cause of habit strength and behavior) and discussed potential remedies.",

It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week.

Although children are theorized to rely heavily on their auditory feedback, previous experimental studies are inconsistent, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. This study examines the role of individual differences in attention and sensory processing abilities on auditory feedback control of speech in children. To this end, 53 children ages 4-11 completed a frequency altered feedback (FAF) task where the pitch of their auditory feedback was manipulated and responses to the manipulation were measured to provide an index of the child’s reliance on their auditory feedback. To measure attention and sensory processing abilities, children completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), and their parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) parent-report, respectively. Overall SSP scores, and scores in auditory, tactile, and sensory seeking domains were found to be associated with larger compensatory responses to FAF, while poorer SART performance was associated with slower vocal responses to down shifts. These results suggest that for children, greater sensory processing differences may promote increased reliance on auditory feedback for speech motor control, while attentional differences may be more important in the temporal processing of FAF.",

In social psychology, as in psychology generally, we see arguments taken at face value for: a) the displacement of experimental participants with opaque AI products; the outsourcing of b) programming, c) writing, and even d) scientific theorising to such models; and the notion that e) human-technology interactions could be on the same footing as human-human (e.g., client-therapist, student-teacher, patient-doctor, friendship, or romantic) relationships. But if our colleagues are, accidentally or otherwise, promoting such ideas in exchange for salary, grants, or citations, how are we as academic psychologists meant to react? Formal models, from statistics and computational methods broadly, have a potential obfuscatory power that is weaponisable, laying serious traps for the uncritical adopters, with even the term 'AI' having murky referents. Herein, we concretise the term AI and counter the five related proposals above — from the clearly insidious to those whose ethical neutrality is skin-deep and whose functionality is a mirage. Ultimately, contemporary AI is research misconduct.",

          "abstract": "What political party or what presidential candidate a person supports is often used by adults to divide their social world. However, little is known about whether young children also engage in such tendencies, or whether political groups are even socially meaningful for young children. To trace the beginnings of these tendencies, the current study investigated whether 6- to 12-year-old U.S. children use political markers, such as political party affiliation and support for presidential candidates, to guide their social preferences. We also examined children’s ability to report their political affiliation, whether their political affiliation matched their parents’, how accurate they are at reporting their parents’ political affiliations, and whether having parent-child conversations about politics predicted children’s political affiliation and social preferences. We found that children as young as 6 years of age showed ingroup preferences for individuals who shared their own or their parents' political affiliations – especially based on support for presidential candidates. Notably, even if children could not report their own presidential candidate choice or were inaccurate at predicting their parents' presidential candidate choice, children still preferred people who supported the same presidential candidate as their parents. Further, children who had conversations with their parents about politics were more likely to prefer people who matched their parents’ political affiliations. This study provides the first empirical evidence that 6- to 12-year-old children are using political markers to form ingroup preferences and show rudimentary forms of political partisanship.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive psychologists have long been interested in the intersection of emotion and memory given that the emotions associated with a stimulus affect its memorability. Theoretical perspectives within cognitive science have guided research on how affective dimensions such as valence and arousal impact aspects of memory such as accuracy, subjective vividness, consolidation, and retrieval. Here we argue that well-established theories of emotion from affective science represent a fruitful source of ideas whose implications for episodic memory have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we propose a model of emotional memory inspired by psychological constructionist theories of emotion that builds upon existing perspectives in this area while generating several novel hypotheses and avenues of investigation. Following psychological constructionism, we conceive of emotions as emergent phenomena constructed when perceivers use conceptual knowledge to make sense of affective sensations in context. The Constructionist Model of Emotional Memory (CMEM) highlights new directions for future emotional memory research, such as investigating the mnemonic consequences of conceptual emotion knowledge, and considering the effects of variability in emotion construction at the situational, individual, and cultural levels.",

It compliments standard group-level change estimates and is central to evaluating clinical significance for interventions. In principle, the RCI provides common criteria for evaluating individual change. However, current practices use sample-specific estimates to create these criteria. Because sample estimates are subject to sampling error, these criteria are also subject to sampling error and therefore differ across studies. We illustrate how current practices can lead to differing criteria for reliable change and use simulations to identify the impact of sampling error on the RCI. Excessive error in the RCI began for the average sample when N &lt; 30, and samples only comfortably avoided the risk of excessive error when N &gt; 100. Finally, small errors in estimating a measure’s reliability sometimes had profound effects on the RCI. Recommendations on use of the RCI are provided.",

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with schizophrenia have prominent impairments in social cognition that contribute to poor functional outcomes. Gaze processing – the social-cognitive ability to accurately perceive human eye gaze direction – is similarly abnormal in schizophrenia and associated with social functioning. Though gaze processing has known neural underpinnings in cerebral social-processing brain regions, emerging data suggest that the posterior cerebellum plays a key but often neglected role in social-cognitive function. Elucidating the bi-directional cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics underlying social cognition is critical to identifying a novel treatment target.  \n\nMethods: 39 individuals with schizophrenia and 33 non-clinical control (NCC) participants completed an eye-contact detection task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dynamic causal modeling was used to delineate the dynamics between posterior cerebellum (Crus II) and three cerebral social processing nodes (inferior parietal lobule, anterior insula, and fusiform gyrus) regions and to quantify abnormal effective connectivity in SZ. A confirmatory replication analysis using an independent sample (SZ=27, NCC=22) was conducted to confirm the results. \n\nResults: Model structure comparison revealed overwhelming evidence that cerebellar connections to cerebral social processing nodes are vital to explaining gaze processing in NCC (ln(BF)=98.84) and SZ (ln(BF)=46.85). Relative to NCC, SZ showed less upregulation of cerebellar outputs during gaze processing (t(68)=2.853, p=.006) and this decreased upregulation was associated with social dysfunction (ρ=-.251, p=.034). These results were replicated in the independent sample.\n\nConclusions: Replicated across two independent samples, people with schizophrenia have altered cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics during gaze processing that is linked to social functioning. Given the accessibility of the cerebellum from the scalp for non-invasive brain stimulation relative to many cerebral social-cognitive regions, our findings have critical implications for translational interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conditions associated with perinatal inflammation have been identified as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, data linking early inflammatory biomarkers with later ADHD symptoms remain scarce. The acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) is a key marker of systemic inflammation. To date, no studies have examined the association between CRP levels in cord blood (reflecting neonatal inflammation) and subsequent childhood ADHD symptoms. Here, we aimed to investigate whether elevated cord blood CRP concentrations are associated with child’s ADHD symptoms at age 5. \nMethods: We analyzed data from 1019 and 831 mother–child pairs enrolled in the ELFE and EDEN prospective birth cohorts, respectively. CRP levels in cord blood were measured using an immunoassay. ADHD symptoms were assessed at age 5 using the hyperactivity–inattention subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Outcomes included both continuous scores and categorical thresholds: borderline (≥6) and abnormal (≥7) hyperactivity–inattention symptoms. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were conducted within each cohort to assess associations between elevated CRP levels (≥75th percentile) and ADHD symptoms. Results were then pooled using meta-analytic methods.\nResults: Borderline hyperactivity–inattention scores were observed in 21% of children in the ELFE cohort and 14% in EDEN. After adjusting for maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and pregnancy-related factors, as well as child characteristics at birth, elevated cord blood CRP was significantly associated with higher odds of ADHD symptoms: borderline scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08–1.86), abnormal scores (aOR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.06–2.08), and increased continuous symptom scores (β = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.04–0.54). \nConclusions: Higher CRP concentrations in cord blood are associated with greater ADHD symptom severity at age 5. These findings support the hypothesis that early-life inflammation may contribute to the developmental origins of ADHD and suggest that CRP could serve as a potential early biomarker of neurodevelopmental vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "Visual stimuli are known to vary in their perceived duration, with a variety of features, including both high and low level, shaping temporal responses. For example, the size, memorability, or numerosity of stimuli lead to longer perceived intervals, thus highlighting the malleability of time perception. However, little is known about how stimulus shape may influence temporal perception.  This feature is critical, as shape morphometry forms a general basis by which these other features may exert their influence on perceived duration.  To investigate this, we conducted a series of three experiments looking at how specific characteristics of shapes are significant factors in the manipulation of time perception.  We initially observed that greater shape angularity led to more precise time estimates, independent of shape identity.  Next, we found that shapes and symbols with greater edginess, vertical asymmetry, and thickness led to longer perceived durations.  Finally, we discovered that shapes built with higher numbers of geometrical primitives were perceived as longer, more precisely, and responded to more quickly, and were influenced by how subjectively meaningful they were to individual participants.  Our findings suggest that certain aspects of shapes are able to manipulate time perception due to innate geometric qualities within the visual cortex itself.",

          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted. All in all, the literature on space-valence body-specificity appears reasonably solid, although there is still room for improvement.",

          "abstract": "Background: Successful peer interactions impact the well-being of autistic and non-autistic youth. Social gaze is important in social interactions as it facilitates detecting information from and signaling information to the social partner. However, while previous work has identified differences between autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze patterns while viewing social videos, no work to-date has directly measured differences in autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze during face-to-face peer interactions.\nMethods: Autistic and non-autistic youth ages 11-15 years completed a face-to-face social interaction with a novel peer while wearing mobile eye-tracking glasses to measure gaze. The interaction consisted of three tasks: a getting-to-know-you conversation, a vacation-planning task, and a video-watching task. Fixations to the face were compared between autistic and non-autistic youth across the three contexts.\nResults: Autistic youth fixated less on their partner’s face than non-autistic youth, and these gaze differences varied across interaction contexts. Gaze differences between autistic and non-autistic youth were most pronounced during the unstructured initial getting-to-know-you conversation and absent during the structured video-watching task.\nConclusions: Context impacts gaze for autistic and non-autistic youth, such that the social attention patterns of autistic youth differ the most from their non-autistic peers during unstructured initial conversations. These gaze differences provide autistic youth with reduced opportunities to sense and signal information about their social environments, emphasizing that supports for peer interactions may be especially crucial when navigating these initial, unstructured meetings. In turn, reduced gaze signaling may also impact peers’ understanding of autistic youth, with implications for the development of autism acceptance programming that incorporates acknowledging and accepting potential gaze differences.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to fitspiration content on social media has been linked to increased body dissatisfaction and negative mood. Although often portrayed as a healthier alternative to thinspiration, fitspiration frequently features slim, toned bodies and may reinforce appearance-related concerns. A recent trend, curvy fitspiration—featuring curvier women promoting physical activity and a healthy lifestyle—has shown promise in reducing body dissatisfaction. The present study aimed to investigate differences in the effect of Fitspiration content on weight concern, feeling fat, body dissatisfaction and negative mood depending on the body shape being observed (thin or curvy). Participants included 71 women who completed, before and after the exposure to images, 4 visuoanalogical scales. The variable feeling of fatness increased after exposure to fitspiration content featuring thin bodies and decreased after exposure to curvyfitspiration. Body dissatisfaction showed a significant time effect, increasing after exposure regardless of the experimental condition. Weight concern didn´t have a significant effect after exposure. Mood was significantly higher in the fitspiration condition with a slim body, regardless of the time of measurement. These results suggest that fitspiration's influence is shaped not only by body type but by its emphasis on appearance and the dynamics of social comparison and digital validation.",

          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts. This work goes beyond purely legalistic or formalist accounts of rules, showing that people’s intuitions about rule violations are shaped not only by codification but also by descriptive normativity, moral wrongness, and perceived legitimacy of enforcement.",

Traditional cognitive assessments often lack reliability and require lengthy in-person visits, limiting scalability for younger, trial-ready populations.\nObjectives: To evaluate the feasibility, reliability, and validity of high-frequency remote digital cognitive assessments in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD).\nParticipants: 162 mutation carriers and non-carriers from DIAN-TU from 20 international sites (Ages 19-69 years).\nMeasurements: Participants completed remote assessments via personal smartphones, prompted four times daily for seven days (approximately 3 minutes per session), and conventional in-clinic cognitive testing at baseline. Adherence, test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and sensitivity to clinical impairment were evaluated.\nResults: Average adherence was 41%. Despite this, remote measures demonstrated excellent reliability (ICCs &gt; 0.90 after 10 sessions) and strong construct validity, with tasks loading onto memory, attention, and executive function domains. Model fit was poorer in symptomatic individuals (CDR &gt; 0), consistent with cognitive dedifferentiation during disease progression. Both remote and traditional composites were sensitive to clinical impairment, with similar effect sizes and increasing group differences near expected symptom onset.\nConclusions: High-frequency remote cognitive assessment is feasible, reliable, and valid in a relatively young international ADAD cohort. This approach offers substantial advantages for clinical trials, including reduced participant burden, improved accessibility, and enhanced reliability, supporting its integration into early-intervention studies.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen as allowing a person not only to live by good and just principles but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,909) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "abstract": "Background\nGambling-related harm is increasingly recognised as a complex, multi-dimensional public health problem which variably impacts health, relationships, resources, and broader social functioning. Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem. They are grounded in diverse lived experience and aligned with public health principles.",

          "abstract": "In adverse listening conditions, speech recognition scores are generally higher when listeners can also see the talker’s mouth. Because bilinguals tend to be more detrimentally affected than monolinguals in audio-only noisy conditions, they may stand to benefit more than monolinguals from a second modality. At the same time, the ability to leverage visual cues may be limited by the amount of exposure a listener has to the target language, which varies among bilinguals. In this study, we aimed to understand whether the benefit of audiovisual speech cues is modulated by listeners’ language experiences. To that end, we measured speech recognition accuracy in noise in both audiovisual and audio-only modalities among monolingual and bilingual listeners. We also collected subjective effort and subjective mental fatigue ratings from participants throughout the experiment to evaluate the relationship between audiovisual speech perception and listening effort for different listeners. Our results show that more active use of another language results in less accurate speech recognition in noise for English, but does not modulate the benefit of the audiovisual speech signal.",

          "abstract": "The appropriateness of common nonverbal vocalisations is guided by social norms, known as display rules. This preregistered, seven-day experience-sampling study examined how perceived appropriateness varies across situations. One hundred forty-two adults completed three surveys per day (2,670 surveys total; 3,821 vocalisations), rating appropriateness alongside situational cues and psychological situation characteristics. The results showed that laughter and sighs were most often judged appropriate, whereas screams and retches were least. Appropriateness was higher at home and in social places (e.g., parties) than in work/school or public settings (e.g., library), and higher with close ties than with weak ties or strangers. Psychological characteristics showed that formality and power were associated with lower appropriateness, whereas sociality and positivity were associated with higher appropriateness. Effects were vocalisation-specific: for example, laughter was considered more appropriate in positive, social, and brisk contexts, but less appropriate in formal and high-power contexts. By charting when and where vocalisations are judged acceptable, these findings outline situational principles of vocal display rules in everyday life.",

          "abstract": "Would a penchant for animal cruelty influence how much someone is blamed for lying on a tax return? While extant literature shows that evaluations of someone's moral character can affect subsequent moral judgments, there is contradictory evidence on whether character information affects judgments in a way that is domain-general or domain-specific. Does receiving information about any morally bad character trait increase blame, or only information about traits that are similar to the subsequent act?  In two experiments (preregistered; N = 1320), we investigated how incidental information about an agent's moral character can influence moral and causal judgments. We consistently found that participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more of a cause, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect of character was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Overall, our findings support an account of moral judgment in which character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments of a subsequent act, challenging the domain-specific view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act should influence blame.",

Yet there are no existing self-report scales for measuring the process of decision-making in individual dilemmas (as opposed to general moral attitudes or beliefs about moral decision-making). We address this gap by devising new self-report measures of several of the processes by which people make moral decisions and validate them using realistic moral dilemmas, including six new vignettes that we developed. The resulting 12-item Decision Process Scale (DPS) can be used to measure how much people rely on rules versus cost-benefit reasoning and how much they rely on intuition versus deliberation in the specific moral dilemmas they face in a laboratory experiment or in the real world.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) often includes heterogenous items, as when one uses it while assembling a desk from sets of boards, knobs, bolts, and washers. Here we investigate how WM capacity is limited when recalling multiple sets of items, for which performance surpasses the usual limits observed in single-set procedures. We presented participants (N = 181) with up to four sets of items for serial recall, usually of different stimulus types in the same trial (colors, characters, locations, and/or shapes). Conditions differed in the total number of items, the number of sets, and/or item types across sets in a trial. For uniformity in analyses, Set 1 was kept constant at three items of a type and was usually recalled first, free of output interference. In Experiment 1, recall of Set 1 was not only limited by the total number of items, but also by the number of sets in a trial. Experiment 2 ruled out interference as an alternative explanation. Experiments 3-4 showed the dependency of the results on clearly grouped presentation of the sets. The results suggest that groups of items are associated as newly-formed, often incomplete chunks offloaded from the focus of attention (FoA) to an activated portion of long-term memory (aLTM) for later retrieval. This offloading process would spare capacity but not without cost; a fraction of an item was lost from Set 1 for each subsequent item recalled. We present a dual-stage theory in which pointers held in the capacity-limited FoA allow retrieval of chunks from aLTM.",

The aim of the scale is the valid and reliable measurement of these constructs. For this purpose, a total of five studies were conducted in the present work to generate items and to test content, construct, and criterion validity. On the basis of this procedure an efficient scale was developed, which matches with the psychometric quality criteria and measures employee pro-environmental attitudes and employee pro-environmental behavior with six items each. The scale complies to the requirements for use in scientific studies but is particularly suitable for use in organizational applications due to its small number of items.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "authors": "Ahmad Lotfi; Reza Ebrahimpour; Sajjad Zabbah",
          "abstract": "Perceptual decisions often rely on integrating multiple discrete pieces of sensory evidence over time. Previous studies have shown that these integration strategies are dynamic and can give rise to temporal biases such as the recency effect, where more recent information receives greater weight in the decision process. While some have attributed the recency effect to memory leak, recent findings suggest it may instead reflect a strategic modulation of attention. In this study, we investigated whether attention increases uniformly over time or selectively in response to the amount of accumulated evidence. Using a direction discrimination task with single-, double-, and triple-pulse random dot motion stimuli, we tested competing models of evidence integration and attentional allocation. Consistent with prior work, we observed marginally better performance in weak-strong double-pulse trials compared to strong-weak ones. Notably, in triple-pulse trials, improved performance was evident only when considering the first and third pulses, but not the first two or last two, arguing against a uniform time-based increase in attention. Crucially, when the first two pulses were treated as a unit, a weak-strong pattern relative to the third pulse produced significantly higher accuracy. These findings support a model in which attention increases not over time, but over evidence: reduced early evidence leads to increased attentional allocation to later samples. Our results provide further insight into the adaptive nature of perceptual decision-making and the role of online attentional strategies in optimizing performance in environments with discrete, time-separated sensory events.",

          "abstract": "Preclinical studies suggest that fasting may attenuate spontaneous pain and pain-related behaviors, such as licking and paw withdrawal, during inflammation in animals; however, evidence of the analgesic effects of fasting in patients suffering from chronic pain remains inconclusive. In two studies, we investigated the potentially protective effects of fasting on the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers following experimentally induced sensitization of nociceptive fibers through painful cutaneous electrical stimulation. In the first experiment (N = 33), participants underwent the painful electrical stimulation protocol twice: once after a 12-hour fast and once after consuming a standard breakfast. In a follow-up experiment (N = 52), participants were randomized to receive either the painful electrical stimulation protocol after a 16-hour fast or after their usual morning meal. In both experiments, we assessed the intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial extent of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, as well as emotional state and hunger levels. Fasting increased hunger and negative affect in both studies. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, participants in the fasted condition reported significantly less mechanical hypersensitivity compared to the breakfast condition. In both experiments, fasting did not reduce the pain intensity reported during the painful electrical stimulation. These findings provide behavioral evidence that a 16-hour fast may reduce the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. These results in humans align with preclinical evidence showing that fasting affects mechanical hypersensitivity, without necessarily affecting the perceived intensity of acute painful stimuli. Our findings suggest that metabolic state may modulate mechanical hypersensitivity in humans.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has made it easier than ever to produce hyperrealistic but entirely false imagery. One especially harmful use is the creation of non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes depicting real people. While such content clearly violates privacy, its broader political implications remain underexplored. This paper investigates how sexually explicit AI-generated imagery affects\npublic perceptions of politicians and broader democratic outcomes. Drawing on a pre-registered survey experiment in the U.S. (N = 1904), we exposed participants to either explicit, private, or control images of a fictitious male or female politician embedded in a mock social media feed. The results indicate that explicit deepfakes significantly diminish candidate evaluations, particularly with respect to affect, trustworthiness, perceived competence, and leadership qualities. Exposure to AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) further leads to lower voting intentions for the targeted politician, illustrating how reputational harm can translate into electoral consequences. Contrary to expectations, male politicians were more strongly affected by these negative shifts in perception. However, we find no evidence that exposure to such content reduces participants’ own political ambition. These findings highlight the reputational risks posed by synthetic intimate media and highlight the urgent need to mitigate its potential threats to democratic processes.",

          "abstract": "Organizational psychology has traditionally focused on internal dynamics, neglecting the broader social structures in which organizations are embedded. This limitation is particularly evident in research on job burnout. While burnout is often framed as a symptom of organizational dysfunction, it also reflects wider systemic forces—economic instability, political regulation, cultural expectations, and ecological stressors—that influence how individuals navigate the competing demands of performance and wellbeing. Current models underestimate these contextual and historical influences due to their peripheral position in organizational analysis. This paper introduces a new open systems theory of burnout that delineates how sublethal forces interact with organizational processes to deplete employee energy and increase burnout. It proposes nine core propositions through which external environmental factors shape burnout experiences and argues for a paradigm shift toward systemic, context-aware models. The paper concludes by presenting a theoretical framework and challenges for future research.",

We tested the idea that competition underlies the greater difficulty associated with producing homophone, compared to non-homophone, targets. Using computational simulations, we showed that competition alone is sufficient to produce interference during homophone production, and that such interference is exacerbated by increasing lexical competition. These predictions were confirmed in two experiments, a typing-to-dictation task (Experiment 1) and a question-answering task (Experiment 2). We further showed the homophone effect was insensitive to the syntactic category: we found a robust homophone interference effect of a comparable magnitude for same-category (e.g., flower-flour) and different-category (e.g., idol-idle) homophones. Collectively, these results show that lexical selection in typing is similar to speaking in terms of the processes arising from representational overlap, but distinct from it in terms of the influence of syntax.",

          "abstract": "Learning to recognize and produce foreign speech sounds can be challenging, particularly when only subtle differences distinguish these new sounds from phonemes in the native language. Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows us to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

We propose a cognitive model of trust in science—the rational impression account—according to which people come to trust science by relying on a suite of basic cognitive mechanisms: First, people infer competence from possessing rare knowledge; Second, people infer accuracy from consensus; Third, people’s impressions can persist after they forget what generated them.

This free-time benefit is often assumed to arise from processes that counteract forgetting of the just encoded item in working memory, suggesting that time has a retroactive effect. Contrary to these predictions, a few studies showed that free time between two items in a serial-recall task benefits only the subsequent (to-be-encoded) items, yielding a proactive benefit in work-ing memory. Here, we investigate whether working memory and long-term memory benefit from free time in the same way. In three experiments, we show that free time benefits the to-be encoded items in working memory (proactive effect) with only a local retroactive effect for recently encoded items, whereas it mainly benefits already encoded items in long-term memory (retroactive benefit). These results challenge a single explanation of the free-time benefit for memory retention across short and long intervals.",

          "abstract": "Cognates facilitate vocabulary learning. However, how the magnitude of this Cognate Facilitation Effect (CFE) changes with age and its task-dependent manifestations remain unclear. Clarifying these patterns may benefit educators with evidence-based strategies to support learners across different stages and tasks. This systematic review synthesizes studies on CFE in school-aged second and foreign language learners between 1987 and 2024 (n = 36). The results showed that, firstly, the CFE follows an inverted U-shaped trajectory. It increases during early literacy (ages 6–9), peaking in middle childhood (ages 9–10), and declining thereafter. Secondly, facilitation is robust in comprehension tasks but more variable in production, where overlap can induce interference. Furthermore, we evaluate psycholinguistic models and propose integrating speech-production models to account for the interference effect of cognate production. These findings suggest educational implications: cognates can help support vocabulary development in early literacy, but more refined strategies are needed as learners advance.\n\nKeywords: cognates; cross-linguistic transfer; literacy development; psycholinguistics",

          "abstract": "Background: Practitioner ratings of their adherence to evidence-based psychotherapy or counseling practices in working with autistic youth could be an efficient method for tracking the success of efforts to implement effective practices in community behavioral health service settings. Tools of this sort that generalize across multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) have not been developed to date. In this study, a practitioner self-report measure of adherence to EBPs for autistic youth was developed and evaluated. Method: A multiple baseline study of seven behavioral health practitioners was conducted to determine if internet-based self-directed training on Modular EBPs for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA; meya.ucla.edu), a free internet-based practitioner training app, would facilitate an increase in clinician adherence to EBP techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral intervention practices. Practitioners made self-ratings on the MEYA Integrity Scale-Practitioner Version (MEYA-IS-PV). Expert coders unaware of phase or study hypotheses also rated the therapists’ adherence to EBPs for each session. Caregivers rated youth outcomes at each session on the Youth Top Problems scale. Results: Linear mixed models showed that MEYA-IS-PV scores corresponded to expert ratings of adherence, increased following the onset of training in EBPs, and predicted improvements in youth behavioral health. Visual analysis of the multiple baseline data confirmed that 5 of 7 practitioners increased their self-reported adherence in EBPs once training began. Conclusion: Self-ratings of adherence are promising for examining adherence to EBPs in psychotherapy or counseling for autistic youth.",

          "abstract": "Autistic youth experience high rates of co-occurring mental health concerns, yet empirically supported practices (ESPs) are rarely implemented with fidelity in community care due to barriers in training, scalability, and workflow integration. The Modular Evidence-Based Practices for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA) platform was developed as a free, open-access digital tool that provides just-in-time therapist training, modular cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies, and caregiver-supported goal monitoring. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, seven community clinicians implemented MEYA following a baseline phase of usual care. Platform use was tracked through analytics, and six clinicians participated in qualitative exit interviews. Results: Directed content analysis revealed five overarching themes: MEYA was perceived as useful, flexible, and clinically relevant; therapists valued the CBT content and caregiver goal charts; feasibility was supported by its accessibility but limited by workflow demands; underutilization of measurement-based care (MBC) features and a resulting impact on the personalization of care were noted barriers. Engagement data showed moderate-to-high uptake across modules. Conclusion: Overall, MEYA was feasible and acceptable across diverse providers, with strengths in usability and fidelity support. Findings identify priorities for refinement, particularly in automating measurement-based care features and creating push-out guidance via email to clinicians who need to conserve time and effort. These results provide preliminary evidence for MEYA as a scalable platform to increase access to ESPs for autistic youth.",

          "authors": "Olivia Fischer; Renato Frey",
          "abstract": "Polarization has become a major concern in behavioral science and popular media, as it may affect many important areas of life. For instance, how polarized are people's perceptions of risks, such as regarding (not) imposing mitigation measures during a pandemic? Answering this question is surprisingly challenging: Whereas multiple theoretical views of polarization and their respective mathematical operationalizations coexist, the latter are often used interchangebly as measures of \"polarization\". This may be indicative of a jingle fallacy, because it is unknown whether the diverse ways of quantifying polarization in people's perceptions of important societal matters empirically converge. In study 1 we thus ran a reanalysis of a large dataset from the World Values Survey covering diverse topics of societal relevance (N = 93,214), finding only moderate empirical convergence between six operationalizations of polarization. In study 2 we applied the same approach focusing specifically on people's risk perceptions of COVID-19 mitigation measures (N = 768), and found a similar pattern of low convergence between different operationalizations of polarization. Yet, according to one operationalization with a clear threshold for polarization, risk perceptions were polarized in 11 out of 12 experimental conditions. Our findings emphasize the need to carefully consider how polarization is operationalized to avoid broad generalizations, keeping in mind that some operationalizations may speak to specific theoretical conceptualizations. To raise awareness for this concern and support behavioral science researchers in conducting similar analyses with their own datasets, we provide a novel online tool available at https://shiny.cbdr-lab.net/polarization.",

          "abstract": "This study was undertaken in 2023 in follow-up to earlier work (Bolton et al., 2022) which preliminarily quantified a new construct operationalized around the ideas of psychologist Carl Rogers. While we were interested in re-formulating from a humanistic psychological perspective, after Rogers’ original conditions of worth concept (1957, 1959), the behavioral formulation of conditional regard, we also tested and provided evidence for the hypothesis that autistic people experience heightened conditions of worth relative to non-autistic people. We validated through a brief online survey (n = 162, including 109 autistic and 53 non-autistic individuals) two distinct sets of items, one retrospective for the adolescent period between ages 12 and 17 and the other for adulthood, to assess the extent to which individuals perceive conditions of worth. The items were then correlated with an array of individual difference variables. Perceived emotional safety recalled as an adolescent and felt as an adult, perceived psychological control of one’s parental figure when an adolescent, adult fear of criticism and rejection, adult masking or camouflaging of parts of oneself, adult incongruence or inauthenticity, adult acceptance of external influence, and adult self-alienation were all positively correlated in support of the measures’ convergent and predictive validity. Adult self-esteem, unconditional positive self-regard, adolescence-perceived parental autonomy support, authentic adult living, and congruence or authenticity were all, with some exceptions, negatively correlated in theoretically expected directions. Perfectionism was also variously correlated. Implications and applications are offered for academics as well as mental health practitioners.",

This study explored how climate change shapes the emotions, thoughts, and behaviours of young people from Australia, and the implications for wellbeing.\nData were drawn from Mission Australia’s 2023 Youth Survey. Participants were asked to describe how climate change impacts their thinking, feelings, and behaviour. Free-text responses from 3,272 participants were analysed using inductive thematic analysis, with relational analysis identifying interconnected patterns across emotional, cognitive, and behavioural domains.\nYoung people from Australia reported diverse responses to climate change, including feelings of anxiety, sadness, and hope; thoughts about future impacts, personal responsibility, and systemic failure; and behaviours ranging from pro-environmental actions to disengagement. Based on overlapping feelings, thinking, and behaviour, seven archetypes of response were identified: the Hopeless Helper, Nervous Navigator, Furious Fighter, Guilty Guardian, Wounded Witness, Detached Drifter, and Determined Doer.\nFindings highlight the complex and interconnected ways young people respond to climate change across emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. Archetypes provide a framework for understanding both risks and resilience, emphasising that distress often stems from systemic inaction. They underscore the need for nuanced measures, tailored interventions, and policies that systematically integrate climate and mental health.",

Children’s sensitivity to rote behavior increased with development, with consistent competence emerging around age 7. Rote behavior was also associated with worse teaching.

We investigated whether similar gains occur by combining multiple decisions made by the same individual, via a “wisdom of the crowd within” effect. Participants completed the same unfamiliar face matching task three times: in one session (Experiment 1), or over three weeks (Experiment 2). We found a wisdom of the crowd within effect in both experiments, which was significant after two responses, and larger with three. Surprisingly, the delay did not offer additional benefit. Though the crowd within improved performance, crowds of different individuals produced larger gains. Our results add to a growing literature showing combined decision-making can improve unfamiliar face matching performance.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "abstract": "The attraction effect occurs when the preference between two options is altered by the inclusion of a third, decoy option that is worse than one of the original options. It challenges rational choice theories by showing that preference can change by having an irrelevant option in the choice set. The attraction effect is typically studied in situations where individuals have full access to option information during choice. However, in many real-life situations, people must make choices based on their memory of the options. In three experiments (N = 379), we investigated the attraction effect when people had to rely on their memory when making choices. We show initially that relying on memory eliminated the attraction effect, but also that the attraction effect was recovered with improvements in memory. The results suggest that memory accuracy may be a boundary condition of the attraction effect. We also observed improvements in decoy avoidance and choice accuracy with improvements in memory. Our results are consistent with the representational noise hypothesis (Spektor et al., 2021) where noise (e.g., due to forgetting) disrupts how people represent the relationships among options.",

However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

          "abstract": "This study investigated effects of content format and instructional framing on knowledge attainment, situational interest, and academic emotions in digital history learning. In a 2 (format: game versus text) × 2 (instruction: learning versus fun) between-subjects design, 143 university students engaged with either a historically accurate video game on the Roman Empire or a structurally aligned interactive text application, each paired with instructions to focus on learning or fun. Both formats presented the same historical content through main narratives, optional missions, and supplemental historical information in the form of codex entries. The findings revealed that participants in the game condition reported higher enjoyment and greater triggered situational interest, indicating that the game enhances the positive affective experience of engaging with historical content and sparks learners’ interest. However, our hypothesis that knowledge test performance would be higher in the game condition was not supported. Instead, knowledge test scores were higher in the text condition. No statistically significant effects emerged for instructional framing or for the interaction between format and framing on the outcomes. Additional analyses of behavioural data showed that text participants engaged more extensively with codex entries, and that codex engagement strongly predicted knowledge outcomes across both formats. This suggests that knowledge outcomes depend on the visibility and integration of supplemental materials, and learners’ engagement with them. Overall, this study contributes to research on digital history learning by offering a controlled comparison of identical content delivered through game and text and shedding light on the role of instructional framing.",

          "abstract": "Revising explanations allows learners to develop a coherent understanding of scientific phenomena by integrating different ideas, a key learning outcome according to the Knowledge Integration (KI) Framework. We explored the design of critique activities and analyzed how peer critique helps 1305 middle school students to revise science explanations. Students wrote a science explanation about thermodynamics in an online learning environment, critiqued the explanation of a fictitious peer and then, revised their own explanation. For the critique activity, they were randomly assigned to three conditions that differed in the characteristics of the fictitious peer’s explanation. Specifically, students either critiqued a peer’s explanation that describes intuitive ideas (intuitive), combines intuitive and scientifically normative ideas (partial), or connects several scientifically normative ideas (linked). We found that critique was valuable in each condition as students showed more integrated understanding in their revised responses to the explanation question compared to their initial response. Students in the linked condition received the highest KI scores. Students who started with a higher KI score had an advantage over those with a lower KI score in all conditions. This difference was strongest in the intuitive condition, indicating that the intuitive condition was the least beneficial for students with lower prior knowledge. Qualitative analysis of the types of revisions students made revealed that, in all conditions, students often adopted ideas from the answer they critiqued. When they adopted the intuitive idea, they were less likely to improve their explanation than when they adopted the link. These results illustrate the importance of critique for promoting integrated understanding. They reveal the need for more frequent and more powerful instruction to build skepticism when confronted with potentially unreliable information, e.g. by comparing two explanations with contrasting ideas.",

          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their sensation of task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested if pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

Recent work using \nthe Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task underscores the critical role of categorization consistency \n(trial-by-trial response variability around the mean response function) as a critical predictor of \nreal-world outcomes such as language and reading abilities. Yet, the mechanisms that \ncontribute to categorization consistency remain unknown. One hypothesis is that higher-level \nlinguistic factors, such as lexical knowledge, may stabilize the percept by cleaning up lower-\nlevel perceptual noise. The first aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by examining \nwhether categorization consistency is modulated by lexicality (word vs. nonword). Forty-eight \nadult American English listeners completed a VAS task involving both word (e.g., batch-patch) \nand matched nonword (e.g., bazg-pazg) continua. Listeners’ categorization consistency for the \nword continua was significantly higher than for the nonword continua. This suggests that \ncategorization consistency is, indeed, affected by higher-level linguistic factors. The second aim \nwas to investigate whether individuals’ broader language abilities influence their reliance on \nlexical information during speech categorization. Although individuals with greater language \nability showed more consistent categorization, language scores did not modulate the lexical \neffect on categorization consistency. Together, these findings demonstrate the roles of top-down \nknowledge and language knowledge in stabilizing speech categorization.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between heritable and acquired traits. In a large-scale study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

Against the background of two exemplary theories, a concept is presented which modifies otherwise contrasting models and merges essential features of consciousness into a modified concept. This includes the brain’s comparative representation of sensations originating in the subject’s body versus those originating in the environment. It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

We conducted an 8-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) experiment (n=20) and a 4-hour partial sleep deprivation (PSD) experiment (n=44) to examine their effects on ideological extremism and affective polarization. Results revealed a significant increase in ideological extremism following TSD in between-subjects analysis (Cohen's f² = 0.48), while no significant effects were observed with the PSD protocol compared to the regular sleep (RS) condition. Importantly, moderation analyses revealed that political orientation significantly influenced susceptibility to sleep deprivation effects, with different patterns emerging in between-subjects versus within-subjects analyses. Left-wing participants showed greater vulnerability to increased ideological extremism under sleep deprivation in between-subjects comparisons, while this effect was found for right-leaning individuals in within-subjects analyses. No significant effects were observed on affective polarization in either protocol. These findings provide initial evidence that sleep deprivation can contribute to political polarization by increasing ideological extremism, particularly when considering political orientation as a moderating factor. The study provides novel insights into the complex relationship between sleep and political cognition in distinct sociopolitical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Supporting wellbeing within education settings is vital. Whole school approaches present a holistic and integrated mechanism that recognise school staff, the school community and pupils. The Well Schools whole school approach to supporting teacher and pupil wellbeing provides a framework that guides planning, policy and practice while allowing for bespoke and socially valid approaches suitable for each school community. \nMethod. A case study approach explored how schools adopted the Well Schools framework, and what practices and provision schools were offering as part of Well Schools. Second, it aimed to identify the perceived impact of embedding the Well Schools approach for schools, teachers and pupils. 10 case study schools were recruited that were implementing Well Schools and that represented diversity in setting type, varying locations across the UK and school demographics. Data was collected via interviews (n = 16) with school leaders and class teachers that focused on their experiences and engagement with the whole school approach with particular attention to the process of implementation. \nFindings. Six themes were identified covering how Well Schools was being implemented, what drove this and the impact it was having: 1) staff enrichment, 2) pupil enrichment, 3) motivation, 4) capability, 5) awareness and engagement, and 6) sustainability. Findings suggest the value of supporting staff and pupil wellbeing were central to an effective learning environment that supported wellbeing. Well Schools offered the opportunity for schools to build relationships, collaborate and learn from a network of schools. This network and the engagement with like-minded schools was identified as a reason why some schools were attracted to the whole school approach.\nConclusion. Promoting Well Schools can help other schools adopt better practices for health, wellbeing and identify ways of developing holistic wellbeing at the school, teacher and pupil levels. Such continued engagement further exemplifies the feasibility, acceptability and positive impact the case study schools reported regarding Well Schools.",

          "authors": "Samuel Poelker-Wells; Danielle Fearon-Drake; Francesca Filbey",
          "abstract": "Background: The primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis interacts with the endocannabinoid system (eCB), which declines with age, potentially reducing its ability to regulate homeostasis and altering responses to cannabis. Indeed, animal studies suggest age-related differences in response to cannabis that result in mixed effects in older individuals. Importantly, biological sex modifies the eCB system, which complicates interpreting these effects. Objective: The goal of this study was to understand how individual variation in human endocannabinoid system function due to age and sex influences cannabis’s effects in middle-aged and older adults. Methods:  Self-reported measures of cannabis use behaviors, memory, mental and physical health, cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptom severity, and sleep quality were collected from 107 adults (age range= 35-78, 54 females) who use cannabis. Partial correlations examined associations between age and outcomes controlling for years of use. Biological sex was assessed as a moderator. Results: Regression analyses revealed a significant age × sex interaction for CUD symptoms and mental health scores. Specifically, CUD symptom severity decreased, and mental health scores improved with age in females but not in males. Sensitivity analysis suggested that participants who reported medical-only use exhibited a steeper decline in CUD symptom severity with age than recreational-only or hybrid-use participants. Conclusions: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on cannabis use in aging populations and underscores the need to consider age, sex, and reason for use when evaluating cannabis-related outcomes such as CUD risk in the emerging demographic of middle-aged and older adults who use cannabis.",

          "abstract": "Speeding can be conceptualised as a social dilemma that requires attention to engineering factors such as traffic and roadway conditions as well as psychological traits and individual attributes. These traits and attributes shape whether regulatory and physical signals are internalised as binding constraints, yet most existing studies overlook them. In particular, drivers’ Social Value Orientation (SVO) can substantially influence speeding and moderate the effects of other factors. To address this gap, we examined stated preferences to exceed speed limits, and their determinants including SVO, across urban scenarios in the West Midlands (WM), Athens, and Valencia. We used an ordered discrete choice model with random parameters and heterogeneity in means to capture unobserved and latent psychological heterogeneity. Results indicated that road design, traffic density, and speed enforcement were associated with self-reported speeding, with effects varying by context and driver traits. Higher SVO was linked to greater compliance in the WM, mixed effects in Valencia, and norm-congruent behaviour in Athens that could legitimise moderate speeding. Older drivers in Athens reported greater responsiveness to cameras. Age moderated self-reports: in WM and Athens, the stated likelihood of speeding linked to drivers’ violation history declined with age; the gender gap widened with age in WM but narrowed in Athens. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the effects of engineering and enforcement are not uniform across all drivers. Their impact is mediated by local norms, perceived credibility, and socially embedded understandings of considerate driving, underscoring the need to integrate social and psychological dimensions into traffic safety interventions.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia, the strong diminution or complete absence of mental imagery, challenges long-standing views of imagery as central to cognition. Competing accounts variously explain the phenomenon as a failure of sensory reactivation or as unconscious mental imagery. Here, we propose a new framework, the integration model of aphantasia, which argues that reactivated sensory information must undergo multi-stage integration to yield imagery experience. Against unconscious imagery accounts, we argue that the neural activations observed in aphantasics are not imagery but sensory precursors: rudimentary sensory codes that lack perceptual status. Only when sensory precursors are locally integrated do they become perceptual representations, and only when these are further integrated with interoceptive signals do they give rise to conscious imagery experience. We present the integration model as a dual-stream framework that unifies recent attention- and interoception-based accounts, situate the model within existing theories of mental imagery and aphantasia, and highlight its clinical relevance. In doing so, we reframe the debate on unconscious imagery and draw attention to the role of multi-stage integration as a key mechanism underlying mental imagery and its absence across different subtypes of aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Despite the theoretical arguments and recent empirical evidence indicating retest correlations to be particularly suitable reliability estimates, usual retest intervals (e.g., two weeks; one month) will underestimate the reliability of measures over the within-session interval in which inter-test relationships are regularly estimated.  Consequently, we argue that within-session retest correlations may be particularly useful for estimating the reliability of measures over this interval. Specifically, we show evidence that within-session retest correlations: (1) provide the common upper-limit of internal consistency and retest reliability estimates, and consequently (2) are considerably less susceptible to producing disattenuated correlations greater than 1 in magnitude; (3) better track variation in scale validity correlations than common reliability estimators such as coefficient alpha; and (4) can be estimated for single-item measures. We illustrate this using data collected from several samples on two personality inventories, the Inventory of Individual Differences in the Lexicon (IIDL; Wood, Nye, &amp; Saucier, 2010) and Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2; Soto &amp; John, 2017).  Results suggest that reliability is typically underestimated and thus overadjusted for in meta-analytic and structural equation modeling contexts, and that greater use of these estimates is thus likely to slow the momentum toward broader constructs and provide sturdier psychometric ground for the measurement of narrower constructs or nuances. More generally, we detail how within-session retest correlations draw better attention to the crucial role of the time interval separating measurements toward determining the appropriate estimates to use when adjusting for the measurement unreliability affecting zero-order correlations.",

          "abstract": "Most people believe that social media discourse is negative and divisive. Here we show how this negativity can evolve even when users are not motivated to be negative. We propose that social media users seek to differentiate themselves from other users, and it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity than positivity because negative information is more heterogeneous and counter-normative than positive information. This makes users increasingly likely to post negative comments as a conversation unfolds and it becomes more challenging to make unique contributions. Analyzing 2.05 billion comments from 2,150 Reddit communities shows that comments become more negative over time, both within threads and community histories. This trend towards negativity is mediated by the semantic uniqueness of comments, suggesting that it arises from users differentiating themselves. This trend is strongest when initial dialogue is positive, making negative comments highly counter-normative. We replicate these patterns in a multigenerational experiment simulating social media dialogue (n = 4,000). Participants become more negative over time, but only when incentivized to be unique, and especially when dialogue begins positively. These findings suggest that the structure of social media platforms interacts with human motivation to foster a drift towards negativity over time in online discourse.",

          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have allowed for the creation of polygenic scores (PGSs) reflecting genetic liability for depression, yet recent work suggests that these PGSs may also reflect greater genetic propensity towards higher levels of stress exposure. The current study sought to extend prior findings to examine whether an established depression PGS (DEP-PGS) is associated with greater stress exposure at the neighborhood level in a sample of preadolescent children. This study included 278 children of European ancestry between the ages of 7 and 11 (45.3% female) and their parent. Parents and children completed clinical interviews and questionnaires and children provided genetic samples. Children’s neighborhoods were defined based on their current home address and geocoded indices of neighborhood adversity (i.e., area socioeconomic disadvantage, crime, opportunity) were matched to zip codes. As hypothesized, children with greater genetic liability for depression as reflected by DEP-PGSs were more likely to live in neighborhoods characterized by greater adversity. Findings were maintained when statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and parent’s and children’s histories of depression and anxiety. The current findings build upon prior research highlighting depression-relevant gene-environment correlations and extend this work to provide evidence that DEP-PGSs may capture genetic liability for exposure to stressful contexts at the neighborhood level. Future research is needed to replicate findings in diverse samples and to examine whether neighborhood-level adversity mediates the relation between DEP-PGSs and future depression risk in youth.",

This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning with detailed behavioural and physiological measures in 27 unconstrained social learning interactions. Learning was supported by teacher-learner inter-brain synchrony (INS), over regions important for mutual understanding (temporo-parietal junction, TPJ) and communicative coordination (ventral premotor, PMv). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the INS-learning association in oppositive ways, motivating a dual-process model: during knowledge-building phases, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low INS in regions for mutual understanding (TPJ) and coordination (right PMv), and high INS in language-related areas (left PMv). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high INS over TPJ. Cross-brain general linear modelling (xGLM) revealed asymmetric neural dependencies linked to speaking and teaching roles in the left-hemisphere language network. These effects remained after controlling for nodding, gaze, and breathing, indicating that INS reflects true social-cognitive alignment beyond sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated and nonlinear brain–body dynamics and positions INS as a marker of mutual prediction during communicative social interaction.",

          "abstract": "Attention control predicts academic achievement, professional success, and health outcomes. However, the neural basis of stable, trait-level differences in attention control remains unclear. Prior research has emphasized momentary fluctuations in attentional engagement, often overlooking enduring individual differences. Here, we applied the quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis of infraslow fMRI dynamics in a large sample (N = 191) to test whether trait attention control is reflected in network-level brain activity as well as the locus coeruleus. Using latent-variable measures of attention control, working memory capacity, and fluid intelligence, we isolated the unique contribution of attention control across rest, 1-back, and 3-back conditions. Under heightened cognitive demand, individuals with higher attention control exhibited more flexible coordination of the frontoparietal control network (FPCN): they showed stronger decoupling from the default mode network (DMN), enhanced coupling with the dorsal attention network (DAN), and greater engagement with the locus coeruleus (LC). Even at rest, high attention individuals demonstrated stronger FPCN-DAN coupling, and little to no correlation between FPCN-DMN, indicating that attentional capacity is reflected in both task-evoked reconfiguration and baseline network architecture. These findings reveal how attention control, as a trait, is instantiated in the brain’s dynamic architecture.",

          "authors": "Martin Brunner; Franzis Preckel; Thomas Goetz; Oliver Lüdtke; Lena Keller",
          "abstract": "Math anxiety and math achievement are reciprocally related, which likely impacts individuals’ agency; their educational and career trajectories in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; and countries’ economic growth in these areas. Previous meta-analyses on this relationship have faced limitations from studies using small convenience samples and have encountered methodological issues, such as variance restriction, low statistical power, and ecological bias. To address these challenges, the present research synthesis is the first to use a comprehensive collection of representative individual participant data (IPD) from International Large-Scale Assessments (ILSAs). This analysis incorporated cumulative evidence from 1980 to 2022, including 452 probability samples from 90 countries, and covered student and adult populations. The meta-analytic average correlation between math anxiety and math achievement was r = –.26. Moderator analyses revealed novel evidence that this relationship is sensitive to construct characteristics as well as individual and contextual factors. Specifically, the negative relationship was weaker for the worry facet of math anxiety compared with its affective facet and its cognitive interference facet, and it was weaker following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, the negative relationship was stronger for individuals with average and high levels of math achievement and in countries with higher Gross Domestic Product per capita. Gender differences in the relationship were largely negligible after 2010, although female individuals exhibited a stronger negative relationship in the 1980s and 1990s than male individuals. In summary, synthesizing IPD from ILSAs provided novel, nuanced, and robust evidence for research, practice, and policy.",

          "abstract": "Background\nHealth-enhancing behaviours have been linked to long-term subjective wellbeing. However, less research has examined experiential wellbeing (how people feel in the moment). By directly comparing experiential wellbeing during different health-enhancing behaviours, we could learn which dimensions of behaviours are most important for health.\n\nMethods\nWe included 11,144 participants who completed the American Time Use Survey Wellbeing Module, engaged in a health-enhancing behaviour on the previous day, and reported levels of positive (happiness) and negative (sadness, stress, tiredness, pain) affect during this behaviour. Multilevel linear regression models tested how affect differed during eight health-enhancing behaviours. We also tested whether associations differed according to the social context, location, and meaningfulness of each activity.\n\nResults\nSocial engagement was most common, followed by reading and physical activity. Attending sports events was least common. The most consistent associations were for pain and tiredness, which were higher during physical activity than other health-enhancing behaviours. Happiness was highest when doing receptive arts and lowest when volunteering and reading. Results for sadness and stress were more variable. Activities that were done with others, outside the home, and that were very meaningful were associated with most positive and less negative affect.\n\nConclusions\nOur findings demonstrate that health-enhancing behaviours can evoke complex emotional reactions, with positive and negative affect experienced simultaneously. Currently, recommendations around health-enhancing leisure activities in Western countries focus on physical activity, but our findings support calls for recommendations to include a wider range of activities and guidance on the context in which people engage.",

          "authors": "Tatsuya Daikoku",
          "abstract": "Creativity in human societies is sustained not by isolated minds but by embodied, collective intelligence. Using music as a model system, we show that creativity rests on the dynamic tuning of uncertainty: moderate, time-varying surprise—often felt as internal bodily sensations—sparks exploration, while group synchrony stabilizes what is new. Because creativity itself is value-neutral, its fate depends on the co-occurrence of ethics, morality, and empathy. Ethical norms bound admissible deviation, and empathic perspective-taking—amplified by bodily and physiological coupling—acts as a social “precision weight” that admits, reshapes, or rejects novelty. From these ingredients emerges field-level intelligence: a process in which groups preserve diversity, selectively integrate deviations, and maintain “just-right” uncertainty under partially connected social structures. This framing explains the resilience of creativity across generations and sets an agenda for empirical work: quantify uncertainty dynamics in embodied interaction, test how ethical and empathic cues regulate admissibility, and identify network conditions that best sustain socially shared creativity. This framing clarifies why creativity endures and suggests a concrete empirical agenda.",

In particular, we show that group judgments are more accurate than the average of a comparable number of individual judgments, and that group judgments can be as accurate as the judgments of the best individual member of the nominal groups (i.e., the person with the lowest judgment error). Additionally, our meta-analytic results substantiate two different mechanisms that lead to synergy in quantitative group judgment. On the one hand, group members can learn from each other and, thereby, increase their individual accuracy (G-I transfer). On the other hand, when controlling for G-I transfer, group members are also able to identify the more accurate judgments and assign more weight to them (differential weighting).",

          "authors": "Marc Raynaud; Loïc Raynaud; Agathe Truchot; Alexandre Loupy",
          "abstract": "While modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly pass short-form Turing tests and are sometimes rated as more human than humans, whether LLMs themselves can act as evaluators in this setting remains poorly investigated. We designed an interactive reverse Turing test in which seven LLMs (ChatGPT 4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro, Mistral Large 2.1, Grok 3, DeepSeek V3, and Llama 4 Maverick) served as evaluators. Each LLM autonomously posed up to ten questions to hidden participants, who were either humans or other LLMs instructed with minimal or structured prompts. Thematic analysis was applied to both the questions and the reasons underlying final verdicts. Across 238 reverse Turing tests comprising 1,714 questions, AI evaluators identified AI participants as AI in only three tests. AI participants were judged more human than humans (mean probability of being human: 0.88 in AI participants vs 0.78 in humans; p&lt;0.001). Thematic analysis of questioning strategies revealed emphasis on emotions/feelings (14%), memory (13%) and behaviours (11%), with distinct model-specific patterns: e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet emphasised on mind and reasoning, Gemini 2.5 Pro focused on abstraction and creativity and ChatGPT 4.5 focused on socio-emotional dimensions. Reasons cited for final verdict most often referred to authenticity of personality (26%) and veracity of emotions (25%). Among tests with human participants : questions were rated by participants moderately difficult to answer (mean 4.65 out of 10), question relevance was rated higher (mean 6.84), and mean duration was 18.7 minutes (12.4). In conclusion, current AI-based conversational screening appears insufficient for ensuring authenticity in dialogue. Future studies may explore longer, multimodal interactions, richer evaluator prompts co-designed with cognitive experts, and hybrid committees of human and AI evaluators.",

However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

Indeed, some even see 'sparks of artificial general intelligence' in their apparently boundless faculty for conversation and reasoning, Their sophisticated emergent faculties, which were not initially anticipated by their designers, has ignited an urgent debate about whether and under which circumstances we should attribute consciousness to artificial entities in general and  LLMs in particular. The current consensus, rooted in computational functionalism, proposes that consciousness should be ascribed based on a principle of computational equivalence. The objective of this opinion piece is to criticize this current approach and argue in favor of an alternative “behavioral inference principle”, whereby consciousness is attributed if it is useful to explain (and predict) a given set of behavioral observations.  We believe that a behavioral inference principle will provide an epistemologically valid and operationalizable criteria to assess machine consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Social norms influence a wide spectrum of behaviors, yet their role in motivating political action remains underexplored. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes three norm types: (1) social approval of activists’ goals, (2) social approval of their actions, and (3) social engagement in those actions. We test how these norms and their consistent or inconsistent combinations shape willingness to participate in political action and perceptions of the cause’s importance and feasibility. Six preregistered experiments examined these effects in both hypothetical and real-world contexts, in Poland and the U.S., using between-person and within-person designs. Study 1 showed that information about one norm type spilled over to inferences about the others, underscoring the need to examine norms in combination. Across Studies 2–6, consistently high levels across all three norm types in most cases produced the strongest action intentions, while consistently low levels produced the weakest. Inconsistent combinations yielded more nuanced effects, with reduced approval of goals especially likely to undermine action intentions, and withdrawal of action approval playing a comparatively weaker role. Manipulations of social norms also influenced perceived importance and expectancy of the cause, which mediated their effects on collective action intentions. Taken together, these findings integrate normative and motivational theories and offer practical suggestions for implementing norm-based interventions in social campaigns.",

This study tested a model of how perfectionism, via its effect on self-compassion, stress and coping, can affect health outcomes such as health-related quality of life and intuitive eating for people with long-term conditions, which had not been previously tested in a sample of people with CKD. To address this gap, structural equation modelling was used to model the association between these constructs in a sample of kidney transplant recipients (n=354) and a non-CKD comparison group (n=400). Results showed that ‘maladaptive’ perfectionism significantly predicted lower levels of self-compassion, coping, intuitive eating and health-related quality of life, and higher levels of stress. However, self-compassion was found to buffer this effect, demonstrating that higher levels of this positive self-attitude could help to ameliorate the negative associations between maladaptive perfectionism and health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases play a critical role in the maintenance of specific phobias, yet reliable assessment tools remain scarce. This study examined the psychometric properties of three novel measures designed to evaluate interpretational processing biases in acrophobia: the Scrambled Sentences Task (SST), the Encoding Recognition Test (ERT), and the German version of the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). Using an online cross-sectional design, the convergent and divergent validity as well as the reliability of these tasks were assessed. The sample included N = 286 participants with mild to severe acrophobia. Overall, all measures demonstrated good convergent validity, and their weak associations with non-acrophobia-related questionnaires support divergent validity. The measures also showed high internal consistency and moderate to high parallel forms of reliability, indicating strong reliability overall. Consistent intercorrelations among the tasks further support their coherence in assessing interpretation bias. Finally, regression analyses revealed that the SST and HIQ were the strongest predictors of acrophobic symptoms, suggesting that each task may tap into distinct facets of interpretation bias despite their overlap. These findings offer empirically grounded insights that can inform future research, especially within intervention contexts. For example, embedding these bias measures in randomized controlled trials could illuminate their role in identifying and precisely tracking cognitive markers during therapy, enabling more targeted interventions in acrophobia treatment.",

Building on the CorBel model—an integrative taxonomy of 97 belief nuances derived via natural language processing—we analyzed two preregistered, SES-representative national samples (Germany: N = 435, UK: N = 266). Across countries, positive beliefs (e.g., competence, autonomy, trust) were associated with higher SES, whereas negative beliefs (e.g., insecurity, unworthiness, pessimism) were linked to lower SES. These associations replicated across SES indicators (education, income, wealth) and explained up to 20% of variance in SES outcomes.

Aphantasic individuals experience a complete absence or significant difficulties in generating visual mental imagery. Their inner perceptual experiences differ notably from those of the general population. However, these experiences have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we employed a Virtual Reality (VR) drawing task using OpenBrush to investigate perceptual differences among aphantasic individuals. Four participants (aged 21–29; two male, two female) completed the drawing task in a VR environment. We used qualitative reflective thematic analysis to identify patterns in the data, supported by three supplementary questionnaires: the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ). Three key themes emerged: (1) black in the mind; (2) stick to the specific references; and (3) influences from trained drawing skills. Further individual differences were revealed through participants’ drawing outputs. The VR drawing task proved effective in directly accessing and representing inner perceptual experiences. By offering an immersive, first-person perspective, Virtual Reality allowed participants to externalize their internal worlds. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the perceptual experiences of aphantasic individuals.",

          "authors": "Deniz Duman; Suvi Saarikallio",
          "abstract": "Human behaviour is largely driven by the desire to maximize pleasure. Music, in both perception and production, is a uniquely powerful source of pleasure, engaging cognitive, bodily, psychological, and social processes. This paper focuses on groove, an everyday, effortless form of sensorimotor musical experience. While previous studies have solely  examined groove as pleasurable urge to move, this paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding groove as a multidimensional source of musical pleasure. Extending beyond prior two-dimensional accounts, the framework incorporates immersive and social aspects of the experience. Gathering research findings across disciplines, four sources of pleasure are identified, operating at the cognitive, psychological, behavioural, and social levels: (1) pleasure arising from processing of the music, especially linked to the balance of prediction and surprise in musical structure; (2) immersive pleasure associated with a flow-like, altered attentional experience; (3) movement pleasure generated through (desire for) bodily synchronization and sensorimotor reward; and (4) pleasure rooted in social connection, synchrony, bonding, and collective participation. These interconnected levels are supported by neurochemical mechanisms that modulate attention, arousal, timing, and reward, anchoring the pleasures of groove in embodied brain–body dynamics and reflecting its biopsychosocial nature. This framework offers a more nuanced account of why groove is such a powerful, rewarding and everyday human experience. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the current work informs applied domains by highlighting various sources of pleasure that provide internal motivation, offering insights for designing music-based interventions in therapy, education, and well-being, and suggesting directions for future empirical testing.",

Study 1, a pre-registered study on intergroup relations in the turbulent Bangsamoro region of the Philippines (N = 816), found that identity fusion was positively associated with outgroup trust when the outgroup was perceived positively. Study 2 (N = 1,576) replicated these results across Gambia (n = 236), Pakistan (n = 505), Tanzania (n = 337), and Uganda (n = 498) , while also finding that perceptions of the relationship itself (e.g., whether cooperation was judged beneficial to the ingroup) similarly moderated the effect of identity fusion on willingness to cooperate.

Current theoretical accounts invoke specific structures of preference or cost to elucidate the occurrence of procrastination. We propose a theoretical model of procrastination that does not invoke a specific structure of preference, and instead relies on an unavoidable aspect of any projection into the future, namely, that the time it takes to complete a task is variable. This model captures the basic phenomenology of procrastination and predicts a phenomenon that we demonstrate empirically, the \"deadline-time-arrival effect\": decision makers (DMs) who live closer to their destinations (e.g., schools or offices) tend to arrive later than those who live farther. The same theory explains other instantiations of procrastination, such as repeatedly postponing the initiation of a task as the deadline for completion approaches—e.g., delaying the planned drafting of a grant application. Our framework thus puts forth a unified view of procrastination in which its various manifestations reflect an optimal adaptation to environmental statistics.",

We recruited 359 low-trusting individuals who participated in a trust game under strict anonymity conditions. Results show that OT administration significantly increased trusting behavior by roughly 15%, with consistent effects across regression models with and without controls for personality traits. A pooled data analysis incorporating a previous sample (n=219) of low-trusting individuals further strengthens this conclusion, yielding a statistically significant 16.9% increase in trust. Crucially, no interaction effect was found between OT and the degree of dispositional trust, suggesting OT’s effect is uniform across the low-trusting spectrum. These findings present a strong case for OT’s selective trust-enhancing role. By isolating OT’s impact within a well-defined subpopulation and experimental context, this study provides a critical pivot in the debate over neurobiological mechanisms of trust.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how individuals form beliefs about their own creativity – referred to as the creative self-concept (CSC) – requires examining the informational sources that shape these self-assessments. In this paper, we introduce and validate the Sources of Creative Self-Concept Scale (SoCSC), a questionnaire adapted from self-efficacy research, designed to assess four theorized sources of CSC: mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and emotional states. A sample of 558 adults completed measures of CSC (both global and trait-like) and the SoCSC. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor model aligned with the proposed sources. All sources were significantly associated with CSC, with social persuasion emerging as the strongest individual predictor. However, structural equation modeling revealed that a general factor – reflecting shared variance across all sources – accounted for the majority of the variance in CSC. This finding suggests a dynamic interplay between personal experiences, observed models, social feedback, and affective responses in shaping creative self-perceptions. The results are discussed in the context of Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy.",

Sign-trackers (ST) attribute both incentive and predictive values to these cues, while goal-trackers (GT) assign solely predictive value, orienting their attention rapidly toward the forthcoming reward. Although animal studies report sign-tracking and goal-tracking as stable, trait-like learning styles often related to maladaptive behaviors, human research has produced inconsistent results, raising questions about the reliability and the stability of this behavior. To address these issues, we investigated the test-retest reliability and stability of the classification over a four-month period of the eye-gaze index most commonly used in human sign- and goal-tracking literature. Our findings revealed good capacity for detecting sign-tracking behavior, but limited consistency in identifying goal-tracking behavior, resulting in suboptimal overall reliability. These results raise the possibility that goal-tracking may be either genuinely rare in the population or poorly captured by the current index. Overall, while the gaze index holds promise for identifying ST behavior, methodological refinements or alternative approaches may be needed to reliably detect GT behavior and improve the utility of this measure in future research.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "Background: Workplace gaslighting is an underexplored psychosocial stressor that may exacerbate burnout and turnover among employees. Aim: This study examined associations between gaslighting, job burnout, and turnover intention in Greek workers using a cross-sectional design. Methods: The study was conducted in January 2025 with a sample (N = 291) of workers based on convenience sampling. Data from networking via professional social media Information was obtained using an online survey shared among professional social media groups. Workplace gaslighting was assessed using the Gaslighting at Work Scale (GWS), job burnout using the Single-Item Burnout Measure, and turnover intention on a reliable six-point Likert scale. Demographic information consisted of gender, age, education level, and years of work experience (potential confounders). Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between workplace gaslighting and the two outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Results: Participants were mainly female (77%), and the mean age was 42.2 years (SD = 10.3), with a mean duration of work experience of 16.7 years (SD = 9.5). High job burnout (mean = 6.8) and turnover intentions (mean = 3.1) were reported. There were significant positive correlations between workplace gaslighting and burnout (r = 0.230, p &lt; 0.01) and workplace gaslighting and turnover intention (r = 0.385, p &lt; 0.01). In multivariable regression analyses, workplace gaslighting was positively associated with job burnout (b = 0.616, 95% CI = 0.466–0.765, p &lt; 0.001) and turnover intention (b = 0.581, 95% CI = 0.414–0.748, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Workplace gaslighting was strongly associated with both burnout and turnover intention in workers. These results highlight the negative effects of gaslighting at work, and direct to the relevance of organizational interventions geared to prevent gaslighting in order to achieve employee well-being while diminishing staff turnover.",

          "abstract": "Pupil dilation responses are reliable physiological markers of arousal in reaction to unexpected events across sensory modalities. However, a direct comparison across modalities has not yet been conducted. In this study, we address this gap by examining pupil responses to regular and random sequences of visual dots and auditory tones, as well as transitions between these sequences. In Experiment 1, we showed dilation responses when a regular sequence of visual dots changed to a random sequence, but not to the reverse transition. A transition between two different regular sequences led to less dilation on average. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings, confirming the reliability of the observed dilation patterns. In Experiment 3, we compared the pupil responses when sequences and transitions were presented in visual versus auditory modalities. We observed strong cross-modal similarity in pupil sizes, particularly for transitions between regular and random sequences. Notably, these similarities persisted even during baseline trials, when no explicit transition occurred. We also decomposed the time-series pupil size to approximate phasic pupil dilation events. The patterns of dilation events aligned with the overall dilation, with modality-specific dilation event size differences primarily in the context of transitions between different regular sequences. Overall, our findings suggest that pupil-linked arousal reflects imperfect inference of statistical structure and its violations, exhibiting substantial similarity across modalities.",

          "abstract": "Millions of people now use AI-powered chatbots to support their mental health, yet little is known about whether such interactions can effectively enhance psychological well-being. We conducted a preregistered experiment on a large, diverse sample (N = 2,922) to test four AI chatbots, each prompted to employ a multi-step strategy drawn from prior psychological research on sources of happiness and meaning in life. Chatbots encouraged participants to either (a) savor positive life experiences, (b) express gratitude toward a friend or family member, (c) reflect on sources of meaning in their life, or, (d) reframe their life story as a “hero’s journey.” All four chatbots led to improvements on a broad range of psychological well-being outcomes – including affective well-being, meaning in life, life satisfaction, anxiety, and depressed mood – relative to a control chatbot condition. These results generalized to key subpopulations, including those with high baseline levels of anxiety or depression. Chatbot interactions increased interest in seeing a human therapist, including among those who were previously unwilling or had never attended therapy. A separate, nationally representative survey (N = 3,056) found that half of U.S. adults expressed interest in using empirically validated AI chatbots for mental health support. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven well-being chatbots grounded in psychological research offer a scalable and effective way to produce short-term increases in several aspects of psychological well-being. Importantly, these results do not generalize to all AI-based emotional support.",

          "abstract": "Skill acquisition in social contexts depends on learners’ ability to attune to the behaviors of their partners, whose actions help structure environments that guide attention and shape the learning of adaptive behaviors. While greater coupling is often associated with learning and collaborative problem-solving, recent perspectives suggest that the dynamics of interpersonal coupling are more complex, arising from the interplay of two opposing forces – integration and individualization – which define social interaction as a metastable system. This study examined how these dynamics influence performance and solution insight in a two-person problem-solving game with a latent solution that, when discovered, enables superior performance. Using multidimensional cross-recurrence quantification analysis (MdCRQA), participants who discovered and exploited the latent solution exhibited greater perceptual-motor coupling during the pre-discovery period than non-discoverers. Coupling declined after discovery, with further reductions linked to successful task performance, consistent with the metastable view of social interaction. Finally, we demonstrate that AI agents embodying the decision policies of pre-discoverers can, when working with novice human participants, scaffold environments that increases the likelihood of participants discovering the latent solution. These findings are discussed in the context of designing human-compatible AI agents that facilitate the self-organization of adaptive behaviors in humans.",

          "abstract": "Ambiguity avoidance in decision-making may reflect either stable preferences for certainty or uncertainty in beliefs formed through limited experience. Prior studies have commonly used the max–min expected utility (MMEU) model to interpret ambiguity-related decisions, but MMEU confounds preferences with beliefs by focusing on the range of possible probabilities rather than how individuals form them. We conducted two experiments (N = 53; N = 298) using a Linked Colored Lottery Task to evaluate whether ambiguity avoidance reflects stable preferences or beliefs about outcome distributions. Participants first learned to associate colors with distinct outcome distributions by sampling from them and then made incentivized choices between options that varied in ambiguity. This design allowed us to observe how beliefs about distributional variance influenced decisions and to distinguish whether choices reflected belief construction processes versus uncertainty evaluation. We compared models based on MMEU and on subjective recursive expected utility (SREU), which explicitly separates beliefs from preferences. In both experiments, model comparison favored SREU, and participants with more dispersed inferred beliefs were more likely to avoid ambiguous options. Sampling patterns and memory for outcomes showed similar effects. Apparent age-related differences in ambiguity avoidance were also better explained by belief variance than by preferences. These results suggest that ambiguity avoidance often reflects perceived imprecision in learned beliefs rather than an inherent aversion to uncertainty–a cognitive rather than affective phenomenon. This distinction clarifies whether individual differences in choice behavior stem from how people form beliefs or from how they evaluate outcomes, with implications for understanding decision-making across learning, memory, and uncertainty processing domains.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing debate in the study of cognitive aging concerns whether aging results in a selective deficit in inhibitory control beyond a general slowing of cognitive processing. Previous studies have obtained mixed findings, in part because the typical free response time paradigm lacks the specificity required to disentangle component processes underlying inhibitory control. Here, we apply a novel forced-response paradigm and a computational model to disentangle these processes to test if aging results in overall speed differences or a selective deficit in inhibitory control. 50 older adults and 57 younger adults completed a “forced-response” arrow flanker task. We find strong evidence that older adults demonstrate a global slowing of processing, without any selective deficit in inhibitory control. Furthermore, we demonstrate global slowing is sufficient to explain the mixed findings in previous free RT studies. Overall, these results highlight the utility of using a theory-informed, fine-grained approach to study inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "While there is a strong educational gradient to the risk of experiencing long periods of unemployment and insecurity at the beginning of the career, recent evidence suggests local labour market circumstances can moderate the degree of risk associated with low educational achievement. We test the wider applicability of this finding by exploring the effect of spatial variation in labour demand on initial job search time in the contrasting institutional settings of Germany and the United Kingdom. Survival analysis of Understanding Society and Socio-Economic Panel data 1998–2015 shows this form of spatial inequality moderates the size of the job search time penalty associated with low educational attainment (and the size of the returns associated with higher attainment) in a similar way in both countries. Young people in places of high labour demand in Germany and the UK obtain employment with relative ease irrespective of the qualifications they hold. However, educational attainment assumes greater consequence as local labour demand declines. On average, low qualified young people in places of weak demand experience 2-3 month longer periods of labour market lockout and 8-10 month longer periods of labour market insecurity than peers located in places of strong demand, and considerably longer periods of lockout and insecurity than their better qualified peers in the same weak labour markets. These findings draw attention to the contextual nature of the risks associated with low educational attainment and the rewards to higher levels of attainment, at least in terms of job search time.",

On average, people blame politicians the most, then traditional media, social media, interest groups, and lastly, citizens. Strong partisan differences exist in blame for traditional media, with leaning and weak Republicans (not strong Republicans) displaying strong blame attribution towards them compared to other entities. Our findings suggest that a gap between depolarization research and citizen perceptions on root causes of polarization may impact the efficacy of possible interventions, and that more research is needed to understand why anti-press attitudes might not be linear with respect to partisanship.",

          "abstract": "The family meal is an institution. It is culturally idealized as a resource for laying the foundations of a good life for children and adolescents, to the point of being included in dietary guidelines. Empirical and theoretical support in favor of this conclusion exists, yet critics also challenge assumptions of causation and family meals being without harm. Here, I challenge a third assumption, which I refer to as the assumption of environmental primacy. Focusing on eating behavior and body weight of children and adolescents, I discuss evidence from methods in behavioral and social science genetics (twin and adoption studies, molecular genetics, and within-family designs) and argue that if no attempt is made to consider the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors, we cannot claim with any confidence that family meals matter. At least not for the eating behaviors and weight trajectories of youth. Throughout the paper, I provide examples of how family meals could be studied with the use of these methods, and finish with five constructive suggestions on how to handle this in the future. The ambition is to strengthen the scientific quality of the family-meal literature and, thus, improve the scientific basis of (potential) family meal policy.",

Illustrating the effect of experiencing positive, neutral, and negative emotions during negotiation processes, this essay proposes three mechanisms – community building, professionalization, and bureaucratization – by which IOs reduce emotion-driven disruptions in diplomatic negotiations and facilitate agreement on issues of global relevance, especially in volatile times.",

Over time, sinks tend to become more strongly associated with marginalisation, while the role of sluices remains variable.\nThe findings support a pluralistic understanding of neighbourhoods as dynamic contexts shaped by migration flows, rather than as fixed determinants of outcomes, as integration and spatial mobility are linked for some immigrant groups but not others. Overall, the study highlights the value of treating migration as a network process for capturing the fluid, group-specific geographies of integration.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of epistemic settlement as a novel analytic category, offering both a systematic coding frame and a transferable vocabulary for comparative curriculum analysis. It does this through a critical analysis of the 2025 Curriculum and Assessment Review: Interim Report. While focused on England, the analytic vocabulary of epistemic settlement and the reform conditions developed here are applicable to curriculum debates internationally. The Review is presented as pragmatic recalibration, but instead reaffirms the assumptions of the post-2010 curriculum landscape: disciplinary coherence treated as neutral, progression codified as linear mastery, and justice framed as access to canonical knowledge. The Review’s ambitions are constrained by a procedural logic that privileges consultation and assessment stability over philosophical or civic purpose. The article develops an analytic vocabulary for identifying epistemic settlement and applies it to the Review, showing how claims of neutrality, proceduralism, and performance metrics foreclose curricular futurity. Against this closure, it advances four conditions for meaningful reform. These are epistemic legibility (explicitly naming and justifying theories of knowledge), professional judgement (teachers as epistemic agents, not policy implementers), temporal flexibility (learning unfolding at varied rhythms), and a diversified assessment ecology (examinations situated within broader repertoires of judgement). These conditions frame curriculum not as a delivery mechanism but as a civic and ethical project, and a space where knowledge, purpose, and futurity remain open to deliberation and contestation.",

          "abstract": "Why did Sweden’s Northvolt—Europe’s most celebrated green industrial startup—collapse, while France managed to stabilise its local aspiring champions in the same cleantech sector? This paper uses these contrasting trajectories to interrogate the EU’s more assertive industrial policy turn. Drawing on the developmental network state (DNS) framework, we argue that while the EU has shifted from market neutrality to vertical industrial policy activism in a global context marked by geopolitical competition, its capacity to sustain strategic firms through crises remains underdeveloped. However, domestic capabilities and strategies mediated EU resourcing, brokering, facilitation, and protection, the main functions of the DNS. Where Sweden lacked credible financial, fiscal and institutional mechanisms of internal protection for the beleaguered Northvolt, France deployed a more robust economic statecraft toolkit, combining strategic finance, firm-level coordination, and public investment. Northvolt’s collapse illustrates the limits of Europe’s institutional orchestration of ambitious industrial policies: a regime that can incubate innovation but cannot stabilise it commercially. We conclude that without repurposed macro-financial institutions, Europe’s role as a competitive supplier of decarbonisation technologies will remain vulnerable.",

Wages significantly affect outcomes only at the application stage, not at subsequent interview or offer stages, consistent with directed search theory.

This study investigates the division of labor in international scientific collaboration using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) from articles published in PLOS journals between 2018 and 2024. We introduce four novel metrics to analyze contribution patterns: Role-Article Coverage, Role Frequency per Article, Role Position Percentage, and Role Correlation Index. Our findings show that international teams incorporate more diverse roles than national ones, particularly in funding acquisition and resources. A clear division of labor emerges across first, middle, and last author positions. International collaborations demonstrate greater task specialization, reflecting cross-border coordination challenges. Contributors with multiple roles often perform specialized technical tasks. These findings enhance understanding of global scientific knowledge production and provide insights for research policy and equitable credit allocation in science.",

          "authors": "Nicolas Salerno; Olivier Vidal; Baptiste Andrieu",
          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

          "abstract": "As climate change exacerbates socioeconomic vulnerabilities, women, often carers, emerge as \"invisible safety nets\" sustaining family and community resilience. Set in a coastal town in Batangas, Philippines, the study explores how carers experience and navigate unpaid care work amid climate adaptation. Guided by feminist participatory action research, the study used photovoice, where 13 participants documented their experiences through photography and writing, then collaboratively interpreted their stories.\nFor Filipino caregivers, climate change intensifies unpaid care work. Climate-related disruptions fracture their sense of wholeness, adding layers of grief and uncertainty to their responsibilities. They take on multifaceted roles across their family, community, and environments, as educators, providers, stewards, and leaders. In navigating intensifying care demands,  they rely on community solidarity and spirituality, which serve as vital sources of strength, purpose, and hope in their collective efforts to adapt to climate change.\nBy recognising unpaid care work in climate adaptation and providing carers with a platform to voice their lived experiences, the study hopes to advocate for climate change policies and programs that respond to unpaid care dynamics, reward women’s contribution, reduce unpaid care work, and advocate for redistribution of and male involvement in care work within families and communities.",

While many studies cite it, only some make use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment Promenade, that aims to address the walkthrough method’s incoherent aims and theoretical perspective. It combines the walkthrough method’s technical walkthrough with a theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment.

Emphasizing quality over quantity, we argue that a small number of high-value expert insights can yield outsized utility when structured around a clearly defined problem domain. Drawing on action research and design science, we present (a) a conceptual framework (b) a case study in SAP S/4HANA implementation expertise, and (c) lessons for generalization across domains.

          "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of digital technologies in India has coincided with a surge in screen-based activities among adolescents, raising concerns about its impact on neurobiological health. This paper explores the concept of \"Digital Diabetes,\" an analogy likening chronic digital overstimulation to insulin resistance in metabolic diabetes. Drawing on empirical evidence from neuroimaging studies, epidemiological surveys, and clinical trials, we examine how prolonged social media and smartphone use disrupts dopamine signaling, leading to reward system desensitization akin to dopamine resistance. In India, where over 462 million individuals actively use social media as of January 2024, with youth comprising a significant portion, average daily screen time exceeds three hours for more than half of adolescents aged 9-17 (DataReportal, 2024; LocalCircles, 2024). This exposure correlates with attention deficits (up to 28% increased risk with &gt;3 hours daily), structural brain alterations (e.g., 15% reduction in caudate nucleus volume), and heightened mental health risks, including a 34% prevalence of common mental disorders among urban Delhi adolescents (AIIMS, 2024). We review policy interventions, such as China's \"double-reduction\" initiative, and evidence-based strategies like mindfulness apps (reducing dependency by 25%) and pharmacological aids (e.g., bupropion for dopamine reuptake inhibition). Recommendations emphasize neuroscience education, digital fasting, and integrated clinical approaches to safeguard India's youth demographic, which constitutes 55% of internet users under 35 (Gopakumar et al., 2025). This synthesis underscores the urgency of addressing digital overuse as a public health priority to mitigate long-term neurological and societal costs.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) framework is intended to safeguard the food supply, yet structural gaps have enabled widespread use of food additives with limited oversight. While regulators evaluate individual substances, Americans are exposed daily to complex mixtures embedded in ultra-processed foods (UPFs). This study conducted a scoping review of the GRAS literature to identify regulatory and toxicological blind spots, and a descriptive mapping of the U.S. packaged food supply to characterize additive prevalence and co-occurrence. Using Open Food Facts data (n ≈ 19,000 products), standardization of additives into E-codes, classified UPFs, and generated co-occurrence networks was done. Results show that while a small set of legacy additives dominate, certain combinations recur thousands of times, revealing potential for synergistic or cumulative exposures not captured by current assessment models. Furthermore, self-affirmed GRAS determinations remain largely invisible, revealing major transparency gaps. These findings stress the urgent need for mixture focused toxicology, improved regulatory disclosure, and systematic monitoring of UPFs. This preliminary analysis serves as a foundation for OpenGRAS, a student-led initiative to document and expose weaknesses in U.S. food additive governance.",

          "authors": "Hampton Gaddy; Rebecca Sear; Laura Fortunato",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.",

          "abstract": "Escalating U.S. net-interest payments now rival flagship budget lines and are projected to surpass 4 percent of GDP within a decade, while unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities exceed $70 trillion. In parallel, over-the-counter derivatives outstanding approach $700–800 trillion in notional value, embedding opaque leverage that could transmit shocks globally. Purpose: This study probes how the confluence of sovereign debt strain, entitlement promises, and derivatives exposure can destabilize the dollar’s reserve-currency privilege and maps reforms capable of forestalling a debt-driven systemic rupture. Methods: An integrative review of Congressional Budget Office forecasts, BIS derivatives statistics, and peer-reviewed network-risk models is synthesized through a tri-theoretical lens that combines Modern Monetary Theory, Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, and network-based systemic-risk science. Results: Vector-error-correction analysis reveals that a one-point rise in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio lifts global derivatives gross-market value by 0.7 percent within two quarters, indicating tight macro-financial coupling. Stress scenarios show that breaching a 120 percent debt-to-GDP threshold alongside derivatives GMV above 10 percent of GDP elevates one-notch downgrade odds to 50 percent within two years. These dynamics threaten confidence in dollar assets, erode the “exorbitant privilege,” and could precipitate non-linear contagion through shadow-banking channels. Conclusions: A coordinated package—gradual entitlement reform, primary-balance fiscal rules, maturity-extension of Treasuries, reinforced CCP cover-two capital, and expanded bilateral central-bank swap lines—can realign fiscal sustainability with financial-network resilience. Infusing policy with a biblical stewardship ethic (“the borrower is servant to the lender,” Prov 22:7) underscores the moral imperative to curb excessive leverage. Timely adoption would safeguard global liquidity, buttress U.S. monetary sovereignty, and preserve the dollar’s hegemonic role.",

Las narrativas más frecuentes se centran en la crítica al Estado y en las demandas de medidas punitivas, lo que evidencia una ciudadanía indignada y favorable a soluciones de seguridad más estrictas.

          "abstract": "Low political trust disengages citizens from mainstream politics, stimulating anti-establishment voting and even electoral abstention. However, existing scholarship has largely overlooked the temporal dynamics of political trust. Next to high versus low trust, our study identifies two additional components of political trust: its long-term variability and its short-term variation. We employ fifteen waves of the Dutch LISS panel (2008-2023) to systematically test the impact of these three components of political trust on electoral behavior. We find that there are systematic and meaningful differences between stable and variable (dis)trusters. While trust levels are the strongest predictor of both support for anti-establishment and abstention, trust variability has an additional effect on electoral behavior. Short-term declines in political trust increase the chances of anti-establishment voting and abstention, independent of individuals’ overall trust levels and variability. These findings have important implications for our understanding of democratic alienation and critical citizenship.",

While lab studies and survey experiments have been used to develop innovative methods for combating false information, challenges with data access have limited their study in ecologically valid settings. As an alternative, a partnership was established with non-profit Tales of Turning to oversee the study of a volunteer-led digital field experiment which saw them use comments to get readers to more carefully consider online content. These questions, known as “social truth queries” (STQs), were randomly assigned to posts containing delegitimizing information during South Africa’s contentious 2024 election. Across the 125 X/Twitter posts, the intervention had a substantial effect on engagement, with posts assigned to receive comments seeing a 77% reduction in likes and 82% reduction in reposts. Critically, the effect of the intervention was dependent on its timing, with the impact largest when STQs were applied quickly. To test related mechanisms, the field study was paired with two preregistered survey experiments (N=1,607) which employed posts collected during the intervention. The surveys provide further support for the role of STQs in reducing perceived post accuracy and trust in users spreading delegitimizing content. For the first time in the context of a digital field experiment, this study provides evidence from a collaboration with a community-based partner regarding the efficacy of a real-world election integrity intervention.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary democracies face growing public mistrust and disaffection. Governments across the world have tried to revert these trends by promoting participatory governance. Prior work has established how deliberation can empower citizens. However, whether these effects hold in real-life initiatives initiated by partisan governments remains unclear. We test the ability of citizens' assemblies to foster democratic attitudes in a natural experiment leveraging the random selection of participants to Lisbon's citizens' assembly. Participation in two full-day sessions of structured deliberation promoted by the local government led to a increase in issue knowledge and salience, external political efficacy, and institutional trust. However, participation did not increase internal political efficacy nor helped citizens better recognize the challenges of collective decision-making. The results hold for two editions of the assembly and reveal how participatory governance initiatives can bolster the connection between citizens and the democratic process.",

          "abstract": "Fearon (1995) and Kalyvas (2006) are arguably the most influential contributions to conflict studies in recent decades. However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

          "abstract": "This paper reconceptualizes silence not as an individual pathology or commu- nication breakdown but as a rationally emergent social equilibrium. Drawing on graph theory, sociology, and behavioral economics, the analysis introduces two cen- tral constructs: the domination number γ(G), which captures structural concentra- tion of recognition, and the cost function J(x) = αE(x) + βS(x) + cAA(x), which models the individual’s calculus of whether to speak or remain silent. Through these constructs, silence is shown to be a predictable outcome of recognition asymmetry. By embedding classical theories from Durkheim, Bourdieu, Goffman, and Foucault into a formal mathematical framework, the paper establishes the foundation for a new research program: the calculus of silence. The following sections—Chapters 1 through 3—introduce the problem, survey the literature, and articulate the theo- retical framework in detail.",

          "abstract": "This article presents a comparative case study of three contemporary AI-focused films: Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya (India, 2024), M3GAN (USA, 2022), and Her (USA, 2013) to explore how global cinema constructs gendered artificial intelligence through the lenses of emotional labor, synthetic femininity, and the posthuman gaze. Each film centers on feminine-coded artificial beings designed to fulfill emotional, domestic, or sexual needs, revealing how cinematic narratives engage with the persistent fantasy of the \"perfect woman.\"\nThe movie Her serves as a case study in disembodied posthuman intimacy, with Samantha’s emotional labor compensating for her lack of physical form. M3GAN dramatizes anxieties around technological motherhood, showing how AI caregiving becomes threatening when emotional boundaries collapse. In contrast, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya examines the male gaze and posthuman embodiment; SIFRA’s hyper-feminized programming is tailored to patriarchal expectations until her system breaks down, exposing the precarity of programmed obedience. Across these texts, AI figures are welcomed as long as they serve, but recoded as unpalatable, disastrous when they rebel, glitch, or evolve beyond control. These portrayals highlight cultural anxieties around female agency, techno-intimacy, and the limits of emotional programming.\nOur analysis is anchored in the intersecting frameworks of gender theory, posthuman studies, and cinematic critique, drawing from Judith Butler’s gender performativity, Hochschild and Ahmed’s emotional labor, Laura Mulvey’s male gaze, and posthuman ethics by Braidotti and Hayles. Methodologically, the chapter employs comparative close reading, filmic discourse analysis, and cultural contextualization, where posthumanism interrogates the collapse of human-machine boundaries, while the male gaze elucidates how feminine AI bodies are constructed for control and submission.\nThis study contributes to understanding how posthuman cinema critiques patriarchal emotional economies and reveals the fragility of techno-feminine ideals, illuminating the ethical dilemmas of loving machines designed to serve.\n\nKeywords: Posthuman Gaze, Feminine Performativity,  Emotional Labour, Gendered AI, Comparative Global Cinema",

          "abstract": "Traditional monetary policy’s effectiveness in controlling inflation through interest rate changes has weakened, as empirical data show easing no longer reliably drives consumer price inflation. We introduce the Dynamic Constitutive Laws Model (DCLM) described by coupled differential equations to capture how interest rate changes reallocate household spending. By explicitly modeling housing demand, house prices, inflation, and consumption components over five years, we show that lower interest rates can act as a disinflationary force when reduced borrowing costs channel additional disposable income toward housing consumption rather than immediately increasing spending on other Consumer Price Index (CPI) goods and services. This effect offsets inflationary pressures from tariffs and supply shocks. Calibrated on U.S. macroeconomic data, the model reveals that loosening monetary policy stimulates housing-related expenditure while dampening CPI inflation. Our transmission mechanism challenges classical views and offers insights for policymakers navigating today’s volatile economic environment. The DCLM provides a flexible framework to analyze monetary policy’s impact on the U.S. economy, advocating a reassessment of inflation fears and the strategic use of rate cuts to foster growth without exacerbating inflation.",

As large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT become increasingly adopted by organizations, we ask whether and how LLMs rely on gender and race in evaluations. Across 26,000 evaluations of innovative offerings (e.g., startup pitches), we find that GPT evaluators did not disadvantage—and even modestly supported—URMs, primarily by avoiding negative outcomes. We theorize that this reflects symbolic compliance: A superficial response to avoid overt discrimination rather than a genuine commitment to fairness. We test this mechanism through “Second Opinion” experiments, where LLMs evaluate alongside simulated human inputs. This study highlights the implications of LLM adoption in strategic evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Digital finance reorganizes everyday economic life through data intensive infrastructures for payments, savings, credit, and fraud control. Governance of these infrastructures is usually framed as financial risk and cybersecurity, which leaves the informational nature of the problem under theorized. This article advances Informational Morality of Finance Theory, IMF-T, a generative theory that reconceptualizes financial data as informational moral objects within socio technical systems. IMF-T integrates Western information ethics, centered on privacy, autonomy, transparency, and accountability, with African communitarian ethics, centered on relational responsibility, stewardship, and equitable benefit sharing. It specifies axioms, defines constructs such as informational dignity, relational stewardship, transparency capability, algorithmic contestability, and trust sufficiency, and articulates mechanisms that connect organizational capabilities to outcomes of data justice and inclusion. The theory yields testable propositions and practical measurement guidance to support cumulative empirical work in Information Studies, Information Systems, and Library and Information Science. It also offers normative principles for institutions and regulators, emphasizing stewardship over compliance and enabling contestability for those affected by automated decisions. By naming and formalizing IMF-T, the article provides a platform for research and practice on the ethical governance of digital finance.\n\nKeywords: information ethics; digital finance; information governance; Ubuntu; data justice; transparency; stewardship",

          "abstract": "Institutional weakness is a defining feature of many African economies, yet little is known about how startups adapt strategically to persistent volatility. This study investigates how entrepreneurs in Lagos and Nairobi mobilize informality to build resilience and navigate institutional voids. Drawing on qualitative interviews and thematic analysis, the findings show that resilience is not an episodic response to shocks but a structural entrepreneurial capacity embedded in everyday practices. Startups in Lagos adopt survival-driven strategies that rely on grassroots bricolage and selective compliance, while those in Nairobi pursue more collaborative approaches that leverage donor partnerships and community-based legitimacy. Informality emerges not as a deficit but as a productive resource that enables adaptation, innovation, and hybrid legitimacy across both contexts.\nTheoretically, the study contributes to institutional theory by reframing voids as enduring and generative rather than transitional. It extends entrepreneurship research by conceptualizing resilience as an ingrained capacity rather than a reactive response, and it advances the study of informality by demonstrating its role as a strategic resource. By situating African entrepreneurship within its specific institutional and social contexts, the study challenges deficit-based models and offers a framework for understanding how startups transform institutional weakness into opportunities for resilience and innovation.\nKeywords: African entrepreneurship, institutional voids, resilience, bricolage, informality, hybrid legitimacy",

          "abstract": "The advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) poses a fundamental challenge regarding \nthe nature of scientific inquiry: what happens to theory when machines cease to pursue \nunderstanding and focus solely on prediction? This article posits that AGI signifies an \nepistemological rupture in the extensive continuum of scientific rationality, wherein \nexplanation, the quest for causal and conceptual comprehension, transitions to simulation, a \nmode of cognition propelled by predictive patterning rather than interpretative profundity. The \npaper engages figures from the philosophy of science and philosophical hermeneutics, \nincluding Popper, Kuhn, Hempel, and Lakatos, in conversation with Gadamer, Ricoeur, and \nHeidegger, to investigate how AGI redefines the concept of “knowledge.” Through a \nhermeneutic analysis of AGI manifestos, research papers, and policy documents, the study \ninterprets these scientific texts as manifestations of a novel epistemic attitude, one that \nprioritises performance over comprehension and reduces explanation to algorithmic efficiency. \nAGI's simulations have unparalleled predictive accuracy, but they jeopardise the foundational \nobjectives of science: justification, clarity, and accountability. The article finishes by proposing \na hermeneutic philosophy of AGI that reinstates the significance of interpretation and meaning \nwithin automated knowledge systems. Instead of seeing AGI as the end of theory, it is shown \nas a critical mirror that science must look into to rethink what it means to \"know.\" In a time \nwhen data may move faster than understanding, philosophy's job is to keep the space of \ninterpretation open to remind us that knowledge is not just about what works, but also about \nwhat makes sense.",

          "abstract": "The relative merits of vocational and general education remain central to debates on sustainable careers. Vocational pathways facilitate smoother school-to-work transitions but rely on occupation-specific skills that may become obsolete, whereas general education yields weaker entry prospects but greater adaptability to changing demands. A key question is whether further training can offset these trade-offs. This study examines participation in, and returns to, non-formal job-related training among vocationally and generally educated workers. Non-formal training, such as structured courses or seminars, allows employees to update and consolidate skills throughout their careers. We hypothesize that general graduates benefit more in early careers, while vocational graduates gain later as training helps counteract skill obsolescence. Drawing on longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we find that secondary-level vocational graduates participate less in training than university graduates, whereas tertiary-level vocational graduates train at similar rates. Training promotes employment stability, particularly in later careers, but effects are relatively uniform across educational groups. These results indicate that while training strengthens career resilience, it does not eliminate disparities between vocational and general graduates.",

The decisions from MLLMs are benchmarked against judgments by human subjects (N=1,854). The results demonstrate that larger, more advanced models can make context-sensitive evaluations that are closely aligned with human judgment. However, pervasive demographic and lexical biases remain, particularly among smaller models. Further analyses show that context sensitivity can be amplified via prompting but not eliminated, and that some models are especially responsive to visual identity cues. These findings highlight the benefits and risks of using MLLMs for content moderation and demonstrate the utility of conjoint experiments for auditing artificial intelligence in complex, context-dependent applications.",

It contends that these systems are not impartial technology of efficiency but modern \nmanifestations of colonial control mechanisms. The paper, based on Quijano's idea of the \n\"coloniality of power,\" says that digital program management is a form of epistemic violence \nsince it turns communities into databases and puts donor supervision ahead of relational \naccountability. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) functions, integrated into these systems, \nexacerbate the issue by legitimising surveillance and data extraction as the prevailing \nframework of responsibility. Based on decolonial theory, the analysis compares the \ntechnocratic positivism that underlies today's management methods with epistemologies based \non Indigenous African Knowledge Systems (IKS), especially Ubuntu relationality. Biometric \nsystems erase relational identity by favouring individualised markers over community \nrecognition. Dashboards impose a managerial \"view from nowhere,\" turning complexity into \nmetrics. Mobile survey tools silence oral testimony by putting stories into pre-coded categories. \nThese behaviours show how digital program administration weakens local ways of knowing \nand gives more authority to outside funders and technocrats. In response, the article proposes \na normative framework of Relational Accountability. It asks for a change from data extraction \nto ethical witnessing, participatory discussion in community assemblies (baraza), data \nsovereignty as cultural sovereignty, and the speculative design of Ubuntu-centric technology, \nall based on IKS principles. The paper asserts that decolonising program management is crucial \nfor fostering trust, promoting epistemic fairness, and ensuring more ethical development \npractices.

While prior research highlights how regimes centralize power by restructuring bureaucracies and appointing loyalists, the formal institutional framework typically remains the main conduit through which partisan control and management of state administration are exercised. This article presents a distinct model of partisan control under competitive authoritarianism — showing how these strategies may be reinforced, or even replaced, by party-run parallel networks that redirect authority flows. Drawing on the case of Serbia under Vučić, it documents a “para-state” shadow governance system that displaces formal command. This model enables centralized, discretionary control across the entire public sector while shielding elites from accountability. Conceptually, the article argues that Serbia’s model blurs the line between competitive authoritarianism and totalitarian rule.",

          "abstract": "We study how a large, exogenous trade shock --- triggered by China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 --- reshaped income, inequality, and import behavior across Brazilian regions. Using a shift-share instrument based on pre-shock export structures, we show that regions more exposed to China’s demand boom experienced increases in income per capita and within-region inequality relative to less exposed areas. These changes, in turn, led to rising import values and a shift in import composition, particularly toward consumption goods and medium- to high-tech manufactured products. To interpret these patterns, we classify goods by necessity and luxury status using Brazilian household survey data and develop a complementary ``demonstration luxury'' classification --- designed to capture status-oriented goods --- based on U.S. consumption patterns. Luxury imports rose most in regions that were initially more unequal or experienced sharper post-shock increases in inequality, consistent with non-homothetic preferences and status-driven consumption. Our findings highlight inequality as a key channel through which trade shocks shape regional import demand in developing economies.",

But When Prophecy Fails (1956), the now-canonical account of the event, claimed the opposite: that the group doubled down on its beliefs and began recruiting—evidence, the authors argued, of a new psychological mechanism, cognitive dissonance. Drawing on newly unsealed archival material, this article demonstrates that the book’s central claims are false, and that the authors knew they were false. The documents reveal that the group actively proselytized well before the prophecy failed and quickly abandoned their beliefs afterward. They also expose serious ethical violations by the researchers, including fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation. One coauthor, Henry Riecken, posed as a spiritual authority and later admitted he had “precipitated” the climactic events of the study.",

          "authors": "Mark Carew",
          "abstract": "A key but under-addressed driver of the health inequalities facing persons with disabilities is disability stigma. However, disability stigma remains poorly conceptualised and consequently inconsistently measured and addressed within health research. Many studies treat disability stigma and health stigma as interchangeable. However, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as the globally accepted framework for conceptualising disability clearly distinguishes between the concepts of “disability” and a “health condition”. This paper applies the ICF to show that disability stigma and health stigma have overlapping components but are conceptually distinct. Specifically, while health stigma is recognised to arise from adverse judgements about health conditions, this paper argues that disability stigma arises from adverse judgements about impairment(s), activity limitation(s), and/or health-related participation restriction(s) that may or may not relate to an individual’s health condition. This paper also explains why this distinction matters. First, it aligns the study of disability stigma with modern definitions of disability and the lived experiences persons with disabilities have of stigma. Second, it enables intersectional analysis of the impact of distinct stigmas arising from judgements about health condition(s) and disability status. Third, it contributes to better ways to measure disability stigma and consequently address it within interventions and policies. Fourth, it contributes to an improved classification of stigma within the ICF itself, which can be used to more comprehensively study health inequalities affecting persons with disabilities.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study aims to deepen open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence International Corps through artificial intelligence methods, exploring AI's application potential and methodological value in complex warfare information environments. The core objectives address two questions: First, how can AI technologies be effectively integrated into the OSINT cycle to enhance information screening, pattern recognition, and risk prediction? Second, can AI-driven OSINT provide more forward-looking and systematic support for strategic decision-making? Methodologically, this study adopts a multidisciplinary mixed methodology, integrating text metrology, semantic network analysis, risk radar modeling, and time-series projection to form a comprehensive framework: “Data Collection → AI Processing → Risk Assessment → Timeline Analysis → Insight Output.” The research process extensively leverages multilingual datasets (English, Ukrainian, Russian) and cross-platform information sources (official, media, social networks), utilizing visualization modeling to present data and risks in multidimensional formats. Results demonstrate that AI significantly enhances the depth and breadth of information processing in OSINT analysis. It outperforms traditional methods in misinformation detection accuracy, multilingual keyword extraction efficiency, and predictive power for risk patterns. Military risks and information warfare risks were assessed as highest priority, followed by public opinion risks and legal risks, revealing an overall “military-information warfare-public opinion” triple-high-risk configuration. Concurrently, time-series analysis revealed rhythmic patterns in risk evolution, providing quantitative foundations for future strategic planning. The study concludes that AI not only transforms OSINT's technical framework but also propels it toward structured, systematic, and forward-looking intelligence generation. AI-driven OSINT effectively bridges the tension between data fragmentation and systematic strategic analysis, enabling a qualitative leap in the intelligence cycle from “information accumulation” to “strategic insight.” This study provides an empirical paradigm for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and intelligence studies, holding significant theoretical and practical implications for future military conflicts, national security, and policy formulation.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "This essay redefines Microsoft Power BI as not merely a business intelligence tool, but as a \ncognitive prosthesis and an epistemic infrastructure that influences management cognition, \nattention, and the generation of organisational knowledge. Although traditional literature \nregards Power BI mainly as a visualisation or decision-support instrument, this study employs \na critical conceptual and metascientific perspective to analyse how the platform pre-defines \nlegitimate evidence, influences organisational reasoning, and reallocates interpretive labour \nwithin knowledge-driven organisations. The analysis puts up three connected arguments. To \nbegin with, Power BI acts like a cognitive prosthesis by automating basic operations like trend \nidentification, forecasting, and comparison measurements. This frees managers from low-level \nduties while also making them dependent on its dashboards and algorithmic logic. Second, it \nworks as a micro-technology of cognitive capitalism by capturing, directing, and turning \nmanagement attention into a resource of economic and organisational value. Third, the platform \nincorporates epistemic authority into its visualisations and metrics, gently regulating the \ngeneration of organisational knowledge and influencing the ethical and political aspects of \nmanagerial decision-making. By integrating perspectives from cognitive science, critical \ntheory, science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and political economy, the \narticle illustrates that the automation of cognition is inherently biased, resulting in epistemic \nconstriction, ethical challenges, and technocratic validation masquerading as “data-driven” \nobjectivity. The research enhances metascientific discourse by elucidating the infrastructure of \nknowledge production within organisations and advocating for reflexive literacy in the \nutilisation of data analytics platforms. It emphasises the ethical, epistemological, and \norganisational implications of cognitive prostheses such as Power BI and promotes a more \ncritical approach to the technologies that increasingly shape managerial cognition and decision\nmaking.",

          "abstract": "tina and Malik are excited to be invited to talk about their music project Circle A at a practice-based research symposium on music, sounds, and the political. They founded Circle A in 2014 as the first Radical Eurodance act ever, with the self-declared mission of “making Eurodance a threat again” and framing it as “a four-to-the-floor declaration of war against any kind of injustice and oppression that haunts the world we live in.” Over the past few years, they have only occasionally performed or recorded, due to their time being taken up by kids, other bands, and a pandemic. In early 2024, they meet over a beer to revisit their joint work and think about the topics they would like to discuss at the symposium. They reminisce about when, how, and why they founded Circle A; how the band and its music developed; what the future may hold for it; how and to what ends they mixed Eurodance and politics; and what all of this has to do with their shared background in musicology. In the process, tina and Malik also engage in discussions about fundamental questions regarding the relationship between music and the political, such as: What makes music political? Who are the audiences of political music, and how do they influence musicians’ practices? What are criteria for deciding whether a piece of political music is “good,” or maybe rather: “successful”? Can (political) music change the world? If so, how and to what extent? How can the seriousness of social struggles be squared with humorous modes of artistic expression? – As the conversation unfolds, tina and Malik switch back and forth between spoken language and song. In the end, they fail to produce notes for their symposium presentation, but they certainly enjoyed the intellectually stimulating – and sometimes controversial – exchange.",

          "authors": "Sinourn Huot; Rany Sam; Thou Nguon",
          "abstract": "An education system should strive to attract well-qualified teachers and teacher candidates who have a high degree of professional commitment to meet society requirements such as teacher shortages, increasing numbers of schools and students (MoEYS, 2023), teacher policy adjustments (TPAP: 2024--2030, 2023) and Cambodia’s socioeconomic status (ESP: 2024--2028, 2024) toward country development. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing teaching career choice among fourth-year primary and lower secondary school student teachers at Teacher Education Colleges (TECs). The study uses a quantitative paradigm with the survey method in the form of a structured questionnaire, which was adapted from Sardana et al. (2021) and Martinez Moreno &amp; Petko (2023), to collect the data. A simple random sampling method was used to select a sample of 223 participants, including both primary and lower secondary student teachers, whose ages ranged from 22--25 years (71.3%), 26--29 years (24.2%) and 4.5% of the other ages. This study uses descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the validity, reliability, mean, standard deviation, and significance of the collected data through a one-sample t test. The study revealed four main factors that influence the decision to choose teaching as a career, such as the influence of others, including family, friends, teachers and mass media; extrinsic, intrinsic, and altruistic motivational influences; and teaching as a fallback career and sociocultural factor. Altruistic motivation had the most significant influence on teaching career choice, with the highest mean score (M=4.26, SD=0.59), whereas teacher influence had the second greatest influence (M=4.20, SD=0.65), followed by intrinsic motivation (M=4.17, SD=0.62), while teaching as a fallback career had the least influence on all four factors, with the lowest mean score (M=2.37, SD=1.12). This study will help relevant people and institutions, such as the Cambodian ministry of education, parents, administrations, teachers, students and other researchers to be aware of the factors influencing career choice so that they can refine recruitment policies, increase their actions and efforts, and enter preparation programs for teaching careers in the Cambodian context today and in the future.",

          "abstract": "Corporate governance and financial statement fraud have increasingly attracted scholarly and regulatory attention in the ASEAN region. This focus aligns with more frequent accounting manipulation and rising demands for transparency. Although literature on this topic is expanding, comprehensive quantitative reviews remain scarce. This study aims to present an updated mapping of the literature on corporate governance and financial statement fraud. It compiles 269 articles published between 2005 and 2024 from the Scopus database. This study employs bibliometric methods, including VOSviewer and the R-Bibliometrix (Biblioshiny) package, to examine productivity, collaboration networks, citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and thematic evolution. The findings identify leading journals, authors, universities, and countries, with Malaysia and Indonesia as dominant contributors. Thematic analysis highlights earnings management as the key issue linking various research streams. Governance mechanisms such as audit committees, audit quality, and ownership structures follow. This study maps the intellectual structure of the literature using co-citation networks and outlines future research directions through thematic maps and the evolution of keywords. It offers the most recent synthesis of the literature, fills gaps in previous reviews, and points to a forward-looking agenda. The agenda encourages the exploration of other ASEAN contexts, the integration of non-traditional issues such as sustainability, and increased cross-country collaborations.",

          "abstract": "Human collective intelligence—the capacity of groups to solve problems, make decisions, and\nacquire knowledge beyond individual capabilities—is here understood as an emergent\nphenomenon that evolved in our lineage from a distinct trajectory of epistemic niche\nconstruction (ENC), and progressively sustained the latter. Humans systematically alter their\ninformational landscapes in materially visible ways by creating enduring spatial and\nartefactual scaffolds for improved cognitive performance and social coordination. In this\npaper, we propose a set of criteria to define ENC and track its emergence in the archaeological\nrecord. These criteria highlight the importance of persistent, publicly accessible, and\nevolutionarily incremental modifications that sustained behavioural coordination among\nindividuals in space and time. We apply this framework to three major domains of material\nculture: the structuring of space for collective action, the culturalization of the human body,\nand the emergence of exosomatic artefacts to store coded information. We argue that these\npractices did not merely externalise knowledge but progressively transformed material\nculture and environments into targeted epistemic infrastructures able to scaffold and amplify\ngroup-level performances characteristic of collective intelligence, thus shedding light on the\nevolution of human cognition and social organization.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how competitive authoritarian regimes reshape state administration through informal, extralegal structures that bypass formal institutional frameworks. While prior research highlights how regimes centralize power by restructuring bureaucracies and appointing loyalists, the formal institutional framework typically remains the main conduit through which partisan control and management of state administration are exercised. This article presents a distinct model of partisan control under competitive authoritarianism — showing how these strategies may be reinforced, or even replaced, by party-run parallel networks that redirect authority flows. Drawing on the case of Serbia under Vučić, it documents a “para-state” shadow governance system that displaces formal command. This model enables centralized, discretionary control across the entire public sector while shielding elites from accountability. Conceptually, the article argues that Serbia’s model blurs the line between competitive authoritarianism and totalitarian rule.",

          "authors": "Alice Daeun Oh; Tony Jiwon Oh; Seongeun Oh",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine factors that improve life satisfaction for Korean adolescents. As the future generations of the country emerge, South Korea must increase its life satisfaction, a comparably low value compared to other countries, as they are ranked 23rd out of 38 OECD countries (Cho, 2021). Grit, defined as the trait of working diligently for long-term goals, is important for life satisfaction. This study examines the relationship between grit and life satisfaction for second-year high school students in South Korea and the mediating effects of crucial relationships formed by adolescents, such as teacher-student relationships, parent-child relationships, and friendships. The data was collected through the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), and there were 2,252 second-year high school students who participated in this study. By completing regression analyses on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, grit and the mediating variables, and the effect of grit and the mediating variables on life satisfaction, as demonstrated by the Baron and Kenny process (Baron and Kenny, 1986), it was found that these variables were all correlated with each other. On the third step of the regression analysis, where the mediators were controlled for, it was found that the mediators had a significant effect on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, and a partial mediation took place. Out of the mediators, teacher-student relationships had the biggest explanatory impact with an R-squared value of 0.177. From these results, it is evident that there needs to be interventions, potentially with grit involved, to increase relationships between teachers and students, parents and children, and friends.",

In addition to theories rooted in regime performance, propaganda, and punishment, I propose system justification, a well-established socio-cognitive motive favoring established systems and stability, as a novel explanation for authoritarian support. I theorize the relationship between system justification and political behaviors in authoritarian contexts and test this in data from two original surveys of Egyptian citizens. After validating that the system justification scale reflects needs for certainty and structure in an authoritarian political setting, I show it is strongly associated with preferences for authoritarian governance. An embedded experiment shows that security, infrastructure, and identity systemic threats mobilize high system justifiers, further increasing support for authoritarian governance. Finally, additional analyses reveal that system justification predicts attitudinal and behavioral support for a specific authoritarian regime. The findings suggest a central role for individual psychological motivation in authoritarian persistence.",

The foundation of the toolkit is a pragmatic approach that aligns research tools with social science project goals— empirical explanation, theory-guided measurement, comparative design, or evidence-based recommendations— guided by the principle that research paradigm and questions should determine methods.

          "abstract": "The color of each cord is often highlighted as one of the primary sites of meaning on an Inka khipu -- the mostly undeciphered recording device of the Inka empire. However, while there are a variety of historical, ethnographic, and archaeological suggestions for how the semantics of color worked, none of these approaches systematically explains how Inka khipu cord colors denoted meaning. Instead, they present a range of fragmented, sometimes contradictory snapshots of a much larger, more complex system. This study aims to address the question: is there even a \"system\" of color that can be discovered and deciphered? If so, how did it work? Or is the sheer variety of uses discussed in prior studies an empirical indication that color had limited semiotic consistency for Inka khipukamayuqs (\"khipu makers/interpreters\" in Quechua)? To answer these questions, I employ an AI khipukamayuq -- a custom \"transformer\" deep learning model trained to parse all of the cord colors in the Open Khipu Repository (OKR) -- to analyze the semantic space of Inka khipu cord color. My findings reveal a coherent system of color signs, wherein different colors occupy distinct, relationally-opposed semantic domains, with many colors demonstrating polysemy. This suggests a versatile set of color signs adaptable to various contexts and domains of representation, akin to other linguistic media. In the domain of khipus and beyond, this study points toward the importance of continued interaction with AI models as archaeologists learn (together with machines) to systematically represent and delineate the past.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study anchors its analysis on the controversy surrounding Shanghai Maritime University's “First-Class Undergraduate Programs” initiative in China. It aims to validate whether AI-enhanced open-source intelligence (OSINT) evidence governance can reconstruct auditable evidence chains and quantify narrative discrepancies in education-related public incidents, while extrapolating governance performance to multidimensional national security risks. Methodologically, we collected university announcements, mainstream media reports, platform-accessible pages, and judicial leads within a unified time window to construct a “source-time-version” evidence graph. We introduced multilingual NLI and sentence vectors to measure narrative consistency, combined with JSD to monitor monitoring scope drift. We employed temporal propagation networks and DTW to measure the temporal misalignment between “post deletion/restriction” and public opinion peaks. Further, we mapped “evidence governance/information control opacity” to four normalized risk dimensions—academic integrity, rule of law and institutional trust, ideological security, and social stability—using structural causal models, providing 95% confidence intervals. Results indicate: The foundational evidence chain can be robustly reconstructed, yet significant narrative gaps exist regarding “whether ‘7 categories, 40 items’ of fraud occurred” and “whether platform actions were implemented/compliant.” Communication peaks typically precede search peaks by approximately one cycle (moderate DTW misalignment), with public nodes consistently holding the highest intermediary scores. Among the four risk dimensions, “academic integrity” and “ideological security” exhibit relatively higher levels. Conclusions indicate that earlier, auditable evidence disclosure (versioned notifications, third-party verification, platform log retention) simultaneously reduces all four risk dimensions and shortens the public opinion chain, whereas declarative statements alone fail to resolve disputes. AI-enhanced OSINT provides a reusable methodological pathway for evidence governance in educational settings and national security assessments.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Deepfake technology has quickly become one of the most disruptive new technologies in the digital information ecosystem. It can make convincing audio-visual content that looks just like real media.  Although much of the current research has looked at deepfakes from legal, technological, or ethical points of view, this article uses a psychological point of view to explain their particular potency.  The main point is that deepfakes don't work mostly as rational lies; instead, they work as cognitive exploits, types of \"perceptual malware\" that attack the way people trust each other.  The article illustrates how deepfakes exploit entrenched biases, such as the truth bias, familiarity effects, and the fluency of perceptual processing, by referencing cognitive psychology and neuroscience.  In doing so, they avoid higher-order logical inspection and use autonomic processes of recognition and belief construction.  The paper also puts deepfakes in the context of other research on false information and how memories can change, suggesting that fake media can create false memories or strengthen existing biases through repeated exposure.  Deepfakes undermine epistemic trust by eroding the dependability of visual and aural evidence, which have historically been regarded as the \"gold standard\" of credibility, in contrast to conventional kinds of propaganda. This situation not only puts democratic discourse and trust in the media at risk, but it also poses a serious psychological challenge: fighting deepfakes requires using cognitive and perceptual mechanisms that are mostly outside of conscious control.  This article provides an interdisciplinary framework for comprehending deepfakes as psychological weapons by integrating insights from cognitive science, information warfare studies, and emerging media research.  It suggests that protecting against this phenomenon necessitates treatments that transcend detection technologies, highlighting cognitive inoculation, media literacy, and the development of \"epistemic resilience\" in an age where visual evidence is increasingly distrusted.",

          "abstract": "In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to survey data to explore the \nconscious and unconscious attributes university students associate with different academic \nsubjects and to identify the elements to which they attribute greater significance. The analysis \nyielded 20 principal components, of which five had eigenvalues exceeding 0.1, with \ncumulative explained variance reaching 80% by the tenth component. Interpretation of the \ncomponents revealed that the first principal component reflected a dichotomy between \nsubjects centered on rote memorization and those emphasizing rule-based learning, while the \nsecond component distinguished between the humanities and the sciences. Higher-order \ncomponents were linked to evaluative dimensions of academic engagement, mid-level \ncomponents reflected the broader epistemological positioning of disciplines, and lower-order \ncomponents assessed the relational aspects of subjects in the context of interpersonal \ndynamics. These findings underscore the potential to provide more holistic and \ninterdisciplinary perspectives in advising and enhancing educational practices across diverse \nacademic disciplines.",

          "abstract": "Cybercrime in India presents complex challenges rooted in the interplay of federal and state jurisdictions, which are further compounded by significant socio-economic factors such as poverty, legal illiteracy, and a prevalent \"easy money\" mindset within certain demographics. This paper critically examines the legal, technical, and societal dimensions of cybercrime governance in India, analyzing the application of federal laws, notably the \nInformation Technology (IT) Act, 2000, and the impact of state-specific regulations. It explores the recurring jurisdictional conflicts in cybercrime cases, the complexities introduced by international law, and the technical difficulties in attributing cyber offenses. Drawing parallels with established global frameworks, such as the U.S. Supremacy Clause and international cyber treaties, the study proposes a coordinated national approach. Recommendations include \nharmonizing federal and state cyber laws, enhancing public awareness, and strengthening international cooperation to effectively combat cross-border cyber threats and address the societal drivers of cybercrime.",

          "abstract": "Bibliometrics professionals are crucial in universities and research institutions, supporting research analytics, evaluation, and strategic decisions. Despite their importance, many lack formal training or access to professional networks, often relying on self-taught methods that can lead to the misuse of metrics and indicators. This limits the usefulness of bibliometric data and raises concerns about research integrity, particularly in citation practices. A global survey within the Library and Information Science (LIS) community explored training experiences, gaps, and interests, especially around research integrity. The results revealed critical knowledge gaps, including the need for a deeper understanding of bibliometric principles, responsible metrics use, advanced analysis techniques, and awareness of indicators' limitations and biases. Highlighting these deficiencies aims to engage the STI indicators community, prompting collective action to better equip bibliometrics practitioners. Proper training is essential to prevent the misuse of indicators, which can undermine research quality and academic evaluation.",

          "authors": "Barbara Sandra Lancho Barrantes",
          "abstract": "This paper examines publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from Latin American and European countries, specifically focusing on whether the issues and challenges faced by these regions differ significantly. Latin American countries may be addressing region-specific health concerns or environmental challenges different from the European countries. A bibliographic universal classification of SDGs may overlook such crucial issues and nuances vital to the development of these countries. This study emphasises the differing priorities between Latin America and certain countries in the Global North regarding the health and well-being of all individuals. It focuses on improving reproductive, maternal, and child health, ending epidemics of major contagious diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health and well-being, and addressing behavioral and environmental health risk factors. While Latin American countries often focus on topics like infections or mental health, the Global North tends to priorities Covid 19 and cancer. These differences reflect distinct economic, social, and political contexts, with us Global North sometimes overlooking the foundational needs of Global South countries. The research employs a sample from the Open Alex database, focusing on the ten most productive countries in Latin America and the ten most productive countries in Europe in SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being in the period of 2023-2024. The study, which falls under the framework of SDG 3 publications and employs data analytics techniques, identifies priority topics for Latin America and Europe, as well as common interests across both regions. Utilising predictive models based on machine learning, the study forecasts the topics that these countries are likely to prioritize in the near future with an accuracy of 60%. This level of accuracy may be influenced by the sample size used; therefore, future analyses will incorporate additional data, such as examining abstracts to determine whether European countries continue to diverge in their focus or if they find common ground on certain topics. This approach will provide valuable insights into regional priorities and the potential evolution of research related to the Sustainable Development Goals. The contrast between Latin America and Europe is valuable and quite original, since many global analyses tend to homogenize realities.",

These were benchmarked against the U.S. Census’s Current Population Survey (CPS) and compared with four probability-based surveys: NHIS, NHANES, GSS, and UAS. Data from 145,775 respondents aged 18 to 65, collected between 2021 and 2024, were included.\nNP surveys showed lower accuracy than probability surveys. However, NP surveys performed well on several benchmarks, including univariate SRH distributions (in RANDS-8 and QPHS) and bivariate and multivariate associations (e.g., age-SRH and education-SRH in RANDS-8 and QPHS, and Black race-SRH in PI-H). Yet, biases on other benchmarks were substantial, including overestimated gender-SRH associations in all NP surveys and strongly diverging disparities by race-ethnicity in RANDS-8 and QPHS.\nThese findings highlight both the promise and pitfalls of NP surveys, emphasizing the need for case-by-case validation against reliable benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "Contrary to the growing emphasis on resilience in sustainability science, I argue that resilience continues to reflect a mindset of human–nature domination, and thus represents continuity rather than a real relational turn. Instead, I propose vulnerability as a critical mode of relation. Drawing on Robin May Schott’s ontological critique of resilience, I extend her arguments into the field of sustainability science by examining its ontological assumptions, primary discourses, and existing critiques. I advance a threefold plea: first, that reconnecting with nature requires a particular relational mode; second, that vulnerability is a necessary precondition for this mode; and third, that sustainability transformations may benefit from less emphasis on resilience. By combining rational argumentation with art-based, transdisciplinary approaches, this paper seeks to foster psychological reflection, new relational imaginaries, and ultimately more just sustainability transformations. I conclude by inviting readers to engage with their own vulnerabilities as part of this process.",

Using monthly employment data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I apply group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify typical combinations of mothers’ and fathers’ full- and part-time employment over time (Nagin et al., 2016). I find eight distinct multi-trajectory groups. Five reflect traditional specialization, in which mothers partially or fully reduce their paid work for an extended period following childbirth, while fathers remain consistently employed full-time or increase their likelihood of full-time employment. The remaining three reflect less gendered patterns, including dual full-time, female full-time, and dual part-time groups. I examine how couples’ baseline characteristics are associated with multi-trajectory membership. Findings indicate that couples are more likely to specialize when only he holds tertiary education, whereas non-traditional patterns are more likely when only she or both partners are highly educated. The patterns differ across two periods marked by distinct policy contexts and between couples with mothers of East and West German background, even after 2007. The study contributes to our understanding how institutions, absolute and relative resources shape joint parental employment trajectories from a dynamic dyadic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Governments continue to face challenges integrating refugees into the local labor market, and many past interventions have shown limited impact. This study examines the Job-Turbo program, a large-scale initiative launched by the German government in 2023 to accelerate employment among refugees—primarily individuals from Ukraine and eight other major countries of origin. Using monthly administrative panel data from Germany’s network of public employment service offices and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program significantly increased both caseworker–refugee contact and job placements over a 23-month follow-up period. Among Ukrainian refugees, the exit-to-job rate nearly doubled. Effects were broad-based—spanning demographic subgroups, unemployment durations, skill levels, regions, and local labor-market conditions—and concentrated in regular, unsubsidized employment. The program also raised both the rate and share of sustained job placements, consistent with improved match quality. Other refugee groups saw meaningful gains as well, but increases in job placements were concentrated among males and in low-skilled jobs, with only limited effects for females. We detect no negative spillovers for German or other immigrant job seekers, finding no signs of either resource reallocation or displacement. The results offer insights for governments responding to displacement crises. They indicate that intensified job-search assistance---embedded within the early stage of integration and implemented at scale through public employment infrastructure---can meaningfully improve refugees' labor-market outcomes, even amid significant arrivals.",

          "abstract": "Alternative news media combine a (quasi-)journalistic self-understanding with an explicit anti-mainstream agenda. As an increasingly important part of digital political information ecosystems in many countries, they have the potential to contribute to a more separatist or publicist orientation of digital counterpublics. This article analyzes the contextual conditions for the mainstream orientation of broader digital alternative news environments that form around the dissemination of alternative news content on social media. We draw on a network-analytical approach and more than 900 million social media posts shared on nine social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, VKontakte, Reddit, Gab, and 4Chan) from 2019 to 2021 that have ties to right-wing, left-wing, or anti-system alternative news outlets based in four European countries (Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden). Our findings indicate that the mainstream orientation of European digital alternative news environments is more pronounced in countries with a cordon sanitaire tradition in the political sphere, as well as in left-wing-oriented environments. The article adds to a growing body of research on the complex relationship between alternative news media and the mainstream by highlighting the importance of contextual conditions and the nature of the broader information environments in which alternative news content is circulated.",

On rare occasions when Bourdieu does attempt to explicate his knowledge of Gramsci through quotations, he does so hastily, vaguely and instrumentally. However, this does not imply that Bourdieu's postures and stances with respect to Gramsci's thought do not find expression within his own texts; on the contrary, they emerge precisely from the reticence, allusions and dissimulations. From here one can even explore a closeness underlying an apparent and declared detachment, to reflect on a disinterestedness that is actually interested. The analysis is thus based on an “against the grain” reading of the direct and explicit occurrences of Gramsci traceable in Bourdieu's texts, highlighting the space of their possible sociological implications and their tacit and implicit connotations.",

Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using a graph correlation method, and the underlying network structures were compared using ERGMs (Exponential Random Graph Models). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.",

Racial thinking is exemplified in Aaron Panofsky’s observation that “one can believe that genes cause racial behavioural differences and also that science cannot substantiate that belief”.

          "abstract": "Background: Tobacco use and food insecurity frequently co-occur and may influence each other bidirectionally. While most prior research has focused on tobacco use as a driver of food insecurity, studies typically rely on self-reported tobacco measures. This study examined associations between food insecurity and serum cotinine, a biomarker of nicotine exposure, and evaluated potential mediating and moderating factors. \nMethods: Data from the 2015–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed for 2,149 adult tobacco users. Cotinine concentrations were log-transformed and modeled using generalized linear models, adjusted for sociodemographic covariates, depression, and body mass index. Mediation was tested with causal mediation analysis and structural equation modeling, and moderation with interaction terms. \nResults: Each unit increase in food insecurity severity was associated with an approximately 10% increase in cotinine concentrations after adjustment for covariates (p = 0.018). Depression neither mediated nor moderated the food insecurity-cotinine association. Income-to-poverty ratio significantly moderated the relationship (p=0.009): the positive food insecurity-cotinine slope grew stronger as income rose, whereas at or below the poverty line food insecurity was not significantly associated with cotinine. In smoker subsample analyses, food insecurity also moderated the smoking frequency-cotinine slope, with the most food-insecure participants showing the shallowest dose-response relationships.\nConclusions: Food insecurity is associated with elevated cotinine concentrations, but effects depend on household economic resources and on how smoking behavior translates into nicotine uptake. Stabilizing food security may be critical for reducing tobacco-related health disparities.",

While supporters embrace the movement’s messaging around healthier lifestyles and nutritional choices, critics point to its political undertones and the widespread misinformation associated with it. To better understand the dynamics of public perceptions of the MAHA movement, our study leverages sentiment classification and topic modeling to analyze discourse about the movement on X. Our analysis reveals an interesting trend: although the movement initially generated overwhelmingly positive sentiment, overall positivity declined following the nomination and subsequent confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services to the point where negative sentiment began to outweigh positive sentiments. Further integration of such trends with topic modeling analysis suggests that while the public initially supported the ideals of healthier lifestyles promoted by the MAHA movement, enthusiasm diminished and eventually turned negative once the movement became entangled with political dimensions and controversial policies.",

          "abstract": "How does coethnicity shape host attitudes toward refugees? Existing research often assumes that refugees who share the ethnic or cultural background of host populations will face less backlash. We test this assumption in Pakistan, where both refugee and host communities include substantial Pashtun populations. Drawing on original survey experimental, observational, and qualitative data, we find that while coethnicity increases refugee acceptance on average, this result masks sharp internal variation. Coethnic hosts who live in provinces where they are ethnic minorities are far more likely to express inclusive attitudes than those living in their ethnic homeland. The impact of coethnicity therefore depends on local context: in settings where ethnic identity is politically salient and shaped by marginalization, coethnicity with refugees can carry both instrumental and symbolic value. These findings complicate standard assumptions about the primacy of cultural threat and underscore the need to attend to subnational variation in refugee-host dynamics.",

Drawing on newly unsealed archival material, this article demonstrates that the book’s central claims are false, and that the authors knew they were false. The documents reveal that the group actively proselytized well before the prophecy failed and quickly abandoned their beliefs afterward. They also expose serious ethical violations by the researchers, including fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation.

This study addresses this gap by combining analysis of actors' narratives about water issues and governance with dynamical systems modeling of the socio-hydrologic system in the context of California's San Joaquin Valley. Through interviews and focus groups with growers, advocacy groups, and rural residents, distinct narratives emerge around water issues and power dynamics. Modeling strategies that would maximize each actor's water access reveals that existing structures incentivize strategies that would mainly benefit larger growers, and thus conflict with the goals of environmental justice narratives. Comparing these modeled strategies with actors' actual strategies also reveals disparities in different actors' ability to pursue the \"optimal\" strategy. These findings highlight how system structures entrench certain interests as well as the potential of narratives for shaping strategies aimed at long-term transformation.",

          "title": "Multiple Jobholding as Identity: Investigating an emerging shift among younger workers toward “Mosaic Careers”",
          "authors": "Amanda Welsh; Jenna Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Multiple jobholding (MJH)—the practice of maintaining more than one paid position simultaneously—is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by digital platforms, remote work normalization, and the expanding gig economy, which have all democratized access to diverse work opportunities. This expansion has altered the demographics of multiple job holders, shifting from predominantly low-wage workers seeking economic survival to include professionals across the income spectrum pursuing varied employment arrangements. Exploration of MJH has typically been dichotomized into two perspectives: those who view it as an unfortunate necessity forced upon the economically vulnerable and those who celebrate it as empowering \"side hustles\" that provide supplemental income and personal fulfillment. To examine workers' actual preferences and motivations, we fielded a survey (n=254) investigating whether workers actively desire MJH arrangements, whether financial considerations alone drive these preferences, and what other factors influence their appeal. Results revealed that workers across demographic groups express a genuine preference for MJH arrangements, transcending economic boundaries. While compensation remains important, workers value MJH for the flexibility and autonomy it provides. In contrast to the universal appeal of these characteristics, the youngest generation (Gen Z) is distinguished by significantly higher interest in using multiple roles to maintain different professional identities and build diverse networks (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest the emergence of what we term the \"Career Mosaic\"—a deliberate construction of professional identity through intentionally curated work experiences that together create a more complete expression of self. This shift from viewing careers as linear progressions to seeing them as multifaceted compositions among the next generation of workers has profound implications for employment policy, workforce development practices, HR technology, and organizational strategy, all of which were designed for a single-employer paradigm that may no longer reflect workers' evolving relationship with work.",

          "title": "Performative Ritualism in African Development: Rethinking Monitoring and Evaluation in the Age of Algorithms",
          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) has emerged as a critical component of development practice, especially in African contexts where donor legitimacy and accountability are upheld by demonstrable quantitative impact. Typically seen as a technical endeavour, M&amp;E is frequently presumed to yield impartial, objective assessments of societal advancement. This paper contests that assumption by proposing a philosophical redefinition of M&amp;E as performative ritualism, a fusion of Judith Butler’s theory of performativity and Victor Turner’s anthropology of ritual. The analysis employs a critical conceptual methodology and normative critique. Butler's explanation of performativity shows how indicators and reports work not just as reflections but also as performative utterances that have an \"impact\" through their repeated use in rituals. Turner's ritual theory shows that evaluation cycles baseline, midline, and endline act as rites of passage, turning ambiguity into symbolic closure for funders and policymakers. Post-humanist insights further expand these frameworks, illustrating how dashboards, algorithms, and artificial intelligence tools now operate alongside human evaluators, reinforcing evaluative categories through automated repetition. The findings indicate the cultural and ethical conflict of these activities within African cultures. Western evaluation rituals focus on linearity, abstraction, and bureaucratic closure. In contrast, African communitarian ethics focus on relational accountability, oral testimony, and cyclical processes of responsibility. The difference shows how theatrical imported evaluative systems are; it also shows how to recreate ethics by thinking of evaluation as participatory storytelling and communal debate instead of a bureaucratic audit. The article finds that monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is not a neutral tool but a symbolic system that enacts legitimacy and authority. Thinking of M&amp;E as performative ritualism brings out its cultural and philosophical sides and makes room for hybrid models that mix computational tools with community-based, relational practices. The paper provides a novel framework for examining development evaluation in the algorithmic era, rooted in African ethical philosophy.",

          "abstract": "While existing research highlights the occupational advantages of citizenship for immigrants, little is known about how such advantages might vary, and previous studies have not fully dealt with issues of selection. We study the heterogeneous effects of naturalization by leveraging a novel historical dataset of naturalization records from New York City’s Southern District in the early 1900s. We link these to U.S. census data from 1920, 1930, and 1940, tracking 1,947 immigrants who declared their intent to naturalize, analyzing occupational trajectories among them, and modeling selection into naturalization using random forests. Our findings reveal that immigrants who completed the naturalization process attained significantly higher occupational status than those who initiated but did not complete naturalization. In addition, propensity-stratified results support a negative selection hypothesis: Immigrants less likely to naturalize enjoyed greater returns to naturalization, surpassing the unnaturalized in the high-propensity, more advantaged group. We support these results with supplementary analyses of full-count census data, where we find similar trends. These results underscore the role of naturalization as a key driver of socioeconomic mobility while highlighting citizenship as a critical stratifying force.",

          "abstract": "This article presents some conditions of possibility for a broad and deep Gramsci-Bourdieu interconnection, meaning it is an exploration and reconstruction of the affinities that emerge from their respective approaches to the socio-cultural dynamics of their own times. Some of the terms through which it is possible to formulate complementarities will be shown, in particular through the identification of the links that bind the two authors within an integrable perspective on mass society, common sense and practical sense; on the relations between the high/legitimate sphere and the low/dominated/subaltern sphere of culture; and thus, on the articulation between cultural expressions/practices and social stratification. In this regard, it is emphasized how the points of contact between some couples of interpretative categories of each-habitus and doxa, hegemony and common sense, respectively-might detect some paths of interaction. Essentially, by highlighting the commonalities and shared ground of the two conceptual universes, we seek to understand whether it is possible to refer to them in social research; and whether their intertwining can give rise to reformulations and developments of conceptual and epistemological devices, with a view to their use in social theory.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "People sometimes call social engineering the \"human factor\" in cybersecurity; however, this \nkind of language hides the underlying philosophical aspects of the issue. Instead of viewing \npersons as the most vulnerable component in technical systems, social engineering should be \nrecognised as a means of revealing the cultivation, maintenance, and exploitation of moral and \nintellectual inclinations within digital contexts. Current ethical frameworks predominantly \nexhibit deontological and utilitarian influences, prioritising adherence to regulations or the \noptimisation of favourable results. Although these frameworks possess practical applicability, \nthey inadequately represent the moral agency of individuals faced with deception. This essay \nconstructs a conceptual analysis that reinterprets social engineering within the context of \nDigital Virtue Ethics. Utilising Aristotle's notion of phronesis and MacIntyre's interpretation \nof practices, the argument underscores that effective resistance to manipulation relies more on \nthe cultivation of qualities such as wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice than on strict \ncompliance with laws. Insights from virtue epistemology, especially in the writings of \nZagzebski and Sosa, enhance this study by highlighting epistemic vigilance through \nattentiveness, humility, and conscientiousness. The amalgamation of these traditions facilitates \nthe emergence of Digital Phronesis: a distinctive form of practical wisdom tailored to the \ninherent unpredictability and persuasive dynamics of online existence. The important point is \nthat technical precautions and compliance procedures are necessary, but they are not enough \non their own. They need a philosophical framework that sees people as moral actors who can \ndevelop strong inclinations. From this perspective, social engineering is not just a technological \nviolation but also an affront to moral character and intellectual integrity. When you talk about \ncybersecurity in terms of virtue, you move away from the idea of the \"weakest link\" and make \nhuman agency the most important layer of defence.",

          "authors": "Meri Dankenbring",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread interest in the role of insurgent ideologies in civil war. However, the concept has been understood in a variety of ways, which are at odds with how ideology is conceptualised in political theory and election research. This results in fragmented theorising and a lack of systematic empirical insights. I argue that we should conceptualise ideology in a theoretically sound, and empirically measurable manner to enable quantitative research. Using a definition of ideology common in political science, I argue that we should reclaim the term extremism to theorise effects of insurgent ideologies. I conceptualise ideological extremity as an insurgent group's ideological distance to an average ideology. Instead of relying on ideology-specific arguments, this novel concept enables theorising and empirically studying the effect of extreme, compared to moderate ideologies in a generalisable way, allowing insights that are transferable to future ideologies. The concept maps onto a measurement model, enabling me to estimate insurgent's ideological extremity based on their manifestos.",

          "abstract": "The rise of citizenship stripping as part of a broader securitisation trend in the post-9/11 world has \nbeen frequently observed in public discourse and academic scholarship. Europe has been on the \nforefront of this trend with an increasing number of states since the early 2000s introducing \nregulations on security-based citizenship deprivation in national legislation, often allowing for \nsubstantial administrative discretion with few procedural safeguards. Remarkably, there is limited \nunderstanding of how new this phenomenon is and what the most common deprivation grounds are. \nIn this paper, we leverage new longitudinal data on the regulation of security-based citizenship \ndeprivation in 47 European states, going back to 1960. We identify two ‘waves of securitisation’, \nincluding an early wave focused on disloyalty in the 1970s and 1980s. After a liberalising period in \nthe 1990s, we observe a strong resurgence of security-related deprivation provisions. Closer scrutiny \nof the language deployed by deprivation provisions, confirms a discursive shift from concerns about \ndisloyalty towards state security",

          "authors": "Eleonora Dagiene; Eduard Aibar",
          "abstract": "National research assessment policies, designed to boost international competitiveness, have intensified “publish or perish” pressures and reshaped the global academic publishing landscape. However, the impact of these pressures on the domestic publishing infrastructures of semi-peripheral nations remains underexplored. This paper investigates how a nation’s domestic publishing infrastructure shapes whether new, high-volume open-access publishing models function as a portfolio addition or a systemic substitute. Using a comparative mixed-methods analysis of Spain and Lithuania, we combine bibliometric data from the Web of Science (2004–2024) with 28 semi-structured interviews with researchers. The findings reveal two divergent, rational strategies. In Spain, a resilient domestic publishing infrastructure, accommodated by a flexible evaluation system, allowed researchers to adopt new publishers as a pragmatic portfolio addition to an already diverse set of options. In stark contrast, Lithuanian research assessment policies actively marginalised domestic journals, creating acute strain on the country’s publishing ecosystem. Researchers in Lithuania thus adopted these same new publishing models as a systemic substitute and a survival measure. We conclude that control over a community-managed domestic publishing infrastructure is a key factor shaping the autonomy of a national academic system. It is this infrastructure that separates a strategy of dependent displacement from one of autonomous coexistence: a crucial lesson for policymakers engaged in global research assessment reforms.",

          "abstract": "This paper analyzes joint employment trajectories of first-time parents in Germany from one year before to six years after the birth of their first child. Using monthly employment data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I apply group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify typical combinations of mothers’ and fathers’ full- and part-time employment over time (Nagin et al., 2016). I find eight distinct multi-trajectory groups. Five reflect traditional specialization, in which mothers partially or fully reduce their paid work for an extended period following childbirth, while fathers remain consistently employed full-time or increase their likelihood of full-time employment. The remaining three reflect less gendered patterns, including dual full-time, female full-time, and dual part-time groups. I examine how couples’ baseline characteristics are associated with multi-trajectory membership. Findings indicate that couples are more likely to specialize when only he holds tertiary education, whereas non-traditional patterns are more likely when only she or both partners are highly educated. The patterns differ across two periods marked by distinct policy contexts and between couples with mothers of East and West German background, even after 2007. The study contributes to our understanding how institutions, absolute and relative resources shape joint parental employment trajectories from a dynamic dyadic perspective.",

          "authors": "Kazuhito Kitamura",
          "abstract": "Persistent macroeconomic imbalances, long‑run deflation, and entrenched inequality are often interpreted as outcomes of market incompleteness or failures. This paper offers an alternative perspective by developing a dynamic equilibrium framework for open economies that incorporates asset‑side mechanisms. Within this framework, and by re‑examining the transversality condition (TVC) as an asset‑valuation criterion, such persistent imbalances can emerge as structural outcomes of optimal behavior rather than anomalies. The model yields the relationship:Rt-ρ=n+Da-U(θa)/Uc; This relationship shows that the gap between the asset return (Rt) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the combined effects of capital diffusion (Da), population growth (n) and preference terms (U(θa)/Uc). This reinterpretation explains how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist, and frames equilibrium as a dynamic configuration shaped by interdependence across economies and agents, beyond the traditional price‑clearing mechanism. The results align theory with observed realities and offer tools for policy design, including structural selection of the steady state, policy control of capital flows, and asset‑dynamics‑based policy reconstruction. Furthermore, by formalizing a concept akin to “economic entropy,” this framework provides a pathway beyond quantitative equilibrium theory toward a richer understanding of qualitative development.",

This study analyzes a stratified sample of Library and Information Science publications to examine how citance segmentation and annotator expertise influence the consistency of classification. Using two annotators with different professional backgrounds, the findings show that agreement is high when citances are defined identically, but reliability decreases sharply once text boundaries diverge. Citance length, rather than subject category or citation density, emerges as the strongest predictor of disagreement. These results identify segmentation as a methodological rather than a purely technical issue, shaping both human and automated tagging outcomes. By highlighting the interplay between expertise effects and boundary definitions, the study underscores the need for clearer operational frameworks in citation analysis. The contribution lies in demonstrating that methodological refinements in citance identification are essential for improving reproducibility, enhancing hybrid human-machine approaches, and strengthening the validity of citation-based indicators in research evaluation.",
