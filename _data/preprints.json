          "abstract": "Reproducibility of research is a hotly debated topic, including aspects like causes and consequences of low levels of reproducibility. While some research fields have led the way and introduced various reproducibility practices and procedures, the call for efforts to ‘improve’ reproducibility in research has not come without criticisms. The current study uses a future studies methodology to gather perceptions of developments in the research ecosystem related to reproducibility issues. It draws on input from representatives of four main stakeholder categories: scholarly publishers, funding agencies, qualitative social scientists and machine learning researchers. Particularly, it discusses the enablers and barriers that members of these stakeholder communities foresee on the road towards a research ecosystem that is more conducive to reproducibility.\nThe study finds that enablers and barriers can be categorised into five main clusters. The factors most prominently mentioned as potentially supporting or hindering a desired future are located within research culture, including norms, values and shared definitions; and in the infrastructure required to engage in reproducibility practices, including repositories, support staff, and digital infrastructure. Three other clusters of factors put forth by participants relate to policy efforts required to incentivise reproducibility practices; training and education to empower researchers and support staff to engage in reproducibility practices; and the financial resources required to facilitate the transition towards a desired future and to specifically fund replication studies. This manuscript also identifies several tensions between enablers and barriers perceived by diverse stakeholders and concludes with recommendations for addressing these.",

          "authors": "Ben McNamee; Patrick S. Forscher; Michael Lenczner",
          "abstract": "Since 2011, the academic field of social psychology has been undergoing a crisis of confidence in its results. This so-called \"replication crisis\" has inspired a widespread examination of the practices that can lead to less than credible results, the incentives that inspire such practices, and the practices that could protect or enhance research credibility. We believe that the credibility of the field of impact evaluation may be similarly threatened by incentives to use poor research practices. We assess the history of both social psychology and impact evaluation and conclude that, although the source of the incentives for impact evaluators is different in kind than those for social psychologists, impact evaluators may be similarly incentivized to make their results look better than they really are. We review three parallels in the history of the two fields, including the use of research as sales, the pressurized, competitive environments in which the work takes place, and the use of research methods as rhetorical devices. Impact evaluators may be able to learn from the credibility-enhancing solutions that worked for social psychology, though the field can consider new tools, such as standards, investment mechanisms, administrative data labs, and innovations inevidence-sharing and synthesis. Rather than sleepwalking through a crisis we cannot see, impact evaluators should consider that their field may be in crisis, a crisis that may require widespread and collective efforts –a credibility renaissance – to discover and deploy methods to protect its legitimacy.",

          "authors": "Wei Zhang; Mengnan Li",
          "abstract": "Jessica Benjamin is a prominent figure in relational-intersubjective psychoanalysis. Her unique intersubjective recognition theory focuses primarily on the concepts of mutual recognition and the Third. Benjamin posits that dyads in interpersonal interactions engage in mutual influence and reciprocal shaping. Recognition, according to Benjamin, represents a psychic position where both parties are recognized as subjects, fostering a process of giving affirming responses to each other; the Third functions as a principle, function, or relationship that creates an intersubjective space, accommodating both commonalities and differences. Types of the Third includes the rhythmic Third, the differentiating Third, the moral Third, the symbolic Third, and so forth. The distinctiveness of Benjamin's intersubjective recognition theory are reflected in several aspects: The concept of recognition is inclusive because of the information transmission mode, the impact of intersubjective responsiveness, the manifestation of otherness, and the focus on both intrapersonal and intersubjective dimensions; the concept of the Third, akin to phenomenological reflection, is more effective than the concept of conflict. In general, Benjamin’s intersubjective recognition theory provides a paradigm for maintaining a tension between the scientific and humanistic dimensions of psychoanalysis.",

          "abstract": "The aim of the present research was twofold: to explore the structure of university students’ goal system and to examine its association with well-being. In Study 1, in-depth interviews were conducted to examine important life goals of Chinese university students and how they were integrated. It identified 17 life goals and suggested that individuals organize their goals into a hierarchical system. Study 2 was a questionnaire survey (N = 301) designed based on the interview findings to examine the associations between goal system characteristics and well-being. The results showed that goal structural attributes such as clarity and integration were significantly related to well-being, and that the size of goal system, structural clarity, centralization and flexibility attenuated the relationships between several goal properties (e.g., goal social support) and well-being. This research confirmed the validity and usefulness of a hierarchical goal structure in the investigation of personal goals and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Our everyday experiences unfold continuously, yet we naturally segment them into distinct memory units—a phenomenon known as event segmentation. While event segmentation is a well-explored topic, its underlying mechanisms have remained a subject of debate. In this study, we address this debate by comparing the two contrasting theories of event segmentation: prediction error and contextual stability. In two experiments, we manipulated contextual stability while keeping prediction error constant. Event segmentation was more prominent when there were stable contexts (Experiment 2) compared to prediction errors among unstable contexts (Experiment 1). This stronger segmentation took place despite signs of a smaller prediction error in Experiment 2. We conclude that contextual stability plays a pivotal role in driving event \nsegmentation, highlighting its dominance over the role of prediction errors. Our study sheds new light on the mechanisms behind how our minds divide continuous experiences into meaningful memory units.",

          "authors": "Gregory John Depow; Michael Inzlicht",
          "abstract": "Do trait empathy measures predict how people experience empathy in daily life? Despite considerable research on empathy, we know surprisingly little about how trait measures relate to real-world empathic experiences. In this preregistered analysis of 7,343 experience sampling surveys from a near-representative sample of 246 U.S. adults, we map the connections between validated trait empathy measures and state experiences of empathy. Each component of state empathy—including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and compassion—was significantly predicted by theoretically-relevant trait measures. However, trait empathy explained limited variance in daily experiences overall, ranging from just 3% for emotion sharing to 15% for perceived empathic efficacy. Adding emotional valence as a predictor improved model fit and variance explained for most state experiences, highlighting the crucial role of context. Our findings validate trait empathy measures while revealing their limitations in predicting real-world experiences.",

          "abstract": "Importance: The tobacco industry spends over $8 billion annually in the United States on marketing at the point-of-sale. Exposure to tobacco retail has been associated with smoking outcomes, but substantially less is known about how objectively logged day-to-day, real-world tobacco retail exposure is linked to smoking outcomes. \n\nObjective: To assess pre-registered hypotheses that individuals report greater craving and cigarettes smoked on days when their objectively logged retail exposure is higher than usual. Design: A 14-day within-person observational study combining objectively logged geolocation tracking, public tobacco-retail location records, and ecological momentary assessment. Data collection occurred from 2022 to 2024. \n\nSetting: A multimodal study including participants statewide in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. \nParticipants: Main eligibility criteria were: aged 21-65 years, smoked at least five cigarettes per day for the previous six months, owned an iPhone or Android smartphone, and a resident of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware. Participants were selected via convenience sampling. A total of 310 participants enrolled.\n\nExposure: To assess tobacco retail exposure, mobility data collected objectively via geolocation tracking was matched with locations of tobacco retailers across three states. \nMain Outcomes and Measures: Daily average craving and daily number of cigarettes smoked, reported via ecological momentary assessment. \n\nResults: A total of 273 participants were included in the final analyses (151 [55.3%] women; 175 [64.1%] white; mean [SD] age, 42.46 [10.69] years). Multilevel models revealed support for both pre-registered hypotheses. On days when individuals had more tobacco retail exposure than their usual baseline, they reported significantly higher levels of craving (b = 0.04, t(3,456.79) = 2.56, p = 0.01) and smoking significantly more cigarettes (b = 0.01, t(3,469) = 2.47, p = 0.01).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: People’s environments shape their feelings and behaviors. Exposure to tobacco retail in the real-world is associated with increases in craving and smoking. Findings highlight the significance of retail exposure in relation to smoking, information that is critical for developing effective tobacco control interventions, and lays foundations for broader health research on environmental factors shaping health behaviors.",

          "authors": "Ege Gür; Abigail Fergus; Keith Baxelbaum; Bob McMurray",
          "abstract": "Word recognition is supported by a competition process in which words that partially match the input are activated and vie for recognition. Recent work has shown that adolescents with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) do not fully resolve this competition, likely due to a deficiency in inhibition among words (lateral inhibition). It is not yet clear how this develops. Three experiments investigated the development of lateral inhibition using a variant of the Visual World Paradigm. Experiment 1 compared adults (N=35), older children (11-12) (N=43), and younger children (7-9) (N=45). In line with previous works, adults demonstrated robust inhibition, with marginal evidence in older children and no evidence in the youngest children. Experiment 2 tested 222 younger children to achieve greater statistical sensitivity and found a small but significant effect. Experiment 3 asked if these weaker effects were due to the younger listeners’ failure to activate competitors, or if competitors were active but simply not inhibiting the target. It found robust competitor activation even in younger children, suggesting the weaker effects may derive from true inhibition differences. Implications for DLD are discussed.",

          "authors": "Kathryn O'Nell; Kiara Sanchez; Emily S. Finn",
          "abstract": "Conversation is a core component of human social life. Many influential theories treat conversation as a linear system, i.e., the sum of its parts. However, linear accounts of semantic entrainment lose explanatory power at their upper limits: discussing perfectly aligned opinions becomes boring. We propose an alternate account that treats conversation as a complex dynamical system. In such systems, pink noise is a hallmark of successful mutual adaptation. Here, we test whether pink noise can be found in interlocutors’ co-navigated trajectories through semantic space. Not only is pink noise present, but its strength predicts positive conversation outcomes, increases with practice, and is reflected in a large language model’s representation of conversation quality. These results demonstrate an important role for mutual adaptation in promoting successful conversation.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

Nearly four million adolescents in rural U.S. lack adequate mental health care, highlighting the need for scalable, accessible solutions integrated into existing systems. Digital self-guided single-session interventions (SSIs) offer a promising solution with proven clinical efficacy, scalability, and low cost. However, widespread adoption depends on developing effective dissemination support systems. This protocol aims to develop a dissemination toolkit to implement Project YES – an evidence-based SSI platform – into primary care settings and schools across rural Montana. Methods. Using implementation science approaches and the Accelerated Create-to-Sustain Framework, we outline a six-step process involving advisory boards of primary care providers, schools, and parents of Montana youth. Activities include refining implementation strategies, developing actionable toolkit components, prototype creation, usability testing, and initial implementation planning. Discussion. This study will provide a practical, user-centered approach to developing a dissemination toolkit, supporting the effective integration of Project YES into rural care systems.",

          "abstract": "The goal of psychological research is to understand behaviour in daily life. Although lab studies provide the control necessary to identify the mechanisms behind behaviour, how these controlled situations generalise to activities in daily life remains unclear. Experience sampling provides useful descriptions of thought in the lab and real world and the current study examined how thought patterns generated by multi-dimensional experience sampling (mDES) generalise across both situations. We combined data from five published studies to generate a common thought-space using data from the lab and daily life. This space represented data from both lab and daily life in an unbiased manner and grouped lab tasks and daily life activities with similar features (e.g., working in daily life was similar to working memory in the lab). Our study establishes mDES can map cognition from lab and daily life within a common space, allowing for more ecologically valid descriptions of cognition and behaviour.",

We introduce a previously neglected variable, namely categorical specificity, and investigate its role in lexical and semantic access, through: ratings, a lexical decision task and a semantic decision task. Our findings confirm the processing advantage of concrete over abstract concepts (concreteness effect) and reveal a similar advantage for specific over generic concepts (specificity effect). We report also a non-significant interaction between the two variables. We discuss the results within the general framework of conceptual abstraction.",

          "authors": "Khena M. Swallow; Ruiyi Chen",
          "abstract": "The human mind automatically divides continuous experience into meaningful events (event segmentation). Despite abundant evidence that some kinds of situation changes (e.g., action, goal, or location changes) contribute to event segmentation, a component of experience that is critical for understanding and predicting others’ behavior, emotion, is rarely investigated. In two experiments, we sought to establish that viewers can track emotion changes while viewing naturalistic videos, and that these changes contribute to event segmentation. Participants watched commercial film excerpts while identifying either emotion changes or event boundaries (moments that separate two events) of different grains (Experiment 1: neutral-grain; Experiment 2: fine-grain or coarse-grain). We found that participants agreed with each other about when emotion changes occurred in the videos, demonstrating that viewers are able to track changes in the emotional content of dynamic naturalistic videos as they are experienced. Moreover, the emotion changes participants identified were temporally aligned with the event boundaries identified by other groups. In addition, valence and arousal ratings from separate groups of participants uniquely predicted the likelihood of identifying emotion changes and event boundaries, even after accounting for other types of change. However, emotion changes were more strongly tied to valence changes than arousal changes while coarse boundaries were more strongly associated with affective changes than were fine boundaries. These novel findings suggest that emotional information plays a substantial role in structuring ongoing experiences into meaningful events, providing a stronger basis for understanding how emotion shapes the perception and memory of everyday experiences.",

          "abstract": "To maintain and develop close relationships, people need to accurately represent the minds of their social partners. Although studies have characterized many aspects of children’s intuitive theory of the mind and children’s intuitive theory of relationships, it is largely unknown whether and how children think about mental state reasoning within relationships. In three experiments, we asked whether children think accurate mental state reasoning is a cue to social closeness. In Experiment 1 (n = 145), we found that 4- to 9-year-old children inferred that characters who are socially close know about each other’s goals and desires. In Experiment 2 (n = 137), we found that 6- to 9-year-old children, but not younger children, inferred that characters who are correct about each other’s minds are socially close. Children did not think that being correct about external states of the world was evidence that a character was close to another. In Experiment 3 (n = 79), we conceptually replicated the main findings from Experiments 1 and 2, and we found that 6- to 9-year-old children did not form the same inferences concerning knowledge about observable features of individuals (e.g., an individual’s outfit); children’s inferences were specific to unobservable mental content. Thus, by 6 years of age, children integrate their intuitive theories of the mind and relationships to make sense of whether and how people are connected to each other, as well as the strength and nature of those connections.",

Moreover, people reported more surprisal when the events deviated from role expectations, and they were more likely to misremember what happened. Our results suggest that roles are a powerful route for social understanding that has been previously under- studied in social cognition.",

At a broad level, these findings suggest that knowledge representation is distinct from belief representation and offers a conceptually primitive way to represent others’ minds.",

          "authors": "Bo Yao",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Linguistic Active Inference Theory (LAIT), which proposes that inner speech enhances the brain’s ability to navigate uncertainty by augmenting predictive processes for perception and action. By leveraging language’s unique properties - its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, ability to extend across time and space, and generativity in constructing novel predictions - inner speech enables predictive processing to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference, while decoding abstract goals through situated action simulations for active control. By unifying previously disparate aspects of inner speech research, LAIT provides a comprehensive framework explaining how its diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and theoretical models emerge from its implementation of perceptual inference and active control through dynamic linguistic predictions, adapting to computational demands and fluctuating uncertainties across contexts. This synthesis generates novel testable hypotheses, underscores the need for methodological innovations in studying inner speech dynamics, and opens new perspectives on both related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Depression and anxiety significantly impact labour participation and productivity, leading to adverse health and economic outcomes at a population level. Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) has emerged as a cost-effective intervention within workplace settings, but more generalisable evidence is lacking. This naturalistic, observational study investigated the impact of iCBT on work-related outcomes using nationally representative data from patients enrolled in routine care in Ireland. Methods. We analysed retrospective data from N=7125 patients enrolled in iCBT through the Irish national health service between March 2023-May 2024. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire was used to measure absenteeism, presenteeism, overall productivity loss, and activity impairment. Secondary outcomes included depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7). We used mixed-effects models to assess pre-post treatment changes in outcomes, and estimated cost-savings from productivity improvement using Irish median salary data. Results. Overall, patients showed significant improvements in all WPAI outcomes with small effect sizes (6-9%, d=.18-30). Greater improvements in workplace functioning were linked to larger reductions in depression (r=.10-.34) and anxiety symptoms (r=.06-.33), both of which on average reduced by ~3 points. Patients with higher baseline clinical severity experienced more substantial improvements in workplace functioning than subclinical patients. These productivity gains correspond to &gt;€4000 annual savings per patient treated, totalling to over €29 million for our nationally representative sample. Conclusion. Our findings support iCBT as a scalable, cost-effective intervention that can effectively improve workplace functioning associated with depression and anxiety when integrated within public health service provision.",

          "abstract": "Managing our natural resources often involves learning about the dynamics of the resource while society simultaneously harvests from the resource. However, little is known about how society’s actions affect our ability to learn about a vulnerable resource. Here, we investigate how experience managing a shared resource impacts one’s ability to learn about the underlying dynamics of a resource. We hypothesised that participants' capacity to learn from experience would depend on the behaviour of other group members. 320 participants played a four-player resource management game with computer partners who acted sustainably, unsustainably, or conditionally cooperatively. Participants’ ability to learn the underlying resource dynamics was then assessed in a subsequent single-player resource management game, where the social dynamics were removed and the participants’ understanding of the resource could be evaluated in isolation. Compared to controls with no prior experience, performance on the single-player game improved after experience with sustainable and unsustainable partners, but not after experience with conditionally cooperative partners. However, experience with a single-player game (rather than a group game) outperformed all other experimental conditions; thus individual experience improved performance more than experience in any group dynamic tested. These findings suggest that the presence of others generally hinders learning in resource management contexts, though how much this learning is hindered depends on the behaviour of others.",

How do children think these achievement goals influence adults’ child-directed behaviors? Across two preregistered experiments (n = 90 adults; n = 160 5- to 8-year-old children), we found that children systematically predict that an adult would select a more difficult task for a recipient child when the adult held a learning (vs. performance) goal, and when the recipient was more competent. Importantly, we found that this pattern matched adults’ actual task choices, although adults showed more sensitivity to choosing a task that anchors closely to what a child can reasonably learn from or accomplish. These results suggest children can reason about how adult’s achievement goals manifest into observable actions, which may have consequences for children’s own goal orientations and task selections.",

We asked children and adults to view a television episode, a naturalistic task for which there exists a ground truth, and assessed their event cognition, forced-choice recognition for event details, ability to temporally order scenes, and free recall. Children’s free recall performance improved dramatically with age, with many young children recalling nothing, even though recognition measures showed retention. However, detail in free recall was related to both recognition and temporal order forced-choice memory performance in our full sample, showing agreement among memory measures. For children, free recall was additionally related to verbal skills and more adult-like event segmentation. We propose that free recall has a more protracted developmental trajectory because it requires more substantial verbal skills and better understanding of event schemas than forced-choice memory tasks.",

Residual IRTs exhibited strong sequential dependencies, being positively correlated at lags of one and two transitions.  We used this IRT model to evaluate the hypothesis that chunking helps subjects learn unstructured materials.  Specifically, we hypothesized that chunks would appear as a slow IRT, indicative of a boundary, followed by a sequence of fast IRTs.  Model-based analyses that included sequential dependencies in IRTs offered evidence for spontaneous chunking in free recall of lists that lacked any grouping or hierarchical structure.",

With this literature review, we explore this parallel using the concept of social contagion—the process of information (including attitudes or behaviors) spreading throughout a group— to examine peer influences on quitting smoking with the goal of generating hypotheses about peer-to-peer influence on veg*nism.",

          "abstract": "Universities usually support students with employability (i.e., interview) skills development using video content during classes.  The reason for searching for alternative learning approaches is mainly because of a lack of engagement from both staff and students. 3D full immersive VR application and 2D desktop computer simulations have previously been found to provide an effective alternative learning environment keeping students and staff engaged with the learning and teaching process. This study explores whether the independent learning environment using a 3D fully immersive application could enhance undergraduate students learning of interview skills compared to an independent use of the 2D desktop application and video presentation resources in a class environment. Students and staff took part in three different learning conditions (3D full immersive application, 2D desktop application and video in class), where participants' employability skills, user experience and presence were assessed. University staff rated the 3D fully immersive learning condition better for employability skills training, presence and user experience compared to the 2D desktop environment and lecture conditions. Students, on the other hand, found the 3D immersive application to be a more enjoyable experience than the other two learning conditions but no learning environment was significantly better than another. This raises a question regarding the integration of 3D fully immersive systems in class for employability training",

This study focuses on affect anchored to the parenting context (i.e., daily emotional exhaustion, emotional distance from children, and feeling fed up) to assess whether the way parenting affect fluctuates relates to dysfunction: parental burnout severity. We focus on three specific patterns (i.e., affective dynamic indices): inertia (i.e., persistence across days), variation (i.e., magnitude of change), and covariation (i.e., whether affect variables fluctuate together). We reanalyzed multiple datasets (from Belgium and the U.S.) yielding 180 parents who had rated their parenting affect daily for either three or eight weeks. We computed a regression model with all affective indices as predictors (controlling for mean levels), with parental burnout severity as the outcome variable. Results indicate that inertia of emotional distance predicts parental burnout severity across most sensitivity models (i.e., even with varied operationalizations of affective indices). No other temporal pattern (i.e., variation or covariation) robustly predicted parental burnout severity, although the mean levels of emotional distance and emotional exhaustion did. Results from sensitivity analyses emphasize that operationalization choices for affective indices can yield varying values and impact results.",

          "authors": "Margaret Cecilia Jackson; Caitlin Hanna Parsons",
          "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which has been found to present differently in males and females. For example, autistic females more commonly tend to hide their autistic traits, or ‘camouflage’. Original theories of autism such as the ‘extreme male brain’ theory have a male bias in diagnosing the condition, creating a significant underdiagnosis of females on the spectrum. Little research has been conducted into whether the assessment questionnaires may be partially to blame for this, as they may not identify these differences in traits between genders. The current study examined this by having autistic (self and professionally diagnosed) and non-autistic adult women complete three questionnaires: the Autism Quotient (AQ50); Girls Questionnaire of Autism Spectrum Conditions (GQ-ASC); and Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q). Participants were also asked to rate each questionnaire on its relevance, meaningfulness, and clarity and an optional comments box was provided. It was hypothesised that (1) autistic participants will score higher in all questionnaires than non-autistic participants and (2) the GQ-ASC will be more sensitive in identifying autistic women than the AQ50. The findings show that both hypotheses were supported. Evaluative comments suggest that participants preferred the GQ-ASC despite some questions not feeling age appropriate, the CAT-Q felt repetitive, and the AQ50 felt stereotyped and male-biased. Development of future questionnaires should focus closely on the age demographic and research proven traits of ASD, ensuring they are not repetitive. Further suggestions for research are discussed.",

Recent advances in systematic review methodology and computational linguistics reveal gaps in earlier narrative reviews, particularly regarding methodological transparency, heterogeneity across OCD subtypes, and integration of objective linguistic biomarkers. This article synthesizes evidence linking neurotransmitter dysregulation (serotonin, dopamine, glutamate) and frontostriatal circuit abnormalities to language deficits in OCD, while emphasizing the need for rigorous methodologies, computational tools, and stratification by symptom dimensions.

We test four competing hypotheses: (i) reduced eye movements in aphantasia due to absent mental images, (ii) increased exploratory eye movements as a sensorimotor compensatory strategy, (iii) typical eye movements with impaired metacognitive access, or (iv) heterogeneous eye movement patterns. We also predict greater pupil dilation in aphantasia, indicating increased cognitive load.

However, this temporal sequence has not yet been properly tested, given the lack of methods allowing to manipulate or interfere with facial muscle activity at specific time points. The current study (N=52, 28 female) investigated this key question using EEG and facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) – a technique offering superior control over which facial muscles are activated and when. Participants categorised neutral, happy, and sad avatar faces as either happy or sad, and received fNMES (except in the control condition) to bilateral zygomaticus major muscles during early visual processing (-250 to +250 ms of face onset), or later visual processing, when SFM typically arises (500 to 1000 ms after face onset). Both early and late fNMES resulted in a happiness bias specific to neutral faces, which was mediated by a reduced N170 in the early window. In contrast, a modulation of the beta-band (13-22 Hz) coherence between somatomotor and occipital cortices was found in the late fNMES, although this did not predict categorisation choice. We propose that facial feedback biases emotion recognition at different visual processing stages by reducing visual processing load.",

          "authors": "Matti Toivo Juhani Heino",
          "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving world, human behaviour plays a crucial role in addressing complex challenges. These span from mitigating non-communicable diseases, to climate action and pandemic preparedness. Traditional behaviour change research has focused on identifying and addressing specific factors that impede positive change, using a decomposition-based approach. This approach breaks key behaviours down into their component parts, and seeks to affect influences – again broken down into e.g. attitudes, social norms, resources and other opportunity-related factors – on these components. Component-dominant dynamics refer to a situation, where the behaviour of a system is determined primarily by the properties of its individual components, rather than by emergent phenomena. The decomposition-based approach is highly effective when this is the case. However, the approach may have severely limited effectiveness in contexts characterized by interaction-dominant dynamics, where outcomes are determined not by individual components, but emerge from the ongoing interdependent influences between them. Interaction-dominant systems have been studied in various fields under the interdisciplinary rubric of complex systems science. \n\nThis work argues that people are active agentic creatures, who are self-determined and self-organising experts of their own environments, which infuses social systems with inherent non-stationarity and hence uncertainty: Objects of study in behaviour change science, as well as their relationships, change. In addition, small events can cause large impacts, and long periods of apparent stability can be punctuated by rapid change. This implies that past data may be of limited use for inference and interventions across contexts or time. Indeed, the opportunities and risks laying in the future of complex systems or decision making contexts, are vastly more numerous than those which could be called merely complicated. Therefore, it should be carefully evaluated, to what extent a given situation is indeed amenable to decomposition-based solutions. While it might be impossible to predict the long-term future of some complex “non-linear” systems, risks and opportunities can be evaluated based on evolutionary potential of their space of possibilities. \n\nThe specific contribution of articles included in this work supports the argument as follows. Article I takes the view of people as agentic, autonomous decision makers, and points to the need to foster their capacity to self-organise. It describes a compendium of techniques, which (combined with proper scaffolding and support) could enable individuals to better self-manage their motivation and behaviour. Article II uses data containing self-management techniques to demonstrate a conceptually important model, where behaviours – and what the literature has conventionally considered their influences, precursors, or determinants – are represented as components of a mutually interacting network. The network representation reflects a deviation from the conventional conceptualisation, which hinges on component-dominant dynamics to depict simplistic causes and their effects with boxes and arrows. The article also discusses the importance of distributional shapes, as well as how summary statistics developed for simple, symmetric distributions can misdirect inference when the shape is more varied. Article III proposes a process definition of behaviour change, particularly calling for attention to some core features of complex systems; interconnectedness, non-ergodicity and non-linearity. It points out how interaction-dominant dynamics can produce distributional shapes, poorly amenable conventional analysis. It also discusses problems of traditional linear models of between-individual data for studying behaviour change, and expands the idea of aforementioned between-individual networks to those containing temporal recurrences of idiographic system states – attractors. Article IV depicts how the conceptualisation of behaviour change as movement in an attractor landscape can be used to understand change on different scales of observation, from individuals to communities and the society at large.

          "abstract": "Political polarization is driving disconnection and animosity between opponents. We propose that perceptions of self-disclosure between partisans helps reduce this hostility. Building on extensive research demonstrating that self-disclosure fosters interpersonal connections, we test whether political views that seem self-disclosing increase connection, respect, and willingness to interact among opponents. Across six studies, we demonstrate that self-disclosure reduces partisan animosity, through building connection between political opponents. While previous work showed that political discussions based on sharing personal experiences bridge divides better than fact-based discussions, our results indicate this is because of the self-disclosing nature of experiences. Leveraging this, we find many arguments partisans share with each other (e.g., facts) can improve connection and reduce animosity when they are perceived as self-disclosing (tested through manipulating self-disclosure). By highlighting the power of self-disclosure, our findings offer a promising path toward bridging political divides.",

          "abstract": "The present study aimed to systematically review research concerning changes in music consumption across the lifespan to better understand how adults of all ages consume music. Keyword searches of four academic databases (i.e., Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, &amp; Academic Search Complete) identified 2,002 peer-reviewed articles, and of these, fifteen articles were selected for review using the PRISMA protocol. The findings of the review indicated that very few studies have investigated how people of all ages consume music, and what little research has been done on this topic has been methodologically inconsistent and led to findings that are contradictory and inconclusive. Several questionnaire studies found that music consumption decreased with age, whilst an interview study found that music consumption is likely to increase with age. This review also identified a shortlist of possible factors (e.g., life goals, personality, conformity) that might account for any age-related changes in musical consumption. With many people living in ageing societies, and music a ubiquitous part of daily life, the review recommends that future research on this topic should seek to reflect how people of all ages consume music, and to identify the factors responsible for any changes in music consumption as people grow older.",

Recently, various behavioural sciences have begun to acknowledge the systematic nature and high relevance of this individuality – but approaches from different disciplines are currently isolated from each other. We propose an integrative, interdisciplinary approach for a more comprehensive understanding of individuality in social behaviour, considering: (1) features (What kinds of individual differences exist, and what is their magnitude?), (2) sources (How do these differences emerge in the social environments that individuals live in?), and (3) outcomes (What are the consequences of these differences, and how can relevant outcomes be changed through tailored interventions?). We highlight common insights across disciplines; key challenges stemming from insular, discipline-specific approaches; and novel potentials enabled by the proposed interdisciplinary approach. Moreover, by allowing comparative analyses across species, groups of individuals, and contexts, our approach promises to uncover the shared and unique nature of individuality in human social behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Almost all parents lie to their children, and recent studies warn that parental lying may negatively impact trust of children in their parents. However, perspectives of children on parental lying and its effect on trust in parents have rarely been studied. In the current manuscript, we (1) report the development and co-creation of an age-appropriate instrument to assess children’s perspectives on parental lying in middle childhood (8- to 12-year-olds), (2) investigate in a pilot sample (n = 62 Dutch 8- to 12-year-olds) whether the instrument is able to capture children’s perspectives on parental lying and truth telling, and (3) explore children’s perspectives on parental lying and trust. Three different lies were distinguished: lies to benefit the parent, lies to benefit the child and prudential lies. The instrument was co-created with a child panel (n = 5 Dutch 8- to 12-year-olds) and a game designer. The instrument was deemed age-appropriate based on the high percentages of correct classifications of parental lies and truths. Our results demonstrated that children evaluated child-benefit and prudential parental lies more positively than liar-benefitting parental lies. Children expected trust to be lower when a parent used a liar-benefitting lie as compared to a child-benefitting lie. Our results demonstrated that 8- to 12-year-olds already have differentiated opinions about different types of parental lies and how they can affect trust, and our open-access instrument provides an engaging and age-appropriate opportunity for future research into children’s view on parental lying and its effect on trust.",

          "abstract": "Background: 91% of those who menstruate reported to experiencing associated pain. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, the prevalence, extent and socio-demographic variation of menstrual pain remains understudied at national levels - whether due to a shortage of applicable data at national scales or other factors.\nMethod: We assess the extent and variation of menstrual pain at a national level. To achieve this, we develop a novel proxy measure for menstrual pain, utilising behavioural data extracted from mass supermarket shopping logs. Baskets where pain and menstrual items co-occur are investigated, and normalized against baskets in which pain or menstrual items occur in isolation. Propensity of menstrual pain purchases are aggregated temporally and geographically across England, prior to linkage with socio-demographic indicators regionally. \nResults: Findings indicate high prevalence of menstrual pain across England, with 26.7% of customers I our dataset buying pain relief together with menstrual products. People who menstruate are observed to be four times more likely to purchase pain relief with menstrual items than without. Average regional income provides the strongest predictor of menstrual pain co-purchases, with lower income regions exhibiting a 32% lower menstrual-pain purchase than higher income regions.\nDiscussion: The robust presence of a consistent 28-day cycle in menstrual-pain purchases provides empirical evidence for the use of behavioural proxies for menstrual pain alongside traditional measures. Significant regional differences observed in the prevalence of menstrual-pain transactions across England brings into light existing disparities. Future research into improved understanding of sociodemographic factors associated with menstrual pain could inform strategies to predict and prevent menstrual pain and its adverse impacts.",

It is being studied by mental health professionals, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners, and computer science communities due to its growing prevalence. However, the lack of a survey article highlighting the study approaches of these communities is still a knowledge transfer impediment between the communities. This survey article aims to bridge the gap by providing a systematic and comprehensive overview of the existing SAD research from all these communities.\n \n    We have discussed the existing SAD assessment techniques and focused on leveraging digital technologies to detect SAD. Furthermore, we have grouped the existing literature based on the study approach into two groups (i.e., lab and field). For each group, we have discussed the research methodologies followed to attain respective objectives. We have emphasized on the field studies owing to the growing use of digital devices, especially smartphones, and wearables, for understanding SAD.   This template simplifies and summarizes the use of artificial intelligence to predict and detect SAD using digitally captured data. In addition to the existing digital SAD psychotherapy, we have also discussed mHealth interventions that use smartphones and wearables to manage mental disorders. Finally, we have discussed challenges and future directions with possible solutions that can be incorporated into future SAD study designs.",

Here, we introduce the Picture Naming Cards test, designed as a tool enabling more ecologically valid assessment of naming abilities, approximating everyday conversational challenges by introducing the cognitive demands of time pressure and distraction. The test consists of two cards each containing the same 20 pictures: one with bare pictures and the other with superimposed written word distractors. In this proof-of-principle study with two experiments, we report on the test’s development and initial validation. In an age-diverse pool of language-unimpaired individuals, we found the expected interference and repetition priming effects, next to convergent validity.

          "abstract": "Punishment and the threat thereof can enforce social norms by deterring inappropriate behaviours and future misdeeds, but enacting punishment can be costly. As a result, individuals may prefer to outsource costly punishment to others and cultural institutions. We propose that shared beliefs about supernatural punishment, might contribute to minimizing the costs of interpersonal punishment by allowing people to outsource this punishment to supernatural entities. We specifically test in a pre-registered experiment (N = 1603 American and Singaporean adults) whether thinking about karma (a supernatural force that punishes misdeeds) reduces punishment. Results confirm that being prompted to consider karma reduces inclinations to punish selfishness in a Third Party Punishment Game. These findings suggest that karma beliefs may have played a role in the cultural evolution of human cooperation by reducing the costs of human norm enforcement while maintaining incentives for prosocial behaviour through the threat of supernatural punishment.",

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel et al., 2021, 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.",

We find that while a third of consumers collect, very few who do so identify strongly as collectors. Those who identify strongly as collectors are significantly different from most collectors, implying that research focusing only on those who strongly identify as collectors will lead to conclusions which do not provide insights in collecting in general.

          "abstract": "Disgust helps humans avoid potentially pathogenic substances such as bodily effluvia. This reduces illness risks, and is difficult to overcome with cognitive strategies or even through simple habituation in the short term (minutes to hours). Whether habituation emerges in the long-term (months to years) is an unsolved question. Regular professional exposure to disgust elicitors is associated with lower disgust sensitivity and avoidance, but this could be due to selection and survivorship bias. Here, we avoid these limitations by testing a sample of parents (N=99) and controls (N=50) on self-report and behavioural avoidance measures. We used parent-specific items in disgust-sensitivity questionnaires, and child-related stimuli (soiled diapers) in a preferential-looking task. While the control group showed the expected behavioural avoidance, parents of children who were past the weaning stage showed almost no avoidance of stimuli depicting child-related or general bodily effluvia. Curiously, parents whose children had not been fully weaned showed similar disgust avoidance to the control group, even if they had older children who were weaned. These results suggest that parents habituate to disgust induced by faeces in diapers, and that this had generalised to other bodily effluvia. Contrary to our expectations, parents did show disgust avoidance while their (youngest) children were fed only milk, which could point to an adaptive response to reduce the risk of illness in young infants. In sum, continuous exposure to their children’s bodily effluvia inoculates parents to disgust for bodily effluvia, but only after the sensitive milk-feeding stage.",

Drawing on classical (Veblen, Bourdieu) and contemporary theories (behavioral economics, self-psychology, signaling theory), and integrating reflections on the impact of digital media and popular music trends (especially rap and trap), the article highlights how the search for visibility and social recognition can lead to risky behaviors such as indebtedness, pursuit of \"easy success\" models (e.g., online trading), and the commodification of the body through sexual content platforms. The final reflections offer a critical interpretation of the phenomenon and emphasize the need for education aimed at substance, identity resilience and economic awareness.",

Furthermore, a sequences designed to hamper learning in a parsimonious neural network network impair learning in humans. As such, our findings indicate strong qualitative similarities between neural networks and humans in curriculum learning for perceptual decision-making, suggesting the former can serve as a viable computational model of the latter.",

This longitudinal study is the first to investigate changes in self-transcendence across late midlife using life story narratives. \nMethod: We tracked self-reported and narrative identity self-transcendence scores of 163 participants as they aged from M=56.4 (SD=0.95) to M=64.5 (SD=0.94). Participants were 64.4% women, 35.6% men; 55.2% White, 42.9% Black, 1.8% interracial/other; median income was $75,000–$100,000; median education was college graduate. \nResults: Self-transcendence narrative themes of closure and self-actualization increased significantly over time, especially between ages 60–65, but self-reported self-transcendence did not change. These trends were not uniform; race by gender groups exhibited distinct trajectories over time.\nDiscussion: Late midlife is seen as ushering in opportunities for increased self-transcendence, especially acceptance of oneself and one’s life. We found some of the strongest empirical evidence of this phenomenon to date. On average, U.S. Black and White adults narrated their life stories with less regret and more satisfaction with self across late midlife. Findings demonstrate the utility of leveraging first-person narrative identity methods to collect and analyze data about rich, complex personality constructs and highlight positive changes associated with late midlife.",

There is a critical need for a robust, reliable, and contemporary measure to identify populations at risk of avoiding HIV testing, treatment, and prevention, thereby supporting global HIV eradication goals. Method:  Focus groups informed the initial development of the HIV Anxiety Scale (HAS), revised through expert feedback. The factor structure was assessed in two studies. In Study 1, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with 251 participants. In Study 2, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with 200 participants was performed alongside validity, internal consistency, and measurement invariance assessments. Findings: Studies 1 and 2 supported a 3-factor model, resulting in a 16-item measure with the following subscales: Psychosocial Implications of HIV, Lifestyle Implications of HIV, and HIV Testing Anxiety. The HAS demonstrated a good factor structure, acceptable validity and excellent internal consistency across diverse groups in Study 2. Conclusions: The HAS provides a contemporary, robust measure of HIV anxiety, addressing limitations of previous tools and contributing to efforts to identify and support populations at risk of HIV avoidance behaviours.",

          "abstract": "This study evaluated the ability of ChatGPT-4, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, to generate psychological reports using mock data. Two hundred forty-nine licensed psychologists in the United States, rated the quality of AI-generated and human-generated psychological reports across six dimensions: overall quality, readability, writing style, organizational structure, summary quality, and recommendation quality. The study used a counterbalanced design with eight conditions, presenting human or AI-generated reports for ADHD, intellectual disability, depression, and anxiety. Participants then provided ratings of quality through an online survey. Human-generated reports were preferred for their writing style (p = 0.026), organization (p = 0.042), and overall quality (p = 0.036), while the recommendations in AI-generated reports were favored (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found in readability. Participants were more likely to prefer and approve human-generated reports for clinical use (p = 0.042), though the majority expressed discomfort with both types. While AI shows promise in augmenting psychological report writing, particularly in generating recommendations, human expertise remains crucial, especially in summarizing information. These findings highlight the need for professional guidelines on AI use in psychological practice and updated educational curricula to prepare future psychologists for an evolving technological landscape in mental health care.",

          "abstract": "Human infants are limited in their self-guided navigation. Can they nevertheless learn about the places they’ll go? Across three experiments, we tested the role of spatial layout and language on pre-crawling 6-month-old infants’ (N = 96) ability to categorize places in a novelty-preference looking-time paradigm. We found that, when places are labeled, young infants are sensitive to their distinct spatial layouts and can learn place categories. When places’ spatial layouts are disrupted or when places are not labeled, by contrast, young infants cannot learn such place categories. Our results shed new light on young infants’ sensitivities to foundational domains of everyday life prior to their capacity for self-guided exploration.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation often relies on people’s ability to discern in whom to invest their limited resources. One solution to this partner choice dilemma entails estimating one’s fitness interdependence with others. Previous studies indicate that estimates of fitness interdependence (i.e., shared fate) motivate cooperation, but the sources of information that contribute to shared fate remain an elusive question. We examine links among ten sources of interdependence (i.e., attributes and experiences that yoke partners’ fitness), shared fate, and cooperation among the Mayangna, a small-scale horticultural society in Nicaragua. While eight sources of interdependence showed positive bivariate associations with shared fate, only relatedness, commensality, and shared subsistence activities were uniquely associated with higher shared fate. Moreover, shared fate (1) was associated with more cooperation across seven fitness-relevant domains, (2) statistically mediated associations between relatedness and cooperation, and (3) had strong effects on cooperation (i.e., forgoing money to buy rice for a partner). Results indicate that shared fate arises from sources of fitness interdependence and cooperation is proximally guided by shared fate. Estimates of fitness interdependence by way of shared fate may therefore offer a simple solution to partner choice dilemmas: Help partners if one has a positive stake in their welfare.",

We have developed a list of Ten Simple rules to aid researchers to perform data collection on queer individuals, focussing on study design and data dissemination. We address several issues in queer data, such as language use, dealing with small populations, and balancing demands. We also discuss how to extend this inclusive practice for studies on animal populations. These rules are aimed at anybody surveying populations which may contain queer individuals, including for example research studies and inclusivity surveys for conferences.

          "abstract": "Background: Mandatory nutrition labels for out-of-home food consumption have been introduced in several countries to curb rising obesity levels. However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impacts of such policies could have on individuals with eating disorders. This review aimed to summarise the literature on the impact of out-of-home nutrition labels on individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating. Methods: A systematic search across eight databases was conducted up to 11th of October 2023. Studies were included if they assessed the impact of out-of-home nutrition labelling policies on individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating. 538 studies were screened, of which 16 studies met inclusion criteria and were included. Results: The reviewed studies included 5 experimental/quasi-experimental studies, 5 cross-sectional studies, and 6 qualitative/mixed methods studies. Most studies were conducted in Western countries and all study participants were adults. Across studies, eating disorder pathology was associated with noticing labels more frequently, paying more attention to caloric intake, and more frequent behaviour changes due to caloric values. The meta-synthesis identified 5 themes based on the qualitative findings, being drawn to calories, facilitating the eating disorder, reassurance, social eating, and frustration.  Discussion: The current review summarised the existing literature on the impact of out-of-home nutrition label policies on individuals with eating disorders. The evidence suggests that there is cause for concern regarding negative impacts, particularly for those with restrictive eating disorders, which should be explored further by research and considered by policy makers when making decisions on public health policies.",

As she sits in her obstetrician's office, trying to understand the doctor's explanation about amniocentesis, Maria's limited English proficiency becomes a significant barrier. Without an interpreter, she grapples with unfamiliar medical terms and complex risk statistics, leaving her confused and anxious about this critical decision. This scenario, highlighting communication barriers faced by the approximately 25 million limited English proficiency (LEP) individuals in the U.S., is precisely the kind of problem Chipman, Meagher, and Barwise (2023) address in their framework for improving healthcare for LEP populations. However, even if Maria could understand every word perfectly, she would face another, less obvious challenge. Recent research suggests that merely using a foreign language can alter decision-making processes, potentially leading patients to make choices that do not truly reflect their values or risk preferences. While Chipman and colleagues. provide valuable insights on improving access and communication for LEP individuals, here I explore how the cognitive effects of foreign language use might impact patient choices in critical medical decisions, even when linguistic comprehension is not an issue.",

          "abstract": "Climate activists frequently use tactics of direct action, an often disruptive “not asking, just doing” approach where ends and means fall into one. Psychological research often subsumes direct action (e.g., drawing bicycle lanes to establish a bicycle lane) under umbrella terms of radical, non-normative or confrontative collective action (e.g., disrupting traffic to draw attention to a call for a bicycle lane). However, interdisciplinary research on social movements and transition strongly suggests, that witnessing direct action can have different psychological effects than witnessing indirect action. Based on this, we argue that direct actions can increase access to cognitive alternatives when they successfully showcase a concrete mini-utopia (a property of prefigurative politics). Two pre-registered online experiments have been conducted in Germany (N = 645) using a 2(direct/indirect action version) x 3(bicycle, parking or automobility protests) design. We hypothesised and found that direct actions with this prefigurative effect are generally more accepted, elicit more positive emotions, and receive more solidarity compared to similar indirect actions. We also found evidence for a mediated positive effect on evaluations of a traffic-reduced future via identification with the activists and ratings of action efficacy. However, there were no significant effects on policy support. Results support the notion that some direct actions are better than others in communicating a concrete utopia, however the criteria to determine this prefigurative effect require further development. We call for more collective action research to specifically investigate the psychological effects of participation in and witnessing of prefigurative politics.",

This study explored this phenomenon, for the first time, from a language processing perspective. Across three studies, English- and Spanish-native adults completed a translation elicitation task, in which they listened to a series of words from an unfamiliar language (Catalan or Spanish for English speakers, Catalan for Spanish speakers). For each presented word, participants had to type their best-guess translation in their native language. Both English and Spanish natives were surprisingly good at translating unfamiliar words, efficiently exploiting the phonological similarity between the presented (unfamiliar) words and their correct translation. When the correct translation belonged to high-density phonological neighbourhood, participants' ability to benefit from phonological similarity decreased. Spanish participants, whose native language was typologically closer to the presented language, benefited more strongly from phonological similarity than English participants. Overall, we show that speech in an unfamiliar language triggers equivalent dynamics of lexical selection than native speech, providing a psycholinguistic account for homophonic translation.",

For example, in English and other languages, two interpretations commonly available to NPIs are each other's logical duals. \nWe explore the hypothesis that these systematic ambiguities arise due to a bias in the learning process.\nSpecifically, when  a given word is restricted to a specific logical environment (such as the scope of negation), multiple equally `correct' analyses are available to a language learner. Learners might find some of these analyses more attractive than others, explaining why an ambiguity arises when the distributional constraint is relaxed.\nWe employ an artificial grammar learning paradigm to test which interpretations of NPIs are preferred by learners when they encounter NPIs in a positive environment. Our results show strong evidence of a `wide-scope dual' interpretation, although specific properties of the training paradigm may influence these preferences.",

We contend that current practices lead to distorted, only seemingly evidence-based inferences while squandering valuable resources. To mitigate these issues, we propose a 'validity by design' approach that separates measurement validation from substantive hypothesis evaluation. Central to our proposal is the establishment of a collaborative consortium tasked with defining core constructs, systematically validating standardized instruments, and disseminating them through open-access platforms. This coordinated effort — augmented by the active involvement of key thought leaders and targeted funding — will empower the HCI community to foster proactive measurement validation, thereby enhancing both scientific rigor and practical impact.",

          "abstract": "Distributional learning enables listeners to form phonetic categories by extracting statistical regularities from speech input. Younger Cantonese speakers can acquire the Mandarin level-falling (T1–T4) contrast through distributional learning, with bimodal exposure facilitating category formation and unimodal exposure suppressing it, and fine-grained pitch sensitivity predicting success. However, aging is associated with declines in pitch sensitivity and phonetic boundary formation, which may disrupt this process. This study examined whether Cantonese-speaking older adults exhibit distributional learning of Mandarin T1–T4 and whether cognitive factors predict success. Sixty-four participants completed a pretest–training–posttest procedure with bimodal or unimodal exposure. While older adults improved in tone discrimination, no group differences emerged. Further analysis showed those with lower pitch-related auditory memory failed to learn from unimodal input. These results suggest a shift from perceptual encoding to memory-based learning and highlight age-related changes in speech perception and the limits of statistical learning in older adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Fear learning processes are often considered underlying mechanisms in the development and maintenance of various anxiety- and stress-related disorders. However, limited attention has been paid to whether these changes are shared across disorders or certain symptoms. In this context, transdiagnostic research on symptom dimensions is especially relevant, as it addresses the significant symptom overlap and heterogeneity observed in anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In the current study, we investigated attentional processes (late positive potential), defensive responding (fear-potentiated startle), and subjective ratings (US-expectancy) in a transdiagnostic sample of participants with OCD (n=38), social phobia (n=39), specific phobia (n=40), and control participants (n=39). We focused on two transdiagnostic anxiety dimensions: anxious arousal and anxious apprehension. A differential fear learning paradigm using geometrical forms was employed, including a habituation, acquisition, generalization, and extinction phase. We observed successful fear acquisition across all outcomes, which generalized to the stimulus most similar to the CS+. While fear responses to the CS+ decreased during extinction, they remained significantly elevated compared to the CS-. The results revealed no differences between the diagnostic groups for neither phase, stimulus nor outcome measure. On a dimensional level, anxious arousal was associated with an increased shock expectancy to the CS+ during acquisition, while depressive symptoms were associated with a higher shock expectancy for both CS+ and CS- during extinction. The unexpected absence of differences between diagnostic groups, along with the modulating dimensional effects, supports the utility of these transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in unraveling altered fear learning processes in internalizing disorders.",

          "abstract": "We investigated public beliefs about the extent to which mental disorders are perceived to be part of the true self, that is, the set of traits and behaviors that compose one’s core character. We conducted three quantitative vignette-based studies (n = 200) in UK general public samples, considering seven disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)). For each disorder, participants rated how much the disorder reflects the vignette character’s true self, along with perceived causes of the disorders (studies 1 and 2), perceived severity, age of onset, duration, probability of recovery (study 2), and stigmatization (study 3). Disorders differed sharply in the extent to which they were judged to be part of the true self: ADHD, ASD, and OCD received higher true self ratings than major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and schizophrenia, with bipolar disorder intermediate. A disorder was rated more ‘true self’ when it was: perceived more “biologically” caused; perceived less “psychologically” caused; perceived less severe; and recovery was perceived as less likely. Although the extent of stigmatization also varied across disorders, true self ratings did not predict stigmatization. Our results show that the public thinks about different mental disorders in quite different ways, suggesting that different disorders should not be lumped together when considering attitudes and their consequences.",

          "authors": "Claas Pollmanns",
          "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has garnered interest from social and political science researchers alongside its technical dimensions. While technology acceptance has been widely studied, there is a growing need to understand how political ideologies shape public acceptance of AI in an increasingly polarized world. This scoping review synthesizes findings from empirical studies examining ideological differences in the perception and acceptance of AI technologies, with a focus on theoretical explanations for these effects. Using PRISMA guidelines, we applied a systematic search protocol across nine academic databases, identifying 21 relevant articles. We reviewed and mapped the key research themes, constructs, methodologies, results, and theoretical rationales across studies. Our analysis highlights two main explanatory frameworks for the influence of political ideology on AI acceptance: (1) the alignment or conflict between the intended purpose and context of AI technology and the core values of different ideologies, and (2) the heightened sensitivity to threat associated with conservatism, which may reduce acceptance of AI technologies. We integrate perspectives from political and social psychology to expand on these findings, particularly regarding stimulus sampling, threat sensitivity, and ideological orientation. Notably, we observe that study results may be affected by design choices, such as stimulus selection and outcome measures. We advocate for a broader and more diverse array of empirical investigations to rigorously test these two explanations and deepen understanding of ideological influences on AI acceptance.",

However, studies comparing the effects of training curricula between the two have typically focused on the acquisition of multiple tasks. Here, we investigate curriculum learning in a single perceptual decision-making task, examining whether the behavior of a parsimonious network trained on different curricula would be replicated in human participants. Our results show that progressively increasing task difficulty during training facilitates learning compared to training at a fixed level of difficulty or at random. Furthermore, a sequences designed to hamper learning in a parsimonious neural network network impair learning in humans. As such, our findings indicate strong qualitative similarities between neural networks and humans in curriculum learning for perceptual decision-making, suggesting the former can serve as a viable computational model of the latter.",

          "authors": "Alexia Galati; Rick Dale; Camila Alviar; Moreno Coco",
          "abstract": "Collaborative task performance is assumed to benefit from interpersonal coordination of behaviors between interacting individuals. Prominent views of language use and social behavior, including the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM; Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004), endorse this idea by building on tasks that require partners to monitor each other’s perspective (e.g., route planning) and positing that behavioral alignment enables task partners to converge conceptually. However, the role of alignment in tasks requiring complementarity (e.g., a “divide and conquer” strategy during joint visual search) has yet to be explored. We examine this question directly by manipulating task goals (route planning vs. visual search) as forty dyads work with ten trials involving subway maps while their eye movements and speech were co-registered. In five trials, dyads planned a route from an origin to a destination (route planning); in another five trials, they searched for landmarks sharing some feature (visual search). We used Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to examine the temporal relationships between partners' eye fixations and word sequences, generating measures that reveal both similarity and other dynamic relationships. Dyads exhibited more gaze alignment in route planning than visual search across a range of CRQA metrics. When examining the temporal evolution of gaze alignment, we found it to vary across the trial substantially, and its increase influenced accuracy differently over time across the two tasks. Specifically, in visual search, higher increases in alignment at the end of the trial were associated with accurate performance. When we turned to speech data, we found that dyads exhibited longer and more entropic word sequences in route planning but had lower overall word recurrence in that task. This finding suggests that the two modalities organize in a compensatory fashion to optimize distinct task goals.  We suggest that these results support a theoretical framework that is more general than IAM yet has interactive alignment as an emergent consequence of how participants adapt to tasks. This framework emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of coordination strategies based on task demands. Altogether, task goals constrain how people coordinate their behavior and provide insights into how collaborating partners distribute their distinctive multimodal behavior.",

          "authors": "Ross Watson; Stuart Mackinnon; Andrew Haddon Kemp",
          "abstract": "This article explores the traditional martial art of Wing Chun through the lens of psychology, examining its potential to promote inner development and holistic wellbeing. Originating in Southern China and now practised worldwide, Wing Chun is characterised by its emphasis on fluidity, adaptation, and effectiveness. At its core are five guiding principles—Simplicity, Practicality, Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Directness (SPEED)—which shape its practice and reflect its Buddhist and Taoist philosophical roots. We propose that these principles provide a foundation for understanding psychological wellbeing that lay a foundation for developing novel interventions and promoting wellbeing at scale. To articulate this, we introduce a new conceptual framework, REACH, which encompasses five interconnected constructs: Radical nonattachment, Embodied empowerment, (skillful) Adaptation, (self) Control, and (psychological) Hardiness. Radical nonattachment cultivates presence and responsiveness through mindfulness-in-action, facilitating a compassionate awareness of self, others and nature. Embodied empowerment enhances awareness and intuitive decision-making through embodied self-reflexivity, supporting individuals to navigate internal and external cues with greater agency while promoting a deeper sense of groundedness and engagement with the world. Skillful adaptation promotes flexibility and creativity, enabling the experience of psychological flow and supporting practitioners to dynamically engage with their environment. Self-control refines focus and energy management through reflexive, nonconscious regulation, supporting purposeful goal-setting with reduced cognitive effort while cultivating harmony and balance. Psychological hardiness strengthens resilience and fierce compassion, enabling individuals to transform adversity into growth and enhancing capacity for working toward social justice and resisting dominant social narratives. These constructs are presented as power resources, and by bridging martial discipline with mindful awareness and social engagement, we suggest that the REACH model provides a foundation for supporting inner development and holistic wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Measurement is at the core of research in many fields such as psychology. One way that\nresearchers can test the factorial structure of an instrument is to use confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA). When using CFA, researchers evaluate how well the hypothesized structure of a measure\nfits the data. Fit indices, which quantify the degree of misfit, are then used to evaluate the\nfactorial model. Traditionally, researchers have used fixed index cutoff values to judge the\nappropriateness of their factorial models. However, many have discussed the limitations of using\nfixed cutoffs, as fixed values do not generalize to all kinds of models. Recently, McNeish &amp;\nWolf (2023) have developed the Dynamic Fit Index approach (DFI) which enables the\ngeneration of fit index values that are tailored to the characteristics of the model being tested. In\nthe following tutorial, we conduct a CFA on the Attainment of School Achievement Goal Scale\n(A-SAGS) using the lavaan package in R. We then generate fit indices using the dynamic\npackage. We conclude that the DFI approach, although very promising and interesting,\nnecessitates further testing. Dynamic fit indices can be overly strict and do not always agree on\nthe appropriateness of factorial models, which stresses the need to further test its algorithm to see\nwhether it is of practical value when evaluating model fit.\nKeywords: Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Fit evaluation, Fit indices, Dynamic fit.

          "abstract": "Recently, claims have emerged that artificial intelligence (AI) is better at providing empathy than humans. These claims come paired with suggestions that people should use empathic AI to supplement human empathy. This paper critically examines these positions by drawing analogies to two well-established psychological effects. First, I argue that the apparent superiority of AI-generated empathy reflects an analog of the “wisdom of the crowd” effect. This reframes the alleged superiority of empathic AI in a more mundane and less dehumanizing way. Second, I consider whether people should use AI for empathy. Here I draw an analogy to placebo effects, suggesting that even clear utilitarian benefits may not justify the adoption of empathic AI.",

          "authors": "Massimo Lipari; Morgan Sonderegger",
          "abstract": "Quebec French is reportedly developing rhoticity, with low F3 resulting from a bunched or retroflexed tongue (like English /ɚ/), in some or all of its front mid rounded vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/. The source of this rare, understudied sound change is unclear from previous work: contact with English and contrast enhancement have been suggested, and phonologization of coarticulation is typologically plausible. We examine this issue, investigating the apparent time change in the F3 trajectories of the three vowels using generalized additive mixed models on a corpus of parliamentary speech (106 speakers from across Quebec). We observe rhoticity in /ø/ and /œ̃ /: men begin with low F3 in these vowels, and women show change in progress. Conversely, there is less clear evidence of change in /œ/. We suggest these findings are best explained by rhoticity being a two-phased change, originally due to borrowing and subsequently spreading through contrast enhancement. Rhotacization, we argue, is the combined product of intensive exposure to English (which led to frequent non-integration of bunched/retroflex segments in loanwords) and an exceptionally large vowel inventory. It thus results from the unique interplay of social and phonological factors in Quebec French, which is consistent with such changes being cross-linguistically rare.",

          "abstract": "Research has widely examined the motives, strategies, and effectiveness of explicit emotion regulation, yet the reasons for not regulating emotions have not been elucidated. Extant daily life research suggests individuals may choose not to regulate their emotions as often as they are choosing to regulate them. We examined (1) how often people did not regulate their emotions, (2) the reasons why people chose not to regulate emotions, and (3) which contextual factors were relevant to not regulating. Adults in the Midwest (N=179; Mage=35.34, SDage=12.26) completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) five times daily for 14 days, reporting on their largest recent emotional shift over the last three hours, contextual factors regarding this shift, and details about emotion regulation. People reported not regulating about half the time, with the most frequent reasons being that emotions were appropriate or helpful (38%) or were not intense enough (31%). The likelihood of not regulating was associated with more positive affect, less negative affect, greater situational pleasantness, and lower situational importance. People were less likely to regulate when they were alone (versus with other people). This research clarifies an aspect of the emotion regulation process that has been largely overlooked despite frequently occurring. Future research should examine whether reasons are more beneficial than others and if the reasons for not regulating differ across culture and the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Jiin Jung; Timothy Gulden",
          "abstract": "The association between cultural tolerance and collective innovation at the macro level has remained unclear, marked by inconsistent findings. Agent-based simulation has established itself as a powerful research method for unraveling complex macro-patterns that emerge from the simple behaviors and interactions of agents. We posit that influence stemming from minorities who have different domain expertise in workers’ collaboration networks can be pivotal micro-mechanisms for organizational innovation in changing market environments, and cultural tolerance is critical for such minority-induced social innovation. The model includes three key micro-mechanisms: (a) direct majority influence, which allows workers to update their focal opinion in their domain of expertise from same-domain colleagues; (b) indirect minority influence, which allows workers to update their opinion on different domains by learning from other-domain colleagues (often minorities within their collaboration network); and (c) cross-domain consistency, which allows workers to align their opinions across domains to be consistent with one another. A tolerance parameter sets the extent of indirect minority influence compared to direct majority influence, and a consistency parameter determines how much agents make their opinions consistent across different domains. Simulation experiments revealed a sweet spot of tolerance and consistency that produced coordinated innovation diffusion across knowledge domains, ultimately aiding collective adaptation to shifting market demands. Actual organizations involve many simultaneous mechanisms, including ones beyond the scope of this simulation, which is designed to isolate and elucidate the link between indirect minority influence and innovation diffusion. This should be considered among the other factors that promote or inhibit organizational innovation.",

We replicate previous findings that playtime over the past two weeks does not predict well-being, and extend these findings to a wider range of timescales (one hour to one year). Results suggest that relationships, if present, dissipate within two hours of gameplay. Our non-causal findings suggest substantial confounding would be needed to shift a meaningful true effect to the observed null. Although playtime was not related to well-being, players’ assessments of the value of game time—so called gaming life fit—was.

Across two experiments with intelligence analysts (n = 74) and non-experts (n = 175), participants rated the accuracy, informativeness, trustworthiness and usefulness of information varying in source reliability and information credibility conveyed using the Admiralty Code, an information evaluation system widely used in the defence and security domain since the 1940s. Accuracy, informativeness, and likelihood of use were elicited as repeated measures to examine intra-individual reliability. Across experiments, intra-individual reliability was higher when levels of source reliability and information credibility were the same compared to when opposing (one low, one high). In Experiment 2, unreliability was associated with worse performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. Results also show that trustworthiness ratings were more dependent on source reliability than information credibility. Finally, the likelihood of using information was consistently predicted by accuracy ratings, and not by judged informativeness or trustworthiness.  Where possible, samples were diverse in their demographics. The current findings call into question the ability of experts and novices to use information evaluation systems reliably.",

Analyzing 1,578,057 posts from U.S. members of Congress (2019–2023), we found that (1) their overall use of moral language was not influenced by ideology as predicted by Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and (2) they moralized different issues within each moral foundation. For example, Republicans invoked the care foundation to criticize Democratic economic policies, whereas Democrats used it to highlight the harm caused by Trump’s immigration policies.

While narratives naturally capture students’ attention and enhance comprehension through relatable experiences, many struggle with understanding informational texts due to their abstract content, domain-specific vocabulary, and complex structures. Drawing on classroom observations and research, this article identifies three key factors influencing comprehension: (1) world knowledge as a foundation for meaning-making, (2) text features as tools for structural understanding, and (3) decoding skills as essential for processing complex texts. The study highlights the “fourth-grade slump,” where comprehension difficulties arise as students transition to more informational reading, and discusses strategies for integrating informational texts into literacy instruction effectively. By aligning instructional methods with students’ cognitive development, educators can enhance comprehension across genres, bridging the gap between narrative engagement and informational literacy.",

This rich database allowed us to examine not just the effects of various country level characteristics, including linguistic distances, but also their dynamic effects over this time range. We performed this analysis by applying a generalised additive mixed regression model (GAMM) to reveal intricate, non-linear interaction effects, especially those of the three linguistic distance measures we applied, and, more in particular, to map the changing role of morphological distance in relation to lexical and phonological distance. All three distances contributed in explaining L2 English country scores: the larger the distance is the lower L2 English proficiency. Morphological distance delivers its own, distinctive contribution, next to and in competition with the lexical and phonological distances. All three distances interact with year of testing. These changes seem to reflect the increasing presence and dominance of L2 English worldwide, but it shows at the same time that the impact of distance is dynamic. Morphological and phonological properties become more important the higher the L2 proficiency is, while the importance of lexical distance gradually decreases.",

However, few comprehensive scoping reviews on this exist because manually reviewing all the literature is impractical, given the large number of studies. Therefore, this study reviewed the literature on self-compassion using a computer-assisted natural language processing technique called the structural topic model. Methods: We searched for studies on self-compassion from 2003 (the year the concept of self-compassion was first defined in psychology) to July 1, 2024, using the Web of Science Core Collection platform. We applied a structural topic model to the titles and abstracts of 4,395 retrieved papers. Results: In total, 38 nameable topics were identified. Eight clusters were extracted from the network graph, showing the correlation between topics. The clusters included Various Interventions, Distress &amp; Cognition, Eating &amp; Body Image, Mental Health &amp; Well-being, Childhood &amp; Parenting, Caregiving, Sport, and Methodologies. The relationship between topic proportion, year of publication, and academic field of the journal in which it was published was visualized. Conclusions: Using topic modeling, we identified the main topics in previous self-compassion research. Furthermore, connections between topics and transitions in topics from the dawn of research to the present day were revealed. The results provide researchers with an overview of the main topics and history of self-compassion research over the past 20 years.",

          "title": "Reading Literacy Decline in Europe: Disentangling School Closures and Out-of-School Learning Conditions",
          "authors": "Ulrich Ludewig; Rolf Strietholt; Nele McElvany",
          "abstract": "Background. This study examines the decline in average reading literacy among primary school students in European countries between 2016 and 2021, as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) documented. This period is characterized by disruptions due to COVID-19-related school closures and changes in student composition, influenced mainly by societal trends across many European countries.\nAims. We estimated trends in reading literacy adjusted for changes in student composition to assess the relationship between the duration of school closures and school-related learning loess.\nSample. We utilized data from 2016 and 2021 from 18 European countries/regions as part of the PIRLS, involving a representative sample of approximately 5,000 fourth graders per year and country/region (N = 187,386; Mean Age = 10.28, SD = 0.86; 49.50% female).\nMethods. Our analytical approach employed propensity score weighting to balance changes in student composition between the 2016 and 2021 cohorts.\nResults. Our findings revealed changes in student composition across most of the 18 countries/regions. First, the average adjusted decline in reading literacy across all 18 European countries/regions was significantly lower than the observed decline, but it remained substantial. Second, the expected decline was associated with the length of COVID-related school closures, estimated at ‒0.0015 SDs per day.\nConclusions. School closures and changes in the composition of student cohorts played a substantial role in the decline in reading literacy observed between 2016 and 2021. This study enhances our understanding of how student composition and school-related factors influence trends in reading literacy.",

          "authors": "Serena Maria Stagnitto; Floris Tijmen van Vugt; Gabriele Chierchia; Serena Lecce",
          "abstract": "Traditionally, spatial perspective-taking (sPT) has been investigated as an ability to take the perspective of others when explicitly instructed to do so. However, more recent findings suggest that, even in the absence of explicit instruction, people sometimes take the visual perspective of others when observing a visual scene, that is, they engage in spontaneous sPT. To explain why, research has so far focused on features of the visual scene. Here, we focus on the observer. By developing a novel task, the Do You See What I See (DYSWIS) task, across 4 studies (N = 603; age range: 18-36 years), we find that some people are systematically more likely than others to choose the perspective of others across conditions and when tested 2 weeks apart. These individual differences in spontaneous sPT correlate with the ability to take the perspective of others when explicitly instructed to do so and with self-reported empathy in 3 out of 4 studies, while they are not associated with mental rotation or non-verbal reasoning abilities. These associations are stable across different visual scenes, even if some features of the scenes, such as the presence of humans or their implied movement, substantially enhance spontaneous sPT. Taken together, this work demonstrates that people systematically differ in their spontaneous tendency to take the visual perspective of others, highlighting the importance of investigating sPT not only as an ability, but also as a disposition or choice.",

          "authors": "Nikesh Lagun",
          "abstract": "Why do capable, intelligent individuals, even when deeply motivated, stall at the threshold of action? Why does effort fail not from lack of desire, but from something deeper, often invisible? Psychology has mapped attention, modeled emotion, and described motivation. But it has not yet defined the internal structure that makes effort possible. Or not.\n\nThis paper introduces Lagunian Dynamics, a first-principles theory of cognitive Drive based not on metaphor or external reward, but on internal mechanics. At its center is Lagun’s Law of Primode and Flexion Dynamics, a formal equation that models Drive as the interaction of six forces: Primode (ignition), CAP (activation voltage), Flexion (mental adaptability), Anchory (focus tether), Grain (resistance), and Slip (entropy). These variables function within three core domains of effort: Ignition, Tension, and Flux. Together they determine whether performance begins, holds, or breaks apart.\n\nPatterns like procrastination, burnout, and inconsistency are reframed here as structural states. Not motivational failures. Not traits. But measurable misalignments within the system of Drive. The paper defines the variables, derives key corollaries, explains familiar failure modes, and outlines early experimental pathways toward empirical validation.\n\nThis work establishes a new psychological field: Cognitive Drive Architecture. A framework for understanding not just how the mind acts, but how it structurally fails to act. It offers a system we can model, test, and eventually design for.",

          "abstract": "Background: Serial dependencies in perceptual tasks have been suggested to reflect implicit perceptual priors derived from short-term perceptual history. A reduced weighting of perceptual priors has been proposed as a mechanism underlying psychotic experiences such as delusions and hallucinations. Here, we sought to characterize the effects of implicit and explicit perceptual priors on auditory perceptual decision-making and their modulation by psychosis proneness.\n\nResults: Across two online experiments, 197 healthy participants completed an auditory two-alternative forced-choice task and standard questionnaires assessing psychosis proneness. In experiment 1, we assessed serial dependence by quantifying the influence of previous on current perceptual choices. Participants revealed a tendency to repeat previous choices, suggesting they formed implicit priors based on recent choice history. The weighting of these implicit priors correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In experiment 2, we additionally manipulated explicit perceptual priors by providing probabilistic cues before each trial. We found significant effects of both implicit (i.e., choice history) and explicit (i.e., probabilistic cues) prior information, but only the latter correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In both experiments, reliance on sensory information was increased with higher psychosis proneness. Using hidden Markov models, we found no conclusive evidence for a modulation of temporal dynamics of serial dependencies by psychosis proneness. \n\nConclusions: Our findings support the notion of a shift in perceptual inference away from perceptual priors and towards sensory information as a mechanism facilitating psychosis.

          "authors": "Shelly Tsang; Adrienne Wood",
          "abstract": "People’s emotional states often become more similar after social interactions, a process known as emotion contagion. Emotion contagion is considered both a by-product of shared goals and a tool for strengthening social bonds. Although cross-sectional evidence suggests emotion contagion is positively related to bond strength, few studies have investigated this relationship longitudinally as people become acquainted. Perhaps emotion contagion increases as people become closer (a within-dyad effect), reflecting relationship closeness. Or perhaps some dyads have a stable mutual liking and a tendency towards emotion contagion that does not change over time (a between-dyad effect). Our study disentangled these two accounts. Pairs of unacquainted participants had conversations weekly for six weeks. Participants reported pre- and post-conversation emotion states and closeness to their partner after each conversation. Emotion contagion, measured in three different ways, declined over time as dyads became interpersonally closer (evidence for a within-dyad effect). This decline may indicate increased comfort with emotional divergence. Notably, dyads that reported greater average interpersonal closeness exhibited larger changes in emotion states during their conversations, aligning with previous between-dyad findings. Thus, the association between emotion contagion and feelings of interpersonal closeness depends on whether we consider change within a dyad or compare between dyads.",

          "abstract": "Recently, claims have emerged that artificial intelligence (AI) is better at providing empathy than humans. These claims come paired with suggestions that people should use empathic AI to supplement human empathy. This paper critically examines these positions by drawing analogies to two well-established psychological effects. First, I argue that the apparent superiority of AI-generated empathy reflects an analog of the “wisdom of the crowd” effect. This reframes the alleged superiority of empathic AI in a more mundane and less dehumanizing way. Second, I consider whether people should use AI for empathy. Here I draw an analogy to placebo effects, suggesting that even clear utilitarian benefits may not justify the adoption of empathic AI.",

          "abstract": "We investigated public beliefs about the extent to which mental disorders are perceived to be part of the true self, that is, the set of traits and behaviors that compose one’s core character. We conducted three quantitative vignette-based studies (n = 200) in UK general public samples, considering seven disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)). For each disorder, participants rated how much the disorder reflects the vignette character’s true self, along with perceived causes of the disorders (studies 1 and 2), perceived severity, age of onset, duration, probability of recovery (study 2), and stigmatization (study 3). Disorders differed sharply in the extent to which they were judged to be part of the true self: ADHD, ASD, and OCD received higher true self ratings than major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and schizophrenia, with bipolar disorder intermediate. A disorder was rated more ‘true self’ when it was: perceived more “biologically” caused; perceived less “psychologically” caused; perceived less severe; and recovery was perceived as less likely. Although the extent of stigmatization also varied across disorders, true self ratings did not predict stigmatization. Our results show that the public thinks about different mental disorders in quite different ways, suggesting that different disorders should not be lumped together when considering attitudes and their consequences.",

Between-persons, welcoming accountability, personal responsibility, and goal progress satisfaction were positively associated. Results: At the within-person goal-level, welcoming accountability and personal responsibility predicted higher subsequent levels of each other. However, satisfaction with goal progress only predicted subsequent welcoming accountability. Exploratory analysis of goal types revealed that participants reported more accountability, responsibility, and progress satisfaction for approach (versus avoidance) goals. Interpersonal (versus intrapersonal) goals involved greater welcoming of accountability and progress satisfaction.

Across two studies with demographically diverse Polish samples, we found that collective narcissism was positively related to belief in Russian disinformation and both generic and COVID-related conspiracy theories, while a liberal political orientation was negatively associated with these beliefs.

This rich database allowed us to examine not just the effects of various country level characteristics, including linguistic distances, but also their dynamic effects over this time range. We performed this analysis by applying a generalised additive mixed regression model (GAMM) to reveal intricate, non-linear interaction effects, especially those of the three linguistic distance measures we applied, and, more in particular, to map the changing role of morphological distance in relation to lexical and phonological distance. All three distances contributed in explaining L2 English country scores: the larger the distance is the lower L2 English proficiency. Morphological distance delivers its own, distinctive contribution, next to and in competition with the lexical and phonological distances. All three distances interact with year of testing. These changes seem to reflect the increasing presence and dominance of L2 English worldwide, but it shows at the same time that the impact of distance is dynamic. Morphological and phonological properties become more important the higher the L2 proficiency is, while the importance of lexical distance gradually decreases.",

By drawing from insights in neuroscience, this paper explores how these gamified elements stimulate dopamine release, shaping consumer behavior and promoting sustained brand attachment.

          "abstract": "Excessive screen use by preschool children has been shown to negatively affect their well-being and physical, cognitive and emotional development. Although there are many interventions aimed at reducing screen time, most of them have focused on adolescents and adults, leaving a significant gap in the study of strategies aimed at early childhood, especially in those carried out in community-based settings. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review through which we analysed 30 studies on interventions implemented in community-based settings such as playgroups, Head Start Centres, kindergartens, universities, schools, infant centres, daycare centres, childcare centres, community centres, and multisetting early childhood education centres. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of different types of interventions. Thus, those interventions directly addressing screen time reduction might be more effective than those aimed at indirectly reducing the time preschool children spend in front of screens (e.g., fostering physical activities). Moreover, we found that classroom-based, family-based, and multicomponent interventions achieved a success rate of around 50% in reducing screen time. At the same time, interventions that modify preschool children’s physical and social environment, although less common, are fully effective in some contexts, such as childcare centres. The discussion underlines the importance of tailoring screen time reduction interventions adapted to the specific contexts in which preschool children are raised. Also, it highlights the relevance of developing holistic interventions promoting active collaboration between parents, educators, and the broader community in support of preschool children’s well-being.",

To test this assumption, this preregistered study (N = 395) combined a repeated measures experiment with a between-subjects design to explore the prevalence of framing preferences, as well as its potentially moderating role for cognitive effects of episodic versus thematic news frames. Results indicate that an episodically framed news article on the impact of climate change in Africa caused readers to list more thoughts and recall more facts than its thematically framed counterpart – although the latter depends partly on how recall is measured. Contrary to the initial expectations, framing preferences do not moderate news framing effects on knowledge acquisition. In part this may be due to framing preferences being not particularly pronounced among most respondents.",

We aimed at describing how lived experience is altered in ecological anxiety, how it can be differentiated from general anxiety disorder, and generating hypotheses about potential cognitive mechanisms. We collected interview data from 30 participants. Ecological anxiety manifests through various symptoms, such as fatigue, ruminating, bodily symptoms, and disordered sleep. Participants reported feelings of guilt, shame, and anger. We identified two types of ecological anxiety: informational and experiential. A key characteristic of ecological anxiety is marked attitude towards information. Participants also experienced a distorted sense of time, feeling alienated from the future and rushed in the present. This research suggests that while ecological anxiety does amount to a distinct experiential state, it shares similarities with both generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.",

This study explored links between cohort changes in socialization goal norms and the incidence of anxiety disorders in children across 70 countries from all world regions. The World Value Survey provided data on socialization goals, while anxiety disorder incidence rates for 0-19-year-olds were estimated through the Global Burden of Disease study. Additionally, societal development indicators were obtained from the Human Development Report. Mixed-effects models were used to predict anxiety disorder incidence in 70 countries over six study waves (1989-2022). Results revealed expected global shifts towards socialization goals linked to an independent social orientation and away from those linked to an interdependent social orientation. The largest association emerged between religious faith as a quality in children (linked to an interdependent social orientation) and anxiety. When religious faith became less important, anxiety disorder incidence increased. Additionally, changes in the importance of tolerance and thrift were weakly related to changes in anxiety incidence among children. The correlation between thrift and anxiety incidence became insignificant when societal development was taken into account. Overall, a decline in religious socialization, rather than a general shift towards independent social orientations, may explain the increase in child anxiety incidences worldwide. Religion may serve as a protective factor by providing a sense of purpose and relatedness. This analysis underscores the relevance of cultural change for children's healthy development and the need for increased support of children in increasingly secular societies.",

          "abstract": "Building on the notion that media effects depend on different levels of susceptibility, this article argues that individual preferences moderate the cognitive effects of episodic versus thematic news frames. To test this assumption, this preregistered study (N = 395) combined a repeated measures experiment with a between-subjects design to explore the prevalence of framing preferences, as well as its potentially moderating role for cognitive effects of episodic versus thematic news frames. Results indicate that an episodically framed news article on the impact of climate change in Africa caused readers to list more thoughts and recall more facts than its thematically framed counterpart – although the latter depends partly on how recall is measured. Contrary to the initial expectations, framing preferences do not moderate news framing effects on knowledge acquisition. In part this may be due to framing preferences being not particularly pronounced among most respondents.",

          "authors": "Łukasz Sumliński; Agata Sobkow; Jakub Michalik",
          "abstract": "Financial decision-making often involves numerical reasoning. For example, monetary lotteries—a common task in economic psychology—require evaluating payoffs and probabilities. To make decisions consistent with normative standards like Expected Value (EV), individuals must accurately perform calculations. However, many people lack objective numeracy or numeric self-efficacy, which limits their ability to make EV-consistent choices and maximize earnings.\nThis study tested whether brief interventions could enhance financial decision-making and emotional responses during such tasks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Control, Calculation, or Estimation. In the Control condition, participants made choices in ten monetary lotteries. In the Calculation condition, they received instructions on how to compute EV before the task. In the Estimation condition, they were additionally trained in estimation strategies to simplify calculations.\nResults indicated marginal effects of the interventions on both EV-consistent choices and negative emotional reactions. Planned comparisons showed that participants in the Calculation condition made significantly more EV-consistent choices than those in the Control condition. Notably, deliberation time—but not emotional reactions—mediated the relationship between condition and EV-consistent choices. Participants in the Calculation condition spent more time deliberating, which contributed to better decision-making.\nIn summary, the findings provide evidence that teaching EV calculation can improve financial decision-making by promoting deliberation. While the interventions had limited effects, they suggest that even brief educational strategies may support more rational economic choices.",

          "abstract": "In a spatial Stroop task, responses to gaze stimuli are faster when the direction and location are incongruent (reversed congruency effect), whereas responses to arrow stimuli are faster when congruent (standard congruency effect). To explain the reversal of gaze, Tanaka et al. (2024) proposed a dual-stage hypothesis comprising target-background segregation and selective inhibition. This hypothesis predicts that the enhancement of selective inhibition reduces and increases the standard and reversed congruency effects, respectively. As selective inhibition varies on a trial-by-trial basis, we tested the dual-stage hypothesis by examining congruency sequence effects (CSE) in the spatial Stroop task. We analysed the data collected from 409 participants previously tested in our laboratory. The results showed a decrease in the standard congruency effect (standard CSE) and an increase in the reversed congruency effect (reversed CSE) after incongruent trials (N − 1 incongruent) relative to congruent trials (N − 1 congruent). Reaction time distribution analysis revealed that these CSEs emerged from faster responses, suggesting that conflict monitoring in preceding trials enhanced inhibition efficiency in the current trials. These results highlighted the role of selective inhibition in the dual-stage hypothesis. Selective inhibition dynamically changes its size and onset depending on the preceding trial type and contributes to these sequential effects.",

Specifically, we synthesized 233 correlation coefficients from 31 studies and 32 samples (N = 16,977) in 24 countries, conducting a multilevel meta-analysis with the assumption of correlated effects. The meta-analytic correlations of the individual, contextual, and technological factors with AI adoption were moderate, positive, and ranged between r ̅s = .50-.56. Within the three broad categories of factors, the correlations exhibited large overall heterogeneity (I^2 above 98%), which could be partly explained by the diversity of constructs and the student samples’ experience with AI. Usage intentions, self-beliefs, and general attitudes towards AI were the strongest individual factors (r ̅s = .60-.64), whereas social norms and influences were the strongest contextual factors (r ̅ = .56). Perceptions of the usefulness, relevance, and impact of AI technologies were driving technological factors (r ̅ = .56). These results point to the importance of considering individual, contextual, and technological factors when examining students’ AI adoption and highlight the need to explore how to leverage social norms and enhance perceived usefulness to encourage AI engagement within student populations in tertiary education.",

          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives—from customer service and education to creative work and personal productivity—understanding how people interact with these AI systems has become a pressing issue. Despite the widespread use of LLMs, researchers lack standardized tools for systematically studying people’s interactions with LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce GPT for Researchers (G4R), or g4r.org, a free website that researchers can use to easily create and integrate a GPT Interface into their studies. At g4r.org, researchers can (1) enable their study participants to interact with GPT (such as ChatGPT), (2) customize GPT Interfaces to guide participants’ interactions with GPT (e.g., set constraints on topics or adjust GPT’s tone or response style), and (3) capture participants’ interactions with GPT by downloading data on messages exchanged between participants and GPT. By facilitating study participants’ interactions with GPT and providing detailed data on these interactions, G4R can support research on topics such as consumer interactions with AI agents or LLMs, AI-assisted decision-making, and linguistic patterns in human-AI communication. With this goal in mind, we provide a step-by-step guide to using G4R at g4r.org.",

          "abstract": "Stereotype Threat (ST) occurs when individuals primed with negative stereotypes underperform relative to a control group. Activating ST increases anxiety and worries about being negatively perceived, also introducing mental distraction that negatively impacts performance. We consider racial/ethnic ST effects on standardized test performance (SDTP) on the verbal and quantitative reasoning sections of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). Across two experiments, Working Memory Capacity (WMC) is investigated as a mediator and/or moderator of ST for race/ethnicity (Experiment 1, final n = 447, 19% Black, 81% White, 59% Female and for Experiment 2, n = 166, 41% Black, 59% White, 73% Female). We find a lack of strong evidence for the classic ST effect of a race by condition interaction. However, we show evidence that for Black students, higher trait WMC moderates racial/ethnic ST such that higher WMC is associated with higher scores on standardized tests under conditions of race related ST. Our findings suggest the importance of higher WMC for racial minority students in remaining mentally resilient and maintaining performance during ST. Future work should address diversity and inclusion concerns regarding research on ST effects for racial/ethnic minorities, include more work examining racial/ethnic ST based on replication issues and statistical power, as well as more examination of the importance of WMC for performance under racial/ethnic ST. Future work should also consider the roles of protective factors, such as mindfulness and self-regulation practices in the context of racial/ethnic ST as WMC and SDTP have been shown to generally improve through implementing these practices.",

Beyond its well-documented emotional and executive dysfunctions, emerging evidence highlights distinct language processing abnormalities, including difficulties in resolving ambiguity, hyper-literal interpretations, and heightened sensitivity to threatening language. Recent advances in systematic review methodology and computational linguistics reveal gaps in earlier narrative reviews, particularly regarding methodological transparency, heterogeneity across OCD subtypes, and integration of objective linguistic biomarkers. This article synthesizes evidence linking neurotransmitter dysregulation (serotonin, dopamine, glutamate) and frontostriatal circuit abnormalities to language deficits in OCD, while emphasizing the need for rigorous methodologies, computational tools, and stratification by symptom dimensions. Preliminary findings suggest that language deficits may serve as endophenotypes, paving the way for personalized interventions.",

Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) has demonstrated effectiveness against such countermeasures and can thus significantly reduce type-II errors. This study examined the effectiveness of an RSVP-based CIT combined with EEG in detecting ‘concealed knowledge’ of personally familiar faces. We compared the sensitivity of traditional univariate analyses, regional multichannel analyses and multivariate decoding analyses. A total of 29 participants performed an RSVP task in which they searched for a target face while a personally familiar face (one of their parents), or one of two control faces appeared in the stream. Using univariate cluster-based permutation tests on the P300 and P600 components at Pz, personally familiar faces were detected in 18 out of 29 participants, yielding a detection rate of 62.1%. Additionally, increased theta power was observed in response to personally familiar faces, allowing detection in 14 participants (48.3%). Regional multichannel analyses indicated that Pz and surrounding electrodes exhibited the largest familiarity effect, successfully detecting 13 participants (44.8%). Multivariate decoding analyses detected personally familiar faces at the group level, though individual variability remained high. It suggests that multivariate decoding is promising but requires larger datasets than traditional analyses and should focus on central and frontal electrodes to avoid the influence of low-level visual features. Overall, our results highlight the potential of RSVP-based CIT as an effective tool when paired with an optimized EEG experimental paradigms and data-analysis techniques.",

          "abstract": "When describing their emotions, people may demonstrate emotional expertise by differentiating between emotions when using emotional labels or use emotion labels interchangeably to indicate a general valence. The authors develop a novel deep-learning-based method to measure the granularity with which people describe their emotions via language. They investigate the role of emotional granularity in consumer decision making, specifically in relation to coping with negative consumption experiences described in online reviews. Granularity in describing negative emotions is associated with more successful coping with negative experiences. Therefore, especially when the overall experience is negative, in which case coping is most relevant, greater granularity in describing negative emotions predicts more positive ratings of the business. Furthermore, in line with the view that the ability to granularly describe negative emotions is a skill, reviewers progressively become more granular when describing their negative emotions as they write more reviews. Consequently, reviewers progressively provide more positive ratings for negative experiences as they write more reviews. Finally, a greater temporal distance between the consumption experience and the writing of the review predicts greater granularity in describing negative emotions. Consequently, when the overall experience is negative and coping is relevant, a greater temporal distance predicts more positive ratings.",

This study aimed to experimentally induce anger and sadness state-related types of rumination and test their general and specific effects on working memory capacity while considering a set of key moderators: (1) affect, (2) modality, and (3) metacognition. The sample consisted of 65 individuals (average age = 27 years, range 18 – 50) who were randomly allocated to three experimental groups (sad rumination, angry rumination and controls). All participants completed a set of self-reports, experimental induction of rumination (or a control procedure) and two change detection working memory tasks with visual/abstract and nameable shapes. We found a significant positive effect of state rumination on working memory capacity (p&lt;.033). There were no differences between sad and angry rumination groups. We found that the verbal processing task with nameable shapes resulted in higher k estimates than the visual processing with abstract shapes (p&lt;.0000001). Modality, affect (incl. depression) and metacognition did not modulate the effect of rumination on WM capacity.  A secondary Bayesian analysis confirmed these results. This study is the first to experimentally test the effects of sad and angry state rumination on working memory capacity estimates.

          "authors": "Satoshi Kawase",
          "abstract": "Groove, the pleasurable urge to move to music, is influenced by rhythmic and harmonic elements. Little research on groove, focusing on rhythm, has systematically examined the relation between groove and emotional responses. This study investigated how groove is modulated by musical emotions—specifically arousal and valence—by manipulating tempo and chord progressions. A total of 4,982 participants listened to one of 144 musical stimuli that varied in tempo (60–170 BPM) and chord progression (from sad to happy). Participants rated groove, arousal, and valence. Segmented linear regression analysis was used to determine the relations between these variables. An optimal tempo for groove was identified at around 130 BPM, beyond which groove ratings declined. Chord progressions influenced groove in a monotonic manner, with happier progressions leading to higher groove ratings. Analysis of emotional responses revealed that groove was associated with higher valence and moderately high arousal, suggesting an “emotional sweet spot” for groove induction. These findings indicated that groove is systematically influenced by both acoustic (tempo and chord progression) and emotional (valence and arousal) factors. The results suggest that groove is not driven solely by rhythmic anticipation, broadening the current understanding of musical groove and its applications in psychology, cognition, and movement-related activities.",

Data from 278 students were analyzed using traditional statistical methods and fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Results suggest that introversion correlates with reflective learning styles, while extraversion is linked to active approaches.

          "abstract": "Memory maintenance strategies such as visual imagery and rehearsal are widely reported by participants as means to enhance recall and their underlying mechanisms are thought to differ. Visual imagery is believed to engage both visual and spatial aspects of memoranda, while rehearsal is thought to reactivate only the item-specific information, excluding spatial information. In this study, we employed the Looking at Nothing (LAN) effect – in which individuals make eye movements towards the original location of the memorized item during retrieval – to investigate the reactivation of spatial location in both visual imagery and rehearsal. Our findings demonstrate that LAN occurs with both strategies, indicating that spatial information is reactivated during rehearsal as well. Notably, we observed higher immediate as well as delayed memory performance with visual imagery compared to rehearsal. However, the amount of LAN observed for both these strategies remained the same. To further explore whether these differences in the amount of LAN and memory performance were driven by a modulation of the strength of long-term memory (LTM) traces we introduced proactive interference (PI) in a second experiment. PI is known to impact LTM traces, while leaving working memory (WM) intact. While PI led to a decline in WM for visual imagery, the amount of LAN remained the same. These results indicate that visual imagery and rehearsal both reactivate location information and additionally, visual imagery drives eye movements and memory benefits through distinct mechanisms.",

Current evidence lacks insights into sociodemographic differences and potential room for improvement in these determinants, despite this being essential for effective interventions. We aimed to identify the most promising intervention targets for face mask use during COVID-19, across the whole population and stratified by age and education, using novel analytical approaches.\nDesign: Cross-sectional survey of a representative Finnish adult population sample.\nMethods: 2272 adults responded to questions about mask wearing and potential determinants (May 2021). We employed two complementary analytical approaches: Confidence-Interval Based Estimation of Relevance (CIBER), which combines bivariate correlations with univariate distributions, and interpretable machine learning (Categorical Boosted Tree regression with SHapley Additive exPlanations).\nResults: Both analytical approaches identified similar promising intervention targets with some notable differences. Key determinants included injunctive norms (particularly expectations of people present rather than authorities), habit, response efficacy, feeling safe when wearing masks, and perceived disease severity. Age was more influential than education in determining both the relevance of determinants and room for improvement, with older adults showing less room for improvement in key determinants.\nConclusions: Promising intervention targets encompass reasoned, habitual, social, and affective elements. Our findings emphasize the importance of socio-contextual determinants like situation-specific injunctive norms, which are often overlooked in behavior change interventions, and highlight the need to consider demographic differences such as age when designing mask-wearing interventions.",

          "abstract": "English orthography has largely been left to evolve freely across its thousand-year history with little top-down design or reform. Yet modern English spelling has become standardized, even if its standardized spellings are sometimes internally inconsistent. The relative freedom with which English orthography has been allowed to evolve makes it an interesting test-case for exploring whether spelling standardization might arise through a process of positive frequency-dependent selection. To maximize the chance of being understood, it pays for a writer to adopt spelling variants that occur with higher frequency, leading to those forms becoming increasingly entrenched. To evaluate this possibility, we assembled a diachronic dataset of English spelling variation, SpellEng, which we make freely available. SpellEng reports on the frequency of 112,080 spelling variants (across 32,264 lemmata) over the entire history of the English language. We use this dataset along with a model of frequency-dependent selection to estimate the extent to which English standardization can be explained by such a process. Our findings suggest that the past 1000 years of English spelling have been characterized by both positive and negative frequency-dependent selection. We discuss how linguistic dynamics and external events have shaped these periods of stability and change.",

Therefore, we conduct a victimization study and quantify the extent of unemployment stigma and its relationship to self-efficacy using survey data from a representative sample of 2,098 jobseekers. Study 1a finds high levels of acute, daily, and anticipated stigmatization and low levels of stigma internalization, with avoidance being a common behavioral strategy. Study 1b uses k-means clustering and uncovers three distinct profiles of stigma exposure that vary by age, family situation, and receipt of social benefits. Study 1c shows that these profiles predict differences in self-efficacy, independent of key demographic factors. The findings highlight the vulnerability of younger, single, welfare recipients who are most at risk for stigma and low self-efficacy.",

All other things being equal, the adaptation of preferences to match prevalent behavior makes them more likely to be fulfilled and hence confers utility. However, we show that people hold other-regarding second-order preferences (preferences regarding the preferences held by others), which are somewhat independent of first-order preferences, and which affect their preferences for policy changes. In Study~1 we found that, across 19 scenarios, such second-order preferences were consistently more negative than first-order preferences. In Study~2, second-order preferences were associated with subjects judging a policy worse if values were to adapt to it. In Studies 3 and 4, subjects believed others to be more mistaken than they themselves would be about what is good for them, resulting in a greater discrepancy of second-order preferences from predicted first-order preferences.",

          "abstract": "In times of high stress, support from our social networks is essential. This paper tested the influence of close friendships on young adults’ well-being in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (May-October 2020). In a longitudinal study of 28 days (N = 205 participants; 10,088 observations), students with more close friends in college, as reported pre-pandemic, adjusted better to COVID-19 stressors, even when away from campus. Follow-up analyses revealed that this effect could be partially explained by differences in the quality of significant online conversations. Students with many close friends in college benefited equally from important in-person and online conversations. In contrast, those with few close friends experienced higher negative affect and lower positive affect on days when their most important interactions were online vs. in-person. Participants’ number of friends was uncorrelated with their number of online interactions or personality traits. Our intensive longitudinal design also permitted investigation, within individuals, of how online vs. in-person interactions led to feelings of closeness. Personal disclosures emerged as the base of closeness in both types of communications; all participants felt closer to their interaction partners when one of them shared something personal, regardless of whether the interaction took place in-person or online. This effect was stronger for those with few close friends, suggesting that individuals can foster connection in everyday interactions by allowing themselves—and inviting others—to be vulnerable. This research leveraged social network and longitudinal methods to highlight how young adults coped with the COVID-19 pandemic through their friendship networks.",

Using a multinational, six-wave dataset collected during the beginning of the pandemic (Nobservations = 2,954), we hypothesized an interaction whereby spending more time with one’s partner than was typical would lead to increased passion and decreased conflict for LDRRs, but decreased passion and increased conflict for CRRs. However, we found, regardless of relationship type, spending more time with one’s partner led to better outcomes. Nevertheless, LDRRs reported less conflict and more passion than those in CRRs. These associations remained consistent across case-control matched models and models adjusting for theoretically-relevant covariates. While LDRRs navigate periods of uncertainty better than CRRs, spending more time with one’s partner, irrespective of the arrangement, is ultimately beneficial.",

          "abstract": "People sometimes behave differently depending on whether they are interacting online (by email, social media, etc.) vs. interacting in person. Four studies test the hypothesis that when an agent’s behavior is different online vs. in person, people think that the online behavior is less reflective of who the agent truly is deep down. Study 1 found that the very same behavior is regarded as less reflective of the true self when it is performed online. Study 2 showed that this effect is not merely a matter of perceived impression management. Study 3 found that there is a general tendency such that behavior is seen as more reflective of the true self when it is performed in an environment regarded as “natural.” In Study 4, a manipulation that led participants to see online behavior as more natural had a downstream effect on the degree to which this behavior was seen as reflecting the true self. Taken together, these results suggest that people’s judgments about online behavior are not simply a reflection of idiosyncratic facts about the online sphere in particular but are instead driven in part by a far more general psychological process involving perceptions of naturalness.",

          "abstract": "Blinded review is often proposed as a solution to inequities in merit-based evaluations. We tested this claim in a high-stakes field experiment comparing single-blind review (reviewer identities withheld) and double-blind review (reviewer and author identities withheld) for 530 academic conference submissions. On reliability, both processes showed moderate reliability, leading to only 40\\% overlap among top-rated submissions. This low overlap indicates that differences between review systems partly stem from noise in the review system. In terms of fairness, our analysis indicates that single-blind reviews favored more senior coauthors and first authors who were Ph.D. students or research scientists, while disfavoring Asian (vs. White) first authors. Meanwhile, male first authors received slightly higher ratings in both conditions (especially under double-blind), but the greater the proportion of male coauthors, the lower the review ratings were under double-blind (vs. single-blind). On validity, we find that for submissions accepted and presented as a talk, neither review ratings nor author characteristics predicted talk quality, number of questions, or attendance. However, review ratings from both systems similarly predicted judged poster presentation quality (for a subset of submissions) and eventual publication (for all submissions). These findings highlight limitations in both single- and double-blind approaches. Double-blind review is not a cure-all for inequities that might arise via single-blind. Yet, including author identities does not appear to enhance reliability or validity enough to justify the risks this information poses in potentially advantaging a particular individual or group.",

Participants were selected via convenience sampling. A total of 310 participants enrolled and 273 participants were included in the final analysis.\n\nExposure: To assess tobacco retail exposure, mobility data collected objectively via geolocation tracking was matched with locations of tobacco retailers across three states.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Daily average craving and daily number of cigarettes smoked, reported via ecological momentary assessment.\n\nResults: Multilevel models revealed support for both pre-registered hypotheses.

To test this question, we used a set of miniature artificial languages with different degrees of structural systematicity, from fully random to fully systematic, and two types of frequency distributions, skewed and uniform. The results from 80 adult native speakers of English show that systematicity facilitates learning: the mean transmission error decreases as the input systematicity increases. Frequency distributions play an important role in the systematicity of the output language, but, contrary to some previous findings, this factor alone does not drive regularization. Learners increased the systematicity of the learned language only when they were exposed to a high degree of regularity in the input. Systematicity is, therefore, critically determined by the patterns in the language input, and not by some independent pressure to regularize.",

This form of counterfactual reasoning critically relies on a mental self-model: a simplified schema of one’s own cognition, which specifies expected perceptual and cognitive states under different world states and affords better monitoring and control over cognitive resources. Here I propose to use inference about absence as a unique window into the structure and function of the mental self-model. In contrast to commonly used paradigms, using inference about absence bypasses the need for explicit metacognitive reports. I draw on findings from low-level perception, spatial attention, and episodic memory, in support of the idea that self knowledge is a computational bottleneck for efficient inference about absence, making inference about absence a cross-cutting framework for probing key features of the mental self-model that are not accessible for introspection.",

Results show that language-mediated abstraction (the ability to generate increasingly more general words starting from a prompt) improves over time, is independent of age, and characterizes both, concrete and abstract concepts. However, abstract concepts used as prompts stimulate children to construct shorter ladders. Additionally, variations in abstraction pathways were observed across development, with extra-semantic relations, beyond taxonomic ones, being most prominent in children of intermediate ages and for abstract and emotional words. These findings support theories distinguishing concreteness and specificity as distinct aspects of the general notion of abstraction, both of which effects category formation and organization.",

Individuals involved in collective action problems are often considered to have two options: contribute towards a public solution or free-ride. But they might also choose a third option of investing in a private solution such as local climate change adaptation. Here we introduce a collective action game featuring wealth inequality caused by luck or merit and both public and private solutions with participants from 34 countries. We show that the joint existence of wealth inequality and private solutions has a consistent effect across countries: participants endowed with higher income choose the private solution almost twice as often as those endowed with lower income; and this finding cannot be explained by different sources of wealth (luck vs. merit) or by cultural or economic factors. We also show that preferences for private solutions undermine support for public solutions, resulting in wealth inequality increasing in every country. In contrast, we identify two universal pathways to successful public solution provision: early contributions to public solutions and conditional cooperation. Our findings highlight the ubiquity of the ‘private solution problem’ and its potential consequences for global collective action problems.",

          "abstract": "Emotional intensity seems to be related to the selection of emotion regulation (ER) strategies. Previous studies have focused primarily on intrapersonal ER. In contrast, everyday use of interpersonal ER remains understudied, with the association between perceived emotional intensity and selection of intra- or intrinsic interpersonal ER still unclear. In a preregistered study, we used experience sampling method data from a community sample of individuals in a heterosexual relationship (n = 183) who provided reports on their daily lives over a period of 4 weeks during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Surveys included questions about various emotions, their perceived intensity, and selected ER strategies. Results revealed more frequent use of ER overall with increasing emotional intensity of all negative emotions (except for boredom). In line with our hypothesis, results showed that greater emotional intensity increased the probability of interpersonal ER more strongly than intrapersonal ER for most negative emotions, in both women and men. Additionally, we found that men used significantly more intrapersonal than interpersonal strategies at average emotional intensity of all negative emotions. A preference for interpersonal ER in the face of highly intense emotions may be related to a higher demand for resources, which is compensated through social connection. In the association between perceived emotional intensity and ER selection, our research highlights the importance of considering both intra- and interpersonal ER strategies.\n\n©American Psychological Association, 2025.

          "abstract": "Humans have developed a sophisticated system of cultural transmission that allows for complex,\nnon-genetically specified behaviours to be passed on from one generation to the next. This\nsystem relies on understanding others as social and communicative partners. Some theoretical\naccounts argue for the existence of domain-specific cognitive adaptations that prioritise social\ninformation, while others suggest that social learning is itself a product of cumulative cultural\nevolution based on domain-general learning mechanisms. The current paper explores the\ncontribution of humans’ unique ontogenetic environment to the emergence of social learning in\ninfancy. It suggests that the prolonged period of post-natal dependency experienced by human\ninfants contributes to the development of social learning. Because of motor limitations, infants\nlearn to interact with and act through caregivers, establishing social learning abilities skills that\ncontinue to develop as children become less dependent. According to this percpective, at least\nsome key aspects of social development can be attributed to a developmental trajectory guided\nby infants’ early motor development that radically alters how they experience the world.",

          "abstract": "Creative processes of semantic extension play a key role in language change, grammaticalisation, and (by hypothesis) the early origins and evolution of language. In this paper we report two dyadic interaction experiments studying the semantic extension of novel labels in controlled circumstances. We find that participants can use salient and shared associations in their perceptual environment (between colours and shapes) to bootstrap a communication system, and can then extend those labels figuratively, to convey both concrete and abstract targets, by exploiting shared understandings such as colours associated stereotypically with specific objects and emotions. By manipulating the presence of reliable statistical associations between colour and shape early in this process we show that such shared associations facilitate both an initial semantic extension and subsequent chaining of extensions; we also find that extensions relying on less certain grounding (e.g. between colours and emotions) lead to greater variability in how extensions are made. Our method can be used to test the creative processes of semantic extension under controlled conditions, and provides experimental purchase on the relationship between association and extension which have only previously been studied through correlational means.",

          "abstract": "Peripheral vision plays a crucial role in visual recognition, with previous studies suggesting that cognitive predictions from peripheral vision enhance object categorization in central vision during single eye-fixation. However, visual recognition is dynamic, alternating between ocular fixations and saccades to new objects of interest. In three eye-tracking experiments, we explored how predictions extracted from the peripheral scene context influence the gaze-based detection of target objects in peripheral vision. We presented both an object and a scene in peripheral vision and instructed participants to make a saccade toward the object if it belonged to a predefined target category, or to maintain central fixation if it did not. We manipulated the semantic congruence between the peripheral scene and the target category, and we measured its effect on saccades. Across the three experiments, the results consistently showed that a scene congruent with the target category triggered erroneous saccades toward the distractor object. Experiment 2 revealed that the congruence effect was amplified when the scene was presented before the object, suggesting that the visual system accumulation of information about the peripheral scene contributed to generating predictions and thus more saccades towards the peripheral object. Experiment 3 confirmed that this effect was not due to a visual grasp reflex and that the response was based on the integrative processing of the object within the scene. This study demonstrated that the peripheral scene context, although irrelevant to the task, was automatically processed and used to form predictions that trigger saccades toward expected objects in peripheral vision.",

          "authors": "Amir Jahanian Najafabadi; Kayser Christoph",
          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that our perception of time is tied to the embodiment of space. They suggest that time is perceived or reproduced differently for stimuli at different distances from our body, and differently prior to and after an interaction with space using tools. To corroborate these findings, we performed a series of experiments in physical and virtual setups, testing 282 younger (18-35 years) and elderly (60-75 years) participants on a time reproduction task for stimuli presented at three distances (60, 120 &amp; 240 cm). In between testing sessions participants performed tool-use training and either used physical or virtual tools to manipulate objects at distances between 120 and 200 cm. For young participants, prior to training the reproduced intervals were significantly longer for stimuli at an intermediate distance (120cm) compared to near the body (60cm), though this effect was not observed for the elderly. For young participants, tool-use training significantly shortened the reproduced intervals for stimuli at 120 cm, hence the distance at which tool-use training was operated. This effect was again absent in the elderly, resulting in a significant group-difference. In both groups, participants' sensitivity to the presented intervals did not differ between distances prior to training, but was significantly reduced by tool-use training systematically at all distances. We observed qualitatively similar results for experiments in physical and virtual setups but the effect sizes were generally small, pointing to systematic but weak effects. Overall, this supports previous claims that time perception is tied to space and our interaction with this when we are young, though further work is required to understand the robustness and specificity of these effects.  \n\nKeywords: Time perception, Peripersonal Space, Space Representation, Active Tool-use, Aging",

          "abstract": "Political scandals can shape entire elections and political structures within society. Scholars have long pointed to different strategies politicians can use to respond to such scandals—finding strategies like denying may be more effective than apologizing. However, a recent trend suggests politicians increasingly respond to accusations of scandal by emphasizing how they (or their political in-group) have been victimized. These victimhood strategies may be highly effective by garnering sympathy and reducing blame, but have yet to be studied in political scandal research. Across 3 studies in the United States (N = 2,541), we show that when politicians respond to scandal accusations by emphasizing their own (or their political in-group’s) victimhood, participants see them as more moral and less responsible for the scandal. Additionally, people are more sympathetic to politicians emphasizing victimhood as compared to apologizing and control conditions. Victimhood strategies do not reduce competency evaluations—potentially making these strategies especially effective. While responding by highlighting victimhood is less effective than denial, victimhood strategies positively benefit reactions to scandalized politicians with people from across the ideological spectrum. Further these strategies work similarly well for male and female politicians. These findings underscore how responding to scandal with victimhood can significantly and positively influence the publics’ perceptions of a scandalized politician—highlighting the powerful influence of victimhood in political scandal research.",

          "authors": "Kodai Kusano; Waleed Jami",
          "abstract": "Cross-cultural researchers often compare mean scores across cultures using subjective Likert scales, but this approach faces several methodological challenges. One alleged problem is the reference group effect (RGE), which posits that varying normative standards distort cultural comparisons, potentially suppressing or even reversing true differences. In this study, we revisit this issue and challenge its premise. Leveraging data from three large-scale international datasets, we examined the relationship between subjective socioeconomic status (SES) and its external criterion, national wealth (GDP per capita). According to the RGE, respondents’ judgments based on their local peers would result in individuals from wealthy countries rating themselves as less affluent and those from developing countries rating themselves as relatively more affluent. Such biased evaluations would suppress true differences, leading to a null correlation between SES and GDP across countries. However, our findings consistently revealed a strong positive correlation: respondents from wealthier countries rated themselves higher, while those from developing countries rated themselves lower. The majority of respondents appear to interpret numerical anchors of Likert scales in a single, universal, and absolute manner—“middle class” carries the same meaning regardless of varying economic standards. This consistent interpretation enables valid cross-cultural differences to emerge. Our findings encourage cross-cultural researchers to interpret observed cultural differences with greater confidence when using Likert scales.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) have become a popular data format to capture people's momentary affect in everyday life. Besides describing persons' average affect over time, ILD are also often used to describe affect dynamics - that is how affect changes over time -, such as intraindividual variability or moment-to-moment temporal dependencies. Given that ILD studies mostly use self-report rating data, there is an increasing concern that response biases, such as extreme responding, might impact the estimates of affect dynamics. In this study, we assessed the relationship between extreme responding and affect dynamics in a controlled experiment. In a highly powered sample with N=1,398 persons, we measured extreme responding using background questionnaires, and repeatedly induced affect using a probabilistic reward task with T=140 trials per person. Our results suggest that people with high extreme response style trait levels show substantially higher measures of affect variability. However, extreme responding is neither associated with moment-to-moment temporal dependencies nor with participants' reactivity to affective stimuli. We conclude with a discussion on the importance of evaluating measurement in ILD for psychological assessments, and outline potential areas for future research to improve assessments of affect dynamics.",

Several TSST adaptations for the presentation in virtual reality (VR) have been introduced and evaluated recently. Here we describe a freely available version, the Open TSST-VR. In two independent studies, we evaluated subjective, endocrine, and heart rate responses to the Open TSST-VR compared to an active control condition. In study 1, 50 men were randomly assigned to the Open TSST-VR or the control condition. Compared to the active control condition, the Open TSST-VR induced higher levels of subjective stress and significantly more cortisol responders. In study 2, we employed a balanced within-subject design comparing groups of 46 men and women. Again, the TSST-VR induced more stress than the control condition and a stronger cortisol response, but there were also order-effects suggesting that the TSST-VR is less suitable for within-subject comparisons. In both studies, we observed a substantial stress level (and cortisol responders) in the control condition indicating that future studies should further elaborate on non-stressful control conditions, either without any task or non-stressful active components. Overall, the Open TSST-VR is a versatile tool for collaborative experimental stress research that offers flexibility to a broad range of future research questions among various disciplines.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the neural effects of perceptual (caused by blur processing) and sexual ambiguity (induced by morphing manipulation) in facial images via event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency analysis. Gaussian blur and morphing of male and female faces were used to create gradually ambiguous face images, and participants completed a sexual dimorphism judgment task. Results revealed that the N170 was strongly affected by blur, which suggested that it disrupted the structural encoding of faces. The EPN exhibited a different response compared with the N170, which indicated that it may reflect both bottom-up processing due to lack of visual cues and top-down processing driven by the sexual dimorphism judgment task. Additionally, LPP amplitude increased under conditions of explicit perceptual and sexual faces, which confirmed that ease of interpretation in sexual dimorphism judgments influenced neural responses. Furthermore, the time-frequency analysis revealed that high-frequency gamma activity at approximately 200 ms was associated with extracting and evaluating facial features, whereas activity after 600 ms reflected processes related to retaining facial information. These findings suggest that visual processing and semantic evaluation of faces rely on complex mechanisms influenced by both the clarity of physical cues and task context.",

The aim of the present research was to assess whether older readers make use of lexical prediction by investigating whether they demonstrate processing costs for incorrect predictions in a controlled experimental design. The eye movements of a sample of older adults (60-86 years) were recorded as they read strongly and weakly constraining sentences containing a predictable word or an unpredictable alternative that was either semantically related or unrelated. To determine whether predictive processing depends on the stimuli presentation format, a second experiment presented the same materials in a self-paced reading task in which each word of a sentence appears one at a time at the readers’ own pace. Older adults showed processing benefits for expected input on eye-movement measures of reading. They also showed processing costs for unexpected input across both methodologies but only when semantically unrelated to the best completion. Taken together, the results suggest that the use of predictive processes remains relatively preserved with age. The implications of these findings for understanding whether prediction is a fundamental component of online language comprehension are discussed.",

This study used multiple-group latent curve modeling to assess anxiety symptom trajectories in a sample of 367 high school students (Mage = 14.05 years; 22% [n = 79] LGBTQ, 78% [n = 288] cisgender heterosexual) over five waves during 9th and 10th grade. Results indicated that LGBTQ adolescents entered high school with significantly higher anxiety symptom levels than their cisgender heterosexual peers but experienced a significant linear decline in anxiety symptoms over time. In contrast, anxiety symptoms remained stable for cisgender heterosexual adolescents. Additionally, for both groups, initial levels of self-esteem predicted lower initial anxiety symptoms and steeper declines in anxiety symptoms; however, its association with later anxiety symptoms weakened for LGBTQ adolescents. These findings suggest that LGBTQ adolescents experience significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms compared to their cisgender heterosexual peers as they transition through the first years of high school but that these increased levels of anxiety symptoms can be mitigated by the bolstering of a more robust self-esteem.",

Unlike traditional resilience approaches that may require extended practice or external support, this framework enables individuals to transition between emotional awareness and analytical thinking within minutes. Through systematic examination of case examples across various contexts, the research demonstrates how cognitive malleability combined with strategic analysis can transform potentially overwhelming situations into manageable challenges. The framework's distinctive elements—including \"stepping out\" visualization, trigger questions, and the detective metaphor—provide accessible tools for navigating the critical transition between emotional reactivity and strategic effectiveness. This study addresses a significant gap in resilience literature by focusing on the specific mechanisms that facilitate rapid state transitions during challenging situations.",

          "abstract": "Dysphoria is associated with dampening of social interaction intention, but the cognitive mechanisms that underpin this relationship are under-investigated. This study tested the hypothesis that heightened negative social expectancies mediate the association between dysphoria and dampened social motivation. Additionally, it tested the hypothesis that the association between dysphoria and negative social expectancies is mediated by an attribution style bias that attributes negative, but not positive, outcomes to internal causes. University students (N = 271) with varied levels of dysphoria read vignettes describing situations where they initiate a social interaction that results in positive or negative outcomes. Participants rated their expectancies concerning the likelihoods of these outcomes, and their expected emotional impact. Participants also forecast the emotions they would experience and reported the degree to which they attribute each outcome to internal factors (themselves) or to external factors (the other person/circumstance). Finally, participants reported their intention to seek social interaction in similar future situations. Results showed that negative biases in outcome likelihood and emotional impact expectancies both independently mediated the association between dysphoria and deficits in social interaction intention. Furthermore, negative internal causal attribution bias mediated the association between dysphoria and each type of expectancy bias. Dysphoria’s association with negative internal causal attribution style converged with negative affective forecasts, reflecting greater self-focused negative emotions (humiliation, guilt, helplessness) and reduced self-focused positive emotions (pride). Findings indicate the utility of assessing dysphoria-linked biases in outcome and emotional impact expectancies and highlight the importance of attribution style bias in dampening social motivation in dysphoria.",

          "authors": "Raihan Alam; Tage Rai",
          "abstract": "Punishment is a critical mechanism through which society regulates behavior, yet its effectiveness depends on how observers interpret both the legitimacy of punishers and the morality of the act being punished. Across four experiments, we examine how moral agreement with a perpetrator’s behavior influences perceptions of punisher legitimacy and deterrence. Study 1 finds that when observers morally agree with a perpetrator, they perceive punishers as less legitimate and view punishment as less deterrent. Study 2 shows punisher legitimacy has only a mixed effect on moral evaluations and deterrence. Study 3, using a 2x2 design, finds moral agreement, but not punisher legitimacy, predicts deterrence. Study 4 replicates these effects in a criminal sample. Our results suggest deterrence is deeply intertwined with the morality ascribed to an act, superseding punisher legitimacy. These findings challenge traditional deterrence and procedural justice models, highlighting the importance of addressing moral disagreement in legal and policy contexts.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms following the transition to high school are a challenge faced by many adolescents, yet few studies have examined its longitudinal development—especially among LGBTQ adolescents who face unique minority stressors. This study used multiple-group latent curve modeling to assess anxiety symptom trajectories in a sample of 367 high school students (Mage = 14.05 years; 22% [n = 79] LGBTQ, 78% [n = 288] cisgender heterosexual) over five waves during 9th and 10th grade. Results indicated that LGBTQ adolescents entered high school with significantly higher anxiety symptom levels than their cisgender heterosexual peers but experienced a significant linear decline in anxiety symptoms over time. In contrast, anxiety symptoms remained stable for cisgender heterosexual adolescents. Additionally, for both groups, initial levels of self-esteem predicted lower initial anxiety symptoms and steeper declines in anxiety symptoms; however, its association with later anxiety symptoms weakened for LGBTQ adolescents. These findings suggest that LGBTQ adolescents experience significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms compared to their cisgender heterosexual peers as they transition through the first years of high school but that these increased levels of anxiety symptoms can be mitigated by the bolstering of a more robust self-esteem.",

We compared performance on traditional explicit tasks and an implicit anticipatory looking mentalizing task in children with CdLS (N=9), boys with FXS (N=9), autistic (N=22) and neurotypical (N=34) children. The groups showed divergent patterns of performance. Neurotypical children had higher explicit mentalizing scores than all other groups. However, neurotypical, FXS and CdLS groups showed better implicit mentalizing performance than autistic children. Both chronological age and receptive language ability correlated with explicit mentalizing scores in neurotypical children. In autistic children, there was an association between explicit mentalizing score and receptive language ability but not chronological age. Explicit mentalizing score was not associated with receptive language ability or chronological age in the CdLS and FXS groups. Neither chronological age nor receptive language ability correlated with implicit mentalizing task performance in any group.  Despite having intellectual disability and autistic characteristics, findings demonstrate that children with CdLS and FXS are skilled at spontaneously mentalizing.",

This gradient system helps promote flexibility, deal with ambiguity, and maintain plasticity. While the exact sources of gradiency are not well understood, prior work suggests it may be a product of statistical learning: Listeners exposed to more variable input show shallower categorization slopes. However, the tasks used in earlier work are ambiguous regarding what this slope represents. We investigated the role of phonetic variability as a causal driver of gradiency across three experiments, using a distributional learning paradigm in conjunction with the visual analog scaling (VAS) task, which resolves this ambiguity. In 2024, participants were trained on distributions of voice onset time with either high or low variance, and gradiency was assessed with the VAS task. Experiment 1 (n=84) suggested that variance  increased trial-by-trial inconsistency not gradiency. Experiment 2 (n=168) utilized 28 items to better generalize across stimulus characteristics and found robust evidence for increased gradiency due to variability. Experiment 3 (n=85) introduced a baseline (no learning) condition and ruled out the alternative explanation that listeners were adapting to low variance by becoming less gradient. Together, these support the idea that variable input promotes gradiency.",

          "abstract": "The majority of reading research takes place in high-income ‘Minority World’ countries where children typically begin learning to read in early childhood. This research, however, does not reflect the experience of many children around the world who learn to read later in childhood or in adolescence. Crucially, children who learn to read later in life may rely on different cognitive systems. Specifically, procedural learning, which supports sequence and pattern learning, reaches maturity around early adolescence, while declarative learning, which supports the arbitrary mapping of form and meaning, continues to develop into adulthood. The declarative/procedural model of learning posits that the role of declarative learning increases as an individual ages, and as it matures will overlap, and compete, with typically procedural supported learning. Therefore, declarative supported learning may lead to poorer outcomes for older first-time readers. This study examined the potential competition between procedural and declarative learning among emergent readers (n = 88) in rural Cote d’Ivoire, aged 10-16. We examined performance on culturally-appropriate declarative and procedural memory tasks, and found that declarative learning competes with procedural learning, such that stronger declarative memory negatively impacts the development of early reading skills. These findings are important for understanding the role of learning systems, and their interaction with age, in supporting literacy development.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

However, confirmatory methods for group network comparison are limited by practical constraints, such as the computational intractability of the Ising model in large networks. In this study, we demonstrate how to estimate causal effects on network state and strength when direct network estimation is not feasible by leveraging the mathematical equivalencies between the Ising model and item response theory (IRT) models. We demonstrate through simulation that a two-parameter logistic (2PL) explanatory IRT model can simultaneously recover causal effects on network state and strength. We first apply the method to a single empirical example of a vocabulary assessment from a content literacy intervention to demonstrate model building and interpretation strategies. We then replicate our approach with 72 empirical datasets from randomized controlled trials with item-level outcome data in education, economics, health, and related fields. Our results show that causal effects on network strength are both common and uncorrelated with effects on network state, suggesting that causal network models can provide new insight into the impact of interventions in the social and behavioral sciences.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety is a pervasive phenomenon that negatively impacts individuals’ ability to perform mathematical tasks, yet its implications for functioning in a society where math is often helpful if not necessary remain underexplored. This study examines the relationships between math anxiety, financial anxiety, and financial literacy in a nationally representative sample of young adults in the U.S. (n = 393). As math anxiety and financial anxiety have previously been linked to avoidance of mathematical and financial content, we also examined the role of avoidance in their relationships to financial literacy. Consistent with prior research, math anxiety, financial anxiety, and gender were related to financial literacy. Further analysis revealed that math-anxious individuals and women showed a greater tendency to avoid responding to financial literacy questions. These findings clarify math and financial anxiety’s negative association with financial literacy and suggest that a tendency to avoid financial content may help to explain the link between math anxiety and financial literacy. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the implications of math anxiety for young people’s educational and financial lives and offers insight into the mechanisms that underlie these relationships. Insights for interventions targeting math anxiety and their potential for boosting financial literacy are discussed.",

These research questions are commonly investigated using panel data obtained at relatively large time intervals of months or years and with measurements referring to the past week, month, or year. In this article, we investigate to what extend panel data can be used to study a causal mechanism when the causal process is assumed to play out at a (much) faster timescale than that at which the panel data were obtained. Specifically, we used simulations to study the impact of time aggregation (i.e., aggregating scores over multiple occasions) and systematic\n(under)sampling (i.e., when parts of the ongoing process are not covered with the measurements) on the ability of popular dynamic models to approximate the effects of a time-varying exposure on a time-varying outcome in three different scenarios. The results show that time aggregation and systematic (under)sampling can lead to severe over- and underestimation of the causal effect, implying that wrong (and potentially harmful) conclusions can be draw. We discuss the implications of these findings for applied researchers.",

On each trial of the Event Ranking Task, participants were asked to provide a ranking for an event set consisting of four events, A, not-A, B, and not-B, in terms of their perceived likelihoods. Qualitative predictions were formally derived by assuming direct sampling from a fixed underlying probability distribution. Adding read-out noise in the sampling process – as suggested in the Probability Theory plus Noise model (Costello &amp; Watts, 2014) – did not change the qualitative predictions.

          "abstract": "Menstruation in the workplace is common but has, to date, received little attention. Guided by theories of femmephobia and dirty femininity, we explored cis-men’s perceptions of menstruation in the workplace in three European countries: Croatia, Germany, and Italy. Semi-structured interviews with 21 cis-men office workers and thematic analyses uncovered pervasive beliefs and attitudes that contribute to menstrual stigma at work. These included beliefs that menstruation is taboo and irrelevant to the workplace, and that talking about menstruation uncomfortable and therefore menstruation should be concealed. Additionally, findings demonstrated how menstruating individuals are seen as emotionally instable and weak. Overall, our findings extend applications of femmephobia to feminine experiences in the workplace and additionally broaden theorising about dirty femininity to include menstruation. Interventions that promote contact between menstruators and non-menstruator and induce empathy are recommended, as are educational campaigns to decrease menstrual stigma and overcome taboos surrounding menstruation at work.",

          "authors": "Jussi Jylkkä; Aila Mustamo",
          "abstract": "Rationale. Anecdotal evidence suggests that psychedelic researchers often have personal experiences with psychedelic substances. While such experiences may benefit research, concerns have been raised about potential biases and \"excessive enthusiasm.\" However, the prevalence of personal experiences, their perceived relevance, and their association with opinions about psychedelics remain underexplored.\n\nObjectives. This study aimed to investigate how common personal psychedelic experiences are among psychedelic researchers, their perceived relevance to research, and whether personal use is associated with opinions about psychedelics.\n\nMethods. Participants (N = 111) conducting psychedelic research in academic settings were recruited. Data were collected on personal experiences, their perceived relevance, and opinions about psychedelics. Regression analyses examined associations between personal use and opinions.\n\nResults. Most respondents (85%) reported personal experiences with classic psychedelics. Personal use predicted more positive opinions about psychedelics’ potential to improve well-being, transform society, address the ecological crisis, and answer spiritual questions (regression βs = .3 – .5, ps &lt; .01). For 72%, personal experiences had sparked interest in psychedelic research, and 67% found personal experience as helpful for research. Many expressed the need to disclose and discuss personal experiences but found it challenging in practice.\n\nConclusions. The findings highlight the prevalence of personal psychedelic experiences among researchers and their influence on research interests and opinions. The results underscore the need for open discussion and reflection. Future studies should explore whether the observed associations reflect causal relationships or potential biases.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Self-harm is a leading cause of death and injury worldwide and is especially common amongst adolescents. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are characterized as a risk factor for self-harm within the Integrated-Motivational Volitional (IMV) model. However, it is unclear how ACEs relate to self-harm as it unfolds in daily-life, and research investigating potential protective factors in the association between ACEs and self-harm is scarce. Here, we investigated whether ACEs were associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), and whether parent-child or peer attachment relationship quality influenced this association. Additionally, we explored whether specific types of ACEs were differentially associated with self-harm. \n\tMethods: A cross-sectional study using retrospective questionnaires to assess ACEs, lifetime self-harm thoughts and behaviours, and paternal, maternal, and peer attachment relationship quality, and ESM to assess daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, 10x/day for 6 days. N=1014 adolescents (Age, Mean (SD) = 14.05 years (1.91), 66.66% female) were recruited from the general population via schools across Flanders (Belgium). \n\tResults: Multilevel analyses demonstrated associations between ACEs and lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, that were attenuated by a high-quality maternal attachment relationship. Specific types of ACEs (e.g., sexual victimization) were more strongly associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours.\n\tConclusion: The study provides evidence for ACEs as a pre-motivational phase variable within the IMV model. Clinicians are encouraged to consider exposure to ACEs and the potential of maternal relationships to buffer their impact in the prevention and management of adolescent self-harm.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a novel method to test a classic idea in developmental science: that children's attention to a stimulus is driven by how much they can learn from it. Preschoolers (4-6 years, M=4.6) watched a video where a distracting animation accompanied static, page-by-page illustrations of a storybook. The audio narration for each storybook page was looped such that children could listen to it up to 6 total times. However, the narration automatically ended if the child looked at the distractor for an extended period of time, indicating their loss of attention to the story, and triggering the next page. The complexity of the narration was manipulated between-subjects: the Simple narration largely contained words that should be familiar to preschoolers, while the Complex narration contained many rare, late-acquired words. Children's learning was measured via post-tests of their plot comprehension and ability to generalize the rare words. Consistent with the hypothesis that children's attention was driven at least partly by their ability to learn from the speech, we observed a significant interaction between narration complexity and age in predicting children's probability of continuing listening on each page, and the proportion of their visual attention that they devoted to the story illustration. That is, while younger children were more likely to continue listening to the Simple speech, older children became increasingly likely to sustain attention to the Complex speech. Our results provide evidence that young children may actively direct their attention toward linguistic input that is most appropriate for their current level of cognitive and linguistic development, which may provide the best learning opportunities.",

Additionally, little is known about whether this relationship varies across cultural and societal contexts. Across four studies (total N = 220,314; 67 countries) using cross-sectional and daily diary data, we show that wellbeing is closely tied to gratitude experiences, with no meaningful universal individual differences across age, gender, SES, or education. However, this connection varies across contexts and cultures: The gratitude-wellbeing link was weaker in a pandemic context (versus post-pandemic) and moderated by various country-level factors, such as national income and collectivism. As the first systematic study to examine the gratitude-wellbeing relationship across a broad range of individual, contextual, and cultural differences, these findings underscore the significant role of gratitude in wellbeing and reveal how cultural and contextual factors relate to this connection.",

          "abstract": "Martin Buber's philosophy of dialogue has significant resonances with relational-intersubjective psychoanalysis, yet the communication between these two fields has not been sufficiently explored. Broadly speaking, the concept of the \"I–Thou\" relationship is akin to mutual recognition, manifesting primarily in two ways: (1) During smooth interactions, both parties can fully engage in the ongoing dialogue, achieving attunement and responsiveness through both nonverbal and verbal communication; (2) During less smooth interactions, both parties remain open to dialogue, negotiate areas of disagreement, and even attempt to repair the relationship after a breakdown. Relational-intersubjective psychoanalysis and related research extends Buber's philosophy of dialogue by emphasizing nonverbal communication in infancy, focusing on intersubjective interactions at the micro level, providing evidence for Buber's concept of \"healing through encounter,\" and considering the complementarity of encounter (interactive regulation) and insight (self regulation). Future research could delve into guiding the interaction patterns of certain clients from an \"I–It\" relationship to an \"I–Thou\" relationship, which remains a crucial area for further exploration.",

          "authors": "Sanford R Student",
          "abstract": "Vertical scales are intended to establish a common metric for scores on test forms targeting different levels of development in a specified domain. They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may bias grade-to-grade score distributions. Simulation and real data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce very different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates both the developmental trajectory of flanker task performance in children and the association with the development of teacher-reported problem behavior. Five waves of flanker performance and behavioral and emotional problems were drawn from a large longitudinal sample of elementary school children in the Netherlands (1424 children, ages 7 to 12 years). Latent growth curve modeling (LGM) identified a piecewise decrease in flanker response time: the steepest decline was found from 7 to 9 years old. Boys had lower levels of response time at age 7 than girls. Children showed a linear decrease in behavioral and emotional problems over time. Parallel LGMs revealed that lower levels of initial flanker response time were associated with a stronger decrease in anxiety problems and oppositional defiant problem behavior. A faster decline in response time was associated with a faster decline in depression problems, attention deficit hyperactivity-, and oppositional defiant-related behavior. Results offer insight into the normative development of performance monitoring in childhood and the link between behavioral measures of performance monitoring and behavioral and emotional problems.",

          "abstract": "Niniejszy artykuł stanowi wkład w toczącą się debatę na temat wyjaśnień topologicznych, rozwijając pojęcie topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym. Odwołując się do matematycznej topologii – w szczególności do pojęcia wymiarowości i rzutowania – proponuje nową interpretację konstruktów psychologicznych, wykraczającą poza klasyczne reprezentacje dwuwymiarowe. Artykuł podejmuje temat topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym, wskazując, że wiele dotychczasowych modeli – tradycyjnie analizowanych w przestrzeniach dwuwymiarowych – może w rzeczywistości posiadać ukrytą strukturę trójwymiarową. W oparciu o analizy koncepcyjne, metodologiczne i psychometryczne autor(ka) pokazuje, że przejście do modelowania trójwymiarowego pozwala na pełniejsze odwzorowanie badanych konstruktów psychologicznych. Przykład modelu błędów wychowawczych Antoniny Guryckiej służy jako ilustracja sytuacji, w której pojawienie się dodatkowego wymiaru wynika z niespójności interpretacyjnych w centrum modelu kołowego. Artykuł omawia ograniczenia klasycznych metod statystycznych, takich jak analiza czynnikowa, i proponuje alternatywne podejścia analityczne – w tym maszyny wektorów nośnych z jądrem RBF (z obszaru sztucznej inteligencji) oraz topologiczną analizę danych (TDA). Metody te umożliwiają wychwycenie głębi i złożoności strukturalnej modeli psychologicznych, kwestionując tym samym dotychczasowe założenia psychometrii i diagnozy psychologicznej. W zakończeniu wskazano, w jaki sposób topologizacja może wpłynąć na przyszłość teorii psychologicznych, metod pomiaru i interpretacji terapeutycznej.",

In this study, we investigated the association between adolescent cognitive abilities, educational attainment, and adult mental health. Cognitive ability was ascertained in Norwegian military conscript test data (N = 272,351; mean age 17.8 years; males only), whereas mental disorders were ascertained using the Norwegian register of primary care diagnoses received between the age of 36–40. Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment. These individuals may be an underutilized target group for mental-disorder prevention.",

Although initially thought to be quite rare, DP has been estimated to affect between 1.0% and 2.5% of the population, with different estimates reflecting different tools and analytical approaches to categorising DP. Research over the last 25 years has identified several cognitive and neural mechanisms that appear to contribute to face recognition deficits in DP, and both structural and functional neural differences have been found between individuals with DP and neurotypical participants. Nevertheless, clear neurocognitive signatures of this condition remain elusive, likely due to a) the high degree of individual variability observed in the behavioural and cognitive profiles of individuals with DP and b) the focus on group-based analyses rather than on in-depth, individual-level investigations. We recommend that future studies emphasise the latter approach.",

          "abstract": "Formal theories translate verbal theories into a mathematical representation, such as a coupled differential equation or other dynamical systems, intending to strengthen the deductive power of (clinical) theories and to formulate testable and novel hypotheses. Work in clinical formal theories mainly relies on simulations, which is an intuitive method to evaluate overall model performance but may fall short in establishing a precise link between the mathematical properties of the model and the dynamic property of the model outcome. Moreover, when the model outcome contradicts clinical observations, it is unclear where the discrepancy comes from, and how to improve the model. In this current article, we introduce formal mathematical techniques for graphical model analysis, including phase plane analysis, which allows identifying a system’s stable and unstable equilibria, and bifurcation analysis, a framework to delineate parameter regimes corresponding to qualitatively different dynamical outcomes for a model. Using two formal dynamic models in psychology (one for panic disorder and one for suicidal ideation), we illustrate those methods through an easy-to-use R package, deBif, with a graphical user interface. With these examples, we show the importance of using graphical tools to investigate the hypothesized mechanisms of psychological systems.",

Il presente contributo esplora - in prospettiva interdisciplinare - le motivazioni psicologiche ed economiche che spingono individui privi di reale benessere economico ad assumere comportamenti di consumo simbolico e ostentativo. Attraverso l’analisi di teorie classiche (Veblen, Bourdieu) e contemporanee (economia comportamentale, psicologia del sé, teoria dei segnali) e integrando riflessioni sull’impatto dei media digitali e della musica di tendenza (reggaeton, rap, trap) l’articolo mette in luce come la ricerca di visibilità e riconoscimento sociale possa spingere verso condotte rischiose quali l’indebitamento, l’adesione a modelli di “successo facile” (es. trading online) e la mercificazione del corpo attraverso piattaforme sessuali. Le riflessioni conclusive propongono una lettura critica del fenomeno e la necessità di un’educazione alla sostanza, alla resilienza identitaria e alla consapevolezza economica.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal designs support temporally granular study of social, behavioral, and psychological processes making methods like ecological momentary assessment (EMA) increasingly common. However, the repetitive and intensive measurement strategies associated with these designs increase participant burden which limits the breadth and precision of EMA surveys. This is particularly problematic for complex clinical phenomena, such as suicide risk, which research has shown is multidimensional and fluctuates over narrow time intervals (e.g., hours). To overcome this limitation, we proposed the computerized adaptive test for suicide risk pathways (CAT-SRP) which is the first multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT) designed for intensive longitudinal data. The CAT-SRP leverages multidimensional item response theory to support the simultaneous assessment of multiple empirically informed risk domains and facilitate personalized survey content. Study 1 calibrates the CAT-SRP item bank using a large community sample (N = 1759, 36.33% with a history of suicidal ideation [SI]). Study 2 evaluates the performance, feasibility, and acceptability of the CAT-SRP in an EMA study of participants with a past month SI history (N = 29 across 2,134 observations).  The calibration study suggested twelve risk domains and two SI domains (active and passive). Results from the EMA study suggested that the CAT-SRP 1) administered surveys with low to moderate item overlap, 2) incurred low participant burden, and 3) may improve near-term prediction of suicidal thoughts relative to traditional EMA measurement. Although additional work is needed, the CAT-SRP marks the first MCAT for EMA and represents a significant methodological advancement for ambulatory measurement.",

          "abstract": "The paper aims to present the results of adaptation of the Ukrainian version of Autonomous Career Motivation Scale (Sverko &amp; Babarović, 2024). Methods. At the preparatory stage of adaptation the double translation procedure was carried out for the Ukrainian version of the scale to correspond as closely as possible to the original one. After that, the equivalence between the original scale and its translated version was assessed. The study sample (N=336) included: 1) high school students (14-17 y. o.) – 68.15%; 2) first year university students (17-20 y. o.) – 31.85%. The gender distribution of respondents was following: 1) female – 65.18%; 2) male – 30.36%; 3) unidentified – 4.46%. Results. The results of the study confirm theoretical structure of the Scale, which is consistent with previous conceptual ideas about the measurement construct. Exploratory factor analysis allowed us to identify a clear factor structure that supports the hypotheses about the multidimensionality of the concept and indicates the sociocultural stability of the model. Conformational factor analysis showed high indicators of model compliance, which proves the adequacy of the chosen structure, however, some accuracy indicators demonstrate potential for further improvement of the model. The reliability of the scales is at an acceptable and high level, which confirms their consistency, homogeneity and ability to stably reflect the measured construct. Convergent and discriminant validity of the Scale are also confirmed, which demonstrates the ability of the Scales to correlate with the corresponding items and at the same time distinguish between different constructs. The high discriminantity of the scales indicates the effectiveness of the tool in distinguishing different aspects of career motivation, which is important for further use of the questionnaire in empirical research and for achieving practical goals by psychologists, career counsellors, etc. Conclusions. The Ukrainian version of Autonomous Career Motivation Scale shows a number of high psychometric indicators, which allow to positively assess the factor structure (model), reliability, construct, convergent and discriminant validity and discriminantity of its subscales. Obtained results indicate the effectiveness of using this Scale to measure autonomous career motivation, while indicating directions for further optimization of the model.",

          "authors": "Hirohito Okano; Michio Nomura",
          "abstract": "Self‑compassion, defined as compassion directed toward oneself in difficult situations, has been widely studied. However, the specific cognitive and behavioral patterns related to self-compassion remain poorly understood. Previous research that relies on predefined rating scales restricts the discovery of novel processes, whereas qualitative analyses of small free‑text samples suffer from limited generalizability. To address these limitations, we applied structural topic modeling—a natural language processing technique—to 9,360 free‑text responses (12 responses each from 780 participants; mean age = 43.0, SD = 10.6, range = 19–75) to identify thought and behavior patterns associated with self‑compassion. Participants responded to 12 free‑text prompts asking them to describe their typical thoughts and behaviors in three difficult situations (suffering, recognizing personal shortcomings, and experiencing failure). Higher self‑compassion was linked to topics reflecting problem‑solving orientation, balanced optimism, and adaptive flexibility. In contrast, lower self‑compassion was associated with self‑criticism, upward social comparison, envy, and depressive inaction. These patterns varied by context: for example, among individuals high in self‑compassion, balanced optimism predominated in contexts of suffering and failure, while adaptive flexibility emerged when participants recognized personal shortcomings. This study advances the literature by offering context‑sensitive, nuanced insights into self‑compassion across situations and providing a data‑driven foundation for future theoretical models and interventions. It also demonstrates that a data‑driven approach employing topic modeling on large‑scale free‑text data can uncover nuanced processes that conventional rating scales may not capture, with broad implications for emotion research and psychological science.",

There was substantial variation in symptom networks between ethnic groups. White British individuals showed the most differences compared to other ethnic groups, particularly in anxiety-related symptoms and functional impairment. Fewer differences were observed in symptom co-occurrence across ethnicities (the relationship between symptoms) compared to individual symptom variations (the effect of ethnicity on individual symptoms).

          "abstract": "Reliability Generalization (RG) studies frequently interpret meta-analytic heterogeneity in score reliability as evidence of differences in an instrument’s measurement quality across administrations. However, such interpretations ignore the fact that, under Classical Test Theory (CTT), score reliability depends on two parameters: true score variance and error score variance. True score variance refers to the actual variation in the trait we aim to measure, while error score variance refers to non-systematic variation arising in the observed, manifest variable. If the error score variance remains constant, variations in true score variance can result in heterogeneity in reliability coefficients. While this argument is not new, we argue that current approaches to addressing this issue in the RG-literature are insufficient. Instead, we propose enriching an RG study with Boot-Err: Explicitly modelling the error score variance using bootstrapping and meta-analytic techniques. Through a comprehensive simulation scheme, we demonstrate that score reliability can vary while the measuring quality remains unaffected. The simulation also illustrates how explicitly modelling error score variances may improve inferences concerning random measurement error and under which conditions such enhancements occur. Furthermore, using openly available direct replication data, we show how explicitly modelling error score variance allows for an assessment to what extent measurement quality can be described as identical across administration sites.",

Exam access arrangements (AA) are provided as reasonable adjustments to reduce disadvantage for students with SpLD. However, the application process for AA has become increasingly burdensome, requiring extensive documentation and formal assessment. The number of applications for AA continues to rise, adding pressure to schools and examination bodies, underscoring the need for a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape around AA provision. The present study captured current practices and provisions around identifying the need for AA for students with SpLD, the nature of support offered, and barriers to effective provision. Semi-structured interviews with 35 practitioners (21 Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs); 14 Specialist Assessors) working in secondary schools in England identified three themes: ‘the importance of equity in identification’, ‘resources impact identification and support’, and ‘lack of consistency and a systematic approach’. Findings highlighted the complexities of identifying and assessing students for AAs, the need for better communication with stakeholders, and the need to provide clearer guidance covering identification, implementation, and training for students on AA use. Findings also uncovered continued inequities, with eligibility for AA as well as access to best practice in arranging accommodations partially influenced by socio-economic status. Structured guidance in effective identification, assessment, and implementation processes with student training programmes, with specifically dedicated resources, could help address disparities and ensure more equitable support.",

Our aim was to systematically review progress in this emerging field. Based on articles selected using systematic and reproducible criteria, we identified five current themes in the computational study of AN: 1) reinforcement learning; 2) value-based decision-making; 3) goal-directed and habitual control over behaviour; 4) cognitive flexibility; and 5) theory-based accounts. In addition to describing and appraising the insights from each of these areas, we highlight methodological considerations for the field and outline promising future directions to establish the clinical relevance of (neuro)computational changes in AN.",

          "abstract": "Background: Approximately 5% of children are affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder of their sensorimotor skills. DSM-V and ICD-10, the two most widely used diagnostic systems, define this diagnostically as ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ (DCD) or ‘Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function’ (SDDMF), respectively. A diagnosis of DCD/SDDMF has been found to have a detrimental impact on a range of outcomes (e.g., health and education). It is therefore crucial that these children receive timely intervention. This is reliant, however, on effective assessment and support pathways. Research has shown there is great parental dissatisfaction, but there has been limited research exploring a clinical and education perspective. This study therefore aimed to understand barriers and facilitators for clinical and education practitioners in the pathway in a diverse district in the UK (Bradford). Methods: Semi-structured interviews were completed with stakeholders across the pathway to identify barriers and facilitators to assessing, diagnosing, and supporting children with sensorimotor skill difficulties. Theoretical thematic analysis aligned to the COM-B model were used to analyse the qualitative data. Results: Interviews revealed many barriers in the DCD pathway related to capability (confusing terminology, inconsistent knowledge, inappropriate referrals), opportunity (resource constraints, DCD/SDDMF being considered low priority, and disconnected services), and motivation (overlapping job roles, a desire to consider those with difficulties not eligible for a diagnosis). Conclusion: Families face multiple barriers to obtaining a diagnosis for their child through existing clinical pathways for assessment and support. These findings are unlikely to be unique to Bradford and appear to reflect national and international health service challenges. There is an urgent need for: (i) clear communication across different services (with consistency in terminology), and (ii) a more collaborative and integrated approach to assessment, diagnosis, and support in order to help these children thrive.",

          "abstract": "Background: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), also termed dissociative convulsions, are paroxysmal events resembling epileptic seizures but without ictal EEG correlates, reflecting complex biopsychosocial etiology. Despite high prevalence and significant functional impairment, limited research has comprehensively examined biological, psychological, and social determinants of PNES in Indian clinical populations.\n\nAim: To examine biopsychosocial factors in patients with dissociative convulsions and evaluate interrelationships among these domains.\n\nMethods: Seventy‑two patients (mean age 26.15±8.87 years; 91.7% female) diagnosed with dissociative convulsions per ICD‑10 criteria at a tertiary psychiatric center in North India were recruited. Participants completed validated self‑report instruments assessing dissociative experiences (DES‑II), cognitive distortions (CD‑Quest), alexithymia (TAS‑20), trauma symptoms (ITQ‑18), emotion dysregulation (DERS‑18), and sleep disturbances (ISDI). Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained via semi‑structured interview. Spearman correlations explored associations among biopsychosocial variables. Principal component analysis and k‑means clustering identified distinct patient subgroups, with discriminant analysis validating cluster membership.\n\nResults: Psychological measures were strongly intercorrelated (rs 0.58–0.94; p&lt;0.01). Sleep disturbances correlated positively with dissociation and emotion dysregulation (rs 0.71–0.88; p&lt;0.01). Lower education, joint family status, and lower socioeconomic status were significantly associated with greater sleep pathology and higher dissociation (p&lt;0.01). Cluster analysis yielded two distinct groups: a high‑trauma cluster (n=23, 32.8%) characterized by greater trauma history, elevated DES‑II, ITQ‑18, DERS‑18, TAS‑20, CD‑Quest scores, and more severe sleep disturbances; and a low‑trauma cluster (n=49, 67.2%) with comparatively lower scores across biopsychosocial domains. Discriminant analysis achieved 99% classification accuracy (Wilks’ λ=1.00).\n\nConclusions: Dissociative convulsions in this sample are associated with pervasive emotion dysregulation, alexithymia, cognitive distortions, trauma exposure, and sleep disturbances, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. Identification of high‑ and low‑trauma phenotypes underscores the importance of tailored, multidisciplinary interventions targeting trauma processing, emotional regulation, and sleep hygiene to optimize outcomes in PNES.\n© 2025 Akhand Pratap Singh.

However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory. This model is the foundation of brain-inspired AI.",

Apathy and fatigue were related to almost all academic measures, yet apathy was more closely linked to academic functioning; in particular autonomous motivation, study engagement, and study satisfaction. Our findings suggest that apathy is an important and likely overlooked factor in understanding academic functioning, at least among university students aged 30 – 50.",

Building upon previous iterations, QCFT 4.0 introduces a topological approach that addresses key challenges in consciousness science: the binding problem, phenomenal unity, and the relationship between consciousness and physical processes. By incorporating empirical findings from quantum interference experiments and neurophysiological data, we demonstrate how consciousness may emerge through field interactions constrained by a specific topological structure. The model's predictions include half-integer harmonic signatures, coherence tunneling effects, and π-phase offset phenomena that match observed experimental data. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous yet ontologically nuanced framework that bridges quantum field theory, neuroscience, and phenomenology while suggesting new experimental directions for consciousness research.",

          "abstract": "obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in elderly populations represents a critical yet understudied frontier in mental health, characterized by diagnostic ambiguities, treatment resistance, and dynamic symptom evolution. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, neurobiology, and clinical management of late-life OCD, while proposing a novel polymorphic systems framework to reconceptualize its evolving nature. Drawing parallels to adaptive computational algorithms, we posit that OCD symptoms \"mutate\" contextually (e.g., contamination fears → symmetry obsessions) while retaining core anxiety-neutralizing functions, necessitating precision medicine approaches that map real-time symptom trajectories. Key findings include: (1) Genetic (SLC1A1 polymorphisms) and epigenetic (NR3C1 hypermethylation) factors driving late-onset OCD; (2) Neuroimaging biomarkers (orbitofrontal cortex hyperactivity, white matter hyperintensities) predictive of SSRI resistance; (3) Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) correlating with symptom severity; and (4) Pandemic-induced exacerbations (68% increased compulsive handwashing). We critique traditional diagnostic frameworks and advance Bayesian hierarchical models to address cohort heterogeneity, integrating socio-cultural, genetic, and neuroimaging data for personalized interventions. Emerging tools such as virtual reality exposure therapy, AI-driven compulsion tracking, and caregiver-mediated CBT demonstrate promises but require age-specific adaptations. The review underscores the urgency of transcending static diagnostic paradigms in favor of dynamic, computationally inspired models that mirror OCD’s fluid architecture. By aligning geriatric psychiatry with precision medicine innovations, this work charts a roadmap for scalable, cost-effective interventions tailored to the unique needs of aging populations.",

The collection of standardised, routinely collected data within clinical services holds promise to improve patient care. Proposals for standardised variables for collection in eating disorders services have been made, but not implemented, and have included limited biological measures. Given emerging evidence about the importance of metabolism and other biological factors in eating disorders, there is a need for such measures to be integrated into routine data collection. \nObjective: To agree on a set of biopsychosocial variables for routine data collection within eating disorder services in the United Kingdom.\nMethods: Two online workshops were conducted using an adapted nominal group technique to agree priorities for data collection in adult (n= 20) and child/adolescent (n=23) eating disorder services (n = 43 participants, comprised of people with lived experience, carers, clinicians and researchers). Two researchers independently conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of the workshop transcripts to identify qualitative priorities for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the results of online voting. Measures and variables were chosen based on the priority-setting workshops, informed by prior work on psychometric properties of relevant measures. \nFindings: Thematic analysis identified four superordinate themes for data collection in eating disorder services: (1) a mutually valued and beneficial collaboration; (2) a holistic approach; (3) a balance between standardisation and individualisation; (4) doing no harm. Quantitative analysis of voting identified priorities across a range of domains\nConclusions: This project agreed a set of biopsychosocial variables which have been implemented for routine data collection as part of the Eating Disorders Clinical Research Network. Further research should investigate the implementation of these variables for data collection in eating disorder services and identify priorities for data collection in under-represented groups such as people with experience of binge eating disorder.\nClinical implications: Patients, caregivers, and clinicians support routine data collection in eating disorders services so long as the measures used are considered meaningful, not overly burdensome, non-stigmatising and collected as a collaboration between patients and treatment providers.",

Various cognitive processes operate autonomously in the absence of external inputs or demands. Spontaneous thoughts—mental experiences that accompany ongoing cognition—are ubiquitous during wakeful rest. Spontaneous memory reactivations—neural events that replay recently learned information—also occur at rest and have a fundamental role in long-term memory consolidation. Here we review recent research on how the DMN may act as a neural workspace to jointly support spontaneous thought and memory consolidation. We identify gaps in the current understanding of the DMN’s function and propose avenues to study how spontaneous thought and memory systems may operate synergistically. Through our review of closely related yet traditionally siloed literatures, we aim to bridge the gap between research on spontaneous thought and memory consolidation to advance understanding of the DMN’s function.",

While Popper raised this objection in the context of assigning prior probabilities to models, we argue that Popper's objection does not just concern the priors, but Bayesian model comparisons more generally. We term this `the subset problem'. A variety of solutions have been proposed in the literature. We discuss some of these solutions and combine them into a new Bayesian account, in which both the probability assignments and the algebra over which they are assigned receive a specific interpretation.

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable negative events yield increased stress responses compared to situations over which we have control. Previous studies have assessed the impact of uncontrollability of threat on stress reactivity. Less is known about whether and how acute stress exposure influences how we react to uncontrollable threats. Until now, research has primarily focused on investigating the lack of control despite the idea that losing control may cause greater distress and be more clinically relevant. The current study aims to investigate whether acute stress exposure impacts reactivity to a subsequent loss of control over threat. One hundred twenty-eight participants will be equally and randomly allocated to a stress or a no-stress group. Participants will undergo an acute stress induction or a non-stressful procedure, followed by a behavioral loss-of-control task. The loss-of-control task is designed to effectively induce control followed by a subsequent loss of control over aversive electrical stimulation. We hypothesize that participants exposed to acute stress will show stronger biological and psychological responses to the loss of control over threat than those in the no-stress group, as expressed in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase assays, blood pressure measurements, and self-report ratings. Additionally, we will assess biological sex, general perceived stress, and childhood adversity as factors that might moderate the relation between acute stress exposure and reactivity to loss of control. Investigating the sensitizing effect of acute stress on the reaction to a loss of control could offer valuable insights into their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",

Results: There are 182,978 children currently in the Connected Bradford primary care records, suggesting there should be ~9149 children with a diagnosis (given estimated prevalence rates of 5%). But over 74 years of records available, there were only 152 recorded childhood diagnoses of SDDMF (the ICD-10 used in the UK and Europe for diagnosis). When exploring related diagnoses and findings there were 1037 cases (~14 per year), however this amount over 74 years is still nine times lower than would be expected within current childhood populations in Bradford. Moreover, there were low levels of recorded assessments and a lack of clarity regarding how children are being assessed. Conclusion: Diagnosis is the current pathway to accessing support across UK services, yet the current study highlights that children with DCD/SDDMF are not being diagnosed within Bradford. This likely reflects national and international challenges. Further research is needed to investigate the barriers and facilitators to assessing, diagnosing, and supporting children with DCD/SDDMF.",

          "abstract": "Clinical reasoning is a core competency required by all medical professionals. A testlet is group of two or more items based on the same clinical scenario. A testlet can be used to measure clinical reasoning skills because each scenario is evaluated with two or more items. Unfortunately, testlets are challenging and time consuming to create. The purpose of our study is to address the item writing challenge by describing and illustrating testlet-based automatic item generation. We use this method to create testlets for evaluating clinical reasoning skills across four different scenarios in thoracic surgery. We created a testlet-based item model. The item model contains global and local variables. Global variables can be used to place content in any item across the testlet and hence are unique to testlet-based automatic item generation. Local variables are specific to each item model and can only be used for one specific item in the testlet. We generated 47 unique 3-item testlets. A sample of three, 3-item testlets, one from each clinical scenario, was independently evaluated by four surgical content experts and judged to be of high quality. Directions for future research are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Taxometric methods may help researchers estimate guilty-suspect base rates in the criminal justice system and develop procedures for classifying individual suspects. This program requires that criminal evidence be quantified for statistical analysis, but no appropriate indicator variables exist. We discuss the criteria for suitable taxometric indicators and outline characteristics that indexes of criminal evidence should meet. We derive quantitative indexes of four types of criminal evidence: eyewitness identifications, interrogations and confessions, forensic match evidence, and propensity evidence. We sketch how the proposed indexes could be validated within the taxometric program. Further, we illustrate how researchers can empirically probe critical assumptions underlying these indexes, quantify the sizes of departures from these idealizations, and leverage these estimates to modify and improve index calculations. The proposed indexes address an outstanding impediment to the realization of the taxometric program to study guilty-suspect base rates in the criminal justice system.",

          "abstract": "When deciding between action alternatives, we use information about the costs and rewards of each action to choose an appropriate plan. Curioni et al. (2022) recently found that participants had a strong preference for completing a virtual box-clearing task cooperatively with a partner rather than alone, despite it being more motorically and cognitively costly. Participants completed the task standing beside each other in close proximity, which may have created a social pressure to cooperate through a need to manage one’s reputation or a sense of commitment. Here, 50 human pairs—each composed of a “Decision-maker” and “Helper”—completed a box-clearing task modeled after Curioni et al. while seated farther away and out of view of one another. In 50% of trials, Decision-makers were forced to complete the task alone or with the Helper. In the remaining 50% of trials, Decision-makers chose to work alone or cooperatively. When working together, participants were required to synchronize their movements without communication or feedback of their partner’s movements. Decision-makers answered open-ended questions regarding why and when they chose to complete the task alone and together. We found a slight preference for individual action over costly joint action, yet this preference was not significantly different from chance. Inductive thematic analysis revealed two dominant themes: “chose actions with greater instrumental utility” and “chose actions with greater social value”. The identified themes suggest that preferences to cooperate are highly individualized, and that cooperative actions may provide additional social rewards that drive preferences for cooperation even when it is more costly.",

In this study, we investigated the association between adolescent cognitive abilities, educational attainment, and adult mental health. Cognitive ability was ascertained in Norwegian military conscript test data (N = 272,351; mean age 17.8 years; males only), whereas mental disorders were ascertained using the Norwegian register of primary care diagnoses received between the age of 36–40. Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment. These individuals may be an underutilized target group for mental-disorder prevention.",

During a bike ergometer task, participants’ state VoPE, RPE, feeling, and heart rate at light, moderate, and vigorous cycling intensities were measured. The intensities were individually tailored using a VO2 max measurement. Additionally, trait VoPE was assessed. Higher trait and state VoPE were positively related to feeling better during cycling, independent of intensity, whereas no relation to RPE was found. These findings suggest that VoPE may play a role in shaping exercise experience, which could be relevant for long-term adherence to exercise or physical activity.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Value-based decisions are driven by subjective estimates of value for each available option, but recent work has shown that subjective measures of certainty about those value estimates also influence choice behavior. Cognitive and computational theories have proposed that decision-makers process information about choice options in order to reduce their uncertainty about their value estimates before choosing an option. One theory specifically proposes that value estimates are refined during deliberation, which results in more certain – and sometimes revised – value estimates after the choice relative to before. Here we examine the idea that choice options hold different levels of familiarity for decision-makers, and that familiarity can influence the degree to which certainty gain or value revision occurs. Our results show that both certainty gain and value revision are decreasing functions of initial certainty – which we classify as a demand effect – and increasing functions of familiarity – which we classify as a supply effect. Together, these results provide support for our supply and demand approach to the processing of information during decision-making.",

A broader cognitive zone of bounded surprisal emerged during Late Miocene times in small social units of mosaic-landscape dwelling homininans than in woodland-dwelling paninans.    \n2.Small-world homininan networks of small, mixed-sex philopatrial, social units, with maternal and paternal close proximity to children, facilitated the augmentation of intra- and inter-unit information.\n3. Pliocene and Pleistocene spatiotemporal spread of homininans involved increases of transmissible information that expanded tool-making, resource-exploitation, and communicative fluency.\n4. Biological and natural processes are indicated which could have been advantageous or disadvantageous to the survival of various homininan taxa identified in the Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil record.       \nLong Abstract\nA phylogenetical split 8- 6 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, and homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans later became mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling Pan whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. \nContrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: \n(1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; \n(2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; \n(3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibiity of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan zones of bounded surprisal with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan small-world social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding small-world information networks (eventually reaching Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Upper Pleistocene);\n(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ~4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. \nThe vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds of false dawns between ~4 Ma (Australopithecus anamensis) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan palaeospecies (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving prehistoric Homo sapiens alone to roam the world, blessed with \"Homo informatio's\" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive zone of bounded surprisal grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle foreshadowed by the nineteenth-century physicist Hermann von Helmholtz.",

The outcomes of such analyses may shape the images (i.e., theories) that we as scientists have of the phenomena that we study. However, key conceptual issues tend to be overlooked in these analyses, which is especially problematic when the items are person descriptions espressed in the natural language. A correlation between judgments on two such items may reflect the influences of (a) a common substantive cause, (b) substantive target characteristics on another, (c) semantic redundancy, (d) the perceivers’ attitudes toward the targets, (e) the perceivers’ formal response styles, or (f) any mixture of these. We present a conceptual framework integrating all of these mechanisms and use it to connect formerly unrelated strands of theorizing with one another. A lack of awareness regarding the complexity involved may compromise the validity of interpretations of psychometric analyses.

A significant nodal difference was found in the Category Fluency Test, with increased centrality observed among A+ participants. A similar, yet nonsignificant trend was observed between A+T+ and A-T- participants.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the importance of semantic memory alterations in A+ individuals. The wide set of neural and cognitive resources that sustain semantic memory may play a supportive role in the presence of neuropathology.",

          "abstract": "A wave of criticisms and replication failures is currently challenging claims about the scope of unconscious perception and cognition. Such failures to find unconscious processing effects at the population level may reflect the absence of individual-level effects, or alternatively, the averaging out of individual-level effects with opposing signs. Importantly, only the first suggests that consciousness may be necessary for the tested process to take place. To arbitrate between these two possibilities, we tested previously collected data where unconscious processing effects were not found (26 effects from 470 participants), using five frequentist and Bayesian tests that are robust to individual differences in effect signs. By and large, we found no reliable evidence for unconscious effects being masked by individual differences. In contrast, when we examined 136 non-significant effects from other domains, two novel non-parametric tests did reveal effects that were hidden by opposing individual results, though as we show, some of them might be driven by design-related factors. Taken together, five analysis approaches provide strong evidence for the restricted nature of unconscious processing effects not only across participants, but also across different trials within individuals. We provide analysis code and best-practice recommendations for testing for non-directional effects.",

Random intercept cross-lagged panel models\nindicated older adults with better well-being on average had better cognitive function on average.\nFurther, well-being change at one timepoint predicted subsequent cognitive change, and vice\nversa.

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) are disproportionately exposed to several risk factors for suicidality. However, no meta-analysis has yet quantified the relative risk of suicide and self-harm, including suicide attempts, within this population. The aim of this project was to bring together and synthesize the research on suicidality among individuals with ID.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out. Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PsycInfo were searched from inception through May 24, 2024. Observational studies with a quantitative design examining ID as the exposure and reporting relative risk estimates for suicide or self-harm, including suicide attempts, were included. Risk of bias was assessed using a shortened version of the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Exposure (ROBINS-E) checklist. A random effects model was used to synthesize the results.\n\nResults: Eleven primary studies were included in the review (n= 241 438). The level of ID severity was only presented in two articles. Compared to the general population, the pooled relative risk for death by suicide was 0.54 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.89, k = 6, I² = 77%) and the relative risk for self-harm was 3.16, (95% CI 2.3 to 4.35, k = 6, I² = 89%).\n\nConclusion: The findings suggest that individuals with intellectual disabilities have an elevated risk of self-harm but a lower risk of dying by suicide compared to the general population. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of primary studies and substantial between-study heterogeneity.",

In this study, we investigated the association between adolescent cognitive abilities, educational attainment, and adult mental health. Cognitive ability was ascertained in Norwegian military conscript test data (N = 272,351; mean age 17.8 years; males only), whereas mental disorders were ascertained using the Norwegian register of primary care diagnoses received between the age of 36–40. Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment. These individuals may be an underutilized target group for mental-disorder prevention.",

          "abstract": "Characterising the mechanisms underlying naturalistic defensive behavior remains a significant challenge. While substantial progress has been made in unravelling the neural basis of tightly constrained behaviors, a critical gap persists in our comprehension of the circuits that implement algorithms capable of generating the diverse defensive responses observed outside experimental restrictions. Recent advancements in neuroscience technology now allow for an unprecedented examination of naturalistic behaviour. To help provide a theoretical grounding for this nascent experimental programme, we summarise the main computational and statistical challenges of defensive decision making, encapsulated in the concept of critical intelligence. Next, drawing from an extensive literature in biology, machine learning, and decision theory, we explore a range of candidate solutions to these challenges. While the proposed solutions offer insights into potential adaptive strategies, they also present inherent trade-offs and limitations in their applicability across different biological contexts. Ultimately, we propose series of experiments designed to differentiate between these candidate solutions, providing a roadmap for future investigations into the fundamental defensive algorithms utilized by biological agents and their neural implementation. Thus, our work aims to provide a roadmap towards broader understanding of how complex defensive behaviors are orchestrated in the brain, with implications for both neuroscience research and the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems.",

          "authors": "leif erik langsdorf; Torsten Schubert",
          "abstract": "In dual-task (DT) situations performance typically deteriorates compared to single-tasking situations. These decrements can be explained by the serial scheduling of response selection stages constituting a central bottleneck as with decreasing stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) the reaction time for the second task (task 2; RT2) increases. Prior studies indicated that the reaction time for the first task (task 1; RT1) and RT2, are improved in reward compared to no-reward conditions for a block-wise reward prospect, which reflects reward-related optimization in DT processing. However, it remains unclear whether participants can flexibly utilize reward information in a trial-by-trial manner to achieve reward-related improvements. Additionally, it is unclear whether a potential reward-related optimization reflects optimized task preparation only or whether the prospect of reward can evoke an additional task optimization mechanism that extends beyond preparation-related processing improvements. For Experiment 1, we combined a trial-wise reward prospect for participants' task 1 performance, which was signaled by a cue before task 1 onset, with block-wise presented cue-target-intervals (CTI) of either 200 ms or 700 ms, resulting in precise temporal predictability of task 1 onset by participants. First, we observed a reduced RT1 in the reward compared to the no-reward condition. Furthermore, the reward effects increased on RT2 for short compared to long SOAs, reflecting effect propagation at short SOA from task 1 onto task 2. Second, RTs decreased with increasing CTI, while reward effects increased with increasing CTI. Consequently, preparation-related processing improvements of DT performance were additionally improved by reward utilization. For Experiment 2, the temporal predictability of task 1 onset was reduced compared to Experiment 1 by presenting CTIs randomized within blocks, which allowed replicating the result pattern of Experiment 1.  Across both experiments, the results indicate that participants can flexibly utilize reward information in a trial-by-trial manner and that reward utilization additionally improves preparation-related processing improvements for DT conditions with predictable and less predictable task 1 onset.\nKeywords: dual-tasking, reward utilization, motivation, temporal preparation",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "authors": "Paul L Nunez",
          "abstract": "Electric potentials (EEG) were first recorded on the human scalp in 1924 and have since become a key window into brain activity. However, no consensus has emerged regarding their origins. Over the past 50 years, EEG has been modeled using two distinct mathematical approaches: local network models, which focus on cell membrane properties such as synaptic rise and decay times, and global models, which emphasize axon propagation delays in white matter.\nGlobal models predict longitudinal waves of synaptic activity, akin to sound waves in an opera house. These large-scale brain waves are recorded as electric potentials or electric fields on the scalp or cortex, though they should not be confused with the (transverse) electromagnetic fields governed by Maxwell’s equations.\nThe foundational global model is classified into “Toy Model Levels” (1–9) based on its physiological accuracy and ability to replicate EEG dynamics. These models predict the dynamics of EEG frequency bands—delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma—which occur in certain brain states, selectively modulated by neocortical excitability. \nKey topics include EEG dynamics, dispersion relations, white matter properties, resonance phenomena, wave packets, and complex systems theory. While some equations are presented, mathematical details are largely relegated to appendices and references, ensuring accessibility for a broad audience. Recent advancements (levels &gt; 6) emphasize multi-scale resonance phenomena, exploring local, regional, and global resonances in white matter networks with distributed propagation speeds.",

          "authors": "Chandra Sripada",
          "abstract": "Inspired by economic theory, theorists in neuroeconomics and related areas of cognitive science contend that value serves as a common currency for selection among options. While impressive support for this view has amassed over the last three decades, critics have raised serious concerns. They argue that there are a number of pathways to action that bypass value; dissimilar psychological systems do not share a common value currency; and the view cannot accommodate well documented kinds of “irrationality,” such as context effects. This essay offers a systematic response. Key refinements are made to the common currency view, distinguishing common currencies that operate at two phases (decision-phase and learning-phase) and at two levels (options-level and meta-level). A further distinction is made between mechanistic common currency models utilized in cognitive science and representational common currency models that are formulated in expected utility theory and utilized in economics. These refinements help address the criticisms and yield a more nuanced understanding of the role of value in human decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Attentional control refers to the ability to maintain and implement a goal and goal-relevant information when facing distraction. So far, previous research has failed to substantiate strong evidence for a psychometric construct of attentional control. This could result from two methodological shortcomings: (a) the neglect of individual differences in speed-accuracy trade-offs when only speed or accuracy is used as dependent variable, and (b) the difficulty of isolating attentional control from measurement error. To overcome both issues, we combined hierarchical-Bayesian Wiener diffusion modeling with structural equation modeling. We re-analyzed six datasets, which included data from three to eight attentional-control tasks, and data from young and older adults. Overall, the results showed that measures of attentional control failed to correlate with each other and failed to load on a latent variable. Therefore, limiting the impact of differences in speed-accuracy trade-offs and of measurement error does not solve the difficulty of establishing attentional control as a psychometric construct. These findings strengthen the case against a psychometric construct of attentional control.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The prospective and retrospective memory questionnaire (PRMQ) is one of the most widely used questionnaires to assess subjective memory through self-reporting of common memory failures. There have been mixed results in the literature regarding its internal structure. The early studies favoured a tripartite structure with one factor representing a general memory and two group factors representing retrospective (RM) and prospective memories (PM) components. Other findings favoured different structures, such as with only a single factor or only two factors (PM and RM). The objective of the present study was to verify the internal structure of the PRMQ in a very large sample and with precise modelling. Methods: We analysed data from 297,242 adult participants, with ages ranging from 18 to 79 years, and used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to examine the internal structure of PRMQ. Results: The results showed that the model that best describes the data was one with a single factor. The tripartite model failed to converge and our results indicate that the PRMQ is a unidimensional instrument. Conclusion: This is relevant especially for researchers interested in using the PRMQ in future studies and professionals using the questionnaire in clinical settings.",

          "abstract": "Assessing a participant’s latent ability is one of the goals of item response theory (IRT) and IRT-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In the literature, the commonly adopted indicator of the precision of the ability estimator in IRT (including CAT) is the Fisher information. However, this index cannot reliably reflect the precision of the estimate when the number of items is small. Two alternatives to evaluating the standard error (SE) of the ability estimator have been proposed: the Monte Carlo parametric bootstrap  \\parencite{Liou1991} and the ``exact SE'' method \\parencite{magis2014}. The first part of this study contains some theoretical work. We start with showing that Magis's method is an instance of the parametric bootstrap. In particular, we derive the exact bootstrap distribution based on the principle of Magis's algorithm. Next, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the parametric bootstrap SE under the independent but not necessarily identically distributed condition. We prove the consistency of the parametric bootstrap SE. The asymptotic relative efficiency of it over the Fisher information SE is also established. The second part contains an improvement of the parametric-bootstrap algorithm for SE to reduce computational complexity. Using minimal sufficient statistics, we develop an accelerated version of the algorithm for the two-parameter logistic model. The last part concerns the small sample analysis. We conduct a series of simulations comparing the performance of the SE estimator from our proposed algorithm with that from the information-based method. We also illustrate an application of our algorithm on test construction using existing data with small item numbers. \nOverall, the results reveal an advantage of our newly developed method over the the information-based method for assessing the precision of the ability estimator in IRT.",

Emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction were measured through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 12-Item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. We compared the frequency of sensory symptoms between groups, and associations with demographics, injury factors, and clinical outcomes were examined within the msTBI sample.\nResults: 70% with msTBI reported experiencing ≥1 sensory changes due to their brain injury, and 35% reported experiencing dizziness in the previous week, averaging 2.2 symptoms in total—significantly higher than controls after adjusting for age and sex. Sensory changes were more common in younger participants (light hypersensitivity), females (light and noise hypersensitivity), those with more severe TBI (overall sensory changes, affected vision, reduced smell), and those fewer years post-injury (overall sensory changes, noise hypersensitivity, reduced smell, altered taste, dizziness), though many of these associations did not survive multiple comparison correction. Sensory changes were clearly and consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes, with medium-large effect sizes for emotional distress and functional disability and smaller effects for life satisfaction.\nConclusions: Although causality cannot be established, these findings suggest that sensory changes are a clinically significant issue after msTBI, even among individuals more than a decade post-injury on average. This underscores the need for routine assessment and further research on underlying mechanisms and interventions.",

          "abstract": "This research examines cardiovascular response to everyday threats and challenges during wakefulness and sleep. Approximately eleven thousand people, who comprised a diverse sample ethnically but not socioeconomically, completed three weekly morning and evening surveys in which they indicated whether they expected and experienced threats and challenges that day. Participants also provided measures of blood pressure on morning surveys and provided measures of average heart rate during the day and resting heart rate when asleep via their WHOOP biometric capture device. Enrollment began in April, 2024 and data collection ceased in July, 2024. Results indicated that both threat and challenge were associated with higher blood pressure and higher average heart rate during the day. In contrast, when people were asleep, threat was associated with higher resting heart rate but challenge was associated with lower resting heart rate. These results suggest that the body achieves more restorative sleep in preparation for perceived challenges but not for perceived threats, raising the possibility that the greater stress associated with threats disrupts the body’s capacity for restorative sleep. The generalizability of these results to members of economically marginalized groups remains an open question.",

          "authors": "Li Zhaoping",
          "abstract": "Our brain recognizes only a tiny fraction of sensory input, due to an information processing bottleneck. This blinds  us to most visual inputs. Since we are blind to this blindness, only a recent framework highlights this bottleneck by  formulating vision as mainly looking and seeing. Looking selects a tiny fraction of visual information for progression  through the bottleneck, mainly by shifting gaze to center an attentional spotlight. Seeing decodes, i.e., recognizes,  objects within the selected information. Since looking often occurs before seeing and evokes limited awareness,  humans have the impression of seeing whole scenes clearly. According to the new framework, the bottleneck starts  from the output of the primary visual cortex (V1) to downstream brain areas. This is motivated by the evidence- backed V1 Saliency Hypothesis (V1SH) that V1 creates a saliency map of the visual ﬁeld to guide looking. Massive \nvisual information loss downstream from V1 makes seeing vulnerable to ambiguity and illusions (errors). To overcome  this, feedback from downstream to upstream areas such as V1 queries for additional relevant information. An integral  part of this framework is the central-peripheral dichotomy (CPD) theory proposing that vision in the peripheral and  central visual ﬁelds are specialized for looking (deciding where to shift the gaze) and seeing, respectively, and that the  feedback query to aid seeing is mainly directed to the central visual ﬁeld. This V1SH-Bottleneck-CPD framework  predicts that the peripheral visual ﬁeld, lacking feedback queries, is more vulnerable to illusions, and that such  illusions become visible in the central visual ﬁeld when the feedback query is compromised. We present theoretical  predictions, experimental conﬁrmations, a Feedforward-Feedback-Verify-and-reWeight (FFVW) algorithm for seeing  through the bottleneck, and indicate how the framework explains visual crowding, grouping, understanding, and  post-V1 visual cortical areas.",

          "authors": "James Lavers",
          "abstract": "Resistance to change is usually chalked up to habits, cognitive rigidity, or avoidance behaviors. But none of these explanations quite cover what happens when someone is all geared up for change, even motivated, but their actions keep looping back to the same old counterproductive behaviors. I call these Unconscious Clusters of Behavioral Artifacts (UCBAs)—behavioral echoes from earlier stages of psychosocial development that emerge under pressure or novel experiences. They’re not habits formed through repetition, and they’re not conscious strategies of avoidance. They’re automatic, fallback mechanisms—deeply ingrained coping responses from earlier developmental stages that show up when a person’s current strategies feel insufficient or under threat. They mimic, but are distinct from, phenomena like cognitive rigidity or the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS). While habits are built over time through reinforcement, UCBAs are like behavioral fossils—old strategies that resurface to reassert safety and predictability when someone encounters threshold challenges. What makes this interesting is that UCBAs seem to have been reinforced by early success at a particular developmental stage, which means the behavior persists even if it’s completely inappropriate for the current context. This paper argues that understanding UCBAs could be a missing link in explaining why people get stuck in cycles of ineffective behavior, despite having all the knowledge and intention to change. And if we can make this unconscious process conscious, we open the door to real, lasting transformation.",

As such, the successor representation models stimuli as what future states they lead to. Therefore, two stimuli that are perceptually dissimilar but lead to the same future state will come to be represented more similarly. This is very similar to an older behavioral paradigm -the acquired equivalence paradigm, which measures the generalization of learned associations. Here, we test, via computational modeling, the plausibility that the successor representation is the mechanism by which people generalize knowledge learned in the acquired equivalence paradigm. Computational evidence suggests that this is a plausible mechanism for acquired equivalence and thus can guide future empirical work on individual differences in associative-based generalization.",

This uncertainty creates a challenge: How do we decide what asset to invest in and when to divest from an underperforming asset? In this paper, we propose a normative model of asset selection and switching. We hypothesize that people use Bayesian function learning to extrapolate asset performance trajectories and choose assets based on anticipated final performances at a task-specific time horizon. We test the model in three experiments (N = 380) that manipulate the setup (selection versus switching), time horizons, and statistical properties of asset performance trajectories. The model outperforms myopic alternatives inspired by foraging and study time allocation. Our work highlights the role of probabilistic forecasting---integrating prior knowledge with observed asset performance---in guiding complex decisions about uncertain future outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This study examines different approaches to modeling change over time, comparing growth curve models with difference equation models. Growth curve models provide a descriptive framework for capturing longitudinal trends but primarily serve as phenomenological tools that summarize observed trajectories. In contrast, difference equation models offer a process-based perspective, modeling system dynamics iteratively and allowing researchers to explore change processes. This study’s empirical analyses highlight both the advantages and limitations of such models. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of difference equations in capturing system dynamics, but high levels of variability in early time periods can make the models fit somewhat poorly in some cases. Findings suggest that while growth curve models remain valuable for summarizing change, difference equation models provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving temporal processes. Future research should explore hybrid modeling approaches that integrate these frameworks, using dynamical systems theory to enhance psychological and organizational research.

For example, dietary restriction is a common behavioral symptom across the eating disorders; however, the cognitive-affective factors that predict restriction may vary among persons. The aim of this study was to examine which variables are associated with dietary restriction in group-level models of eating disorder pathology and describe how these symptoms compare to the associations evidenced in person-specific models. We collected time-intensive longitudinal data from 26 participants with eating disorders. Participants provided a mean of 355.92 observations across a 90-day period. We estimated group-level models using group iterative multiple model estimation including nodes with the six highest means for the sample. We estimated idiographic (N=1) models by using regularized graphical vector autoregressive models including nodes with the six highest means for each participant. Nodes included in the group-level model were anxiety, feeling fat, fear of weight gain, overevaluation of weight and shape, drive for thinness, and the urge to restrict. In the group-level model, aside from the autoregressive relationship, fear of weight gain was the only variable associated with the urge to restrict. In idiographic models, the urge to body check was the most common variable associated with the urge to restrict, followed by anxiety and feeling fat. Findings from the group-level model were rarely maintained at the individual level. Idiographic models may provide more tailored conceptualizations of eating disorder symptom dynamics related to dietary restriction relative to group-based models.\nKeywords: eating disorders, dietary restriction, idiographic, network analysis, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, OSFED",

Despite being heralded amongst the “kinematic laws of nature” (Flash 2021, p. 4), there is no consensus on its origin, common reporting practice, or vetted analytical protocol. Many legacy elements of analytical protocols in the literature are suboptimal, such as noise amplification from repeated differentiation, biases arising from filtering, log transformation distortion, and injudicious linear regression, all of which undermine power law calculations. This article reviews prior power law calculation protocols, identifies suboptimal practices, before proposing solutions grounded in the kinematics literature and related fields of enquiry. Ultimately, we synthesise these solutions into a vetted, modular protocol which we make freely available to the scientific community. The protocol’s modularity accommodates future analytical advances and permits re-use of modules useful in broader kinematic science applications. We propose that adoption of this protocol will eliminate spurious confirmation of the law and enable more sensitive quantification of recently noted power law divergences. These divergences have been linked to neurochemical disturbances arising from ingestion of dopaminergic drugs, and in neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s and autism.",

The motivation for a post-school pathway and perceptions of the impact of moving out of home, ending a relationship, and entering a new relationship were examined as potential predictors of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 897) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys over approximately one year and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway and life events they had experienced. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations of the motivation for a post-school pathway and the life events with well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

These windows, or critical periods, are valuable targets for learning interventions and best practices. However, making sense of the vast body of empirical findings is difficult. We lack clear theoretical foundations of critical periods and the effects they generate, which breeds disagreement about how to conceptualize and study them, as well as how to turn empirical findings into pedagogical practice. Here, we develop a computationally-motivated framework for explaining how experience can contribute to the emergence of CPEs. In building our framework, we offer a precise definition, a methodology for identification, and geometric intuitions for the influence of experience on CPEs. We identify three qualitatively different ways in which experience-driven CPEs can emerge, and use simple computational models to illustrate each of these possibilities. With this work, we hope to provide more structure and intuition to the study of CPEs in a way that is useful across neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and machine learning.",

In this article, I provide insight into what consciousness is, and how it is produced, by showing that consciousness is faster than light. I also show that consciousness is a new faster-than-light phenomenon; as opposed to coming from non-local quantum mechanics. To be clear, I have not disproven Einstein’s theory of relativity; instead, I have discovered a loophole in Einstein’s theory of relativity that applies to consciousness. The discovery that consciousness is faster than light is important, because it shows that consciousness cannot be a particle, energy, or anything else located in space (e.g. not a soul). In other words, we can now conclude that consciousness is non-energy information. Where does this non-energy information (i.e. consciousness) come from? The discovery that consciousness is faster than light excludes numerous theories of consciousness while also enabling new theories of consciousness. For example, a computational theory of consciousness was previously untenable due to the fact that there is no convergence point in the brain for all information and the speed limit of light prevented the conscious observer from accessing all of the distributed information in the brain, but now a computational theory of consciousness is plausible. I show rare case reports and evidence that support the theory that consciousness (i.e. non-energy information) is, at least in part, produced directly from “non-trivial” computations.",

          "abstract": "The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum theory methodologies and quantum-like modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena — such as order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects — there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach.\nIn this paper, we develop a quantum-like representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on {\\it generalized probability theory} (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework. Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect-observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments — a critical aspect of this model. This GPT-based approach successfully reproduces key quantum-like effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects (commonly associated with decision interference).

          "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that hallucinations may arise because of an over-reliance on prior knowledge during perception. While best established in psychosis-spectrum illness, data also support the presence of this abnormality in other neuropsychiatric illnesses that vary in their association with disruption of visual sensory circuits. In this piece, we ask whether an over-weighting of expectations may be conceived of as a compensatory response to incoming sensory noise. \n\nWe make the case that visual hallucinogenesis across a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders can be captured within a common Bayesian computational framework, as a compensatory response to sensory signal disruptions at different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. We focus on three specific disorders (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Schizophrenia) with prominent visual hallucinations and highlight the fact that these disorders describe a spectrum of visual impairment where the overtness and localization of the visual processing disruption is reflected in the characteristics of the emergent visual hallucinations. We examine how discrete sensory disruptions in Charles Bonnet Syndrome translate to hallucinations via known circuits, and then how different disruptions in Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Schizophrenia may lead to hallucinations with distinct phenomenology, comorbidities, and circuit involvement. Finally, we appeal to emerging computational theories to unite these observations under a common conceptual umbrella.\n\nTaken together, this work presents a means of understanding how sensory disruptions could interact with other aspects of cognitive and neural architecture to produce hallucinations across neuropsychiatric disease. It is our hope that this framework will help in efforts to identify pathophysiologically distinct patient subgroups and new pharmacological and circuit-based interventions.",

Recognizing that adherence to guidelines is a necessary first step in improving the items that are used to assess, we undertook a State-of-the-Art literature review to provide a time-based overview of the current state of knowledge about item-writing guidelines and to suggest directions for future research guided by a use-inspired perspective. First, we explain the history of item-writing guidelines. We identify Haladyna and colleagues’ 2002 as the seminal work and use academic metrics to identify a steady decline in its scholarly impact over time. Second, we critique the current state of the field of item-writing guidelines drawing on evidence from literature related to item-writing flaws, professional development, and automatic item generation noting that innovations to increase the adherence to guidelines have not resulted in a sustained improvement. Third, we apply a use-inspired lens to identify conceptual overlap and implementation redundancy in Haladyna et al.’s (2002) guidelines, reducing the list to 13 sequentially ordered guidelines. In reaching these future directions, we focus on how a use-inspired perspective is more in keeping with the reality that most item writers will write many items without ever becoming measurement experts.",

These constructs can also be understood within the framework of the five-factor model (FFM) of personality. This study aimed to examine the relationship between personality profiles, the severity of suicide-related histories, and ITS-related risk factors. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the relationship between ITS-related risk factors and the severity of suicide-related histories was moderated by personality profiles. Method: A nationwide sample of 1,367 adults, collected via CloudResearch, completed an online survey. Results: Six distinct personality profiles were identified via latent profile analysis. Elevated levels of neuroticism and low levels of conscientiousness corresponded to the highest levels of suicide-related histories. Lower levels of neuroticism coupled with higher levels of extraversion and conscientiousness were associated with reduced levels of suicide-related histories and ITS-related risk factors. However, personality profiles did not moderate the relationship between ITS-related risk factors and the severity of suicide-related histories. Conclusion: Future research should investigate whether directly targeting personality domains contributes to mitigating suicide risk and alleviating thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and hopelessness.",

However, it is unclear why outsiders would not fake such signals—participate in rituals—and free-ride on the cooperative effort of committed members. We propose that biases in signal value computation promote the cooperative functions. In three pre-registered studies (total N = 1,341, general US population), we first showed in an artificial setting that committed individuals assort by overestimating signal benefits, although free-riders faking the signal earned the most. Using a real-world identity—religious affiliation—the second study demonstrated that highly costly religious signals deter outsiders, making religious cooperation profitable and resistant to free-riders. Finally, the third study revealed that religious signals were perceived by committed members to bring additional benefits that were not perceived by outsiders. This differential benefit estimation explains why highly costly signals such as extreme rituals persist and promote cooperation.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the persistent heterogeneity in psychopathology, treatment outcomes, and the science-practice gap requires a systematic approach to personalizing psychotherapy. Case conceptualization aims to understand a patient’s idiographic psychopathology by generating hypotheses about predisposing, precipitating, and maintaining factors. These hypotheses are continually updated with new information from assessments and ongoing treatment. This study applies a novel data-driven approach to formalize this process with personalized network estimation through prior elicitation and Bayesian inference. It is the first study to assess the clinical utility of this approach in a sample of twelve psychotherapy patients, primarily treated for depression, along with their respective therapists (preregistered: https://osf.io/38qdx).\nPatients employed the PECAN (Perceived Causal Networks) method to create personalized \"prior networks,\" mapping how they perceived their symptoms to interact. Intensive longitudinal data were then collected six times daily over 15 days (N = 935). Bayesian inference was used to update these prior networks using the collected longitudinal data, resulting in personalized \"posterior networks.\"\nBoth PECAN and longitudinal assessments were evaluated feasible and acceptable. Face validity was scored highest for the posterior networks. Patients emphasized the personal relevance of these networks, while therapists noted their value in guiding the therapeutic process. However, prior, posterior, and data networks showed significant dissimilarities. These differences may stem from patients’ limited insight into symptom interactions, insufficient power in the longitudinal data, or variations in self-perception. Despite these discrepancies, this study demonstrates the potential for integrating two methods to create personalized models of psychopathology. Future research should refine this formalization process to develop a more rigorous theoretical-empirical cycle to test these models.",

          "abstract": "Diminished use of goal-directed (“model-based”) decision-making is a hallmark of transdiagnostic compulsivity, promoting an over-reliance on inflexible and habitual behaviours. However, the origin of this impairment remains unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that these impairments arise due to uncertainty within the internal world model that subserves goal-directed decision-making. We adapted a validated gamified decision-making task to characterise how individuals build an internal model of an environment, pairing this data with computational modelling to uncover the exact mechanisms underpinning behaviour and quantify individual differences. Two samples of participants (a discovery and pre-registered replication sample) performed the task, and we also acquired longitudinal data over 2 week and 3 month periods to assess task reliability and stability of behaviour over time. Across discovery (n=551) and replication (n=1322) samples, we found that individuals higher in compulsivity and intrusive thought learned more slowly and formed a less certain representation of the task’s structure. This uncertainty mediated the link between compulsive symptoms and use of goal-directed behaviour. Behaviour in the task was relatively stable over a 3 month (n=385) and 1 year (n=326) period and did not predict changes in symptoms. Our results suggest that reliance on habitual behaviours seen in those with high levels of compulsive symptoms result from a tendency to form less certain internal models of the external world. Given the stability of this behaviour and its links to symptoms, this may represent a trait-level vulnerability for this symptom dimension.",

          "abstract": "Combined action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) training has been shown to facilitate motor skill performance, but limited research has explored its effectiveness on motor learning and possible moderating factors for the intervention. This study examined the influence of model type on the effectiveness of AOMI training for novices learning an Ankle Pick takedown. Twenty-eight novice participants were randomly assigned to AOMI training that displayed footage of a self-model (AOMISELF) or an other-model (AOMIOTHER). A motor learning design incorporating pre-test (Day 1), acquisition (Days 2-6), post-test (Day 7), and retention-test (Day 14) was utilised). Motor skill performance, self-efficacy and mental representation structures were recorded as measures of learning. There were no significant differences between the training conditions across all twelve kinematics measures of motor skill performance. Self-efficacy scores increased for all training conditions over time. Both the AOMIOTHER and Control conditions led to improved functional changes in mental representation structures while the structures for the AOMISELF condition moved further away from the reference structure over time. Collectively, the largely null findings suggest that physical practice is the main driver of motor adaptations for this complex motor skill at these early stages of learning. However, the findings also suggest model type may be an important factor for novices using AOMI training. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to explore different modeling approaches, such as mixed-modeling, when designing AOMI interventions for sport.",

However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks---via edge simplification and node consolidation---resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.",

First, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify sentiment and frames in 153,288 emails sent to Governor Jeb Bush about the Terri Schiavo case. We find that the religious frame increases the likelihood that an email is positive, while the legal and medical frames lower that likelihood. Then, we qualitatively analyze 999 randomly chosen emails from the corpus to understand how individuals use emotions in their claimsmaking. We find that individuals use emotion to modify frames in ways that signal their understanding of a target’s authority relative to other actors. Individuals used positive emotions with the religious frame to signal their approval of Bush’s actions. In contrast, individuals used negative emotions with the legal frame to convey their disapproval of other actors, such as Terri’s husband, who were seen as misusing their authority and endangering Terri’s life. We conclude with a discussion of how scholars might better understand the role of emotion in individual claimsmaking.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines the relationship between satisfaction with social life and overall subjective well-being in Spain. Despite increasing recognition of social life as a key determinant of well-being, direct empirical research on its influence remains scarce, particularly in Southern Europe, where much of the existing evidence is anecdotal. Unlike concepts such as social capital, social support, and relational support, satisfaction with social life captures the intrinsic value of social interactions rather than their instrumental utility. It reflects an individual's subjective appraisal of their overall social relationships, encompassing not only close ties but also broader interactions with acquaintances, neighbours, and peripheral contacts. Drawing on data from the first wave of the Global Flourishing Study (2020–2022), this chapter investigates how social life satisfaction contributes to both cognitive and affective well-being. Spanish findings are contextualized within a comparative framework, including high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income countries. The results highlight that subjective evaluations of social life play a crucial role in shaping overall well-being, surpassing the influence of individual characteristics. Furthermore, the significance of social life satisfaction for both cognitive and affective well-being increases with socioeconomic development, positioning Spain alongside upper-middle-income countries with collectivistic and Latin cultural orientations. An analysis of heterogeneity within Spain reveals no substantial variations across gender, social background, or regions. However, significant age-related differences emerge, with the importance of social life satisfaction on overall well-being—particularly affective well-being—increasing with age. The chapter concludes by discussing theoretical and practical implications and outlining directions for future research, including methodological considerations.",

The study also investigates how this relationship varies across different social origins. Catalonia is a pertinent context due to its significant increase in inequality and unemployment during the 2008 Economic Crisis, positioning it among the most affected regions in Europe. The findings reveal that satisfaction with one’s social life matters for global life satisfaction, even after accounting for individual and macro characteristics. However, contrary to the initial expectations, the study demonstrates that satisfaction with one’s social life becomes less influential for global life satisfaction during the macroeconomic crisis, particularly among individuals from middle and low social origins. Furthermore, while a strong positive relationship exists between satisfaction with one’s social life and global life satisfaction during times of economic prosperity for all social groups, a robust negative relationship emerges in periods of macroeconomic crisis for individuals from high social origins. The article offers several potential explanations for these findings.",

First, from 2019 to 2020, there was an exacerbation in gender housework gap among couples living without children, such that women increased approximately half-an-hour more housework than men daily. The gender housework gap among parents however remained similar. Second, such trends were relatively short-term and reversed in 2021 and 2022. We provide short explanations and call for more studies to use national time diary data to intentionally incorporate family diversity into studying the gendered consequences of disruptive events in the longer term.",

          "title": "The Politics of Illicit Trade of Cultural Property - A Review of the Literature",
          "authors": "Michael Crenshaw",
          "abstract": "Cultural imperialism has existed for ages before antiquarians were able to trace a country’s heritage through historic objects. The amount of history lost to stolen archives, looted archaeological sites, and displaced objects has disrupted empirical evidence of the past, severely impacting the heritage, identity, and education of a country. Increased emphasis on historical literacy during the 21st century has heightened awareness surrounding illicit cultural trade, its environmental and cultural impact, as well as the shifting political dynamics at play. The US, whose museum institutions have largely benefited from the sale and exchange of stolen objects, began raiding private collections and archives holding stolen objects, leaving the world of art trade weary in the face of legal prosecution. In turn, the black market for cultural property has grown massively during the last 50 years, linked to large crime organizations and terrorism. This review examines existing research concerning history and global impact of illicit trade of cultural property, the political motives which both fuel and cease the movement of illicit trade, and highlight the important work of government and independent repatriation organizations. Concluding this review, I will provide new directions to take this research, emphasizing the importance of filling knowledge gaps within illicit cultural trade.",

          "authors": "Débora Chaves da Silva; Caio Maximino",
          "abstract": "This study examined lay conceptions of dopamine functions in a Brazilian sample using a quali-quantitative approach. Participants often simplified neurobiological processes, associating dopamine primarily with well-being, motivation, and mood improvement (positive effects), and reward system dysregulation, addiction risk, and health issues like stress and apathy (negative effects). Physical activity and healthy eating were seen as key factors in dopamine increase. Lay conceptions, while differing from expert discourse, may shape a “neurochemical self,” reflecting a neoliberal ideology of self-regulation and productivity. Participants viewed dopamine knowledge as a means to control daily habits for a balanced life. While positive effects were prominent, negative effects were also frequently mentioned, emphasizing productivity and risk management within a capitalist context. Dopamine was both an asset to maximize and a risk to mitigate. This aligns with the view of pleasure as limited and controlled within neoliberal values. The study highlights how media simplification may lead to exaggerated perceptions of dopamine’s role in well-being.",

          "authors": "Irene Ruiz Espejo; Emily Bastable; Jessica Boxall; Chandni Jacob; Frankie Norton; Pathik Pathak",
          "abstract": "Background: The latest military assault on Gaza by Israel, which began after 7 October 2023, has led to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, with tens of thousands killed, nearly two million displaced, and famine officially declared in 2024. The near-total siege cut off food, water, electricity, and medical supplies, while relentless bombardments destroyed critical infrastructure, rendering Gaza unliveable. Many donor nations have simultaneously provided humanitarian aid to Gaza while supplying military assistance to Israel, underscoring the structural hypocrisy in international responses to the catastrophe in Gaza. Methods: In this article, we introduce and develop the concept of justice-oriented counter-stories (JOCS) to critically examine how quantitative datasets on humanitarian aid flows can distort reality and obscure key disparities. Using aid to Gaza in 2023–2024 as a case study, we apply JOCS to identify biases in official reporting and make statistical adjustments to offer an alternative perspective. Results: Our justice-oriented analytical lens shows how the countries humanitarian aid rankings shift significantly when we factor in donor nations’ GDP, and the structural hypocrisy of offering humanitarian aid while simultaneously providing significant military assistance to Israel. Our paper also identifies some of the key methodological challenges in making such adjustments. Conclusion: We conclude by emphasising the broader implications of “justice-oriented counter-stories” for understanding not only aid flows, but social justice and the representation of social and environmental issues.",

          "abstract": "While most adolescents display a steady recovery trajectory following surgery, some develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPP), which can significantly impact their functioning. Psychosocial factors are known to play a role in the recovery from pain following surgery, but positive psychosocial factors have received little attention in the literature. This study aims to address this gap by investigating parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism as predictors of post-surgical pain recovery and positive outcomes in adolescents. \nThis study uses data collected as part of a larger longitudinal project that involved administering questionnaires to adolescents and their parents over multiple timepoints. Adolescent participants aged 12 – 18 years old with a diagnosis of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, and scheduled for spinal fusion surgery, were recruited across four Belgian hospitals along with their parents. Structural Equation Modelling was used to investigate how parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism predicted post-surgical positive outcomes, including mood, quality of life and functional disability in adolescents. \nThe study comprised 94 adolescent-parent dyads. Findings indicate that parental optimism before surgery predicted increased adolescent mood following surgery. Adolescent positive affect before surgery predicted increased mood and decreased pain intensity following surgery, while adolescent optimism predicted increased quality of life. None of the optimism or positive affect variables were significantly related to adolescent functional disability following surgery. \nStudy findings identify parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism as potential predictors of post-surgical recovery and positive outcomes in adolescents. However, the multifaceted and complex nature of these relationships warrants further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent mental health and wellbeing are of growing concern globally with increased incidence of mental health disorders in young people. BrainWaves provides a framework for relevant and diverse research programmes into adolescent mental health and wellbeing that can translate into practice and policy. The research programme is a partnership with schools centred on establishing a large (n&gt;50,000) cohort and trials platform. Reported here is the BrainWaves cohort pilot study. This was designed as proof-of-concept for our recruitment and data capture pipelines, and for cost-modelling. A network of research schools was recruited and a computer-driven questionnaire administered. The eligible population was 16+ year olds who were attending the research schools. Of 41 research schools, 36 (88%) participated over one three-week and one four-week data collection period. From an eligible population of 33,531 young people, 16,010 (48%) attended the study lesson and created an account. Of the 16,010 (100%) who created an account, 15,444 (96%) consented to participate, 9,321 (60%) consented to linkage of research data with educational records, and 6,069 (39%) consented to linkage of research with school/college attendance data. Participants were aged 16-19 years, 59% female, and 76% White. Higher levels of anxiety and depression were found in girls than boys. Higher levels of media-based social networking were found in girls, whereas higher levels of media-based gaming were found in boys. Girls were more likely to report insufficient sleep whilst boys were more likely to report high levels of exercise. This study confirmed an ability to recruit at pace and scale. Whilst the response-rate does not indicate a representative sample, the demographics describe an inclusive and diverse sample. Data collected confirmed findings from previous studies indicating that the electronic data collection methods did not materially bias the findings. Initial cost-modelling suggests these data were collected for around £20 per participant.",

          "abstract": "An innovative course introduced digital twinning concepts to liberal arts students, aimed at enhancing technological literacy, critical thinking, and ethical awareness in an increasingly digital world. The course designed using Quality Matters rubrics and delivered through a competency-based education (CBE) model in an online, asynchronous format to 24 students in Fall 2024 with 96% student course complete rate. The curriculum offered a comprehensive introduction to key digital twinning concepts, applications, and their societal impacts. The flexible, self-paced structure accommodated diverse student populations with varying responsibilities. Pre-course survey revealed limited familiarity with digital twinning among participants. However, post-course survey responses demonstrated significant improvements, with students developing a nuanced understanding of the technology's complexities, including data privacy, ethical considerations, and accessibility challenges. The course successfully aligned with students' expectations for practical knowledge applicable to their careers, and the emphasis on the transformative potential of digital twinning across various fields, including healthcare, space, urban planning, defense, agriculture, and sustainability was the notable strength of the course.  Post-course surveys revealed strong positive outcomes, with 63% of students extremely likely to recommend the course, 55% expressing high enthusiasm for digital twinning's potential, and 90% reporting confidence in understanding its industrial impacts. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating digital twinning education into broader curricula, emphasizing its relevance to liberal arts and interdisciplinary studies in preparing students for the technological demands of various industries.",

          "authors": "Kristina Sabrina Weißmüller; Tijs van den Broek; Jana S. Krawinkel; Steven James Watson",
          "abstract": "This study explores the legitimation strategies employed by organizations engaging in criminal activities to influence public opinion about the legitimacy of these criminal activities. These discursive strategies are used to justify criminal actions, such as corruption, fraud, or violence, within broader organizational and cultural contexts. Often involving moral neutralization and moral licensing techniques, these strategies allow organizations engaged in criminal activities to present themselves and their actions as virtuous or justified. Although these strategies can result in societal harm by undermining public support for law enforcement, little is known about what types of legitimation strategies exist, how they differ, and how they influence public opinion. Hence, this scoping review identifies and categorizes the legitimation strategies used by organizations engaged in criminal activities. By conducting a scoping review of 21 empirical studies, a four-dimensional typology of 10 legitimation strategies is developed, clustered by their association with distinct types of legitimacy. The findings propose five mechanisms whereby legitimation strategies impact public opinion. Understanding these strategies and mechanisms is crucial for developing effective counter-strategies to delegitimize criminal actions and enhance societal resilience. This study advances the fragmented discourse on legitimation processes of specifically criminal actions employed by organizations, integrating findings from various disciplines to inform theory and practice.",

Rhetoric from politicians about policies can sway public opinion, but it remains unclear how much political arguments can alter the public perception of an issue's salience. This study investigates the extent to which hypothetical party statements supporting or opposing a ban on exploration of new oil and gas fields influences opinions about this policy, and the salience of climate change. Results from a pre-registered online survey experiment of 1650 participants in Australia and New Zealand show that political statements impact policy support and opinions of policy efficacy, but have little discernible effect on participants’ perceptions of climate change salience. These results suggest that the public issue salience of climate change is stable, potentially making it challenging for politicians to pursue transformational climate policies.",

          "authors": "Nicholas J. Klein; Matthew Palm; Stella Connaughton",
          "abstract": "Rising transportation costs have sparked widespread concern, with media headlines questioning whether the era of inexpensive automobility is over. Yet existing analyses often rely on sticker prices and aggregated sales data, failing to account for the full range of ownership costs such as insurance, fuel, and debt payments. This study bridges that gap by examining transportation affordability and “forced car ownership”—low-income households incurring high automobile costs due to limited alternatives. Using data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey from 1984 to 2023, we analyze trends in transportation expenditures, debt, and affordability using descriptive statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS), and binary logistic regression.\nOur findings reveal that while transportation expenditures have increased in nominal terms, real expenditures have remained relatively stable, and transportation costs as a share of household expenditures have declined since the 1980s. However, significant disparities persist. Low-income households, Black households, and households with multiple vehicles face disproportionate transportation cost burdens, with debt playing a critical role. Households in the bottom income deciles devote significantly higher shares of income to transportation, often driven by auto loans.\nRegional and demographic variations highlight structural inequities, with rural households and Southerners incurring higher absolute debt levels. These results underscore the inadequacy of existing affordability thresholds and the need for more comprehensive metrics that account for debt. By identifying the determinants of forced car ownership and its uneven distribution, this study offers policy-relevant insights into where transportation affordability initiatives should be targeted, and for whom.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Dissipative Representations (DiRe) as a methodological notion that transcends dualistic thinking in language research, identity studies, and related fields. Drawing from the premise that reality equals information (R=I), DiRe offers an epistemological reorientation that conceptualizes representations as dynamic informational patterns rather than static entities, challenging traditional frameworks that reify conceptual dichotomies. The theoretical foundation integrates Analytic Idealism (ontological dimension), Decolonial Theory (axiological dimension), and the Informational Field Metaphor (methodological dimension), creating a coherent alternative characterized by informational flexibility, provisional utility, relational dynamics, and resistance to objectification. A three-level model of information processing—perception, representation, and meta-representation—provides practical analytical guidance, while validation criteria across ontological, epistemological, methodological, and decolonial dimensions ensure epistemic responsibility. Applications in sign language analysis through deep multimodality, linguistic identity demarcation, and digital identity studies demonstrate DiRe's capacity to resolve persistent theoretical dilemmas without sacrificing analytical rigor. The framework's transformative implications extend to knowledge decolonization, educational practices, and ethical research conduct, addressing what I term \"Technical-Epistemic Gridlock\" in contemporary methodologies. DiRe constitutes the primary analytical tool within the broader framework of Convergences of Lived Open Unfolding Diversity (CLOUD), offering pathways toward more epistemically just and ontologically coherent approaches to understanding human experience.",

Data was collected through five focus groups (31 participants in total) and analyzed using thematic analysis and a novel journey-based approach. Our results highlight key experiential trade-offs between the analog and digital methods focusing on cognitive burden, emotional investment, and practical constraints. Centrally the analog method allowed greater emotional investment, which may or may not be desired. This work showcases the merits of a journey-based analytical approach for better understanding the interview process from respondents’ point of view, and highlights that considering sociogram tools experientially invites greater focus on ethical concerns for respondent care.",

Overall, baby boomers reported larger close networks than did their adult children. Swedish speakers reported slightly more close relatives than Finnish speakers did in the older (6.9 vs. 6.4) and the younger generations (4.7 vs. 4.4) but the differences were not statistically significant. However, Swedish speakers reported on average significantly larger close friendship networks than Finnish speakers in both the older (7.4 vs. 5.3) and younger (5.6 vs. 4.2) generations. The differences in close friendship networks remained significant after controlling for sex, age, self-rated health, and various other socio-demographic factors.

We employed hierarchical multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling to explore the roles of demographic variables, principal support, teacher autonomy, and self-efficacy with classroom management. The findings reveal that strong administrative support, high teacher autonomy, and robust self-efficacy in classroom management significantly enhance job satisfaction, which in turn increases the likelihood of teachers remaining in the classroom. The study underscores the importance of supportive leadership, empowering teachers, and building their confidence in managing classrooms to improve job satisfaction and retention. These insights offer actionable steps for schools and districts to better support teachers and address retention challenges.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper explores the musical dimensions of early infant vocal expressions—crying, cooing, and babbling—and their role in shaping secure attachment through the lens of Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the ritornello. Building on Bowlby’s attachment theory, which emphasizes the infant’s innate signaling behaviors and the caregiver’s responsive attunement, the discussion foregrounds how repeated vocal exchanges create a sonic “territory” that fosters a sense of emotional safety. Drawing on studies of mother–infant interactions, the paper examines how rhythmic and melodic qualities of cries and babbles elicit complementary parental responses, forming protoconversations integral to a child’s emerging self-regulation. The theory of communicative musicality is invoked to illustrate how these interactive “songs” precede formal language yet convey complex affective states. Deleuze and Guattari’s refrains framework highlights the creative, organizing power of repeated sound patterns in stabilizing early relational life. Incorporating insights from Kristeva, Trevarthen, and Stern, the paper argues that the preverbal “song before speech” establishes a foundation for later linguistic and psychosocial development. Finally, clinical perspectives show how voicework and expressive therapies can re-access and re-configure these preverbal sonic territories in adulthood, offering corrective emotional experiences for individuals with disrupted attachments. Through this approach, the paper reaffirms the important  impact of musicality in infancy, underscoring how repeated vocal refrains not only forge secure bonds but also endure as vital resources for therapeutic healing.",

          "abstract": "Social capital is widely believed to impact a wide range of outcomes including subjective well-being, social mobility, and community health. We aggregate data on over 20 million Facebook users in the United Kingdom to construct several measures of social capital including cross-type connectedness, social network clustering, and civic engagement and volunteering. We find that social networks in the UK bridge class divides, with people below the median of the socioeconomic status distribution (low-SES people) having about half (47%) of their friendships with people above the median (high-SES people). Despite the presence of these cross-cutting friendships, we find evidence of homophily by class: high-SES people have a 28% higher share of high-SES friends. In part, this gap is due to the fact that high-SES individuals live in neighbourhoods, attend schools, and participate in groups that are wealthier on average. However, up to two thirds of the gap is due to the fact that high-SES people are more likely to befriend other high-SES peers, even within a given setting. Cross-class connections vary by region but are positively associated with upward income mobility: low-SES children who grew up in the top 10% most economically connected local authorities in England earn 38% more per year on average (£5,100) as adults relative to low-SES children in the bottom 10% local authorities. The relationship between upward mobility and connectedness is robust to controlling for other measures of social connection and neighbourhood measures of income, education, and health. We also connect measures of subjective well-being and related concepts with individual social capital measures. We find that individuals with more connections to high-SES people and more tightly-knit social networks report higher levels of happiness, trust, and lower feelings of isolation and social disconnection. We make our aggregated social capital metrics publicly available on the Humanitarian Data Exchange to support future research.",

          "abstract": "The advent of conflict event data initiated various research agendas under the umbrella of subnational conflict processes and beyond. Event data are mostly confined to information on the type of violence and actors, the number of casualties, time, and location. However, the text sources on which they are based contain much more information and are often provided for individual observations. Using abductions and forced disappearances in the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, we generate additional variables from the notes variable about the number of abductees, subdivided by gender and whether they are adults or children, and individuals killed or released in the process, and whether there was a ransom demand. We demonstrate that large language models can extract additional information about events with an accuracy of over 90 percent. This opens up new, previously impossible research agendas such as analyzing government abductions and near-real time kidnappings. The proposed approach can easily be extended to collect additional information, such as the tactics and claimed objectives of the perpetrators. Importantly, we also show that open-weight models perform at least as well as closed-weight ones for this particular task, and that there are substantial differences in computing time across models.",

          "abstract": "Although there is growing social science research examining how generative AI (genAI) models can be effectively and systematically applied to text-based tasks, whether and how genAI can be used to analyze images remain open questions. In this article, we introduce a framework for analyzing images with generative multimodal models (MMs), which consists of three core tasks: curation, discovery, and measurement and inference. We demonstrate this framework with an empirical application that uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model to analyze satellite and streetscape images (n = 1,101) to identify built environment features that contribute to contemporary residential segregation in U.S. cities. We find that model-generated labels are more reliable than research assistant-generated labels and comparably valid to expert-generated labels. We conclude with thoughts for other use cases and discuss how social scientists can work collaboratively to ensure that image analysis with generative MMs is rigorous, reproducible, ethical, and sustainable.",

          "abstract": "Do climate protests influence elections? How does repeated exposure influence protest outcomes? In this paper, I build on social-psychological work to argue that a key characteristic of effective protests is their ability to repeatedly expose voters to their message. I test this argument by studying the effect of Fridays for Future (FFF) protests on voting for Green Parties. Using a novel dataset of FFF protests and a difference-in-differences design, I find that exposure to climate protests increases the vote share of the German Greens, and that repeated exposure to protests increases this effect. Additional analyses suggest that this increase is driven by higher voter turnout and shifts in climate attitudes, but not by changes in the issue salience of climate change. These patterns are replicated in six other European democracies. These findings are important to understand when protests influence behaviour, and the political consequences of climate protests.",

          "abstract": "Where do LGBTQ+ immigrants settle in the United States? The policy landscape for same-sex couples in the U.S. has changed rapidly in recent years, and number of immigrants in same-sex couples have increased rapidly. But little is known about where these lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) immigrants choose to settle and enjoy their new rights. Do they behave more similarly to their straight immigrant counterparts and locate based on job opportunities and cost of living? Or do they gravitate toward more LGBTQ+-friendly cities and states, as U.S.-born LGB people do? How have these patterns changed over time, especially in conjunction with local policy changes relevant to LGBTQ+ people and immigrants? Using American Community Survey data from 2008-2023 and original datasets, this paper studies the geographic context of immigrants in same-sex couples in the U.S. We find that the distribution of immigrants in same-sex couples is expanding across the U.S. over time. These settlement patterns generally look more similar to fellow U.S.-born LGB Americans: locations with higher concentrations are more progressive, have more robust LGBTQ+ civic life, and have higher incomes. Yet immigrants in same-sex couples also live in more racially and ethnically diverse areas compared to U.S.-born Americans in same-sex couples. Our findings contribute to a fuller understanding of this rapidly growing population and its unique characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Why are public institutions blamed for crises caused by private actors’ mismanagement? Building on accountability and attribution theory, this study investigates the mechanisms of blame attribution during crises, when public institutions fail to prevent systemic risks caused by private sector agents. Data from a survey quasi-experiment with 1,652 Swiss citizens reveals how perceived situational control, causal responsibility, normative accountability expectations, and accountability performance shape citizens’ blame attribution. The findings reveal asymmetries in the responsibility-accountability logic, showing that citizens hold public institutions accountable for private sector failures if they strongly believe that they had causal responsibility and situational control over the crisis. Citizens’ normative expectations of public institutions’ obligation to govern systemic risks are strong drivers of blame, while public institutions’ accountability performance does not impact citizens’ blame attribution. These novel findings provide critical insights for policymakers to manage perceptions, maintain trust, and safeguard legitimacy during crises. This study advances accountability theory by highlighting the contingent nature of blame, which is particularly relevant for crisis governance.",

          "abstract": "This paper questions the conventional wisdom about the extent of white nationalist recruitment into the United States Military. While researchers have come to expect that white nationalists are actively interested in joining the military for the sake of acquiring training or threatening the institution from the inside, we find that this population expresses low levels of interest in military topics, as well as highly mixed and often negative perspectives on the potential of joining. Our findings were derived from analysis of white nationalist conversation on Stormfront and Iron March between 2003 and 2023. As highly active and visible spaces within the English-speaking white nationalist world, Stormfront and Iron March offer a representative look into the motivations and behaviors of such extremists. Although many users value the training and professional benefits of joining the military, these positives are frequently balanced against overriding fears of Zionist infiltration of military leadership. Further, we found that motivations related to posing an insider threat the military were relatively unimportant.",

Anecdotal accounts suggest that military service may be tied to radicalization toward political violence. A nationally representative survey of veterans and servicemembers compared to civilians shows that veterans’ and servicemembers’ attitudes toward political violence reflect those of the larger society. However, current and former servicemembers have different patterns of attraction and engagement with extremist ideologies and groups as compared with civilians. Servicemembers and veterans are more likely to be attracted to anti-government groups and causes that have been associated with violent acts, especially those espousing ideologies related to defending against perceived violations of the Constitution and/or Constitutional rights. Their greater willingness to commit violence on behalf of favored causes makes them attractive targets for recruitment to these groups.",

          "abstract": "Given an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape and growing climate-related risks, this paper argues for strengthening the EU’s fiscal capacity for crisis prevention, preparedness and response, focusing on two fields: security and defence on one hand and natural catastrophes on the other.\n\nThe analysis highlights lessons from responses to COVID-19, including not only the benefits of joint financial instruments (e.g. NextGenerationEU and SURE) but also their shortcomings, such as their temporary nature, weak alignment with long-term resilience, and inadequate parliamentary oversight. The current EU budget framework remains rigid, prioritising mid-term investment while offering limited flexibility for emergency responses.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, the paper advocates for systematically integrating crisis preparedness and readiness considerations into EU budget and scaling up investments in defence and security, as well as in natural disaster prevention and response. Defence funding remains inadequate and fragmented, with insufficient EU-level contributions despite escalating security threats. Apart from repurposing cohesion funding towards security goals and better leveraging the spending power of national promotional banks, the paper proposes a permanent off-budget solution for defence financing to build a new European Security Funding Facility (ESeFF). Similarly, EU disaster relief funding is under-resourced. The EU Solidarity Fund and Civil Protection Mechanism require significant expansion, along with stronger incentives for climate adaptation. The introduction of a public-private climate catastrophe reinsurance scheme could help mitigate financial risks.",

A large body of scientific research has shown that nature markets regularly do not achieve their environmental objectives, and provides generalisable lessons to support their ongoing improvement. The scale of the biodiversity crisis and the enduring popularity of nature markets means it is now critical to stop reproducing the same mistakes. Here we synthesise international research from the history of nature markets and summarise five ‘golden rules’ which are necessary precursors for achieving their environmental aims. We propose a simple checklist for investors, policymakers, and civil society to assess whether nature markets are likely to be delivering scientifically-credible outcomes. We score the world’s largest nature markets against these rules and show all face integrity risks. Lastly, we outline critical evidence-based actions that can be taken to push nature markets towards greater integrity.",

          "abstract": "We argue that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. We employ two factors to model the expected risk-free rate that the market expects the current monetary policy to move towards the neutral rate over a certain period. Expecting that the T-bill risk (i.e., the macrorisk) largely reflects a country’s inflation risk, we measure the risk as a 5-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors. Our models thus split US and Canada T-bill yields into the risk and risk-free rate, on average explaining 98.7% of the returns. The models assuming independence of the two returns show similar power in predicting T-bill returns, which can significantly simplify the formulas. We also find that the inclusion of a risk constant over maturity, which has a small value of several basis points, significantly reduces the prediction errors. The risk and the risk-free rate is the gateway to corporate the risk of various assets in the country.",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, volatility does not decrease asset value while volatility of a lognormal distribution actually raises value. We thus argue that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address these challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as the measuring distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former following a quasi-normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. To be comparable across assets and firms, our asset risk is a 5-year payment’s risk that approaches zero as the distance approaches zero. We show that equity price reflects the present value of a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option’s price minus its present value reflects the overcharge or transaction cost. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, and redefines firm misvaluation theories.",

          "abstract": "A legally binding unilateral settlement option for dismissal disputes could streamline the dismissal process, but concerns persist about the potential overuse of dismissals. To assess this claim, we develop a model of employment adjustment followed by negotiation under litigation threat, and show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, unilateral settlement can enhance total surplus and benefit workers with relatively high productivity when employment adjustment does not significantly hurt productivity. These results stem from a fundamental trade-off: employers must forgo potential worker output to avoid litigation costs, which alters the threat points of wage negotiations and dismissal decisions in favor of workers. Our findings suggest that properly designed unilateral settlement institutions can contribute to both stable employment, efficiency and distributional equity in labor markets beyond merely reducing litigation costs, particularly in contexts with high productivity retention rates.",

We emphasize the ownership of firms as an important channel through which political connections operate and identify a resulting link between political turnover and turnover in the ownership of firms: Political turnover prompts newly politically connected individuals to take, and newly disconnected individuals to cede, ownership of firms. This pattern should be more pronounced in countries with weaker property rights, among firms with publicly recorded owners, and among firms with more immobile assets. Moreover, firms that experience changes to ownership during periods of political turnover should have elevated political connections and therefore pay less taxes and earn higher profits. Analyses of the ownership structure of firms in 87 countries are consistent with the theory. Because politically connected owners allow firms to compensate for other vulnerabilities, the theory also explains mixed findings in prior work on the consequences of asset immobility.",

Consumers benefit from lower prices. Because governments in democracies are more responsive to voters, they should implement lower tariffs. We develop and evaluate an implication of this line of argument. If lower tariffs are a response to consumer interests, lower tariffs should be concentrated on products most relevant to consumers. Using data on consumption shares across product categories, we report evidence that consumer interests do not account for lower tariffs. Governments place higher tariffs on goods with higher consumption shares, and we find no evidence that this relationship attenuates under more democratic institutions. There may be a variety of reasons why more democratic states are engaged in higher levels of international trade. A larger concern for consumer interests, however, is likely not among them.",

          "authors": "Katy Sutcliffe; Dylan Kneale",
          "abstract": "Background: It is now widely recognised that in addition to providing robust evidence about intervention effectiveness, systematic reviews need to provide decision-makers with detailed information about critical intervention, contextual and implementation features that support successful outcomes. Our 2015 paper introduced Intervention Component Analysis (ICA), a method comprised of three key approaches for examining trials within an effectiveness synthesis:  a) an inductive approach to coding trial features; b) extraction of trialists perspectives about the strengths and limitations of features and experiences of implementation; and c) an assessment of identified features in relation to outcomes to assess which appear to be important. In this paper we reflect on how ICA has since been employed by ourselves and others to demonstrate the variety of ways it has been applied and to support further developments of the method. \nMethods: In March 2025 we searched Google Scholar for papers citing the 2015 ICA paper. We extracted information on: the year of publication; whether ICA was employed as an analysis method or simply cited; which aspects of ICA were employed; whether ICA was employed in combination with other synthesis methods and any innovations to or refinements of the method. We also conducted several in-depth case studies to identify the variation and illustrate the benefits of ICA. \nFindings: We identified 95 papers citing the 2015 paper of which 44 reported using or drawing on ICA in their analysis and a further 4 protocols reported a plan to use ICA; the remainder (n=47) cited but did not use ICA. Of the 48 that used or planned to use ICA, most (n=38) used or planned to use it in combination with another method such as a meta-analysis or qualitative comparative analysis whilst 10 used ICA as the sole method of analysis. We identified several innovative applications of ICA including the use of existing frameworks or logic models alongside the inductive coding method.  \nDiscussion: Use of ICA allows systematic reviewers to better understand ‘how’ interventions work. ICA has been found by ourselves and others to be both useful and flexible – able to be tailored to both large and small reviews, suitable for use as a stand-alone tool or alongside existing theories or taxonomies, useful as a tool for understanding intervention variation only or as a tool for explaining variation in outcomes. Potential future avenues for development include the use of subgroup analysis and meta-regression to test the theories generated by ICA.",

          "abstract": "The question of what creates and sustains national political identities has been investigated from many angles. However, the question of how international constraints on national autonomy shape national identities is so far under-investigated. This paper uses the European sovereign debt crisis as a case for investigating whether externally imposed constraints on fiscal political autonomy, typically contested decisions, solidify or weaken national solidarity. Using data from 1983-2021, I find that the imposition of austerity led to a strengthening of national identities immediately after the austerity packages were agreed. This effect was strongest in Southern Europe, where austerity had the largest social impact and constituted the greatest break with pre-existing national policy preferences. I find evidence that the strengthening of exclusively national self-identification after the imposition of austerity was most likely driven by an increased perception of economic threat in the austerity countries, rather than shifting evaluations of EU membership.",

          "authors": "Rita Schmutz; Dana McCoy",
          "abstract": "The early years are crucial for child development, with long-term impacts across various domains. While early childhood education and care (ECEC) policies aim to mitigate social inequalities, ineffective implementation can widen these disparities. This study assesses the impact of the rapid expansion of childcare through public-private partnerships (PPP) for children aged 0 to 3 years in São Paulo, Brazil, on their academic performance at ages 8 to 11. While the PPP model facilitated quicker capacity expansion, centers operating under this scheme were reported to have lower structural quality and received only half the per-child funding compared to public childcare centers. Using administrative datasets and a difference-in-differences approach, we estimated the impact of attending PPP centers (versus better-financed and regulated public centers) in the period immediately following the policy implementation on children's later academic outcomes. The results show that, on average, attending PPP centers in the post-policy period was associated with a small but positive effect on educational outcomes, and that this benefit was primarily observed for children who attend for only one year. Conversely, extended attendance (two to three years) correlated with declining test scores, intensifying concerns about prolonged exposure to substandard conditions. Contrary to expectations, children in disadvantaged areas did not fare worse during the policy expansion than those in wealthier regions, with positive effects concentrated in moderately disadvantaged neighborhoods. These findings underscore the importance of considering variability in ECEC policy outcomes to ensure they do not inadvertently create cumulative disadvantages and to guide policy adjustments for improving these programs.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents an original perspective on fault and responsibility for harms caused by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Scholarship on liability for AI harms highlights the difficulties that doctrines like negligence may encounter in attributing responsibility across complex AI value chains. Drawing on the theory of ‘system safety’, this paper argues that these difficulties can be diminished by conceptualising AI hazards as a set of socio-technical conditions rather than specific aberrant outputs (‘errors’) with discrete technical causes. System affordances, use context, and organisational arrangements are all key risk factors. Animated by case studies of AI harms and near misses, the paper clarifies what is ‘reasonably foreseeable’ about AI harms, and to which value chain participants. It also identifies various kinds of ‘reasonable care’ that different actors can exercise to avert harm. This socio-technical perspectivemakes it easier to apply concepts that are vital to negligence liability,and highlights key priorities for regulating ‘responsible AI’.",

Governments routinely resort to policies that privilege their own debt on financial markets, exploiting their dual role as borrowers and regulators.

They share similarities with prudential regulation, but skew the market in favor of the government's debt; and they share similarities with financial repression, but are less severe and thus consistent with the growth of financial markets. Introducing the first systematic dataset documenting the use of such policies across countries and over time, we demonstrate that governments implement borrowing privileges when their interactions with the global economy heighten fiscal needs: when borrowing costs indicate tightened access to credit, when trade liberalization undercuts revenue, and where fixed exchange rates increase the value of fiscal space. Despite the mobility of financial assets and constraints from global markets, governments retain latitude in regulating domestic markets to their own fiscal benefit.",

          "abstract": "The Gregorian calendar and the 7-day week are impractical systems of common\ntimekeeping. More practical would be a calendar based on a 6-day week and a 30-day month,\nsuch that the year is divided into 12 months plus a monthless week at the end of the year\ncomprising 5 days (or 6 days in a leap year), and each year begins with a new week, i.e. the\nmonthless week would end in the old year, even if it lasts only 5 days. Business and science\nwould benefit from such a secularization of the calendar.",

          "authors": "Fernando Ivan Garza Hernandez; Luis Escobar L.-Dellamary",
          "abstract": "El capítulo examina la paradoja de la normalización lingüística en el discurso intercultural, destacando cómo la planificación y estandarización del lenguaje pueden operar como mecanismos de control ideológico. Se introduce el concepto de Demarcadores Identitarios Discursivos (DID), los cuales, aunque útiles en la categorización social, pueden reducir la diversidad lingüística y cultural a meras abstracciones. Se argumenta que estos demarcadores, al elevarse al nivel ontológico, contribuyen a una visión esencialista y estática de la identidad, en oposición a una perspectiva enactivista que enfatiza la identidad como emergente y dinámica. Desde una perspectiva decolonial, se critica la imposición de normas lingüísticas eurocéntricas que perpetúan la jerarquización cultural y la marginación de lenguas y comunidades minorizadas. Se expone cómo la planificación lingüística ha servido históricamente como herramienta de unificación nacionalista, contribuyendo a la consolidación de estructuras de poder hegemónicas. A través del análisis de la epistemología de la representación y las dicotomías impuestas por el racionalismo, se cuestiona la validez científica y ética de la normalización lingüística como proyecto político. El capítulo concluye abogando por una resignificación crítica de los DID, enfatizando la necesidad de prácticas discursivas más equitativas y contextualmente sensibles. Se propone un enfoque que reconozca la diversidad lingüística sin imponer jerarquías normativas, promoviendo una visión más inclusiva y dinámica de la identidad cultural y lingüística.\n\nPalabras clave: Identidad Enactiva, Idealismo Analítico, Raciolingüística, Decolonialidad, Educación Superior Intercultural.",

          "authors": "Lakshmanan K",
          "abstract": "The transition from the Indus-Sarasvati civilization to the Ganges civilization marks a foundational transformation in Hindu religious traditions. This study proposes an Indus-Ganges migration framework as an alternative to Aryan-Dravidian model to explain the evolution of ritual, language, and mythology. Early Vedic yajña traditions and deities such as Indra and Agni gave way to Bhakti movements, temple worship, and the prominence of Shiva and Vishnu. Linguistic and textual shifts, including reinterpretations of dharma, yajña, and moksha, reflected broader cultural transformations. The Upanishads, Puranas, and epic literature encoded these changes, preserving continuity while embracing new religious structures. By integrating textual analysis, linguistic evolution, and archaeological insights, this study demonstrates how Hinduism developed through adaptation rather than racial or linguistic ruptures. Reframing Hinduism’s origins within the Indus-Ganges continuum offers a more nuanced understanding of its historical evolution.",

          "abstract": "How do democratic institutions shape financial market regulation? Focusing on the government’s fiscal motives in financial market regulation, we present a new dataset documenting policies that governments use to place their own debt in an advantageous position on financial markets. These policies, which we call borrowing privileges, commonly require that banks and institutional investors hold their own government’s debt, and take a place in-between prudential and repressive regulation. Drawing on data for 58 non-OECD countries, we document that borrowing privileges are more likely to be implemented in countries with democratic institutions. Focusing on the mechanisms for this association, we show that several characteristics typically associated with democracies – increased revenue needs from trade liberalization, political competition and transparency, and the growth of financial markets – make these policies attractive to policy-makers. We contribute to the literature on the institutional sources of financial regulation and show how governments balance the growth of financial markets with revenue concerns.",

          "abstract": "Humanity faces a complex and dangerous global risk landscape, and many different terms and concepts have been used to make sense of it. One broad strand of research characterises how risk emerges from the complex global system, using concepts like systemic risk, Anthropocene risk, synchronous failure, negative social tipping points, and polycrisis. Another strand focuses on possible worst-case outcomes, using concepts like global catastrophic risk (GCR), existential risk, and extinction risk. Despite their clear relevance to each other, only limited connections have been made between these two strands. Here we provide a framework which synthesises the two and shows how emergent properties of the global system contribute to the risk of global catastrophic outcomes. Specifically, the global system generates hazards, amplification, vulnerability, and latent risk, as well as challenges for GCR assessment and mitigation. This systemic lens helps us understand the origins of GCR, provides a useful interface between two deeply related but infrequently connected bodies of work, and provides important insights for risk reduction.",
