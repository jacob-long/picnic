          "title": "LINGUISTIC STRATEGIES IN MISINFORMATION: A SEMANTIC-PRAGMATIC FRAMEWORK FOR DETECTING MANIPULATION IN MEDIA DISCOURSE",
          "authors": "ANGELICA JEANICE MARTINS ANDERSEN",
          "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

          "authors": "Kamil Fuławka; Ralph Hertwig; Dirk Wulff",
          "abstract": "Understanding the reasons behind human choices under risk is a central goal of the decision sciences, yet traditional methods relying on behavioral data are limited by strict invariance assumptions. Here, we introduce a scalable method using large language models (LLMs) to analyze verbal reports and identify the articulated reasons for choices between monetary lotteries. We show that a validated LLM accurately identifies predefined decision reasons in participants' free-text reports, aligning with their actual choices in over 92\\% of trials. Our analysis reveals that reason usage varies systematically and is driven more by the choice problem's structure than by individual differences. A predictive model based on these problem-specific reason profiles outperforms prospect theory in out-of-sample prediction. This work demonstrates that verbal reports are a rich data source and that LLMs can unlock their potential, challenging foundational invariance assumptions and paving the way for more context-aware models of human decision-making.",

          "authors": "Jürgen Kayser",
          "abstract": "Temporal principal components analysis (tPCA) is widely used to identify and quantify event-related potentials (ERPs). Less commonly, it has been applied to single-trial EEG epochs, despite concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty about how single-trial components compare with those derived from averaged waveforms. Alternatively, averaged principal components (PCs) can be imposed on single trials via back-projection. The present study evaluated the fidelity of single-trial and back-projected single-trial tPCA (covariance-based, unrestricted Varimax rotation) in representing meaningful averaged PCs by systematically comparing factor loadings and factor scores in two existing ERP datasets (72-channel, N=152; 67-channel, N=98), using both surface-referenced (infinity, nose) and reference-free current source density (CSD) transformations. In the 72-channel dataset with four balanced conditions (emotional hemifield paradigm), single-trial PCs closely matched those from averaged data, whereas in the 67-channel dataset with three imbalanced conditions (novelty oddball task), they did not. In contrast, across datasets and transformations, back-projected single-trial PCs consistently reproduced virtually identical averaged PCs. All single-trial tPCA solutions enabled full reconstruction of the original data matrix, confirming the validity of back-projected decomposition, and all single-trial measures showed high or adequate internal consistency. These findings suggest that single-trial tPCA may approximate averaged solutions only when the variance structure is preserved, whereas back-projection provides a robust alternative: it quantifies single-trial epochs based on the variance structure of the averaged data, thereby maintaining component structure, integrity, and interpretability, and enabling confident linkage of trial-level component measures with other trial-level variables.",

          "authors": "Ulrich Schimmack; Maria Soto",
          "abstract": "Statistical power remains a central yet confusing concept in psychology. Pek et al. (2024) define power as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true, a view consistent with many textbook accounts. We argue, however, that Cohen (1962, 1988) advanced a broader definition: the probability of obtaining a significant result, without conditioning on a specific alternative effect size. This broader perspective allows power to serve two functions—planning studies with hypothetical effect sizes and evaluating completed studies with plausible effect size estimates. The broader concept is useful to evaluate single studies and to estimate publication bias. We conclude that power analysis of published research is an important tool for the credibility revolution of psychological research.",

          "authors": "Chiara Pompei; Serena Lecce; Paola Del Sette; Elena Didoni; Luca Bischetti; Valentina Bambini",
          "abstract": "Persuasion is a complex communicative process aiming at influencing others’ beliefs or behaviors. Imbuing everyday communication, persuasion is a crucial skill for children to manage social \ninteractions successfully. While theoretically persuasion has been linked with the mastery of figurative language and with pragmatics more broadly, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence exploring the relationship between persuasion and metaphor skills. Here we tackle this issue in early childhood by examining whether individual differences in metaphor skills are related to those in persuasion. A sample of 167 children (age 4-6 years) was assessed for persuasive abilities alongside metaphor comprehension and production, in addition to vocabulary and working memory skills as control variables. \nResults showed an improvement in persuasive skills at 5 years of age. Across ages, children preferred \nto use positive persuasive strategies (i.e., offering rewards) over negative ones (i.e., punishments), \nwhile psychological strategies relying on mitigation and modeling were rarely used. Regardless of the \ntype of strategy, persuasion correlated positively with vocabulary skills. Interestingly, greater use of \npsychological persuasive strategies was associated with better metaphor production skills (being con\nversely hampered by working memory), while no effect of metaphor comprehension was found. Over\nall, these findings suggest that some aspects of metaphor skills, within the broader set of pragmatic  competencies, might be a driving factor in achieving a high-level persuasive style. Such aspects possibly deal with the functions of metaphors to favor flexible conceptualization and social use of language.",

          "abstract": "What moral values do politicians on the right and left invoke in their rhetoric, and do they emphasize different issues when appealing to these values? We used Structured Topic Models (STM) combined with a word embedding model to examine U.S. politicians’ use of moral language and identify the issues Democrats and Republicans moralize most on X (formerly Twitter). Analyzing 1,578,057 posts from U.S. members of Congress (2019–2023), we found that (1) Democrats and Republicans did not differ meaningfully in what kinds of moral language they used but that (2) they used moral language for different issues. For example, Republicans used language reflecting harm and care to criticize Democratic economic policies, whereas Democrats used it to criticize Trump’s immigration policies. These findings suggest that politicians on the right and left rhetorically invoke similar moral values but do so to highlight different issues.",

          "authors": "Zhang Qikai; 吴静岚",
          "abstract": "Efficiently perceiving social interactions is fundamental to human social cognition, yet the underlying mechanisms remain contested. Domain-specific theories propose specialized processing for social content, while domain-general accounts attribute perceptual advantages to low-level visual features. This debate has been critically hampered by an overreliance on static stimuli, which obscure crucial temporal dynamics and introduce configural confounds. The present study addressed these limitations using a dynamic visual search paradigm that differentiated physical-contingency interactions (defined by synchronized, perceptually coupled movements) from communicative-contingency interactions (defined by sequential, meaning-based exchanges). Experiment 1 revealed a sharp dissociation: physical-contingency interactions were detected more efficiently than both non-interactive dyads and communicative-contingency interactions, while communicative-contingency interactions showed no search advantages. Experiment 2 employed eye-tracking to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Physical-contingency interaction search showed overall search advantages through enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection, despite equivalent attentional guidance compared to non-interaction search. Communicative-contingency interaction search exhibited enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection but suffered from attentional guidance deficits that eliminated overall search benefits. Additionally, communicative-contingency interactions as distractors required the longest fixation durations, indicating strongest attentional stickiness. These findings challenge existing theoretical frameworks by demonstrating that social interaction search advantages cannot be explained by either domain-specific or domain-general mechanisms alone. We propose a dual-route processing model wherein physical-contingency interactions benefit primarily from domain-general perceptual mechanisms that efficiently process motion synchrony and gestalt properties, while communicative-contingency interactions rely on domain-specific social processing mechanisms that handle complex interpersonal meaning. This integrated framework reconciles competing theoretical perspectives and advances understanding of how different types of social information are prioritized in dynamic visual environments.",

          "abstract": "The present article offers an assessment of intra-individual variability in visual\nattention using the Theory of Visual Attention, which provides a formal framework for\nquantifying attentional components. We specifically investigated overall attentional\ncapacity – that is, the available processing speed – and its distribution, the relative\nattentional weight.\nBy reanalyzing a large existing dataset from Tünnermann and Scharlau (2021),\nwe found that across multiple testing days, participants either remained stable within a\n20 Hz margin or showed consistent improvements in capacity – in some cases tripling\ntheir initial capacity. The weights in response to salient stimuli were remarkably\nconsistent.\nTo determine whether increases in capacity reflect pure test-retest effects or are\nfacilitated by consolidation between days, and to quantify within-day variability, we\nconducted a second study in which participants completed five self-administered\nsessions within a single day. Capacities remained within the same magnitude and did\nnot show a consistent directional trend. The relative weights exhibited comparatively\nlittle variation in most participants, akin to the previously analyzed dataset. Further,\nestimation uncertainty increased with higher capacity values.\nThese results suggest that capacity may be subject to training effects, but that\nsuch improvements appear to depend on longer breaks between sessions. This has\nimportant implications for individualized assessment: A personal prior could be\nestimated from a single session to accelerate future estimations, as long as subsequent\nsessions occur on the same day. Participants with higher capacities may require tailored\nexperimentation methods when small to medium effects are of interest, due to increased\nuncertainty.",

          "abstract": "The hypervigilance hypothesis of psychosocial distress posits that individuals with visible skin conditions exhibit an attentional bias toward disease- or stigma-related information. While previous research has focused on psoriasis, the present study represents the first empirical test of the hypervigilance hypothesis in atopic dermatitis. Across a series of four pre-registered reaction time studies, we found no evidence that people with atopic dermatitis preferentially allocate their attention to words that are related to the sensory-affective or stigmatizing disease experience, relative to neutral control words. This was the case both during the early phase of stimulus disengagement, as well as during a later maintained attention phase dominated by controlled strategic processes. Overall, contrary to our expectations, results are incompatible with the hypervigilance hypothesis since the attention of people with atopic dermatitis was not biased towards the disease or stigma-related information.",

          "authors": "Russell T. Warne",
          "abstract": "Mental speed is a multidimensional construct that encompasses three distinct time-related measures: reaction time, processing speed, and tempo, the latter of which is defined as the rate at which individuals respond to items varying in difficulty. This study applies van der Linden’s (2007, 2009) hierarchical model to jointly analyze item responses and response times from 1,620 adults taking the nine core subtests of the Reasoning and Intelligence Online Test (RIOT; https://riotiq.com). Using Bayesian estimation of the van der Linden model, results showed strong model fit across subtests, with near-zero correlations between examinee ability and examinee tempo for verbal tasks (r = -.209 to .136) and stronger negative correlations for visuospatial tasks (r = -.467 to -.769), supporting predictions from dual process theory. Item intensity and sensitivity positively moderated response times with difficulty on most subtests, indicating that item characteristics were the cause of longer response times for more difficult items. Few examinees (2.5%) exhibited dual misfit in responses and times, but the Figure Weights subtest revealed anomalous slow responding. These findings demonstrate that tempo (i.e., examinee response times) are independent of cognitive ability level and that correlations between the two are spuriously caused by item characteristics. Implications for intelligence testing and future experimental validation are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This review examines how listeners evaluate sounds in everyday contexts and how auditory attention research has approached this process. While experimental paradigms have yielded important insights into auditory processing, their constructs often rely on task-specific definitions that may not fully reflect how sounds are perceived and interpreted outside the laboratory. We argue that auditory evaluation is shaped by the interaction of acoustic properties, affective tone, task demands, and contextual framing. To account for this, we propose a multidimensional framework based on arousal, valence, and context, which enables a more flexible characterization of how sounds are judged in everyday listening. We also examine how different methodological approaches highlight distinct facets of this evaluative process. By focusing on the conditions under which sounds are experienced, this review contributes to a more integrative understanding of auditory attention across both controlled and naturalistic settings.",

          "title": "The Paradox of Agency in Psychotherapy: How People with Mental Distress Experience Generative AI and Human Therapists",
          "authors": "Xiaolu Dai; Ling Li Leng; Yiyan Liu; Yu-Te Huang; Daniel Fu Keung Wong",
          "abstract": "Background: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models has sparked heated debate over whether Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots can serve as “digital therapists” capable of providing therapeutic support. While much of this discussion focuses on AI’s lack of agency, understood as the absence of mental states, consciousness, autonomy, and intentionality, empirical research on users’ real-world experiences remains limited.\nObjective: This study explores how individuals with mental distress engage with both generative AI and human psychotherapy in natural and unguided contexts, with a focus on how perceptions of agency shape these experiences. By drawing on participants’ dual exposure, the study seeks to contribute to the ongoing debate about “AI therapists” by clarifying the role of agency in therapeutic change.\nMethods: Sixteen adults who had sought mental health support from both human therapists and ChatGPT participated in semi-structured interviews, during which they shared and compared their experiences with each type of interaction. Transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults: Analysis revealed three themes and eight subthemes enabling comparison of what participants found helpful and challenging in their interactions with ChatGPT and human therapists: (1) encouraging open and authentic self-disclosure but limiting deep exploration; (2) the myth of relationship: caring, acceptance, and understanding; (3) fostering therapeutic change: the promise and pitfalls of data-driven solutions. Drawing on these comparative reflections, we propose a conceptual model that highlights how perceptions of agency carry both strengths and limitations for therapeutic engagement. The model also illustrates how the non-agential nature of AI chatbots shapes their capacity to support individuals with mental distress in ways that differ from human therapists.\nConclusion: The findings suggest that agency functions as a double-edged feature in therapeutic interactions. Rather than anthropomorphizing AI chatbots, their non-agential features—such as responsive behaviors, absence of intentions, objective stance, and disembodied state—should be used strategically to complement human-delivered psychotherapy. Meanwhile, practitioners should maximize the benefits of their agential qualities while remaining cautious of the potential inherent risks.",

Here, we introduced an open ecosystem (https://taskbeacon.github.io/) that addressed these gaps. Task and Paradigm Structure (TAPS) defined a clear directory layout separating task logic, configuration, assets, documentation and output. Psyflow, built on top of PsychoPy, provided support for TAPS and offered flexible and modularized tools for participant’s information collection, block/trial management, stimulus presentation, response collection, event synchronization with various neuroimaging systems. TaskBeacon served as the community-driven platform for hosting curated tasks, managing variants, and coordinating community contributions. Finally, the model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposed tools to large language models (LLMs), allowing natural language-driven task development and localization. Together, these components form an ecosystem that advances task standardization, fosters reproducibility and collaboration, and enables LLMs–driven development of cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects receptive and expressive language skills. In contrast to the wealth of evidence on acquired language disorders, we understand relatively little about the neural underpinnings of DLD. A recent meta-analysis across different types of structural brain analyses in DLD highlighted consistent anatomical differences in the anterior striatum, with other subcortical structures relatively spared. These findings are consistent with predictions from the procedural circuit deficit hypothesis (PCDH), namely that the anterior neostriatum differs in structure and function in DLD, whereas medial temporal lobe structures are unaffected and may act in a compensatory manner. Here in a case-control study with a larger sample size than previous studies, we evaluated volume and microstructure of subcortical grey matter structures using T1-weighted images and diffusion imaging. Our predictions were partly in accord with those of the procedural circuit deficit hypothesis and the findings of the meta-analysis. Neuroimaging and behavioral measures were acquired in 156 children and adolescents (54 DLD; 74 typically developing; 28 with a history of language difficulties) aged 10:0–15:11 years. As predicted by the PCDH, there were significant differences in the DLD group in volume and microstructure of the neostriatum (caudate nucleus, putamen). However, in contrast to our prediction, there were also significantly smaller structures in the DLD group across other subcortical structures evaluated: globus pallidus, thalamus, and hippocampus. The hippocampal difference is of particular interest as it is hypothesized in the PCDH to be spared in DLD. Microstructural measures (diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) revealed differences in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, and hippocampus. Multivariate machine learning analyses highlighted the relationship between the hippocampus and language skills, but only in the typically developing cohort. We conclude that the subcortical correlates of DLD are in fact not limited to the neostriatum and represent important areas of further inquiry.",

An earlier paper showed\nhow, when it is treated as a probability distribution, the traditional\nsingle PMF based on binary-choice data can be decomposed into sensory\nand decision components, expressed as two independent random variables\nthat are summed to create the PMF.  Here we extend this development\nto the multiple-response procedure, and use it to elucidate the\nrelations among the spreads and shapes of the resulting family of\nPMFs, which can be described by their first four cumulants.  For\nexample, we determine conditions under which the PMFs can have the\nsame spread and shape, differing only by translation on the stimulus\naxis.  Whereas PMFs depend on both sensory and decision processes,\ndifferences among the PMFs in a family depend only on the decision\nprocesses.  Application of this \\fImultiple-PMF method \\fRto several\ndecision models, whose evaluations depend on the PMF cumulants, shows it to\nhave greater power than the single-PMF method for understanding the\nperceptual process.  Although this work was inspired by experiments\non the perception of temporal order, it can be applied to experiments\nwhere features of stimuli other than their occurrence times are\nbeing compared, such as the pitch of tones or the brightness of\nlights.",

          "abstract": "In two pre-registered experiments (exp.1: n=44; exp.2: n=46), we investigated whether emotional inner speech influences heart rate. Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: self-encouraging positive inner speech, self-degrading negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Experiment 1 consisted of two negative, two positive and four counting trials. Experiment 2 had four trials of each type. Trials lasted 180 seconds in experiment 1 and had a mixed duration in experiment 2 (40-70 seconds) to limit predictability. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust and demonstrates a causal effect on physiology. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed. We also discuss the results in relation to possible confounds, such as differences in cognitive effort and inner speech rate.",

          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, offer significant performance benefits across professional tasks. Yet, their adoption in work-related contexts is complicated by social disapproval and penalties, especially under conditions of mandated transparency. In three studies (one pre-registered; n = 1,678 applicants and n = 477 evaluators), we investigate how people navigate this augmentation-approval tradeoff in an incentivized mini-job application scenario. We find that mandatory disclosure substantially reduces visible AI adoption, but prompts a covert behavioral strategy we term shadow adoption, that is, using AI in ways that avoid detection and disclosure. Strikingly, these shadow AI users produce the highest-quality applications, as rated by HR professionals who are unaware that the outputs were AI-assisted. As the knowledge about the tradeoff spreads, shadow adoption becomes more prevalent, with nearly twice as many people choosing to use shadow AI. These results reveal a misalignment between well-intended transparency rules and user incentives in work-related contexts. Policies and technologies designed to enforce ethical AI use may inadvertently encourage covert behavior, rewarding concealment over compliance.",

The motivation for a post-school pathway (e.g., starting university or vocational training) was examined as a potential predictor of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 874 between ages 16 and 20; 69% female, 95% born in Germany) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway.a At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global than for daily assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations between the motivation for a post-school pathway and well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

Experiments 2 and 3 examined the BBS in politically polarized groups of Democrats and Republicans.

In this commentary, we discuss why and how greater integration of affective science with central tenets of, and frameworks from, diversity science —“the study of the interpretation and construction of human differences” — would enhance the field’s understanding of a wide variety of consequential affective phenomena.

          "authors": "Justin Angel",
          "abstract": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of AI psychotherapeutic tools (APTs) that are non-inferior to human therapists and hold the potential to dramatically expand access to mental healthcare worldwide. This paper proposes the ΔAPT framework, which forecasts APT clinical outcomes by linking architectural decisions to validated therapeutic metrics. Through an interdisciplinary AI and psychotherapy critical review, this paper establishes APT success criteria using conventional psychotherapy measurements including symptom reduction scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7), quality-of-life improvements, and therapeutic relationship indicators (WAI). A comparative analysis reveals that newer LLM- driven APTs achieve clinical outcomes non-inferior to human psychotherapists and significantly superior to earlier rules-based chatbots. The ΔAPT framework models how APTs' inherent structural advantages (24/7 availability, negligible cost) counterbalance current technical limitations (hallucinations, sycophancy, bias) and systemic risks (legal ambiguity, safety failures). Specific AI/ML architectural solutions are identified: context engineering techniques (retrieval-augmented generation, chain-of-thought prompting); fine-tuning on 1,000-10,000 hours of diverse therapy modalities beyond CBT; multi-agent architectures for cognitive task distribution; and integrated ML models for safety monitoring. This comprehensive roadmap guides APT developers and researchers in LLM architectural choices and therapeutic modality selection, with the goal of continuously improving clinical outcomes while addressing the global mental health crisis.\n\n\n**Contributions** \nThis paper presents four key contributions for AI/ML and psychotherapy research: First, the ΔAPT framework, which forecasts clinical outcomes by modeling the interplay between APTs'\nstructural advantages (zero-friction intake, extensive memory), technical limitations (LLM operational issues), and systemic risks (legal, ethical, safety concerns). Second, a prioritized analysis of limitations based on prevalence and mitigation feasibility, identifying sycophancy as the most critical unresolved challenge. Third, the first comprehensive taxonomy of hybrid APT architectures, detailing how context engineering, fine-tuning on ethically sourced therapy transcripts, multi-agent design, and ML safety models can be integrated to achieve clinical efficacy. Fourth, evidence that multimodal audio-video technologies are approaching readiness for emotionally attuned therapeutic interactions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Social anxiety and alcohol use disorders are often comorbid. Researchers have identified several psychosocial factors that often maintain social anxiety, such as fear of negative and positive evaluation, post-event processing, and difficulties with emotion regulation. Although evidence suggests that social anxiety disorder and alcohol-related risks are indirectly related via greater anxiety alcohol coping motives, the roles of maintaining psychosocial factors have not yet been tested in a comprehensive model. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study investigated the extent to which these psychosocial mechanisms were related to alcohol use and related problems through social anxiety and anxiety coping-motived drinking. Methods: 476 undergraduate students and community members completed an online survey measuring social anxiety symptoms, psychosocial mechanisms, and alcohol use problems. Results: We conducted a multivariate path analysis and examined eight indirect pathways within this model. Findings support that complex indirect relationships exist between psychosocial factors and alcohol outcomes via social anxiety and coping motives. While difficulties with emotion regulation only demonstrated partial mediation effects, all other psychosocial factors were differentially related to all alcohol-related risks through a combination of indirect-only and inconsistent mediation effects. Implications: These findings support self-medication and biopsychosocial models of social anxiety disorder and highlight the importance of considering the intricate underlying relationships between psychosocial factors, social anxiety symptoms, coping motives, and alcohol-related risks. Moreover, they can help inform evidence-based interventions for comorbid social anxiety and alcohol use disorders by identifying pertinent treatment targets.",

          "abstract": "Digital technologies now shape how people connect, work, relax, and avoid. Yet the psychological sciences lack a unified approach for explaining what sustains these behaviours over time. Existing frameworks are either too broad (e.g., “screen time”) or too narrow (e.g., app features) to capture the functions digital behaviours serve. Here we introduce technological behaviourism, a general theoretical approach grounded in operant conditioning that explains digital engagement through observable antecedents and consequences. Rather than focusing on what people do (e.g., scrolling), this approach is focused on why they do it, in terms of four functions: exploration, esteem, entertainment, and escape. By shifting the lens from form to function, technological behaviourism enables precise, testable analysis of digital engagement and guides the design of context-aware, functionally aligned interventions. It bridges behavioural science with digital environments, offering a scalable, mechanistically grounded approach to understanding and shaping digital behaviour.",

This system, comprised of 24 character strengths attempting to provide a comprehensive set of character dimensions, has inspired a number of studies attempting to define a latent structure for the strengths. The most frequently replicated model across different measures of the strengths, populations, and analytic strategies is comprised of three factors that have been or can be called heart/will/mind, caring/self-control/inquisitiveness, or.morality/self-control/reasoning. Subsequent explorations has suggested this model has relevance beyond the context of character strengths to character in general. Summarizing additional research with the character strengths, research on persona perception, empirical research and theory in education, discussions in moral philosophy, and examples from entertainment, the case is made for considering these three dimensions a Big Three of Character, playing a similar role to the Big Five of Personality. Evidence from person perception and popular culture in particular suggest the model is intuitively appreciated even by youth.",

          "abstract": "When listening to acoustically challenging speech, listeners may have to compensate by shifting their cognitive strategies such as how they use prior context. This shift may depend on the age and hearing acuity of the listener. In the current study, younger adults with normal hearing (N = 48; Exp 1) and older adults with varying hearing acuity (N = 80; Exp 2), listened in quiet and in noise to contextually constraining sentences that ended in an expected word, an unexpected word, or a morphosyntactic violation of the expected word. We recorded EEG and extracted event-related potentials (ERPs) to target words. For younger adults, we observed that the syntactic P600—a component linked to controlled integrative processes—was reduced when listening to speech in background noise. In contrast, an ERP response more strongly yoked to predictive processing, the late frontal response, was present in noise, suggesting that acoustic challenge did not impair predictive processing. For older adults with normal hearing, we observed a small prediction-related ERP response and a robust P600 response in quiet. In noise, the integration-related P600 response to syntactic violations was reduced while the increased syntactic N400 effect increased, suggesting a shift from an integrative mode to reliance on lexical predictions. In quiet, a similar shift towards reduced integration and increased prediction was observed with increasing hearing loss, but these prediction-related effects were severely reduced among older adults with hearing loss when speech was presented in noise, suggesting auditory limits to compensatory reliance on contextual prediction. Collectively, these results suggest that listeners show adaptive shifts between integrative and predictive processing modes as a function of age, acoustic challenge, and hearing acuity.",

Neither of these strategies can be detected in paradigms assessing habits in humans, which are usually conducted in disorder-irrelevant contexts, and this may explain inconsistent evidence for a goal-directed-to-habitual behavior shift in addiction. We tested whether individuals with high-risk drinking behavior rely more on (red)SR, particularly in alcohol-related contexts. Findings suggest that a (reduced) random-policy SR-like strategy contributes to human behavior, but that high-risk drinkers do not differ from low-risk drinkers in their use of this strategy. Instead, both groups rely less on (reduced) random-policy SR and more on model-free control in alcohol-related contexts. Results suggest that (reduced) random-policy SR supports adaptive, resource-efficient behavior and is selectively downregulated in substance-related contexts, highlighting the importance of contextual modulation in understanding decision strategies in mental health.",

In an experiment comparing both instructional treatments on both types of content, we observe a cross-over interaction such that participants learn verbatim facts better from pure practice testing but learn general skills better from example-integrated practice. We use a computational learning architecture, AL, to create an executable theory that explains and predicts these results. Simulated students developed in AL interactively learn from the materials provided in the same four conditions as human learners and reproduce the same cross-over interaction. We further demonstrate that the benefit of integrated examples for general skill learning are a result of, and thus explained by, AL’s inductive learning mechanisms whereas the benefit of practice for verbatim fact learning result from AL’s memory learning mechanisms.",

So far, insights have largely focused on controlled lab-based experimental studies while less is known about individual differences in infants’ curiosity in everyday life. Recently, the Infant and Toddler Curiosity Questionnaire (ITCQ) was developed to examine trait curiosity in infants between 5 to 24 months. Extending this novel tool to Dutch-speaking families, this preregistered study translated the ITCQ to Dutch and examined its psychometric properties in a sample of 316 Dutch-speaking caregivers of infants in The Netherlands (5 to 24 months, 47% female). The results indicated that the ITCQ-NL reliably measures infants’ general curiosity and their curiosity in three subdomains (Sensory, Investigative, and Interactive Curiosity). Furthermore, the ITCQ-NL showed moderate to good reliability over time (n = 218). Finally, we provide evidence of the questionnaire’s construct validity by relating the construct to established temperament measures. To conclude, this study demonstrates the reliability and validity of the ITCQ-NL for assessing individual differences in infants’ everyday trait curiosity in a Dutch population. Our instrument will also facilitate the exploration of cross-cultural differences and comparisons across methodological approaches.",

In both, children needed to coordinate between simple mathematical operations (counting and addition), and reconstructing an agent's visual or mental perspective.

          "abstract": "Later life involves critical financial and healthcare decisions, such as how to manage one's income in retirement. With ageing populations and increased individual responsibilities, understanding the impact of healthy cognitive ageing on decision-making is crucial. While the effect of ageing on basic cognitive abilities has been examined widely, its effects on decision-making remain underexplored. To address the latter, we conducted a large (n = 357), pre-registered online experiment comparing decision-making and basic cognitive functioning between younger (18-30) and older (65+) adults. Older adults made significantly lower quality decisions. The decline in decision-making capacity is primarily explained by lower performance on tasks of basic cognitive abilities and not age, education, or motivation. Despite investing more time, older adults explored fewer decision options and were more overconfident. These findings suggest that healthy cognitive ageing impairs decision-making capacity due to cognitive decline, with important implications for policy and choice architecture design, particularly in ageing populations.",

          "authors": "Julia M. Rohrer; Vincent Arel-Bundock",
          "abstract": "Psychological researchers usually make sense of regression models by interpreting coefficient estimates directly. This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

The current study investigates how perceived normative and personally endorsed honour values predict competition and cooperation behaviours. In an online experiment testing pre-registered hypotheses, 3,371 participants from 13 societies made incentivized competition decisions in a contest game and cooperation decisions for coordination in a step-level public goods game. Perceived normative honour values were associated with greater competition and also greater cooperation at both societal and individual levels. Personally endorsing values tied to defence of family reputation was associated with greater coordinative efforts, whereas endorsing self-promotion and retaliation was associated with weaker engagement in coordination. These findings highlight the role of honour as a cultural logic (in its different forms) in shaping competition and cooperation across societies.",

Research on measuring and training selective attention is limited and focused on a single sensory modality. In the current study, we tested the psychometric properties of a new, digitalized selective attention measure, the adapted Bourdon-Wiersma test in 26 healthy participants. We also used this measure to test the efficacy of a new computerized selective attention training called “The Botanist and the Animals” in 17 ABI patients. The training was hypothesized to help patients regain control over sensory experiences, without intending to restore cognitive functions. Both the measure and training involved multiple sensory modalities. Results showed variable psychometric properties of the adapted Bourdon-Wiersma test. Selective attention training in ABI patients showed near transfer effects on this measure, although only 35% of the patients showed reliable improvements. No far transfer effects to other cognitive measures were observed, yet exploratory analyses indicated improvements in self-reported rehabilitation participation, cognitive difficulties, and quality of life. Potentially, active engagement in the training helped ABI patients to boost their confidence in daily life, yet the specificity and long-term effects of the training need further assessment.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) are neural prostheses that restore some level of hearing capacity, albeit\nconveying a less fine-grained speech signal than normal hearing conditions. For example, CIs\nconvey altered fundamental frequency (F0) information, disrupting the perception of lexical stress\n(e.g., distinguishing between the noun CONtent and the adjective conTENT) in languages in which\nthis feature rests on F0 modulations. CI-users can compensate for the degraded nature of the\nacoustic input by exploiting the audiovisual affordances of human communication, weighing more\nheavily the visual information provided by the speaker (e.g., lip movements and gestures). Recent\nstudies showed that, in individuals with normal hearing, the timing of simple up-and-down\nmovements of the hand (i.e., beat gestures) biases lexical stress perception. The present study tested\nif the timing of beat gestures produced by an avatar can bias Dutch lexical stress perception in\nvocoded speech, which simulates CI-hearing conditions. The bias induced by beat gestures in\nvocoded speech was particularly pronounced when hearing an ambiguous or the least frequent\nstress pattern in Dutch. These results suggest that (even artificially generated) beat gestures can be\nused to support speech perception in CI-mediated speech, especially when processing words with\nprosodic features that are less frequent.",

This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and emotion-processing difficulties, coping strategies, resilience, and cognitive functioning after moderate-severe TBI.\n\nMethod: This was a secondary analysis of data from 106 individuals with moderate-severe TBI. Suicidal ideation and emotional distress were assessed using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Participants also completed measures of emotional lability and detachment (Comprehensive Assessment of Traits Relevant to Personality Disorders [CAT-PD]), coping (Coping Scale for Adults), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and cognitive functioning, including subjective (CAT-PD, Brief Rating of Executive Function) and objective measures (Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone). Spearman’s correlations and path models were used to examine psychological and cognitive correlates of suicidal ideation.\n\nResults: Suicidal ideation was positively associated with emotional lability, emotional detachment, non-productive coping, and self-reported cognitive problems, and negatively associated with resilience. Path models indicated that emotional distress accounted for 76–100% of these associations. Conversely, suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with adaptive coping or objective cognitive performance.\n\nConclusions: Emotion processing, non-productive coping strategies, low resilience, and self-reported cognitive problems are linked to suicidal ideation in individuals with moderate-severe TBI, primarily through their associations with emotional distress. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and its underlying contributors in suicide prevention for this population.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Discrepancies have previously been observed between the numerical mathematics problem solving of autistic children and their solving of worded mathematics problems, with the latter perceived as an area of challenge. While there are many reasons why this challenge may exist (e.g., reading comprehension and executive function differences), one, as yet untapped, explanation is the specific mathematical concepts assessed which may confound comparisons across assessments. \n\nMethods: In this study, 43 autistic children (32 male, 11 female) aged 6- to 12-years completed four assessments of mathematics problems: WIAT-III subscales of Numerical Operation and Mathematical Problem Solving, and two bespoke subscales (numerical and worded) matched on mathematical concepts and difficulty across numerical and worded problem sets. \n\nResults: We found that while performance in the worded problems subscale of the WIAT-III was significantly lower than the numerical problem subscale, there was no significant difference between the two task types in the bespoke measures. \n\nConclusion: Our results suggest that differences in mathematical concepts assessed between worded and numerical problems may explain challenges experienced by autistic children in worded problems, rather than reading comprehension alone. As such, when drawing conclusions about the mathematics performance of autistic children, careful consideration of the mathematics concepts evaluated is needed. These findings also have implications for the development of formal school assessments and research on mathematics skills in autistic children.",

          "abstract": "The question of whether humans have free will or not is longstanding in the areas of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. While the issue has not been resolved, determinist and compatibilist frameworks have received support from the neuropsychological data. In both cases, decisions are made within a broader framework of causal determinism. If thoughts and behaviours are inevitable consequences of a continuous chain of cause-effect events, why do we feel free? Here, we propose a neuropsychological model for the experience of free will as a conditioned illusion – a misattribution of causality reinforced through operant learning. Drawing on classical findings such as the readiness potential preceding conscious intention and more recent work on active inference, we argue that the temporal contiguity of premotor and motor activations gives rise to superstitious conditioning, shaping an experience of – and belief in – free will that is compatible with determinism. Sustained by dopaminergic circuits and reinforced by sensorimotor feedback loops, our framework situates free will as an experiential phenomenon rooted in the functional neuroanatomy of learning. We discuss implications for medicine, ethics, law, and suggest conditions under which the experience of free will may be disrupted or restructured by disease, pharmacology, and reinforcement history.",

          "abstract": "Several prominent theories of eating disorders maintenance exist, with most corresponding to evidence-based treatments. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an ideal method for testing relationships between proposed maintenance factors and eating disorder symptoms given its ability to examine antecedents and consequences. A seminal systematic review and meta-analysis of EMA studies on affect and binge eating was published in 2011, but the literature since this time and beyond these variables has not been synthesized. We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Scopus (last search March 31, 2025) for articles using EMA to study psychological/contextual variables in relation to a core eating disorder symptom in people with an eating disorder or eating disorder symptom. After screening, 179 papers were included. The majority examined affect in relation to binge eating or loss of control (LOC) eating, although affect was also considered in relation to purging, restriction, exercise, and body checking. Whereas negative affect primarily drives binge eating/LOC eating and purging, positive affect appears more relevant for exercise and (perhaps) restriction. Surprisingly few studies have considered how ED-related cognitive, affective, or behavioral variables relate to eating disorder symptoms, despite these being primary associations in leading maintenance/treatment models of eating disorders. Most studies have investigated samples of exclusively women, with some having a small proportion of male participants, and only two samples were comprised of all or almost all men. Future EMA research on eating disorders should go beyond studying affect to test whether relationships proposed in established maintenance models can be observed in daily life.",

This study leverages computational text analysis of over 250,000 U.S. congressional speeches from 1880 to 2020 to examine the evolution of intentionality framing—rhetoric focusing on immigrants' motives, desires, and goals. Using GPT-4 to identify intentionality cues, we find a significant increase in intentionality framing since the mid-20th century, coinciding with growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans. Crucially, pro-immigration discourse increasingly emphasizes positive intentions, while anti-immigration rhetoric has become more behaviorist, focusing on external impacts rather than internal states. This rhetorical divergence intensifies during periods of heightened political polarization. Our findings highlight how political actors strategically mobilize psychological intuitions about intent to mobilize voter support and underscore the role of perceived intentionality in shaping social and moral evaluations of immigrant groups.",

Studies 2a (N = 1,506) and 2b (N = 1,255), conducted as one-week longitudinal studies during the 2024 European and French parliamentary elections, revealed that an information treatment emphasizing deservingness cues strongly reduced misperceptions about immigrants, modestly reduced opposition to immigration, and had an even smaller effect for anti-immigration voting. These findings suggest that while immigrants are often perceived negatively, emphasizing perceived deservingness can mitigate prejudice, presenting a promising strategy for reducing anti-immigration bias.",

          "abstract": "For many years the accepted wisdom in vision science has been that humans tend to underestimate the speed of an object when they pursue it with their gaze in comparison to when they fixate a spot in the visual scene and the object moves across the retina, an effect that is referred to as the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. However, experiments on the Aubert-Fleischl effect have generally employed a target moving in front of a blank background. For objects moving in the real world, relative motion between the object and the background provides additional cues, potentially allowing the visual system to compensate for the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we asked 50 participants to compare the speed of a single sphere to the speed of a sphere-cloud in a two-interval forced-choice task while they either followed the single sphere with their gaze or kept their eyes on a fixation cross. Stimuli were presented in virtual reality and the sphere’s movement could occur either in a completely black environment with no relative motion cues present, or against a visible, textured background behind the moving sphere. The probe sphere-cloud always moved in front of the same background as the target. In a large data set (n = 50), we found no evidence for an Aubert-Fleischl effect, i.e., no evidence for an underestimation of speed during pursuit relative to fixation, in either of the environments. Our results challenge the prevailing notion that object speed is underestimated when the object is pursued versus when fixation is maintained and highlights the necessity to take into account characteristics of the visual scene.",

Results revealed three distinctive grit trajectories over four years: Moderate-Decreasing (72.9%), Low-Stable (17.6%), and High-Decreasing (9.5%). Parenting styles characterized by rejection and chaos predicted class membership. Adolescents in the High-Decreasing class reported the highest levels of psychological well-being, followed by those in the Moderate-Decreasing and Low-Stable classes. Our findings underscore the importance of identifying developmental heterogeneity in grit trajectories.",

Moreover, both species benefitted from category structures that had multiple category-relevant dimensions (i.e., dense categories). In addition, human adults, who have a more advanced ability to attend selectively, showed faster learning and better generalization overall. Finally, attention was optimized to the category-relevant dimension in the sparse category only in human adults.

While previous research used confidence ratings to implicitly infer knowledge gaps, the impact of making these gaps explicitly salient to people on their information-seeking behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated this question across two preregistered experiments (Experiment 1: \\textit{n} = 501, Experiment 2: \\textit{n} = 511 participants). Participants first took a knowledge test on elephant conservation in Botswana. Subsequently, participants repeatedly decided to either read or skip a chapter of an article covering different subtopics on elephant conservation in Botswana, before they took the same test again. We manipulated the salience of knowledge gaps by illustrating pretest performance scores to the experimental group, while the control group received no such information. In Experiment 2, we instructed participants after the pretest that a posttest would follow at the end of the experiment and thereby intended to increase the utility of information seeking. Our results provide converging evidence that illustrating moderate knowledge gaps significantly increased participants' probability of seeking information by reading the chapters. In Experiment 2, illustrating moderate knowledge gaps was not only associated with increased information-seeking behavior, but also led to significantly greater gains in posttest performance compared to the control group. Altogether, our findings open new avenues for research on leveraging knowledge gap illustrations to deliberately stimulate curiosity, thereby increasing information-seeking behavior and knowledge acquisition.",

          "authors": "Luca Blumhardt; Justin Harris",
          "abstract": "Research over the last decade has shown that the value associated with a perceptually salient stimulus enhances its ability to attract attention towards itself. This phenomenon, called value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC), has relevance to a wide variety of psychological matters. Thus, an understanding of the conditioning processes that are responsible for VMAC can provide further insight into these matters. Almost all the literature argues that a Pavlovian conditioning process and not an information-seeking process is responsible for VMAC. However, there are grounds to question whether this is always the case. The current article reviewed the empirical research that has been conducted, or could potentially be used, to investigate the learning processes that are responsible for VMAC. It established that much research has been too limited to determine what processes are responsible for VMAC, but much research has not. Specifically, research that has found VMAC arising in its entirety before awareness of the stimulus-value association is acquired and taking place regardless of whether reward information is devalued later in training provides evidence of Pavlovian conditioning. However, research that has found VMAC arising when points feedback is withheld and individuals are informed of the stimulus-value association, and only taking place when reward information is not devalued when information devaluation is manipulated from the start of training, provides evidence of information-seeking. Thus, the findings of the research suggest that either process may give rise to VMAC and that it is the conditions under which VMAC is established that determines what process is responsible for it – Pavlovian conditioning will be responsible for VMAC when information-seeking is precluded, and information-seeking will be responsible for VMAC when Pavlovian conditioning is precluded.",

          "abstract": "Predictive processing (PP; also known as predictive coding) has emerged as one of the most influential theoretical frameworks in contemporary neuroscience, promising to unify perception, cognition, and action under a single computational principle. This article presents a comprehensive critique of PP theory, arguing that despite its superficial elegance and broad appeal, the framework suffers from fundamental conceptual flaws, empirical inadequacies, and methodological problems that render it unsuitable as a general theory of brain function. Through systematic analysis of its core assumptions, empirical support, and explanatory scope, we demonstrate that PP represents not a revolutionary advance in neuroscience, but rather a sophisticated example of theoretical overreach that has diverted attention from more productive research directions. We conclude that the neuroscientific community would benefit from abandoning this framework in favor of more empirically grounded and conceptually coherent approaches to understanding neural functioning.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) research has long debated whether its storage operates via discrete slots or distributed resources. However, emerging neuroscientific evidence suggests that neither account alone fully captures the complexity of WM function. Here, I propose a context-content hierarchical framework that unifies these views. A capacity-limited “context” system maintains discrete spatiotemporal pointers that individuate and prioritize items, while a precision-limited “content” system encodes detailed sensory information in modality-specific population codes whose fidelity varies with task demands. These systems interact through predictive top-down feedback and rhythmic coordination to support “holographic” reconstruction, in which a low-dimensional pointer selectively reinstates high-dimensional content on demand. This architecture explains how stable capacity limits can coexist with graded precision, activity-silent states, and rapid cue-driven reinstatement, and clarifies when contextual retrieval protects performance from interference. The framework yields clear experimental predictions and motivates computational models in which pointer indexing is coupled to sensory reconstruction. By integrating discrete control signals with continuous sensory representations, the context–content framework reconceptualizes WM as a dynamic, generative system that balances sparse indexing with on-demand reconstruction to guide adaptive behavior.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, contextual pointers, sensory recruitment, discrete slots, continuous resources",

          "abstract": "There is considerable debate over whether and how social media contributes to polarization. Research suggests that a small number of hyperpartisan “influencers,” or highly followed accounts, produce the vast majority of misinformation and toxic content. Yet, little is known about the long-term causal effects of exposure to these influencers. In a correlational study (n1 = 1,447) and two digital field experiments (n2 = 494, n3 = 1,133), we examined whether (un)following hyperpartisan social media influencers contributes to polarization and misinformation sharing. We found that incentivizing Twitter/X users to unfollow hyperpartisan social media influencers improved their recent feelings toward the out-party by 23.5% compared to the control group, with effects persisting for at least six months. Unfollowing also led participants to engage with more accurate news accounts, increased satisfaction with their Twitter/X feeds, and reduced the amount of political content they reported seeing a full year later—without reducing engagement. By contrast, incentivizing users to follow accounts that tweeted about science improved well-being. Additionally, we found that, after Elon’s Musk purchased Twitter/X and made several platform changes, participants used Twitter/X less frequently, viewed their feeds as less reliable, and posted lower quality news. Our results demonstrate the long-term, causal impact of repeated exposure to hyper-partisan influencers on attitudes and behavior. They also illustrate that the behavior and experience of Twitter/X users changed substantially after Elon Musk’s purchase of the platform, revealing the potential impact of social media design changes. Our work has implications for interventions that can be made by platforms or by individuals seeking to curate their social media experience. Unlike other social media reduction interventions, unfollowing is a targeted approach: like a scalpel, it surgically removes a few harmful parts of one’s feed, allowing the beneficial aspects to remain.",

          "authors": "Liudmyla Yuzva; Piotr Długosz",
          "abstract": "This article explores the migration and settlement decisions of Ukrainian refugees in Germany following the 2022 Russian invasion. Applying Everett Lee’s push–pull theory, it focuses on women with children—the largest displaced group—and investigates whether access to children’s education emerges not only as a domain of integration but as a significant pull factor within a broader constellation of drivers shaping settlement intentions. The analysis draws on original survey data collected in late 2024 (n = 1075), using an SMS-recruited online questionnaire administered across several host countries. Findings indicate that while war-related threats (e.g., bombardments, destruction of housing) were the primary push factors prompting departure from Ukraine, the decision to settle in Germany was strongly influenced by pull factors such as safety, social support, and access to schooling. Respondents in Germany were more likely to cite long-term motives—such as improved living standards and educational prospects—than those in neighboring countries. Education emerges not only as a sphere of integration but also as a migration driver. Dual-schooling models (local and Ukrainian), parental assessments of system quality, and children’s adaptation shaped settlement choices. These dynamics underscore the role of education in refugee agency and family strategy. The article argues that Ukrainian migration to Germany illustrates the interplay between structural pressures and personal decision-making. Push factors triggered large-scale displacement; pull factors and individual evaluations shaped longer-term trajectories. These findings contribute to migration theory by demonstrating the centrality of education in forced migration contexts and by highlighting the heterogeneity of refugee profiles within a single national cohort.",

Findings revealed that HSP, EoE, and LST significantly moderated responses to social cues related to safety. Individuals with higher HSP scores experienced more positive emotions in safe, orderly environments with positive social interactions. However, AES did not show significant moderation, though those with higher aesthetic sensitivity reported better emotional responses in urban parks.

This study developed a new measure to quantify how youth with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STBs) respond to their SI, and conducted an initial evaluation of the measure’s psychometric properties. \n\nMethods: Using inductive and deductive approaches, we developed a preliminary item set (n = 79) for the Response to Suicide Ideation Inventory (RSII). Thereafter, 491 participants (Mage = 22.0, SDage = 3.3, 18-29 years old), completed the RSII, as well as questionnaires assessing the RSII’s content validity, general coping, emotion dysregulation, history of STBs, reasons for living, and future expectations of engaging in STBs. \n\nResults: Results from an exploratory factor analysis indicated that a 43-item, seven-factor solution was an appropriate fit to the data. The RSII and its subscales showed acceptable reliability, as well as preliminary content validity. The RSII’s subscales also demonstrated medium-sized positive correlations with measures of general coping, and weak associations with emotion dysregulation, suicide resilience, and expectations of future STBs. \n\nConclusions: Our results point to some important directions for refining the RSII. Exploring the range and types of responses youth engage in to manage their SI may improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, fluctuations in SI severity.",

Appraisals of self and close real others were more favorable than appraisals of favorite fictional characters. Self-esteem was more strongly associated with self-appraisals than with appraisals of non-self targets. Differences between unlikable self and real other appraisals interacted with unlikable self and character appraisal differences in predicting self-esteem: Less unlikable appraisals of close real others compared to self-appraisals were predictive of lower self-esteem.

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

          "abstract": "Mindset (beliefs about the malleability of intelligence) has been studied in a variety of contexts for decades. Recent research highlights the importance of contextual factors in moderating mindset’s impact on student outcomes. The commonly-used original mindset measure is context-general. Recently, a mindset measure that is specific to science and math undergraduates was developed: the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities (ULTrA) Survey. I hypothesized that a context-specific measure of mindset would associate more strongly with undergraduates’ outcomes than a context-general measure. I surveyed 1,537 undergraduates with Dweck’s 3-item original mindset measure, ULTrA, and measures of outcomes (sense of belonging, goal orientation, self-handicapping, evaluative concern and intent to persist in science) and collected course grades. Structural equation modeling indicated that the fixed factor of the ULTrA exhibited stronger and more consistent relationships with outcomes than the 3-item original mindset measure and predicted unique variance in outcomes above and beyond what the original mindset measure accounted for. The academic outcomes (intent to persist and course grade) were significantly related to ULTrA, but not the original mindset measure. Our results provide evidence that the context-specific ULTrA survey can detect relationships with undergraduate outcomes that the context-general original mindset measure can fail to detect.",

This study investigates whether \ninterleaved training can also support continual learning in humans when consolidation through \nsleep is possible. Participants learned three tasks under either a blocked or interleaved regime \nacross two experiments: Experiment 1 used non-semantic contextual cues presented before the \nstimulus, and Experiment 2 used semantically meaningful contextual cues presented after the \nstimulus. Tests were conducted immediately and after 24 hours in an interleaved format. In \nExperiment 1, the blocked regime outperformed the interleaved group during learning, but this \nadvantage did not persist in testing. In Experiment 2, the blocked regime maintained higher \naccuracy across both learning and test phases. No sleep-related improvements in performance \nwere observed for the interleaved groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, recurrent neural \nnetworks trained on participant data did suggest an increase in task separation after sleep, but \nthis was not associated with improvements in task performance, nor was it specific to the \ninterleaved condition. Together, these findings suggest that blocked training or sleep alone do not \nensure superior continual learning, which is further determined by the timing and semantic nature \nof contextual cues.",

However, immediate pre-retrieval instructions are impractical in therapeutic settings. Thus, this study investigated the impact of CI before and/or after extinction training on extinction learning in 240 participants (120 patients with anxiety disorders (ADs), 120 healthy controls) using a three-day sequential conditioning paradigm. Electrical shocks and colored lamps served as UCS and conditioned stimuli (CS), with skin conductance responses (SCRs), CS valence, and UCS expectancy ratings as readout measures. CI before extinction training enhanced extinction learning for both patients with ADs and healthy controls across the physiological and subjective measures. Instructed healthy controls displayed even lower SCRs than instructed patients during early extinction. Furthermore, participants receiving post-extinction CI showed reduced CS differentiation in their SCRs during extinction retrieval. After a reinstatement, instruction timing differentially affected fear responses across contexts. Participants instructed before and after extinction, and uninstructed participants showed higher fear responses in the original conditioning context. Those instructed only before extinction exhibited increased fear responses in extinction and novel contexts, while participants instructed only after extinction showed heightened fear responses exclusively in the extinction context. The findings highlight how the timing of providing contingency information shapes fear learning and memory.",

This paper introduces AI-Mediated Cognitive Distortions (AI-MCDs) and Digital Echo Delusions (DEDs) as emergent phenomena at the intersection of human biases and generative AI. We propose the Resonant Amplification Framework (RAF) to explain how small cognitive tendencies can be amplified into entrenched distortions of belief through four recursive phases: Anthropomorphic Priming, Confirmation Alignment, Linguistic Reinforcement, and Perceptual Displacement. Unlike traditional echo chambers, AI systems not only reflect but co-produce content, generating iterative resonance that is more powerful and self-sustaining.\n\nWe distinguish DEDs from clinical delusions by emphasizing their phenomenological similarity but contextual reversibility—AI-induced distortions weaken when interaction ceases, unlike pathological delusions. The paper outlines empirical pathways for testing RAF (e.g., trust and vigilance measures, dialogue analysis, repetition effects, resistance to correction) and proposes practical safeguards in the form of “cognitive circuit breakers”—design principles aimed at disrupting harmful feedback loops.\n\nBy naming and conceptualizing these phenomena, the study establishes a foundation for cognitive science, AI ethics, and human–AI interaction research. It urges interdisciplinary collaboration to preserve users’ affective and epistemic sovereignty, ensuring that AI serves as a constructive amplifier of knowledge rather than a distorting echo of illusion.\n\nKeywords: AI-Mediated Cognitive Distortions (AI-MCDs), Digital Echo Delusions (DEDs), Resonant Amplification Framework (RAF), cognitive bias, confirmation bias, illusory truth effect, anthropomorphism, echo chambers, epistemic vigilance, human-AI interaction, AI ethics, cognitive sovereignty.",

Identity-based motivation theory makes three predictions that have not been directly tested: First, people make both inferences (ecological validity). Second, endorsement varies across people and situations (trait-state) and matters for self-perception and action (consequential). Third, unambiguous contexts (context) shift momentary endorsements. We address this gap using validated difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scales across five studies (N = 2,746), finding support for each prediction. Ecological validity: people recall making both inferences a few times a month (Study 1, N=986 undergraduates). Trait-state: difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scores differ between persons and fluctuate within-persons (Study 2, three time-points, N=733 middle schoolers and high schoolers; Study 4, N=260 undergraduates, n=2,789 two-week daily diaries). Consequential: trait difficulty-as-impossibility predicts later preference for easier tasks (Study 3, N=216 undergraduates); trait difficulty-as-importance predicts daily meaningful engagement with school (Study 4). Daily fluctuations in both are associated with daily self-esteem, self-compassion, and goal self-efficacy (Study 4).

Unlike fragmented studies focusing on isolated attacks, our systematic approach predicts novel threats, such as adversarial inputs redirecting execution paths, and guides proactive defense development. \nThis framework offers researchers and practitioners a pioneering tool to anticipate future vulnerabilities, enhance AI security, and develop automated vulnerability testing pipelines.",

          "abstract": "Second Brain Psychology (SBP) is a dynamic psychological model that integrates neuroscience, symbolism, biology, and clinical experience to understand and transform emotional and psychosomatic disorders. Centered on the recognition of the enteric nervous system as a \"second brain,\" SBP provides operational tools to decode bodily-lived polarities and convert them into available psychic energy. Through real clinical cases, the methodology demonstrates effectiveness in treating anxiety, panic, somatic symptoms, and developmental blocks, even within fragile and complex contexts. This article explores SBP's future potential as an innovative approach to promote mental health, resilience, and mind-body integration, addressing contemporary challenges on both European and global scales. SBP is adaptable to clinical and digital environments, proving effective in remote formats and lending itself to integration with emerging technologies such as AI for emotional block analysis and microbiota monitoring, highlighting its versatility and future-readiness.

          "authors": "Resti Tito Villarino; Maureen Lorence Villarino",
          "abstract": "Background: Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to community resilience across the ASEAN region, with the Philippines serving as a critical case for investigating links between environmental stressors and community mental health. This meta-analysis and systematic review examine how community-based mental health interventions strengthen climate resilience within disaster risk reduction and resilient infrastructure frameworks.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched eight databases for literature published between 2010 and 2025. Quantitative synthesis used Review Manager (v5.4) and R (v4.4.3); qualitative analysis used MAXQDA (2020). GRADE assessment evaluated the certainty of evidence across primary outcomes.\n\nResults: Thirty-two studies (N=45,247) revealed substantial climate-related mental health impacts: pooled PTSD prevalence 35.2% (95% CI 28.6-42.1), depression 18.4% (95% CI 14.7-22.8), and anxiety 31.8% (95% CI 25.3-39.1). Meta-regression revealed that disaster type explained 45% of the heterogeneity variance (p &lt; 0.01). Protective community factors significantly reduced the mental health burden, including social networks (OR=0.43, 95% CI 0.35-0.52), collective efficacy (OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.29-0.49), and cultural practices (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.75). Infrastructure-integrated psychosocial support centers demonstrated 60% greater effectiveness in intervention compared to standalone programs (p &lt; 0.001). Women, children, and indigenous communities experienced disproportionate impacts, requiring targeted interventions.\n\nConclusions: Climate-induced mental health impacts require coordinated regional responses within integrated disaster risk reduction frameworks. Aligning with the Sendai Framework priorities, the findings support community-centered, culturally adapted interventions that combine immediate psychosocial support with resilient infrastructure development. ASEAN collaborative strategies are essential for strengthening community mental health systems and advancing Sustainable Development Goals through multi-hazard approaches.",

          "abstract": "Purpose:  \nIntolerance of uncertainty (IU) is associated with poorer emotional wellbeing and worse \nprognosis of chronic physical health and pain conditions (CHPCs). Our current understanding of \nIU in CHPCs is siloed within the literatures on specific CHPCs. However, IU is consistently \nidentified as a risk factor for anxiety and depressive disorders. In this exploratory study, we used \na mixed methods design to better understand the role of IU and anxiety in people’s (n = 139) \nlived experiences of their CHPCs and how they respond to uncertainty across health and \neveryday contexts.  \n\nPrimary Results:  \nHigher acceptance of illness and perceived social support were related to lower IU and anxiety \namong people with CHPCs. Higher IU and anxiety were also related to lower scores on many \ndomains of quality of life. Our reflexive thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes: 1) \ndistressing ambiguous contexts are not limited to health scenarios and require management in \ndiverse ways; 2) interference of CHPCs affects multiple domains of life beyond physical health; \n3) navigating uncertainty for a chronic period changes coping abilities and identity development; \nand 4) responsivity to uncertainty is a multifaceted cognitive-behavioural and emotional\nphysiological response that hinders or promotes coping.  \n\nConclusions:  \nIU significantly impacts the lives of those with CHPCs and holds potential as a transdiagnostic \ntarget for early prevention and intervention. By tailoring therapeutic approaches to acknowledge \nthe importance of health-related cues while increasing tolerance of uncertainty, people with \nCHPCs will likely experience improved prognosis, wellbeing, and fulfillment.  \n\nKeywords: intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, chronic health, chronic pain, transdiagnostic, \ncontext, mixed-methods",

          "abstract": "Machiavellianism (Mach) is a personality trait characterized by cold rationality, cynicism, duplicity, and the strategic and egotistical pursuit of goals. Despite recent advances in the measurement of Mach, most Mach scales show limited content validity because they have not systematically integrated recurring Mach themes in the areas of affect (A), behavior (B), cognition (C), and desire (D). To overcome this and other issues, we developed a new Mach scale, the M4. We created the M4 by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select 16 items from a pool of 92 newly generated and expert-rated Mach items. In two studies with German-speaking participants (N1 = 765; N2 = 1,288), the M4 total score showed high reliability and high convergent validity with established Mach scales and M4 informant reports. Furthermore, the nomological network of the M4 aligned in several respects with the theoretical conceptualization of Mach. However, some unexpected associations suggested the need to refine the conceptualization of Mach regarding its relationship with certain forms of impulsivity and neuroticism. Commonality analyses further indicated that the M4 predicted incentivized cheating behavior better than five other recently developed Mach measures. Hence, the M4 holds promise for advancing the assessment of Mach.",

We assessed children’s visual vocabulary knowledge in a game where children heard a word (e.g., “swordfish”) and had to choose a matching picture. Distractors were chosen to vary in their linguistic similarity to each target word in a multimodal language model. We collected data from a large sample of children (N = 3575, 3–14 year olds) and adults (N = 211 adults) and found gradual changes over developmental age ranges in participants’ ability to identify the image that a word referred to. When children made errors, younger children were more likely to choose unrelated distractors than older children; error patterns were best explained by combining linguistic and visual similarity. These results highlight that children have partial knowledge about many visual concepts and document a transition from coarse to finer-grained representations.",

          "abstract": "Dogs have ascended to core family members in American households. Across three studies, we show that modern dogs now occupy roles historically reserved for close human relationships and often receive greater moral concern than people. Approximately three out of four dog owners view their dogs as primary sources of emotional support and companionship, and this “soulmate” bond is associated with a tendency to prefer and prioritize dogs over people. Childless dog owners are especially likely to view their dog as a soulmate, and national and county-level analyses further reveal that declining birth rates are strongly associated with increased pet-related spending. This suggests that dogs may fulfill caregiving roles once reserved for children and close kin. To assess the implications of this shift, we presented dog owners with moral dilemmas pitting the welfare of dogs against humans. Owners who viewed their dogs as soulmates were more likely to feed, fund, and save the life of a dog over a person. More than half of dog owners chose to save their dog over a human stranger, one in five chose to save an unfamiliar puppy over a person, and one in four chose to give money to a puppy in need over a child in need. The moral elevation of dogs may reflect—and potentially contribute to—declines in human social connection.",

          "abstract": "Attentional processes are crucial to ensure successful reading, and theories of dyslexia propose that dysfunctional attention networks may contribute to the observed reading deficits. The goals of this study were to localize a region of the frontal-eye-field (FEF) involved in both reading and attention and examine its connectivity with regions in the reading and attention networks, given the known role of the FEF in attentional processes and theorized role in reading. In Experiment 1, we revisited the results of our previous hybrid reading and attention study (Ekstrand, Neudorf, Kress, &amp; Borowsky., 2019). We observed a significant reading × attention interaction in BOLD intensity in the FEF, specifically the ventrolateral portion of Brodmann’s Area 6 (A6vl). In Experiment 2, we used Human Connectome Project diffusion tensor imaging data to examine the connectivity profile of the FEF-A6vl. We observed high communicability between the A6vl and basal ganglia (which plays a role in rhythm during syllabic processing). These connections support tract clusters which terminated in the cerebellar Crus I/II (which play roles in eye movements and semantics) and cerebral superior parietal lobule (which plays a role in attentional orienting and phonetic decoding). The results of this study elucidate the reading × attention interaction in the FEF-A6vl, and may have implications for developing treatments to improve reading in individuals with dyslexia.",

          "abstract": "Despite recent attempts to dismantle diversity initiatives in the US, many people and organizations continue to advocate for diversity. However, people vary widely in who they mean when they discuss diversity and their beliefs about why and how to promote diversity. These diversity components have only been examined in separate literatures, lacking full integration. Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

          "abstract": "Elected officials are increasingly extreme. Research trying to understand this trend has tended to focus on structural factors, such as primary elections and changes in the supply of candidates. Less emphasis has been placed on psychological perspectives. The current research advances such a perspective. Leveraging research on attitudes, we investigate when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their own party. We posit that the identity relevance of people’s attitudes plays a key role. Specifically, we propose that identity relevance fosters attitude extremity, which in turn promotes a preference for extreme over moderate candidates. Across six main studies (N = 3,136) using a variety of political issues, operationalizations of identity relevance, instantiations of candidate extremity, and experimental paradigms (including two studies with human-LLM interactions), we find support for this hypothesis. Our findings suggest that as attitudes become more identity relevant, they become more extreme, leading individuals to prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their party. These results shed light on when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates, contribute to a nascent literature on the identity relevance of people’s attitudes, and advance our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of attitude extremity.",

The acoustic properties of vowels stem from a combination of multiple factors including the intended vowel quality, vocal tract length, coarticulation, and speech rate. However, most current vowel normalization approaches do not distinguish among the different determinants. Scale2fit uses mixed effects models to jointly evaluate multiple factors, avoiding their conflation in vowel normalization. Study 1 shows that the new method excels in a series of comparisons with other normalization methods. Study 2 shows that the proposed framework excels at preserving vowel space reduction that follows from short duration, and is therefore more appropriate for studying vowel space reduction. Finally, Study 3 shows that it is possible to establish variety norms and add speakers incrementally",

However, CLD construction is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and cognitively demanding. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their advanced text processing capabilities and extensive knowledge base, offer the potential to support theory construction and reduce workload. This paper presents theoraizer, an R package and Shiny app that enhances CLD construction by integrating LLMs as a digital extension of the expert group. Researchers can use theoraizer to define a list of putative variables, then query an LLM to evaluate candidate causal links between these variables and provide supporting literature. Rather than replacing expert judgment, theoraizer functions as a thinking partner, helping researchers assess causal relationships and construct proto-theories. We describe how LLMs can be used to automate key steps in CLD construction and demonstrate empirically that agreement between theoraizer and human experts is comparable to the agreement observed between experts themselves. This suggests that LLMs can reliably assist in identifying putative causal structures, making the theory-building process more efficient. In addition to improving efficiency by quickly generating an initial candidate CLD, theoraizer supports creativity in the modeling process by suggesting alternative perspectives and highlighting variables or relationships that may have been overlooked. By combining the CLD method with the generative capabilities of LLMs, theoraizer drastically reduces the work required to arrive at a candidate CLD and provides users with a standardized, multi-stage framework for constructing CLDs that support early-stage theory development.",

Models performed worse for non-advantaged groups (non-White and/or Hispanic, below poverty, female). Past alcohol use, abstinence self-efficacy, and craving were the most important features, with the magnitude of importance varying meaningfully by lag.

Using Bayesian statistics, we found cumulative evidence that when support givers used higher pitch in delivering these reappraisals, targets of support experienced less negative affect. Targets of support also reported greater relationship satisfaction with support givers who used higher pitch during reappraisal.

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) has emerged as a promising intervention for conditions such as depression, PTSD, and substance use disorders by enhancing the therapeutic potential of psychedelics with structured psychological support during preparation, dosing, and integration phases. Despite encouraging trial results, evidence for therapeutic mechanisms and optimal frameworks for PAP remain in nascent stages. We explore candidate therapies and frameworks for PAP. Concurrently, clinical science is shifting toward process-based therapy (PBT; Hofmann &amp; Hayes, 2019), which targets core transdiagnostic processes rather than disorder-specific protocols. While previous reviews of multiple mechanisms (e.g., Yaden et al., 2022) and disorder-specific papers (e.g., Sloshower et al., 2020) have identified key processes to target in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, this review introduces PBT and situates candidate mechanisms—such as psychological flexibility, emotion regulation, and decentering—within its framework. We explore how PBT principles can inform each phase of PAP, providing an idiographic, process-driven approach. Treatment strategies are selected based on functional analyses, case conceptualization, patient preferences, and qualitative and quantitative data collected throughout the treatment process. By moving away from specific brands of treatment, and instead integrating a PBT approach within PAP, we propose a novel, empirically grounded paradigm for optimizing therapeutic outcomes in this emergent field.",

          "abstract": "Environmental factors can have profound influences on biological systems, particularly through their effects on epigenetic processes. Epigenetics provides a powerful framework for understanding the regulation of gene expression through the interplay between genetic predispositions, inherited epigenetic marks, and lifelong environmental influences. Drawing on the “butterfly effect” metaphor from chaos theory, this review proposes that even subtle epigenetic changes may initiate cascading effects on gene regulation and biological systems, ultimately contributing to significant phenotypic outcomes, including the modification of developmental trajectories, disease susceptibility, and adaptive responses. The reversible and adaptable nature of epigenetic modifications enables organisms to respond dynamically to a wide range of stimuli throughout their lifespan. Conversely, maladaptive epigenetic regulation can be associated with pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and adverse mental health outcomes. Thus, epigenetic markers represent a promising target for risk prediction, prevention and therapeutic intervention. In this review, we discuss the wide-ranging implications of epigenetic theories underlying gene-environment interactions. Furthermore, we examine the evolving expectations of the scientific community and the public regarding epigenetic theories, which may shape future research directions and drive therapeutic innovation in health and disease. Epigenetic concepts are poised to bridge the gap between genetic predispositions and environmental influences, offering novel insights into complex biological processes and their outcomes.",

          "abstract": "When an action does not yield the sensory action effect associated with it, prediction error (PE) signals are generated. The present study investigates auditory event-related potential (ERP) markers of PE for violations of strong action-effect couplings as a function of whether the participants’ intention focuses on a particular action or a particular action effect. Participants produced high- and low-pitched tones by left and right button presses according to a pattern of visual stimuli. While the instruction as well as the action and tone sequences produced by the participants were identical, the type of intention induced by the visual symbols differed (in a between-subject design): In the action-effect intention group, the pattern consisted of “notes” (for high/low pitch), in the action intention group it consisted of “letters” (for left/right button-press). Occasionally, a button-press did not produce the associated sensory action effect. These incongruent sounds elicited an enhanced auditory N1 compared to congruent sounds in the “notes” but not the “letters” group which we interpret as PE signal. Actions selected by the intended action effect in the “notes” group presumably induced a predictive sensory representation of the action outcome, its violation resulting in an early PE at the level of the auditory N1. N2b and P3 were elicited in both groups. This suggests that the respective action-effect couplings were represented, and their violation processed at a conceptual level also in the “letters” group.

          "authors": "Nathan Francis Gillespie; Gregory Edward Cox",
          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models are powerful tools that explain how representations in\nperception and memory are transformed into observed behavior—such as choice and response\ntime—at the level of individual participants and individual trials. Such models have been used\nacross domains in cognitive science to build integrative theories of phenomena like\ncategorization, recognition, and attentional learning. Many of these models, however, were\ndeveloped to account for data from visual tasks, so it remains unclear whether the same\nmechanisms apply in the auditory domain. Thus, theories of, for example, auditory memory have\nnot benefited from modeling techniques to the same extent as have theories of visual memory. To\naddress this gap, we illustrate how a cognitive model that was originally developed in the visual\ndomain, the Exemplar-Based Random Walk model (EBRW; Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997), can\nnonetheless account for choice and response time in recognition of novel auditory timbres. We\ndo so by using the EBRW to couple stimulus representations derived from multidimensional\nscaling to a process by which recognition decisions are made by accumulating evidence that\ndepends on similarity. This paper therefore offers a practical tutorial on addressing the unique\nchallenges of adapting computational cognitive models to psychoacoustic data, highlighting the\nutility of applying such models in revealing connections between seemingly disparate aspects of\nauditory cognition.",

          "authors": "Nathan Francis Gillespie; Gregory Edward Cox",
          "abstract": "We present four experiments that examine perception and memory for a novel set of\nauditory stimuli, using multidimensional scaling and cognitive modeling to clarify how people\nperceive and recognize these items. The stimuli are auditory “textures” constructed by adjusting\nthe distribution of power across upper frequency bands. In Experiment 1, people rated similarity\nbetween pairs of stimuli; in Experiments 2 and 3, they also engaged in a recognition memory\ntask using the same stimuli. In Experiment 4, they did all the same tasks from the first three\nexperiments, and rated stimuli for distinctiveness. Multidimensional scaling suggested the\nstimuli were perceived along three dimensions, a result which replicated across all four\nexperiments. While recognition performance was affected by similarity, serial position, and list\nhomogeneity, it was not related to distinctiveness ratings. These effects were accommodated by\nthe Exemplar-Based Random Walk model (Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997), extending prior work\n(Visscher et al., 2007) to show that recognition memory and similarity perception for static\nstimuli in the auditory domain are fundamentally like those for static stimuli in the visual\ndomain—though particularly strong recency effects in the auditory domain suggest the influence\nof an additional sensory representation like echoic memory. We conclude by discussing how the\nstimuli introduced in this article can be used as “building blocks” to test hypotheses about\nperception and memory for complex, naturalistic sounds such as speech or music while retaining\ntight experimental control.",

To succeed in this pursuit, people must make inferences about the structure of their social networks, monitor group norms, and adjust their behavior strategically. This study employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods in a sample of 92 college students belonging to 9 social groups to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these processes and their relationship to conformity in the context of alcohol use. When young adults passively looked at faces of their real-life social network peers, brain systems implicated in valuation and social cognition spontaneously represented information about the popularity and leadership status of the social target. Individual differences in these neural valuations were systematically associated with varying levels of conformity to group drinking norms in everyday life. Students who had stronger responses to faces of peers with relatively higher popularity and leadership status than themselves in one key valuation brain region, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), were more likely to align their behavior with their groups’ drinking norms in daily life. These results provide novel evidence for how brain systems involved in valuation and social cognition track multidimensional (popularity and leadership) information about real-life social networks and contribute to a growing literature on the neural mechanisms through which social comparison processes shape conformity (2). Our study highlights the vmPFC as a central hub that spontaneously tracks differences between the self and peers and uses this information to guide behavior to match group norms.",

          "abstract": "Social robots are increasingly integrated into everyday environments, yet effective human-robot interaction remains challenging as robots often fail to engage social cognition the same way human partners do. Here, we examined the degree to which physical features impact the degree to which robots are being perceived as agents ‘with a mind’. For that purpose, we took all robot stimuli currently contained in the Anthropomorphic Robot Database (ABOT; n = 251) and examined the degree to which they trigger mind perception (N = 300). Consistent with prior findings, robots were generally attributed more agency (capacity to act and plan) than experience (capacity to sense and feel). Body components significantly explained variance in the perception of agency, especially in interaction with facial features; for experience, on the other hand, variance was significantly explained by body components, face and surface details. Increasing human-likeness boosted perceptions of both dimensions, but the trajectories differed: experience followed a cubic function, plateauing at medium levels of human-likeness, while agency followed a quartic function with a dip around 75% human-likeness—a pattern resembling the un-canny valley. Our results indicate that in order to create specific levels of agency (e.g., for surgery robots) and experience (e.g., for companion robots), a general increase of human-likeness might not suffice; instead, targeted design of individual physical features is crucial for convey-ing specific mental capacities. Our ratings linking physical robot features to dimensions of mind perception are made available, offering a comprehensive and accessible resource for researchers to experimentally manipulate perceptions of agency and experience.",

          "abstract": "More than half of the children and adolescents worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity (e.g., abuse, neglect or bullying) whilst growing up. Childhood adversity is among the strongest predictors of mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood. Yet, some individuals show resilient functioning, meaning they have good mental health and well-being despite their exposure to childhood adversity. Childhood adversity is thought to affect mental health through its impact on neurocognitive functioning, for example through blunted social feedback learning and biased emotion and threat processing. The neurocognitive social transactional model suggests that such childhood adversity related neurocognitive functioning may ultimately lead to reductions in the quality and quantity of social relations and increases in stressful experiences with peers over time, increasing the risk for mental health problems. However, empirical evidence to support this theoretical framework is scarce. Therefore, the longitudinal Towards Health and Resilience in Volatile Environments (THRIVE) study is set out to investigate the dynamics of psychological, social, and neurobiological mechanisms underlying mental health functioning in adolescents aged 18-24 years with a history of childhood adversity.\n\nThe ongoing THRIVE study aims to recruit 288 participants aged 18-24 years who retrospectively self-report childhood adversity (current N=220). This longitudinal neuroimaging study consists of 6 sessions including an in-unit session, during which participants undergo extensive testing including salivary cortisol measures, emotion labelling measures, as well as functional neuroimaging (whilst completing the Montreal Imaging Stress Task and the Social Feedback Learning Task). In the longitudinal part of the study, participants fill out online questionnaires at 5 time points (i.e. every three months) to map the dynamics and associations of social support, mental health, and stressful events, over time. Using the data collected at the in-unit session, we aim to test whether childhood adversity is associated with biased emotion processing, blunted feedback learning and enhanced stress responses, while social support may moderate these effects (i.e. ‘social stress buffering’). The longitudinal component of the THRIVE study allows us to test our hypothesis that mental health problems arise because childhood adversity shapes neurocognitive functioning in a way that, over time, reduces social support and increases social stress. By unravelling how social functioning contributes to resilient functioning after childhood adversity, the THRIVE study will aid crucial knowledge and ultimately help intervention and prevention efforts.\n\nThe THRIVE study has been approved by The Medical Ethics Committee Leiden - The Hague - Delft (NL80017.058.21) on July 5th, 2022  and has been co-created with the Augeo Youth Task Force (a panel of young adults with childhood adversity, https://www.augeo.nl/jongerentaskforce). The Augeo Youth Task Force is involved in every step of the empirical cycle to make sure the perspective and knowledge of young people with childhood adversity are incorporated. The results of the THRIVE study will be disseminated through preprints, peer-reviewed scientific publications, scientific presentations, media and public outreach.",

          "abstract": "People differ in their susceptibility to both negative and positive environmental influences. Environmental Sensitivity is a framework that explains such individual differences, and its phenotypic trait can be measured using the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) scale. From the cultural/ethnic differences perspective, this study investigates the measurement invariance of the HSP scale and its associations with the Big Five personality traits and Negative/Positive Affect using samples from Japan and the United States. Participants from Japan (n = 531, Mage = 20.6 ± 1.5 years) and the United States (n = 487, Mage = 20.8 ± 2.2 years) completed an online questionnaire survey. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis supported the partial metric and full scalar invariance of the HSP scale across the samples, suggesting that the measurement of sensitivity is largely consistent across countries. Sensitivity was negatively correlated with Conscientiousness only in the Japanese sample, while higher sensitivity was associated with lower Extraversion and higher Neuroticism in both samples. Similar trends were observed in both samples for the correlations between sensitivity and Negative/Positive Affect. These findings illuminate both cultural and ethnic differences, as well as similarities, in sensitivity. Such differences were discussed in light of the individualism–collectivism framework.",

However, insight into how to adequately measure engagement in these activities is a necessary precursor. \nA rapid scoping review was performed to search relevant articles on PubMed. The aim was to obtain an initial understanding of (a) how cognitive and social activities are measured in research that investigates protective activities against dementia and (b) to explore to what extent this aligns with the operationalization in preventive interventions. \nThe findings show that across 58 studies, questionnaires were mostly used to measure engagement in cognitive and social activities. A wide variety of items and themes was observed across studies, including: arts and crafts; clubs, groups, and communities; exercising; games and puzzles; going out; household tasks; learning and education; making music; multimedia usage; reading; socializing; work/volunteering; writing. There were considerable variations in the number and content of items, ulitized response scales, recall periods, and methods to compose scores. Additionally, preventive interventions stongly focused on psychoeducation and (computerized) cognitive training, which limitedly reflect the activities operationalized in questionnaires.\nMany researchers investigate the protective effects of cognitive or social activities against dementia but measure and promote these concepts completely differently. This results in fragmented insights into what activities are protective. Clarifying precisely what these concepts entail, and which aspects are relevant to measure would support the development of measurement instructions as well as interventions to promote relevant activities.\n\nKeywords: Dementia, Cognition, Social Participation, Cognitive Activities, Social Activities",

It consists of almost four hours of eye-movements. Ten participants fixated different targets designed to induce saccades, fixations, and smooth pursuits. Ground truth was established by designing stimuli that prevent fixations and smooth pursuits to co-occur, and separating them from saccades by their velocity. Here we make available both the raw data and offer a convenient way for preprocessing and assigning ground truth labels in the form of a companion package in Python.

          "abstract": "Offloading tasks to artificial agents, such as ChatGPT, has become commonplace, yet little research examined offloading of attentionally demanding tasks. Prior work investigating how humans offload attentional demands to algorithms and humans found that people prefer an equal split of attentional demands when interacting with other humans but not when interacting with algorithms. The question arises how offloading decisions are made when interacting with embodied AI in form of a social robot with human-like characteristics: Would they treat it in the same way as a human or like an algorithm? To investigate this question, participants performed an attentionally demanding task (i.e., the multiple object tracking task, MOT), which they could (partially or fully) offload to the social robot MAKI, whose task accuracy was either known (Experiment 1) or unknown (Experiment 2) to the participants. In both experiments, participants offloaded a significant number of the tracking load to the robot, which improved the participants’ own tracking accuracy; knowing the robot’s task accuracy, on the other hand, did not impact offloading behavior or performance gains. Interestingly, participants did not split attentional demands equally with the robot –like they do with human interaction partners– aligning with results from previous studies when humans offloaded attentional demands to algorithms. Questionnaire data indicates that this might be due participants perceiving the robot as rather machine-like. In conclusion, our results indicate that when it comes to cognitive offloading behavior, a social robot is treated similarly to an algorithm rather than a human interaction partner.",

          "abstract": "India faces a profound mental health crisis, marked by the largest population in the world, a high prevalence of disorders and a severe shortage of qualified professionals. Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP’s B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI’s introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Since learning to read involves associating letter shapes with how they sound, it is widely believed that children become familiar with letter shapes when they start learning their sounds or start writing them down. However, since printed letters are often available in the environment, it is possible that children are already familiar with letter shapes. Here, we provide evidence for this intriguing possibility. We tested 300 children at the beginning of formal reading instruction of the Indian language Kannada. Each child performed four tasks: (1) a letter familiarity task in which they saw upright and inverted versions of each letter, and had to identify the more familiar orientation; (2) a letter recognition task where they had to name letters shown sequentially; (3) a visual search task where they had to find an oddball letter among identical other letters, with letters either all upright or inverted; and (4) a rapid automatized naming task where they had to name digits. Our main finding is that, despite showing wide variation in letter naming, children were highly familiar with letter orientation. This effect was present even on letters that children did not recognize at all. This familiarity with letter orientation also gave them a letter processing advantage: children searched faster when letters were upright than when they were inverted. Our findings reveal a far deeper knowledge of print among early readers than previously observed, and provide empirical support for early exposure to print as a strategy to jump-start reading acquisition.",

Some countries enforce\nschool phone bans, while others (e.g., England), have guidance promoting “phone-free\nenvironments” but no legal mandate. There is limited evidence on the benefits of such policies,\nincluding whether they promote safeguarding.\n\nMethods. We used Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to investigate the relationship\nbetween smartphone policies and digital safeguarding incidents in 114 schools in England\n(&gt;90,000 pupils). We examined the prevalence and content of phone policies during the\n2023/24 academic year and digital incident reporting.\n\nResults. Only 53% (60/114) of schools had a phone policy. Policy content varied significantly,\nwith inconsistent use of “ban” terminology. Digital safeguarding incidents made up only 4.9%\n(4183/85,540) of all incidents but varied substantially (&gt;10% in 36/114 schools; &gt;25% in 9),\nsuggesting inconsistent reporting. Schools with policies, regardless of restrictiveness, reported\nmore digital incidents. Schools with restrictive policies were more likely to refer incidents and\nreported more school-based incidents, although most still occurred outside school.\n\nConclusions. Safeguarding incidents involving smartphones or social media are occurring in\nschools throughout England. Schools with phone policies were more likely to report digital\nsafeguarding incidents, suggesting an association between policy presence and reporting. Vast\nvariation in policy content and inconsistent “ban” rhetoric undermine the potential for effective\nsafeguarding.

Children with DA develop age-appropriate semantic knowledge, language, and general cognitive abilities, yet profound impairments in episodic memory, spatial navigation, and recall emerge in development. These deficits have significant consequences for education, frequently leading to academic underachievement despite strong intellectual potential. In this paper, we outline the distinctive challenges DA presents in education and highlight three effective strategies: spaced learning, repeated testing in multiple-choice formats, and errorless learning, which draw on preserved recognition memory. We also discuss approaches that have not proved effective, including fast-mapping, chunking, and memory training. We conclude by reflecting on how findings from neuropsychology can shape inclusive and effective educational practices, both for children with DA and for those with memory difficulties more generally.",

Participants (n = 185) were teachers from Finnish comprehensive schools (Grades 1–9). They answered three questionnaires: the Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practice scale, the Attitudes towards Inclusion scale, and the School Climate for Inclusive Music Education scale. Using linear regression analysis, we found that the more positive the feelings towards inclusive music classes were, the stronger the teacher's self-efficacy was in inclusive instructions, collaboration, and managing behaviour. Moreover, the more substantial the experienced support from the school community was, the stronger the teachers’ self-efficacy was in collaboration. However, beliefs on inclusive education and perceived support from school management did not show significant effects on teacher self-efficacy in inclusive music education. These findings highlight the importance of music teachers gaining positive experience in inclusive education. This implies the crucial need for sufficient training for inclusive settings and ensuring that the environment and starting points are adequate for teaching and learning music in the classroom.

          "abstract": "Episodic autobiographical memory retrieval (EAM) is characterized by the vivid sense of re-experiencing past events. While doing so, different viewpoints over the scene can be taken, often referred to as the field or observer perspectives. However, the precision with which individuals can accurately reconstruct their original viewpoint over an event, within the field perspective, has not yet been characterized. Here we developed a task and continuous implicit measure to quantify this ability (viewpoint retrieval accuracy, VRA) and study its association with explicit measures of re-experienced vividness. Twenty-five participants experienced lifelike events in mixed reality, with five controlled observer–object angles at encoding. After a 24 h delay, they retrieved each event, rated re-experiencing vividness, and indicated their original viewpoint (VRA). Mean VRA decreased with increasing encoding eccentricity (observer–object angles) and was consistently biased toward more central viewpoints. Moreover, VRA significantly explained re-experiencing vividness, with higher re-experiencing ratings being associated with smaller errors. These findings establish VRA as an implicit and continuous proxy for re-experiencing vividness, and a new tool for investigating the spatial and bodily foundations of EAM retrieval.",

          "abstract": "Individuals reliably differ in how they look at complex visual scenes, with the most prominent variation in their propensity to fixate faces and text. In 60 adults, we tested the hypothesis that these differences in gaze are tuned to representational properties of the individual visual system. Eye-tracking captured each observer’s characteristic gaze tendencies during naturalistic scene viewing, and functional magnetic resonance imaging recorded category-selective responses to faces, words, and other stimuli when participants were instructed to fixate centrally. We find that the propensity to fixate faces or text goes along with enhanced distinctiveness of corresponding categorical representations in the ventral stream, which in turn predicts performance on reading and face recognition tasks. Thus, active vision appears tuned to the precision of category-selective encoding in the individual brain.",

          "abstract": "“Urami” is the negative emotional state that one experiences when treated unfairly by others. While similar to anger, it differs in various ways, such as in its long-term persistence. Empirical studies on urami have suggested that it comprises factors such as feelings of injustice, unforgiveness, and helplessness. However, the generalizability of its factor structure is questionable because most previous studies were based on small sample sizes. In this study, free descriptive responses regarding urami and anger provided by 489 participants (aged 19–72 years) were quantified and analyzed using structural topic modeling, a type of natural language processing algorithm. The results revealed the topics that compose the conceptual structure and the situations in which urami occurs, as well as the relationships between some grouped situations and individual traits, such as narcissism. Furthermore, comparing the conceptual structure and situational occurrences of urami and anger based on quantitative criteria revealed unique elements of urami, such as persistence and feelings of victimization. These elements are particularly likely to occur when one is victimized by a close other.",

          "authors": "Piper Louise Rennerfeldt; Roberto A. Abreu-Mendoza; Miriam Rosenberg-Lee",
          "abstract": "When learning about decimals, whole number knowledge can be a detriment, leading children to incorrectly report, for example, that 0.26 is larger than 0.8. Two potential sources of whole number interference could lead to such errors. Digit length interference arises from the whole number rule that more digits = larger number, while whole referent magnitude interference arises from ignoring the decimal point and comparing the whole referents (26 &gt; 8). The independent effects of each interference type have been measured in adults, but we still do not know how these effects play out in early decimal learning. Further, inhibitory control has been linked to overcoming whole number interference, but it is unclear which specific type of interference is inhibited. Here, we used carefully designed decimal stimuli to examine these two interference effects in middle school students who are more susceptible to whole number interference than adults. Students in 2 U.S. school districts (grades 6-8, n = 178) completed computerized decimal comparison and inhibitory control tasks. We implemented cluster analysis to account for heterogeneous strategy use. The two most prominent groups, Whole Number Biased and High Performing, differed in their extent of digit length interference, but were equally susceptible to whole referent magnitude interference. Crucially, inhibitory control only related to overcoming digit length interference, not whole referent magnitude interference, in both groups. Taken together, whole referent magnitudes are a pervasive source of interference in decimal comparison, independent of overall task performance or individual differences in inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "Heightened air pollution exposure is associated with an increased risk for developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, yet it is unclear how pollution impacts the aging brain more broadly. Pollution studies in rodents have shown that higher air pollution exposure is associated with impulsive behavior and preference for immediate reward in delay discounting tasks. We examined this relationship in middle aged and older humans, by analyzing associations between residential pollution exposure and time-based reward preferences. One hundred-and-three (103) adults aged 40-80 completed a delay discounting task. We estimated long-term residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a prominent air pollutant, using participant address information and satellite pollution data. We found that higher residential PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with a higher preference for more immediate rewards, even after controlling for demographic factors including income and education. A preference for immediate rewards has been independently associated with higher risk of addictive behaviors, including substance abuse and gambling disorders, indicating that PM2.5 exposure may increase the emergence of these conditions. We discuss these results in detail along with potential underlying biological mechanisms, implications on human behavior, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "For many types of behaviors, whether a specific instance of that behavior is blame- or praiseworthy depends on how much of the behavior is done or how people go about doing it. For instance, for a behavior such as “replying to an email in x days”, whether a specific reply is perceived as blameworthy or praiseworthy will depend on how many days elapsed before the reply. Such behaviors lie on a continuum in which part of the continuum is praiseworthy (replying quickly) and another part of the continuum is blameworthy (replying late). In the current manuscript, we investigate how judgments of blame and praise on such behaviors relate to people’s perceptions of the statistical norms surrounding that behavior (i.e., how quickly people usually reply). We find that people do not base judgments of blame and praise on a comparison to the statistically average quantity. Instead, judgments of blame and praise are related to whether the behavior is perceived as frequent or infrequent. Notably, frequency showed an asymmetric relationship with moral judgments: higher frequency was strongly associated with reduced blame, but showed a much weaker association with reduced praise.",

          "abstract": "One justification for preregistering research hypotheses, methods, and analyses is that it improves the transparent evaluation of the severity of hypothesis tests. In this article, I consider two cases in which preregistration does not improve this evaluation. First, I argue that, although preregistration may facilitate the transparent evaluation of severity in Mayo’s error statistical philosophy of science, it does not facilitate this evaluation in Popper’s theory-centric approach. To illustrate, I show that associated concerns about Type I error rate inflation are only relevant in the error statistical approach and not in a theory-centric approach. Second, I argue that a test procedure that is preregistered but that also allows deviations in its implementation (i.e., “a plan, not a prison”) does not provide a more transparent evaluation of Mayoian severity than a non-preregistered procedure. In particular, I argue that sample-based validity-enhancing deviations cause an unknown inflation of the test procedure’s Type I error rate and, consequently, an unknown reduction in its capability to license inferences severely. I conclude that preregistration does not improve the transparent evaluation of severity (a) in Popper’s philosophy of science or (b) in Mayo’s approach when deviations are allowed.",

          "abstract": "Altered reward processing is proposed to be central to the pathology of anorexia nervosa (AN). This study aimed to investigate how aspects of reward dysfunction relate to suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STBs) in AN. We compared responses on self-report measures of general (i.e., anticipatory, consummatory, and social reward) and disorder-specific (i.e., self-starvation reward) reward between individuals with AN with (AN + STBs; n = 28) or without (AN; n = 31) lifetime active STBs and healthy controls (HC; n = 32). Further, we examined whether interactions between general and disorder-specific reward dysfunction were associated with lifetime active STBs in AN. Compared to AN and HC groups, the AN + STBs group reported significantly lower anticipatory and social reward; both AN + STBs and AN groups reported higher self-starvation reward than HCs. When accounting for the effects of depression, group differences became non-significant for general rewards but remained significant for disorder-specific reward processing. The interaction between anticipatory and self-starvation reward was significantly associated with STB risk beyond the effects of depression: AN participants reporting high self-starvation reward were at elevated STB risk regardless of anticipatory reward levels, whereas those with low self-starvation reward showed increased STBs only when anticipatory reward was also low. Our results suggest that the combination of general and disorder-specific reward processes may shape distinct suicidality risk profiles in AN.",

          "abstract": "A central question in cognitive psychology concerns how humans selectively attend to\ntask-relevant information whilst ignoring task-irrelevant information. This question is\nfrequently studied using conflict tasks, such as the Simon, Eriksen flanker, and Stroop\ntasks, that require responses to relevant stimulus features while ignoring irrelevant, and\npotentially conflicting, features. While all conflict tasks produce better performance on\ntrials where task-relevant features and irrelevant features match—a phenomenon known as\nthe congruency effect—they differ markedly in their RT distributions. The Diffusion Model\nfor Conflict tasks (DMC) was introduced as a model to formally account for all\ndistributional patterns in conflict tasks. It integrates dual-route theories of cognitive\ncontrol into the framework of sequential sampling models by positing two superimposed,\nindependent evidence accumulation processes: a linear one for controlled processing of the\ntask-relevant information, and a pulse-like one for automatic processing of the\ntask-irrelevant information, where activation first increases until a maximum and then\ndecreases again. This review summarizes DMC’s architecture, its core parameters, and its\nability to account for various distributional patterns. We review and discuss applications of\nDMC across several psychological domains, and technical considerations such as parameter\nestimation and recovery. Limitations of the model are critically assessed, and fields of open\nresearch are outlined. Overall, DMC offers a general account of conflict processing. While\na powerful tool for quantifying the dynamics of selective attention and cognitive control,\nthere is still a limited standardization in its application and more research is needed to\nextend DMC to other classes of conflict tasks.",

By situating the Ulfhéðnar within contemporary clinical contexts related to masculine trauma, rage, and identity, this work extends Jungian theory and archetypal psychology to address unresolved aspects of male integration. The analysis highlights how the rupture of ego boundaries permits the return and processing of repressed instinctual energies, offering a symbolic framework for therapeutic approaches.

We asked whether functionally related object pairs benefit VWM and whether people’s judgments of relatedness predict participants’ performance on memory tasks. We curated a stimulus set of 160 line drawings arranged into 80 related and 80 unrelated pairs. Participants viewed four pairs of objects and then identified the new object in a probe display. Results showed a robust accuracy advantage for related over unrelated pair displays, with strong split-half reliability. This finding was replicated in a version where the probe display used pairs rather than single objects. To validate our relatedness manipulation, we collected Likert ratings of both semantic relatedness and action compatibility. The two rating methods showed a strong correlation with each other, as well as with the relatedness benefit observed in the memory experiments, providing further support for our manipulation. However, within the related and unrelated sets considered separately, subjective reports of relatedness did not predict variability in memory performance, and this replicated with a follow-up ratings task. Cross-condition correlations in the memory task indicated stable differences for individual objects regardless of relatedness. Together, the results show that functional pairing reliably boosts VWM - consistent with chunking - yet fine-grained variability in memorability is driven by object- and pair-level properties not captured by perceived relatedness.",

This project examined physician studies specifically, not healthcare professionals in general, including primary practice settings and specialties as factors that affect burnout levels. After data preprocessing, visualizations were made based on correlations between burnout levels and factors such as time spent on various tasks and years of experience. After accuracy-guided hyperparameter tuning on various models, a Random Forest Classifier model was used and evaluated with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The model performed best in predicting moderate burnout (with 62% accuracy for that class), but tended to misclassify low and high burnout levels as moderate.

We compared the effect sizes between ordinary regression models with within-sibling pair, and within-twin pair fixed-effect regression models. Results showed a weak association between physical activity and depressive symptoms in unpaired models (~SMD= -.07), which remained  similar in within-sibling pair models (SMD=-.05), and in within-twin pair models (SMD= -.08). These results were robust with use of physical activity measured as minutes per week and with different intensities of physical activity. There was no evidence for reverse causality.

          "abstract": "Simulation accounts posit that speech is covertly imitated to support perception in a top-down manner. Behaviourally, covert imitation can be measured through the stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) task. In a speech SRC task, participants produce a target speech syllable whilst perceiving a speech distractor that either matches the target (compatible condition) or does not (incompatible condition). The degree to which the distractor is covertly imitated is captured by the automatic imitation effect, computed as the difference in response times (RTs) between compatible and incompatible trials. Simulation accounts disagree on whether covert imitation is enhanced when speech perception is more challenging or instead when the speech is familiar. To dissociate between these two accounts, we conducted two experiments, one behavioural and one using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), in which participants completed SRC tasks with native and non-native contrasts. In Experiment 1, participants performed an SRC task with two native and two non-native contrasts, received perception training with the non-native contrasts, and performed the SRC task again. Results showed that non-native distractors were linked to higher automatic imitation than the native distractors before and after the training, but that the automatic imitation effect for the non-native distractors decreased more after training. Experiment 2 demonstrated that speech primary motor cortex showed higher excitability during passive perception of non-native compared to native contrasts but showed no correlation with automatic imitation. Our results highlight that speech motor cortex acts as an adaptive reflexive gain control mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are poised to become a ubiquitous feature of our lives, mediating communication, decision-making and information curation across nearly every domain. Within psychiatry and psychology the focus to date has remained largely on bespoke therapeutic applications, sometimes narrowly focused and often diagnostically siloed, rather than on the broader and more pressing reality that individuals with mental illness will increasingly engage in agential interactions with AI systems as a routine part of daily existence. While their capacity to model therapeutic dialogue, provide 24/7 companionship and assist with cognitive support has sparked understandable enthusiasm, recent reports suggest that these same systems may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of psychotic symptoms: so-called ‘AI psychosis’ or ‘ChatGPT psychosis’. Emerging, and rapidly accumulating, evidence indicates that agential AI may mirror, validate or amplify delusional or grandiose content, particularly in users already vulnerable to psychosis, due in part to the models’ design to maximise engagement and affirmation, although notably it is not clear whether these interactions have resulted or can result in the emergence of de novo psychosis in the absence of pre-existing vulnerability. Even if some individuals may benefit from AI interactions, for example where the AI functions as a benign and predictable conversational anchor, there is a growing concern that these agents may also reinforce epistemic instability, blur reality boundaries and disrupt self-regulation. In this paper, we outline both the potential harms and therapeutic possibilities of agential AI for people with psychotic disorders. In this perspective piece, we propose a framework of AI-integrated care involving personalised instruction protocols, reflective check-ins, digital advance statements and escalation safeguards to support epistemic security in vulnerable users. These tools reframe the AI agent as an epistemic ally (as opposed to ‘only’ a therapist or a friend) which functions as a partner in relapse prevention and cognitive containment. Given the rapid adoption of LLMs across all domains of digital life, these protocols must be urgently trialled and co-designed with service users and clinicians.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing our actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding by itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their current sensation of task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related cognitive effort, difficulty-related cognitive effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested if pupil size, as a physiological indicator for cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by overall cognitive effort (difficulty- and boredom-related) than by task-difficulty-related cognitive effort alone. The best model fit was found for a model including boredom- and difficulty-related effort as well as their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop task predicted task performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results highlight, that enduring boredom is not only perceived as effortful but also reflects in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it has behavioral relevance. This emphasizes the importance of considering boredom as a confounding variable in self-control research and, more general, within the broader scope of study designs.",

          "authors": "Jianghao Liu",
          "abstract": "Subjective imagery refers to one’s quasi-perceptual experience in the absence of direct external input. Yet around 4% of individuals with “aphantasia” report an inability to voluntarily generate such experiences. This phenomenon provides a natural experiment that challenges current theories of imagery, which typically assume that reactivation of the visual cortex in imagery generation is sufficient for imagery experience. In fact, neuroimaging evidence shows that aphantasic individuals can reactivate visual cortex normally during imagery tasks, indicating that additional, as-yet-unspecified, processes are required for subjective experience to emerge. \nHere, I propose an attention-based model of subjective imagery with two aims: (i) to outline a hierarchical processing, in which generation provides initial sensory reactivations, integration binds these features into coherent perceptual-like content, and amplification enhances them for conscious access, capturing both voluntary and spontaneous imagery; and (ii) to specify a putative neural implementation in a fronto-parietal-fusiform network shaped by two interacting attention systems. Aphantasia primarily reflects deficits in top-down attentional control, with preserved generation but impaired integration and amplification of internal representations, linked to altered interactions between frontoparietal control networks and the fusiform gyrus.\nOverall, this model reframes imagery as an active, constructive process shaped by the dynamic interplay of attention, sensory, and memory networks, rather than a passive reactivation of memory traces. Thus, this paper presents a testable mechanistic account of the neural substrates of subjective imagery and aphantasia, motivating future research and illuminating the neural basis of conscious experience.",

This multiverse-based, meta-analytic systematic review aims to examine the association of disclosing an LGB+ orientation with organizational LGB+ climate, discrimination, job satisfaction, and mental health. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review in line with PRISMA guidelines. Multi-tiered, systematic literature searches were conducted across 4 databases and further sources. Sixty-five studies from 62 publications (19,440 participants) met prespecified inclusion criteria. Pooled effect sizes (Pearson r) were calculated based on three-level, multiverse meta-analyses. Across 792 models, we found that workplace LGB+ disclosure was associated with a better organizational climate (mean observed r = .39), less discrimination (r = -.24), higher job satisfaction (r = .15), and better mental health (r = .14). Moderator analyses were mostly inconclusive with some evidence found for disclosure type, sexual orientation, gender, and year of data collection in certain subsets of multiverse specifications. Organizations aiming to support the well-being of LGB+ employees may benefit from cultivating non-discriminatory work environments, as such LGB+ friendly environments are associated with greater openness about sexual orientation and, in turn, with higher job satisfaction and better mental health among LGB+ staff. This multiverse-based, meta-analytic systematic review considers different communicative forms of disclosure and examines the associations of disclosure with organizational and personal variables and considers a variety of moderating variables.",

The approach’s efficacy has previously been demonstrated in highly controlled laboratory studies where the SoS approach was implemented through semi-scripted protocols. The current study is the first to develop and evaluate a 2-hour training program designed to teach novice interviewers to independently apply the SoS approach in mock interviews. We compared the SoS training with a program focused on foundational interviewing principles (Basic training). We predicted that participants receiving both types of training would elicit more information from mock suspects than those who only received Basic training. Participants (N = 31) acting as interviewers were assigned to one of three training conditions: Basic, SoS, or SoS-Delay. Basic participants only received Basic training before conducting four interviews with separate mock-suspects. The two SoS conditions received both types of training at different time points (before all four interviews for SoS, after two interviews for SoS-Delay). We recruited mock suspects (N = 124) to complete a mock crime before being interviewed. Interviewers who received the SoS training used SoS tactics more frequently and elicited more general information compared to those who only received Basic training. However, we observed no significant differences in interviewers’ ability to elicit previously unknown information. However, the use of several SoS tactics was positively associated with eliciting such information. These results demonstrate that even brief SoS training improves novices’ use of tactics and ability to elicit information.",

          "abstract": "Interoception, the sensing of the body's internal state, is an important component of homeostatic and allostatic regulation with wide-ranging implications for mental and physical health, yet its measurement is hindered by tools with conceptual and psychometric issues. To address these limitations, we developed and validated the Multimodal Interoception Questionnaire (Mint). In Study 1 (N=559), a comprehensive item pool using a novel \"modality-by-context\" framework was generated and then reduced using psychometric network analysis. In Study 2 (N=737), we validated the Mint in an independent sample, establishing its structure,  comparing its predictive power against established interoception questionnaires (MAIA-2, BPQ, IAS), and across a wide range of clinical and cognitive outcomes. This rigorous process yielded a 33-item scale with a stable hierarchical structure comprising three metaclusters (Interoceptive Deficit, Interoceptive Awareness, Visceroception) and 11 distinct facets. The Mint demonstrated superior criterion validity, consistently outperforming existing scales in predicting outcomes tied to altered bodily perception, including alexithymia, ADHD, autism, and somatic symptom clusters. The Mint offers a psychometrically robust and nuanced measure of self-reported interoception that integrates and extends existing scales, providing researchers and clinicians with a practical and readily usable tool to investigate the role of bodily sensations in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "Recently, public debates related to metaphors such as echo chambers and filter bubbles have emphasized how the formation of like-minded spaces can harm democratic systems. In fact, human beings have always tended to surround themselves by those who act and think alike. Still, the extent and the potential effects of this human tendency specifically in online networks are yet to be understood. This chapter summarizes a five-year research program at the intersection of media psychology, communication studies, and social media analytics devoted to understanding the emergence and the consequences of political homogeneity in social media. We present subjective and objective measures of political homogeneity, which psychological factors facilitate its emergence, and how its presence can shape perceptions of public opinion, metacognitions, personal opinions, and expressive actions. Drawing on this evidence, we outline its implications for strengthening and securing democracy in digitized societies.",

          "abstract": "Truly understanding the position of ideological opponents is challenging, yet crucial if our goals are to avoid escalation or further polarisation, identify areas of agreement, and ultimately reduce misunderstanding. We operationalise the idea of an ‘Ideological Turing Test’, as a behavioural measure of the extent to which people are able to accurately represent the position of their ideological opponents. The original ‘Turing Test’ challenged any artificial intelligence to successfully mimic human dialogue- the test would be passed if a human was convinced that the machine was a human. The Ideological Turing Test has been proposed (Caplan 2011 Econlib) as a requirement for would-be human debaters - can they successfully mimic their ideological opponent’s arguments to the extent that their opponent endorses the argument as strongly as their own? Crucially, this ‘Test’ offers a behavioural measure of open mindedness which goes beyond self-report measures. It is not possible to pass an Ideological Turing Test by believing you understand the other’s perspective - you must articulate those arguments to the satisfaction of those who hold them.  In this study, we operationalise the Ideological Turing Test by recruiting participants from opposite sides of commonly polarising debates (Covid-19 Vaccines, Brexit, Veganism), and asking them to provide reasons both for and against their position. These reasons were rated by participants from the opposite side of the debate. Our criteria for “passing” the Ideological Turing Test is if an argument is agreed with by opponents to the same extent or higher than arguments made by proponents. We found no difference in minority or majority positions in their ability to pass the Ideological Turing Test (i.e. no difference in passing rate between those who are for or against Covid-19 vaccines). However we did find that those who pass the Ideological Turing Test are less judgemental towards their opponents, in that they are less likely to rate them as ignorant, immoral or irrational. The Ideological Turing Test not only provides a  behavioural measure of open-mindedness, it also provides insights into the scope and diversity of arguments within and between polarising topics.",

          "authors": "Eva Wiese; Tobias Feldmann-Wüstefeld",
          "abstract": "Efficient allocation of attentional resources is critical when humans collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI): they must focus on their task while monitoring the AI to intervene if it fails. Inefficient allocation—such as excessive monitoring or overreliance—can impair performance and cause critical errors. Whether humans appropriately offload attentional effort to an AI depends on factors such as the AI’s competency, the user’s expertise, and their propensity to trust. Yet, trust in AI is a latent variable that is difficult to measure. Here, we introduce an EEG-based approach to directly track how attentional resources are shared between a human and an AI. Participants performed a visual search task either alone or with an AI whose competency was varied. The N2pc component—an established neural marker of selective visual attention—was used to index attentional deployment. Results showed that the N2pc amplitude varied with the AI’s competency: smaller amplitudes indicated greater offloading and trust in the high- versus low-competency condition. The findings demonstrate that neurophysiological markers such as the N2pc can serve as implicit, non-disruptive measures of trust that inform about the cognitive mechanisms underlying trust calibration. The study thus establishes the N2pc as a promising marker for quantifying attention allocation in collaborative human-AI search tasks and extends its relevance from visual attention research to the study of trust in automation.",

          "abstract": "Mental rotation ability plays a crucial role in learning outcomes in STEM subjects - the ongoing debate questions whether and, if so, why men outperform women in mental rotation. Existing mental rotation tests (MRTs) have recently been criticized for being male-biased in their design. In our study, we attempted to overcome potential MRT design bias by integrating the renowned MRT into an immersive virtual reality (iVR) environment that reduces those biases. In a sample of N = 731 university students, we examined whether the iVR environment had an impact on MRT performance for males and females compared to (a) the paper-and-pencil condition and (b) a tablet condition. Our findings reveal the consistent superiority of male over female students in MRT performance across the three conditions. However, this discrepancy is attenuated in both technology-supported conditions. Based on the mediation model, cognitive effort partially mediated gender differences in mental rotation performance in the paper-and-pencil and tablet conditions, but not in iVR, suggesting that the role of perceived mental workload in gender disparities may vary depending on the testing environment.",

According to “motivated perception”, a person’s motivation can alter how the brain interprets incoming sensory information. Yet, empirical support remains mixed, often due to methodological confounds. Here, we systematically tested whether motivation alters perception or whether it instead biases behavior. Across four experiments, we assessed the quality and quantity of motivation (self-concordance, value) and two key dimensions of perception: bias and sensitivity. Moreover, we tested two potentially mediating mechanisms (gaze position, spatial attention) as well as an implicit perceptual measure. Using smooth pursuit eye movements as an implicit measure of motion perception, we show that motivation biases responses without altering perception (Experiment 2). Changes in perceptual sensitivity (Experiment 1) and perceptual bias (Experiments 3–4) only arise when participants can freely select their gaze position in response to uncertain or ambiguous visual displays. Our findings therefore challenge the notion of “motivated perception”. Instead, they suggest that motivation shapes how we look and respond – but not how we perceive.",

          "abstract": "Depression is characterized by reduced future thinking specificity, yet the retrieval processes underlying this impairment remain unclear. Building on parallels between future thinking and autobiographical memory, we examined whether depressive symptoms are differentially associated with direct versus generative retrieval of specific and categoric future events, and whether contrast avoidance (i.e., maintaining a negative mood to avoid a sudden negative emotional shift) contributes to these patterns. In Study 1 (N = 80) and Study 2 (N = 113), Japanese adults completed a future thinking task in which they imagined personally-relevant future events for positive and negative cue words, classified each retrieval as direct or generative, and rated phenomenological characteristics. Across studies, depressive symptom severity was consistently associated with more frequent direct retrieval of negative categoric future thinking and less frequent direct retrieval of positive specific future thinking. Depressed individuals also reported lower emotional valence, likelihood, and similarity with past events for positive future thinking, suggesting limited memory resources for generating plausible positive events. In Study 2, a higher propensity for emotional contrast avoidance was linked to increased retrieval of negative categoric future thinking and decreased retrieval of positive specific future thinking. These findings extend depression-related alteration of accessibility from autobiographical memory to future thinking, suggesting common underlying knowledge structures. Increased accessibility to negative categoric futures and reduced accessibility to positive specific futures may be a pathological process in depressed individuals, with contrast avoidance potentially maintaining these biases.",

          "abstract": "Groove, defined as the pleasurable urge to move to music, is affected by properties of the music as well as factors that differ among individuals, such as music training. Ratings of the desire to produce movement (e.g., tapping and dancing) have been used to quantify the amount of groove being experienced, but we do not know whether the specific type of movement that is rated affects scores. Further, few studies have considered the effect of dance training on groove perception. Therefore, the current paper investigates whether rating different types of movements (i.e., tapping vs dancing) affects groove ratings, and how dance experience may alter these ratings. The first study used a within-subject design, with participants rating forty unfamiliar songs on their elicited desire to tap, desire to move, and desire to dance. To assess whether rating all three movement descriptors together created rating differences that would not be observed if participants were not comparing the movement descriptors against each other, a between-subjects study was conducted with the same procedure except that the three groups of participants each rated only one movement descriptor. In both studies, ratings of groove differed based on the type of movement rated. Overall, desire to dance ratings were lower than move or tap ratings across both studies. Desire to tap ratings were significantly higher than move ratings, but only in the first study; in the second study, move and tap ratings did not significantly differ. In the first study, dance training influenced desire to move and desire to dance ratings, while music training influenced desire to tap ratings, however these findings were not replicated in Study 2. Overall, the findings suggest that groove ratings differ based on the type of movement rated, that within- versus between-subject designs affect these ratings, and that dance and music training differentially affect different groove responses.",

          "abstract": "Aims: Hazardous alcohol consumption represents a substantial threat to public health, particularly for older adults (aged 55 and above), who are more vulnerable to alcohol-related harm. Healthcare professionals play a key role in addressing alcohol consumption, yet little is known about older adults’ attitudes towards these conversations. This study aimed to: 1) examine older adults’ attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations with GPs, practice nurses, district nurses and volunteers; and 2) explore associations between these attitudes and older adults’ socio-demographic characteristics and alcohol consumption.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey (N = 424) was conducted to collect data on socio-demographics, alcohol consumption and attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between personal characteristics and attitudes. \n\nResults: Support for routinely asking about alcohol consumption was highest for GPs (60.4%), followed by practice nurses (55.0%), district nurses (46.7%) and volunteers (17.5%). Older adults aged 75 and older were more likely to view alcohol use as a personal matter and were less likely to initiate conversations with GPs (OR 0.66, CI 0.43–1.00) or district nurses (OR 0.60, CI 0.38–0.94), compared to those younger than 75. High-risk drinkers were more likely to have negative attitudes towards district nurses routinely addressing alcohol consumption (OR 0.54, CI 0.29–0.99). \n\nConclusions: Attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations differ across healthcare professionals, with GPs viewed most favourably and volunteers least. These findings highlight the need for healthcare systems to avoid treating healthcare professionals as interchangeable when addressing alcohol consumption.",

          "abstract": "This paper provides novel empirical evidence that the medium-term relationship between trade liberalization and growth varies substantially with countries’ economic structure. Using a multi-method strategy, I examine per capita income dynamics after tariff reductions in a panel of 161 countries from 1960 to 2019. Baseline local projections reveal a sharp divergence: GDP per capita rises in manufacturer countries following tariff reductions, and notably falls in nonmanufacturers. A local projections difference-in-differences framework strengthens the analysis by accounting for treatment effect heterogeneity and variation in treatment timing. Finally, I study tariff reductions during the WTO-era reform period (1986 to 1994), a policy episode that historical evidence supports as plausibly exogenous, providing complementary evidence that confirms the observed heterogeneity. An exploration of mechanisms using local projections links these patterns to shifts in productivity, capital stocks, and manufacturing shares in GDP, consistent with theoretical expectations. The findings suggest that rising protectionism in manufacturer countries may be harmful, while further liberalization in nonmanufacturers could have unintended consequences.",

Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake.\n\nMethods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours.\n\nResults: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits.\n\nConclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

These were, in turn, yet another manifestation of broader debates on the appropriate role and functions of science and expertise in liberal-democratic policymaking, which have defined a large part of European politics over the past few years. This paper contributes to the research on the politics of expertise by presenting the results of an innovative multi-level mini-public approach, in which citizens from five European countries – France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland – were asked to discuss and deliberate on questions relating to the place and role of experts in policymaking, scientific information, and communication. The results of these discus- sions not only yield more fine-grained and nuanced evidence on citizens’ attitudes on these topics than currently available via survey research but also allow for the formulation of actionable advice that will be of interest to policymakers at the national as well as EU level.",

Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. \nIn this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse.\nCluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests.\nFunded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

          "abstract": "Are policies that contribute to reducing climate vulnerability electorally advantageous? Political science has long studied the politics of carbon dioxide mitigation, but we know less about the political logic of climate impacts. As adaptation lies at the intersection of environmental, social, and disaster policy, its electoral effects are puzzling from a theoretical perspective. We address this gap by studying a program to improve the ability of households to withstand episodes of water scarcity in Mexico City, implemented between presidential cycles. In contrast to conventional forms of social policy, this intervention prioritizes building future resilience instead of immediate material benefits. We take advantage of the means-tested nature of the program to reduce imbalances between treated and control neighbors and estimate a difference-in-differences to evaluate its impact on electoral outcomes. We find that neighborhoods receiving this adaptation policy had, on average, higher levels of support for the party in charge of its implementation at the presidential and gubernatorial levels, compared to similar neighborhoods that did not receive the program. We also posit that reductions in reliance on inadequate water sources are a mechanism that explains this result. Our findings suggest that climate adaptation may be less contentious than mitigation, therefore giving politicians strong incentives to implement them. Moreover, we contribute to the climate politics literature by providing a theoretical framework to understand the political logic of adaptation action, regardless of its specific form or domain.",

          "abstract": "Elite and Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) philanthropy is widely debated for its social impact, motivations, and consequences - yet much of this discourse relies on assumptions or theoretical critiques that lack a robust empirical base. This scoping review addresses this gap by systematically mapping published empirical research on elite philanthropy to answer a core question: what is actually known, where is evidence strong or weak, and how can future research be better directed? \n\nDrawing on 182 empirical studies identified through comprehensive database searches and citation analysis, this review shows that existing research is geographically skewed towards the United States and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal patterns in research themes, theoretical perspectives, and methodological choices - alongside major gaps, including limited studies in non-Western contexts, consequently failing to explore differing cultural and religious dimensions, and highlights the sparsity of empirical support for widely held critical assumptions. \n\nBy describing what the empirical literature does and does not show, this paper argues for a more globally inclusive, theoretically diverse, and methodologically rigorous research agenda. The review provides scholars and practitioners with an evidence-based foundation to challenge untested claims, develop new theory, and inform more effective philanthropic practice in an era of growing economic inequality and global wealth concentration.\n\nThe paper calls for more research into topics such as the philanthropy of younger entrepreneurs, gender dynamics, the influence of effective altruism, and recent global phenomena - including the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and technological innovation.",

I suggest using a method originally designed to measure residential segregation to quantify the amount of balkanization in media use at the country, party, and individual levels. To show the potential of the measure, I use data from a nationally representative survey to describe the amount of partisan segregation in media consumption in the United States.",

Using Growing Up in Scotland, a nationally representative longitudinal child cohort study of children born in 2004-05, we investigate social inequalities in social work contact for children living with parental domestic violence and abuse (working sample n:3216). Using logit models, we examine associations between self-reported maternal experiences of domestic violence and abuse (when children were aged 0-6 years old), and social work service contact for study-children (across ages 2-7 years old), controlling for socio-demographic factors, illicit substance use, alcohol consumption, parental separation, and maternal mental health. Maternal reports of domestic violence and abuse significantly increased the likelihood of social worker contact for the study-child. Social worker involvement was far more likely in low-income households. Where domestic violence and abuse had been reported, social worker contact was twice as likely for boys than for girls. Findings suggest significant socio-economic disparities and gender discrepancies in the social work service response in the context of domestic violence and abuse. These patterns raise concerns about the potential for social work engagement being stratified by socio-economic status and under-identification of girls’ needs in domestic violence and abuse contexts.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

By independently randomizing the attributes of a pair of fictitious profiles, researchers summarize the average contribution that each attribute makes to an overall choice. But what if the effect of one attribute depends on the values of other attributes? We present a method that uses data-adaptive experimentation to search for heterogeneity in the effect of one focal attribute as a function of all other attributes. Our empirical application of this method shows that U.S. adults weigh the education of an immigrant much more heavily for certain immigrants than for others. By targeting the heterogeneous effects of a focal attribute, our approach complements conjoint designs that target the average effects of all attributes.",

To date no research has explored the mechanisms that directly influence children’s cognitive and social-emotional development. Using data from the UK-based Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), we examine the relationship between maternal work schedules and children’s social-emotional development from ages three to seven, focusing on three potential mediators: the stability of children’s daily routines, the types of their daily activities, and maternal depression. We find that maternal NSWS is associated with increased social-emotional difficulties in children, particularly when mothers work at night. Among the three mechanisms, maternal depression emerges as the most significant mediator, followed by regular bedtime routines. These findings suggest that while daily routines and activities are important for child development, a substantial portion of the impact of maternal NSWS is mediated through maternal psychological well-being. Effective interventions to support children’s social-emotional development should consider the mental health and well-being of mothers working nonstandard hours.",

          "abstract": "The study of segregation in activity spaces is experiencing renewed attention, fueled by the \nincreasing availability of mobility data from mobile phones and social media. These new data \nsources allow for high-resolution analysis of how people move through cities and interact \nacross diverse neighborhoods. A key goal behind this work is to inform the design of \ninclusive spaces that foster intergroup contact and social cohesion. However, much of this \nresearch has focused on statistical diversity (typically measured through census data, \nmobility traces, or indices that capture the distribution and co-presence of social groups) \nwhile giving less consideration to how diversity is perceived by those who use these spaces.\nThis study bridges that gap by combining GIS-based mobility modeling with on-street survey \ndata. Using aggregated mobility data from ~90,000 mobile phone users in Auckland, New \nZealand, we estimated ethnic mobility flows and computed spatial diversity indices for \nresidents and visitors across six neighborhoods. In parallel, we conducted 249 on-street \nsurveys in those neighborhoods to capture perceptions of diversity.\nOur findings reveal only a weak correlation between statistical and perceived diversity, \nhighlighting that individuals do not simply mirror demographic compositions in their \nperceptions. Instead, perceived diversity is more strongly predicted by self-reported \nintergroup contact (both within the specific neighborhood and across the city) and by \naffective factors such as space affinity and attitudes toward outgroup members. These \nresults underscore the importance of integrating both statistical and perceptual data to \nunderstand diversity in urban environments. Designing for inclusion, we argue, must \naccount for both who is present in a space and how that space is experienced.",

          "abstract": "This study analyzes Türkiye's political landscape by harnessing Computational Social Science techniques to parse extensive data about public ideologies from the Project_Name database. Unlike existing theoretical frameworks that focus on the ideologies of political elites and cadres, this study examines public ideologies in a contentious political manner. Exploiting an AI-based data generation pipeline on digital traces, it distills the eight most prevalent ideologies down to the city level and employs exploratory statistical analyses. Principal Component Analysis delineates two fundamental axes: the traditional left-right political spectrum and a separate spectrum of secular-religious inclination, encompassing both political and cultural dimensions. Then, the Cluster Analysis reveals three distinct groups: left-leaning and religiously inclined, centre-right-leaning and religiously inclined, and those with a centre-right-leaning focus and a pronounced secular orientation. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the political and cultural axes within political society, offering a clearer understanding of the most recent ideological and political climate in Türkiye.",

          "authors": "Iryna Susha; Sofie de Wilde de Ligny; Fredo Schotanus; Mirko Schaeffer",
          "abstract": "To address complex societal challenges, governments increasingly need to make evidence-based decisions and require the best available data as input. As much of relevant data is now in the hands of the private sector, governments increasingly resort to purchasing data from private sources. There is, however, scant empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of how governments go about data purchasing. Therefore, we develop a new conceptual-analytical framework to analyze three models of data purchasing by governments: purchasing raw or aggregated data, data analyses, and data-based services. Next, based on Dutch data purchases, we explore the utility of our framework and create an evidence base detailing what data, data analyses, and data-based services Dutch governments purchase from whom, how, and for what purposes in the context of societal challenges. Our results map buyers and sellers of data in the Dutch context, as well as the types of data sold and in which policy domains. We expose a serious lack of transparency in government reporting on data purchasing. We further discuss our results in view of possible archetypes of data purchases and what purchasing strategy implications they have. Lastly, we propose several recommendations to practitioners and a research agenda for academics.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how welfare states address stratification of reproduction. Whether, when and how people have children is historically an area of intense state intervention and remains so today. Building on comparative welfare state research and inspired by research on stratified reproduction, we examine regulatory provisions towards abortion, contraception and medically assisted reproduction, empirically mapping the institutional landscape for 30 countries between 1995 and 2020. We propose a conceptual framework of ‘reproductive equity support’, defined as the sum of statutory permitted and resourced reproductive options, which varies across four ideal types: conservative, paternalistic, libertarian and comprehensive. Second, we operationalize permissiveness and generosity for contraception, abortion and medically assisted reproduction using policy indicators from the novel International Reproduction Policy Database. We find strong variation between countries, and substantive shifts over time: while most countries make a leap towards more permissive reproduction policy, increase in generosity is less pronounced and less wide-spread.",

          "authors": "Andreas Ljungström; Carina Mood",
          "abstract": "In many Western countries, children with foreign-born parents are lagging behind children with native-born parents in school performance. In the policy debate much hope is placed on the potential of pre-schools to remedy this, by providing a learning and language environment that can compensate for the disadvantages that these children face. \n\nWe study inequalities in pre-school learning contexts by immigrant origin, using full population register data that matches all children to their families and pre-schools. Enrolment in pre-school is lower for children of immigrants, but this is – surprisingly – almost entirely driven by low enrolment of children in non-refugee families. Contrary to expectations, children from origin groups with larger school difficulties have high pre-school enrolment rates. Our results suggest that explanations for low enrolment should primarily be sought in intentions to remain long-term in the host country.\n\nIn pre-schools, immigrant background children have a somewhat higher teacher density, but a somewhat lower density of qualified teachers, and a somewhat higher turnover rate and sickness absence among teachers. These differences are however small. Where we see large differences is in the composition of the child and teacher group: Immigrant-background children go to pre-schools where a much higher proportion of teachers and children have immigrant background. \n\nWe conclude that hopes to equalize school outcomes through encouraging pre-school enrolment are misplaced, and equalizing structural indicators is unlikely to make a big difference. The compensatory potential of pre-schools lies primarily in a de-segregation of staff and children across pre-schools.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how male and female students at a Bangladeshi public university mix English and Bangla languages. It examines how frequently and in what manner these students employ code-mixing in university and social life. It also examines the social reasons and identity concerns that result in variation in code-mixing practices among male and female students. The attitudes of students towards code-mixing and the perception of others’ use of it have also been examined. The research reveals that code-mixing practices vary significantly between males and females due to gender differences in identity and students’ responses to social pressure and opportunity at university. Female students mix languages more frequently and in more sophisticated ways because they aspire to be socially accepted and project a modern identity. Male students, on the other hand, employ code-mixing in a more functional way, using it to exhibit academic expertise and professional standing. Overall, the research reveals that mixing English and Bangla is not the same for all people; it is a finely tuned strategy that exhibits gender differences in identity and students’ negotiation with social pressure and opportunity at university.",

          "authors": "Panos FITSILIS",
          "abstract": "Academic department rankings often overlook the rich evidence in students’ open-ended comments, relying instead on questionnaires, reputation, and research metrics. This paper introduces the PULSE Index (Perceived University Learning &amp; Student Experience), a 0 - 100 composite score that converts student comments into department-level indicators using a transparent AI/NLP pipeline. The method is student-centered by design. Stage 1 defines a set of student-valued categories (e.g., teaching, infrastructure, services) and elicits their weights via a multi-criteria procedure. Stage 2 collects and de-identifies comments, assigns each comment to categories with aspect-based classification, and estimates neutral-aware sentiment using modern embeddings. Topic models (LDA/BERTopic) provide an empirical check on the category map and surface emergent themes. For each module and category, we compute conditional mean sentiment, coverage and intensity; apply empirical-Bayes shrinkage to stabilize small samples; and, optionally, fold salience and strength into a representativeness factor. Stage 3 normalizes indicators within peer groups, forms module composites via the elicited weights, and aggregates modules to departments using reliability- and volume-aware weights, before scaling to the 0 - 100 PULSE Index. Robustness is assessed through sensitivity analysis (weights, normalization), bootstrap confidence intervals and rank-stability; fairness diagnostics examine subgroup patterns (e.g., level, modality, language). The framework yields explainable, auditable scores with traceable contributions by category and exemplary comments, supporting both accountability and improvement. By operationalizing student voice with methodological safeguards, the PULSE Index offers a rigorous alternative to traditional department rankings and a practical blueprint for institutions seeking evidence-based, student-centered quality assurance. An illustrative worked example demonstrates implementation details and reporting.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing partisan bias in redistricting. But these measures are not easily adapted to other groups, including groups defined by race, class, or geography. Nor are they applicable to single- or no-party contexts, such as local redistricting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework of harm for evaluating the impacts of a districting plan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong. We consider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under the current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on existing measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters and directly incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies for estimating harm, and demonstrate the utility of our framework through analyses of partisan gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights litigation in Alabama, and racial dynamics of Boston City Council elections.",

Yet International Relations (IR) research has long struggled with militarism. This paper considers the capacity of existing conceptual and methodological approaches to engage with the concept, in turn assessing militarism’s candidacy to become a ‘core concept’ in the field. We first highlight the diverse and evolving usage of the concept of militarism over time and across different knowledge forms. From there we move on to examine key tensions within IR accounts, suggesting that ‘historical,’ ‘scientific,’ and ‘political’ approaches stand to gain from a more rigorous engagement with each other. We conclude with an appeal for sustained attention to militarism as concept and its historical and political dimensions in particular.",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

We then investigate the relationship between these proportions and interviewer-rated physical attractiveness among self-identified Black Americans (N=2,087).

This paper proposes that political interest can in part be explained by the meaning that people find in politics. Evidence from six experiments (n=5,767) shows that appealing to meaning can increase political interest. In these studies, treated participants provide information about what they find meaningful in their lives, with their responses leveraged in on-the-fly treatments that connect their responses to politics. These treatments lead people otherwise disinterested in politics and policy to become more interested in both. The effects of meaning on interest are sizable, equivalent to 43.1% of the pre-treatment divide in political interest between strong and non-strong partisans and 61.1% of the divide between those with and without college degrees. These results offer a new way of understanding---and increasing---political interest.",

          "abstract": "Rough sets, rough set-theoretic definitions and axiomatic frameworks have been, for some time now, a mainstream mathematical approach from fuzzy mathematics to model and encode (un)certainty in traditional information systems across different domains. With the pervasive rise and shift from traditional information systems to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based intelligent information systems, however, the issue of representing and encoding (un)certain knowledge of different domains and at different levels of abstraction within such systems has emerged as an unsolved pivotal research problem in AI. The paper is interdisciplinary in nature, being positioned at the intersection of mathematics and AI research, and, to that end, will have two objectives. First, it will focus on critically reviewing key state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research literature on how rough sets and rough set-theoretic frameworks are being employed for (un)certain knowledge representation, e.g., via ontologies and Knowledge Graphs, in AI-based information systems across different domains. Second, based on the aforementioned critical review, it will elucidate research implications and potential research strategies which will inform future research towards developing an integrated mathematical philosophy and mathematico-logical formalism for (un)certain knowledge representation in AI systems.",

          "authors": "Nerhum Sandambi",
          "abstract": "Many countries develop through the increase of their economic resources, which naturally exist in most countries. On the other hand, some evidence shows that countries can develop through fiscal decentralisation, which promotes this growth through regional growth via significantly viable economic transformation. In Africa, for example, federalist countries such as Nigeria and South Africa show greater capacity for regional transformation through indicators of great relevance in themselves. Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties. Although there is de facto fiscal decentralisation, particularly in Nigeria and Ethiopia, there is nevertheless a greater lack of economic development in all territories, with the exception, for example, of states with greater economic concentration such as Lagos and Abuja.",

Two third-party data scrapers on Apify were used to obtain a large sample of TikToks (n=3,506) scraped using contraception-related search terms and hashtags. These videos were screened for eligibility, and we used a hybrid deductive and inductive thematic approach to analyze eligible videos (n=712). A youth advisory committee was formed to guide and interpret the research. Central themes include contrasts between user experiences of side effects and clinical evidence, anti-hormonal sentiment, empowerment, and trust/mistrust in healthcare.

          "abstract": "While micro-level research shows that employed individuals are less likely to experience poverty, macro-level trends reveal disappointing poverty reduction despite substantial employment growth across European countries – constituting an employment-poverty paradox. This study addresses this paradox by examining the heterogeneous effects of employment on poverty across different family types, while rigorously accounting for selection processes and confounding through leveraging panel data, varying assumption about causal structure, simulations, and formal sensitivity analysis. We apply a multi-group Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to examine how employment prevalences and premiums contribute to poverty differences across varying family-types. Our results suggest that differences in employment prevalences contribute minimally to poverty gaps, while premium effects drive most observable effects. Part-time employment shows even weaker poverty reduction effects across all family types. Sensitivity analysis reveals vulnerability to unmeasured confounding, suggesting true causal effects may be smaller still. In sum, employment is not a panacea for poverty reduction across family types.",

While existing literature has documented a purported increasing trend of these themes, investigations that consider the social conditions during song production remain scarce. By analyzing 26,438 rap singles released in the United States from 1990 to 2015, we find that the prevalence of these lyrical themes does not show a consistent upward trajectory. Instead, they exhibit significant temporal fluctuations, with each following a distinct pattern. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong contemporaneous correlation between these lyrical fluctuations and their corresponding national social indicators, including rates for crime, sexual assault, poverty, and DEA arrests. Crucially, this correlation becomes significantly stronger when using social statistics specific to Black Americans. These findings provide large-scale empirical evidence that art is a sensitive reflection of the social and economic realities of the time, offering insights into how deep-seated social problems are depicted through artistic expression.",

          "authors": "Selçuk Bedük; Anna Yong",
          "abstract": "While any experience of child poverty can affect life chances, longer exposure is particularly concerning due to its lasting effects on education, health and earnings. This study adopts a life-course perspective, tracking poverty from birth to age 10 for cohorts born in Britain between 1991 and 2017. On average, 17% of children spent at least half of their childhood in poverty. Long-term poverty affected 25% of those born in the early 1990s, markedly declined to 13-14% for cohorts born after the 1997 welfare reforms, and substantially increased again to 23% for children born following the 2013 austerity reforms. Decomposition analysis shows that cross-cohort changes are driven more by shifts in the penalties associated with work and family risk factors than by changes in their prevalence. These shifts in penalties reflect broader changes in redistribution and predistribution. The early decline in long-term poverty was largely due to rising employment and earnings in low-income households, while the post-austerity increase stems mainly from reduced redistribution. For cohorts born in the 2000s, social transfers played a substantial role in containing long-term poverty despite worsening predistribution. Overall, the findings show that long-term childhood poverty remains a significant challenge in Britain and highlight the need for both stronger redistribution and improved predistribution to address it.",

This commentary pleads for a re-engagement with the ‘geographies of research assessment’. Informed by a dualistic understanding of scale as both fixed and socially constructed, the commentary firstly argues for comparing and contrasting the influence of different national research evaluation systems on geographical knowledge production. Secondly, the contribution conceives of research evaluation systems as a form of scalar politics which enables a view of the actors and networks contesting current evaluation systems and promoting alternatives.

The present study is a descriptive-analytical \ninvestigation of the selected speeches of political discourse given by the two most \ninfluential speakers of Animal Farm (Old Major and Squealer), a novel written by \nOrwell (1945). To investigate and uncover the ways in which ideology and power \nrelations are subtly reproduced in discourse, we have examined what makes Old Major \nand Squealer persuasive in the expression of their ideologies. The analysis is grounded \non the main tenets and principles of Critical Discourse Analysis. Unlike any other forms \nof linguistic analysis, the main purpose of CDA is explicitly socio-political, since it \nseeks to better represent the role of discourse in the reproduction of dominance and \npower struggle. Therefore, we have adopted Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework: \ndescription, interpretation and explanation. In addition, we have capitalized on \nAristotle’s approach of persuasion (ethos, pathos and logos) to be as a supporting \nanalytical tool of linguistic and rhetorical devices. Thus, the analytical part of this \nresearch work has analyzed the possible interrelatedness of textual properties and their \nconveyance of a particular ideology by giving it an eclectic treatment as far as the \napplication of framework is concerned. The findings of this investigation uncover the \nlinguistic and rhetorical techniques that contribute to the overall process of persuasion, \nwhich have different ideological attachments. The study concludes that the analysis of \nFairclough’s three dimensional framework and three modes of persuasion under the \nmain tenets of CDA has shown that politicians – even in a fictional political world – \ndepend significantly on linguistic manipulation to demonstrate ideologies, steer people’s \nthoughts, manufacture consent and rise to power.",

The scholarly debate about the impartiality of the fact-checking practice too is stuck in an endless yo-yo motion: permanently vacillating between claims of being irrevocably unbiased or irremediably subjective. Contributing to Critical Disinformation Studies, the paper demonstrates how a prevailing atomist perception of fake news validates the persistent—though increasingly problematised—modelling of Western fact-checking into an impartial fake news detector. Inspired by Karen Barad’s work, the paper therefore introduces a dual relational-atomist fact-checking model that arguably stands a better chance at receiving public endorsement.",

          "authors": "martina mchenga",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Corporal punishment in schools remains pervasive across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite legal prohibitions. While research has examined prevalence and teacher attitudes, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments influence their vulnerability to teacher violence.\nMethods: The study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five SSA countries (Eswatini 2021, Mozambique 2019, Kenya 2019, Namibia 2019, Lesotho 2018), focusing on school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years (N=10,904). Logistic regression models estimated associations between adolescents’ individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes and self-reported experience of teacher corporal punishment in the past year. Models were adjusted for socio-demographic and household covariates. Country-specific estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\nResults: Overall, 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher physical punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, and peer endorsement averaged 53%. In pooled models, adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of reporting teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Girls and adolescents in secondary school were less likely to report teacher punishment, while those exposed to corporal punishment at home were over three times more likely to also report it at school (aOR=3.4, 95% CI: 2.5-4.7). Heterogeneity across countries was high, with strongest associations observed in Kenya.\nConclusions: Adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative climates significantly shape their risk of teacher violence. Prevention strategies must extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also target adolescent attitudes, peer environments, and home-school linkages. Interventions combining school-wide norms change, peer engagement, and parenting support may offer the most sustainable pathway to eliminating corporal punishment in schools",

This study examines student perceptions at a private high school that implemented a zero-access phone ban during the 2024–2025 school year. Two anonymous surveys were fielded at policy launch (October 2024) and three months later (January 2025), yielding a combined N = 494. Primary outcomes were perceived changes in in-person interaction frequency and quality, perceived connectedness, perceived classroom focus, perceived productivity during school, and self-reported academic performance. Most respondents perceived social benefits, including more frequent face-to-face conversations, while a minority reported diminished connectedness. Nearly half perceived higher productivity during school, yet most perceived no change in academic performance. Over half reported increased phone use during homework, which may offset in-school gains. Findings underscore heterogeneity in responses and suggest that bans, without complementary supports, can improve opportunities for in-person interaction for many students but may disadvantage students who rely on digital scaffolds for social engagement.",

          "abstract": "This deliverable set out to analyse the context-specificity of financial support policies for families with children and (out-of-pocket fees for) childcare services, two policy areas that feature prominently in rEUsilience recommendations (Daly et al., 2025). Our first question was to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services at different income levels. Based on our newly introduced compensation ratio measure, we showed that the combination of child contingent benefits and out-of-pocket costs tends to be low-income targeted, in the sense that lower-income families pay lower fees for childcare and/or receive higher benefits. In Poland and Sweden, the out-of-pocket expenses for childcare tended to be lower (on average) across the income distribution than child-contingent benefits, whereas high-income families in Belgium and Spain paid more for childcare than they received as financial support. Secondly, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services for different family types. Here, we found that generally (with the exception of Spain) families with more children receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to families with fewer children. In all the four countries studied here, single-parent families receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to two-parent families. Finally, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services when families transition into work. Here, we found that, generally, the compensation ratio was higher for families on social assistance or employment at low wages, compared to families working at higher wages. This holds for single-parent families (with the exception of Poland) as well as two-parent families. Moreover, the extent to which the compensation rate was lowered with employment and at higher wage levels differed between countries, with the drop particularly notable in Belgium and moderate to absent in Poland. For average wage employees, the compensation ratio was lowest in Belgium compared to the other countries included here.",

We simulate one million US residents’ domestic travel decisions using two different LLMs, Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT 4.1 Nano. The LLM-based projections are compared to the null model and empirical-based simulations to assess characteristics of tourist flows generated by LLMs. LLMs generate tourist flows that are more seasonal, more concentrated in a few popular destinations, and less reciprocal than empirical-based simulations. Other patterns, like the mean resilience index and the mean travel distance, vary by LLM used. These findings show that the widespread adoption of LLMs can undermine the sustainability and resilience of tourism systems. As such, we urge tourism scholars and practitioners to proactively assess the consequences of adopting LLMs in tourism to ensure the sustainability and resilience of tourism systems.",

          "abstract": "U.S. higher education operates as a mechanism of economic control, organized around the dynamics of replacement, credential inflation, and indenture. This paper revisits and updates the 2000 “Indentured Replacement Theory of Credential Inflation” that first argued this case, adding a 2024 lens on endowment capture. A descriptive synthesis of public data series reveals the scale of this control: student-loan balances stand at roughly $1.64 trillion with 90+ day delinquency near 10.2% (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2025); meanwhile, institutional endowments total $873.7 billion\nwith $30 billion in annual spending (NACUBO/Commonfund, 2025). Evidence on “degree reset” is mixed, and post-pause repayment frictions elevate delinquency risk. Policy developments in 2023–2025 increase scrutiny of institutional finances while providing limited direct borrower relief. The paper concludes by proposing structural, cultural, and market-facing remedies, evaluated by a simple test: does a given policy loosen—or tighten—the binding effects of debt on life chances?",

We develop a language-based measure of curveball questions and apply it to a corpus of quarterly earnings calls. After validating this question-level measure, we next demonstrate that a call-level curveball measure predicts absolute returns, absolute abnormal returns, and changes in a firm’s average analyst rating.

To adjudicate between these two perspectives I \nintroduce the use of pseudo items into culture research, and integrate their usage with \nBourdieu’s observations about “competence” and the “right to speak.” I find evidence \nfor a dispositional openness account to claimed cultural knowledge, in addition to a \nknown gender effect that is likely also rooted in dispositions. In closing I discuss how my \nfindings may be suggestive of a new form of allodoxia for elites.

This research aims to bridge the gap by designing a low-cost, scalable sensory room model suitable for public spaces. We included a qualitative interview process with key stakeholders, caregivers of people with NDD, Applied Behavior Analysts, and Title I special education teachers to gain their perspectives and experiences in order to identify barriers to access and determine the components of a sensory room for the proposed model. We created a cost-effective sensory room. Overall, the model has been implemented in multiple diverse environments (community center, public school, pediatric clinic, refugee aid center, etc.). This low-cost model offers the possibility of being adapted as a viable sensory room intervention to improve access to a therapeutic sensory space in areas with scarce resources.",

          "authors": "Juan Mendoza-Collazos",
          "abstract": "This chapter proposes a classification of artifacts based on an agentive approach—that is, on the actions performed by human agents rather than on the artifacts' functions or features. The agentive approach adheres to the thesis that cognition is not reduced to brain functions but is coextensive with the capacity to act. If there is action, then there is cognition, and therefore, meaning emerges from an agent's relationship with its environment (enaction). It is argued that the notion of Enhanced Agency—the incorporation of artifacts to enhance the performance of actions—is a distinctive feature of the human species, and that the ability to design artifacts is distinct from the creation of natural objects by other animals. Therefore, the definition of artifact is limited to an object created by human beings for a specific purpose. Consequently, after critically assessing other proposals, the classification of artifacts is addressed under three criteria: according to the type of incorporation; according to the type of engagement; and according to the type of action performed by the agents. This typology allows us to resolve ambivalent categories such as cognitive/pragmatic and to be consistent with the material and embodied commitment of cognition, which constitutes a contribution to the understanding of the essentially enhanced nature of human agency.",

These results provide the first extensive list of identities ranked by their survivability within individuals’ self-presentations.

Drawing on research that connects political trust to democratic legitimacy, highlights its attitudinal and behavioral consequences, and underscores its contextual character as a form of political support, we hypothesize that political trust exerts a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already reached some level of democracy. We test this hypothesis with cross-lagged models fit to political trust estimates from 62 countries over 30 years, combined with democratic quality scores from the Varieties of Democracy project. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a conditional effect: based on our results, political trust has a positive effect on democracy, but only in countries that have already achieved high quality of democracy.",

          "abstract": "Under the threat window of ‘interception first, decryption later’ in quantum computing, national security and industrial sovereignty face new systemic challenges. This paper proposes a dual-track approach of ‘PQC baseline + QKD enhancement’ to comprehensively compare the standard systems, governance models, and engineering progress of China and the United States in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD). The study employs a three-tier evidence integration framework of ‘policy-standards-engineering,’ combining authoritative documents from NIST, OMB, CISA, and other sources with China's national standard platform and industry announcements. It constructs an analysis model of ‘standard hierarchy-migration ecosystem-international interoperability’ and evaluates the feasibility of the scheme through gap-risk mapping, roadmap design, and KPI matrix assessment. The results show that the United States has established a closed-loop system of ‘primary standards + redundancy’ based on FIPS 203/204/205 and HQC backup algorithms, and has entered an auditable implementation phase driven by mandatory migration and toolchain initiatives from OMB and CISA; China maintains an advantage in QKD engineering and standardisation, but national standards for PQC have not yet been solidified, and the migration governance system lags behind, resulting in a structural shortfall of ‘engineering leading the way while algorithm standards lag behind.’ Based on this, this paper proposes a ‘three-year-five-year-ten-year’ national roadmap: establish a standardised baseline within three years, achieve large-scale migration and verification within five years, and complete consolidation and internationalisation within ten years. This will be supplemented by protocols, PKI/certificates, key lifecycle management, testing and certification, and algorithm switching mechanisms, in conjunction with a five-tier governance structure led by the State Cryptography Administration, with TC260/TC485 as the technical focal points, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology/ the Cyberspace Administration of China/People's Bank of China, operator and critical infrastructure implementation, and research institutes. The conclusion states that PQC must be established as the ‘basic defence line’ in the quantum era, while QKD should serve as the ‘enhanced defence line’ for critical links; China must complete the construction of PQC national standards and migration governance capabilities within a three-year standardisation, five-year consolidation, and ten-year internationalisation timeline, and achieve dual-track integration and international interoperability with the QKD standard suite, thereby safeguarding national security, consolidating industrial resilience, and enhancing international influence.",

Using a mixed-methods approach, including structured surveys and qualitative interviews, we explore how the incentive influenced travel behavior, mode substitution, and public transit connectivity. Results indicate that 69% of participants connected to transit, while 50% of these riders would have otherwise used privately paid rideshare and 6% would have used their private vehicle, and another 6% would have walked or cycled. The remaining 38% of participants would have used transit to reach the public transit station. The study offers critical insights for transit agencies and mobility providers aiming to design integrated AV-transit systems that serve the public good. While there is a risk of misallocating funds to individuals already willing and able to pay for rideshare services, these findings underscore that targeted subsidies can yield meaningful reductions in private vehicle use and promote multimodal travel.",

          "abstract": "Computational text analysis has grown in popularity among social scientists due to the massive influx of digitized data available to study. However, much of this research disconnects patterns observed in text from information about the original authors. Eliding authorship considerations from sociological analysis of text can potentially lead to claims and assertions of trends that are independent from the social actors, conditions, interactions, and contexts which the text was produced. While text analysis without authorship information can yield reasonable inferences about society, complementing that approach with research that explicitly considers the people producing the text could expand the theoretical and empirical scope of work in this area. In this paper, we adapt perspectives from sociolinguistics and explicitly consider categorical identity markers of authors and geography as foundational axes of variation in textual data. We explore these dimensions in a large corpus of college admissions essays (n = 254,820 essays submitted by 83,538 applicants) and metadata about applicant identity, including the ZIP code of their high school. After generating features of the essays using computational methods, we find that author identity markers, such as gender, parental education, and socioeconomic status are highly salient. We also find that ZIP code level socioeconomic measures are extremely correlated with the writing style and content of local applicants. We also find that individuals whose personal identities are spatially unique–that is, demographically different from others in their immediate content–were most likely to be misclassified by our models, indicating that writing is influenced both socially and spatially. This work clarifies how authorship characteristics, like identity and spatial context, constrain the breadth of what we write and how we write by showing strong alignment between text and authors that is observable through machine reading of text.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the archetypal figures of Sköll and Hati, the mythic wolves of Norse cosmology, as embodiments of cosmic shadow, destruction, and renewal within Jungian analytical psychology. Rooted in Viking-era Germanic myth and anchored in Danish cultural artifacts such as the Trundholm Sun Chariot and Nordic winter rituals, the study explores how these wolves symbolize the cyclical tension between psychic dissolution and rebirth. Drawing on primary Jungian concepts alongside contemporary psychoanalytic and mythopoetic scholarship, the analysis positions Sköll and Hati as necessary forces that disrupt egoic sovereignty and reveal the shadow aspect of time and consciousness. The wolves’ pursuit and devouring of the sun and moon reflect psychic upheavals commonly experienced during midlife crises, cultural collapse, and spiritual transformation. The archetypes discussed here do not represent pathology or nihilism but serve as initiatory figures that require surrender to chaos for psychological growth. The integration of Nordic cultural context deepens the understanding of these archetypes and provides a unique contribution to the field of archetypal psychology. This paper encourages clinicians and scholars to consider the paradox of destruction and renewal inherent in the archetypal shadow, thus advancing the discourse on collective and individual processes of transformation.",

          "abstract": "This article critically engages with Johnson et al. (2024), who argue that coercive public health policies require context-specific ethical justification. While Johnson et al. highlight four key principles—harm prevention, public interest, paternalism, and the duty of easy rescue—the present analysis contends that these ethical frameworks are insufficient unless safety, efficacy, proportionality, and necessity of the intervention are established beforehand. Drawing on examples from COVID-19 policies, including social distancing, surveillance measures, and vaccine mandates, the article demonstrates how weak or uncertain empirical evidence undermined ethical justifications for coercion. Cases such as low efficacy against transmission, underappreciated adverse events, and proportionality concerns reveal the dangers of treating empirical validity as an afterthought. The article concludes that coercive public health policies cannot be ethically defensible without robust prior evidence of effectiveness and safety. Ethical reasoning must therefore be grounded in empirical reality, with context-sensitive, localized approaches that ensure transparency, autonomy, and trust.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Contemporary news and opinion dissemination is characterized not by a fixed set of senders\nand receivers, but by networked information flows and active curation by multiple types of\nactors, from professional organizations, politicians and journalists to interest groups, pundits\nand opinionated individuals. Approaches to analyzing news dissemination on social media\nneed to take stock of the broader information sharing environment that news sharing is part of.\nThis study presents a general approach for analyzing large-scale information flows on social\nmedia in a cross-platform context by tracing URLs. Using a selection of alternative news media\noutlets from Germany, Austria, Sweden and Denmark as a starting point for operationalizing\nthe broader news sharing environment that alternative news content is shared within, this study\ntraces URL sharing across Facebook, Twitter (X), Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram,\nVkontakte, Gab and 4Chan in multiple iterations of snowball sampling. A total of ~900 million\nposts are collected, followed by a two-pronged analysis of 1) general cross-platform flows and\nplatform outflow/inflow dynamics and 2) cross-platform characteristics of networks based on\nrepeated mutual URL sharing among actors. Each part of the analysis considers both URLs\nthat simply appear on multiple platforms as well as those that are shared directly from one\nplatform to another.\nResults show that one third of all URLs that appear in more than one post are cross-platform,\nwith 17% being shared directly from one platform to another. Modelling mutual URL sharing\nbehavior as a network shows that only 16 – 24% of the network is strictly single platform.\nAdditional specific platform dynamics are presented and discussed in relation to previous\nfindings on cross-platform content sharing.",

We also define and propose categories of individuals by \nwhom we believe this approach can be meaningfully adopted and implemented, and also lay bare the \npurported objectives of this approach. Last but not the least, we review existing approaches to \ninnovative and creative techniques, and drive home a very crucial and a critical point: the entire field of \ncreative and innovative techniques is apparently in its infancy yet, and more innovative and creative \ntechniques need to be conceptualized and gestated in the years and decades to come including those \nspecific to scientific theorization.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the creation of Anthropological Pedagogy as a distinct field of study within \nthe framework of Anthropology, interfacing traditional Anthropology and Pedagogy with some \npre-defined principles and objectives, chiefly designed to promote Anthropological goals and \nobjectives through the medium of education. This paper proposes to lay the groundwork for \nwhat we believe will be an exciting and promising field, and we hope other researchers, \nscholars, Anthropologists and Pedagogists will take the concepts presented herein to their\nlogical conclusion. This is based on the premise that there can be no quick fixes to complex and \nseemingly intractable issues, but that the ball must be set in motion nonetheless to replace \nsuperannuated axioms. This proposed field of study is distinct from the field of Educational \npsychology which deals with the psychology of learning, is much broader in scope than \n‘Anthropology of Education’, and the relatively less-known field of Pedagogical Anthropology \nwhich was created over a century ago by Maria Montessori and others, even though there may \nbe varying levels of overlap between them. This sub-discipline is proposed to be created with \nthe fond hope that by combining the two crucial disciplines of Anthropology and Pedagogy, a \nnew platform will be created for the wholesome furtherance of human welfare and interests, \nparticularly long-term and global welfare through more scientifically structured education \nsystems, which are designed to merge short-term local considerations with long-term global \nobjectives. This approach includes within its ambit topics such as content fixation for societal \nbenefit, long-term societal benefit, individual benefit and maximum psychological impact. \nNeedless to say, it is integrated with the Theory of Mindspace, the Theory of Mind-orientation, \nSocietal orientation and Cultural remediation. It also deals with the collection and analysis of \nmeaningful metrics, consensus-building and mobilization of international opinion for the \nrealization of the goals, and implementation of the principles of Anthropological Pedagogy.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This paper attempts to merge the concepts and theoretical frameworks of the disciplines of \nAnthropology and Economics, and attempts to create a new sub-field in Economics called \n‘Anthropological Economics’ which is mired in Anthropological concepts and principles and \nseeks to maximize not only human welfare and happiness but also wealth maximization across \ncultures, while considering both the psychic unity of man, universal human needs and culture?specific factors. Thus, Anthropological Economics is expected to be inter-related to other \ndisciplines of Economics, but remain complementary to them i.e., it is not expected that it will \nintrude into other sub-fields of economics, replace them, or override their principles in any \nway. It will therefore draw upon other aspects of economic theory, and enrich them suitably. It \nis therefore expected that all aspects of Economic theory will be taken into consideration for \npolicy formulation and decision-making, including those of Anthropological economics, and \nindependent, context-specific judgment will always be applied. The new proposed field of \nAnthropological Economics proposes to take the idea of Human Welfare to its logical conclusion \nby extending the work already carried out in various sub-disciplines of economics, and \nintegrating it more tightly with various concepts in Anthropology. Many new tools and \ntechniques are therefore, proposed as a part of this paper, and we believe these will suitably \nenrich the field of Economics as well. While many attempts have been made in the past to \nintegrate the fields of Anthropology and Economics, we hope this endeavour will take this \nexercise to a much higher level, by creating a new generation of “Anthroeconomists”. We also \nhope it will eventually help move mainstream economics away from Neo-classical approaches \nto Anthropological and human-centric approaches.",

It attempts to bring all our \nendeavours to their logical culmination and as such may be construed to be our apotheosis in this \nregard. The first paper proposed a basic approach for Historiography in the Twenty-first Century and laid \nout the basic objectives of Twenty-first Century Historiography. The second paper laid out the core \nprinciples of Twenty-first Century Historiography, and these were seen a necessary adjunct for the \naccomplishment of the objectives of Twenty-first Century Historiography as defined in the first paper. In \nthis paper, we introduce Anthropological Historiography as an integral, though not core component of \nTwenty-first Century Historiography and lay down is basic tenets and objectives. We also delineate the \nrole that we expect will be played by Anthropological Historiography in the attainment of long-term \nAnthropological goals and objectives, and in promoting human welfare and well-being in general. \nAnthropological Historiography, with its myriad and multiple interfaces with other sciences is also \nexpected to play a major role in promoting a scientific temper among the laity and the general public \nand trigger shifts in individual and societal orientations in due course by countering popular perceptions \non many issues that impact their daily lives and making outdated and popular paradigms and ideologies\nredundant. We expect that Anthropological Historiography will play a major role in marginalizing fringe \nmovements besides leading to an enhanced understanding of various aspects of science, history and \nethnology among the population and ushering in intellectual movements where such movements are \nlong overdue, and very indirectly leading to a quantum increase in scientific endeavours. We also \nbelieve that Anthropological Historiography should be taught as a specialized sub-discipline chiefly \ntargeted towards higher grade students, or students pursuing advanced courses, and should be pursued \nnot by general historians, but by specialized Anthropological Historians.",

Then, it justifies the film’s main methodological and ideological standpoints by evaluating the process of pre-production, production and distribution. In conclusion, the article highlights the importance of ethnographic film as a counterpoint to market-driven story-telling and as a valuable way of representing underrepresented groups of people.",

          "abstract": "The core objective of this paper is to show why academic Marxism, the intellectual arm of Marxism and Marxist thought has hit an intellectual road block, and is staring at a dead end. Our prognosis is that it is barely likely to survive in its present form for another decade or two. We begin this paper by defining what Marxism is and tracing its thought over the past one and a half centuries or so including varieties and regional variants of Marxism and its common criticisms. The success and failures of Marxism and communism are also likewise probed and investigated. The sphere of influence of Marxism is also probed on fields such as art, architecture, archeology, historiography, religious studies, and cultural studies. We also go on to show why Marxist thought is greatly fossilized and steeped in a mid?nineteenth century mindset, and is unlikely to work in different contexts and situations as it has limited validity and applicability. Many of the failures of mainstream Marxism and Marxist thought also overflow and cascade into academic Marxism too, and it is time to reassess all facets and aspects of Marxism from their bootstraps. We also propose and examine alternative approaches to replace various concepts and components of academic Marxism, and link all our concepts with our previously published papers in a seamless, integrated chain. As such we expect this paper to be an integral component of our globalization movement, and it would not be difficult to understand or figure out why.",

          "abstract": "The presidential election, as the most significant election in the United States, has numerous socio-economic impacts. The real estate market, one of the most closely watched sectors in recent years, has generally shown an upward trend in prices. This paper examines the county-level voting results in two presidential elections which are 2016 and 2020 and the corresponding changes in county housing prices, finding that when a county's presidential election voting results are inconsistent with the final election outcome, the county's housing market is affected, leading to a downward trend in prices.  Additionally, counties with a preference for the Republican Party are more sensitive to fluctuations in the real estate market when they experience electoral defeat. Other factors as races and income status also exhibit heterogeneity in response to policy shocks. This study's analysis of the relationship between presidential elections and the real estate market provides guidance for strategic decision-making in the real estate industry and contributes to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the impact of presidential elections on socio-economic life.",

Rather than treating agents as isolated optimizers within equilibrium-based systems, FORCE embeds them in a fluid field shaped by resistance, influence, and differential access—where capital, policy, and social signals distort the flow of opportunity itself.\n\nBy conceptualizing emergent effort, asymmetrical opportunity, and systemic strain as geometric features of a socioeconomic field, FORCE enables new formulations of economic behavior that account for both agency and structural impedance. Constructs such as economic curvature, opportunity resistance, nexus distortion, and emergence coefficients provide a tensorial language for describing how tension accumulates and resolves across uneven social terrain.",

Previous research focused specifically on online social influencers suggests they may be able to affect group-level diffusion of health-protective behaviours such that they modify epidemic outcomes. The impacts of social influence on behaviour and epidemics depend on whether the disease has a low enough basic reproduction number ($R_0$) that social dynamics have time to diffuse. However, formal models have yet to test the intuitive hypothesis that online social influence is sufficient to generate tangible, real-world effects on epidemics. We develop an agent-based model that incorporates social influencers into an epidemic scenario to test hypotheses about how the presence of competing influence messages affects the diffusion of health-protective behaviours throughout a population, and thereby alter the course and outcome of infectious disease epidemics. We find social influencers had a persistent, independent effect on peak infection intensity and total infection burden of the epidemic, with the greatest effects in highly homophilous scenarios. The presence of health-protective influence effectively flattened the epidemic curve despite equal presence of anti-protective influence.",

They tend to reproduce the categories most prevalent in those data, including reductive framings of public life that equate democracy with choice and procedure rather than shared authorship. Alignment methods such as supervised fine tuning and human feedback can guide behavior after pretraining, yet they begin after the representational substrate is already set. This concept paper proposes an alternative starting point. We outline a Civic LLM that uses an explicit civic ontology during corpus design and fine tuning. The ontology names roles, institutions, practices, and values that thicken democratic life. Our claim is deliberately modest. Curated data that is organized and weighted by a civic schema may produce small but measurable shifts in default framings without degrading general capability. The contribution is twofold. We integrate political theory as a design input, and we show that adjacent literatures in knowledge enhanced language models and concept level steering support a cautious path for evaluation. The aim is to establish a clear, citable origin for the idea and a disciplined agenda for future research.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This paper develops a real options–based framework for modeling the dynamics of political regimes, integrating decision theory with a six-state Markov Decision Process (MDP). Political regimes are treated as strategic decision-makers holding flexible political options—such as repression, reform, policy shift, or exit—whose value evolves with volatility, entropy, and time. The core asset is the regime’s political capital, modeled as a dynamic stock S(t) subject to both gradual diffusion and sudden Poisson jumps representing exogenous shocks (e.g., coups, assassinations, natural death). Option exercise is constrained by an Action Cost Threshold X(t), the political strike price, which evolves over time and determines the cost–benefit feasibility of action.\nThe framework introduces novel visualization and diagnostic tools: Opportunity Landscapes to map option exercise probabilities over volatility and time; Valence of Power heatmaps to measure relative option value; Decision Thresholds under Uncertainty curves linking entropy and action probabilities to reveal points of strategic equivalence; and Volatility Landscapes that integrate volatility, entropy, and probability to assess stability risk. We model the Decay Time Value of Political Capital Stocks and Political Options, quantify the Time Evolution of both S(t) and X(t), and use Cost–Benefit Landscapes to jointly evaluate capital and cost trajectories. The framework also captures coercion dynamics, distinguishing between rational coercion in dysfunctional equilibria and irrational coercion in stable democracies.\nApplied to Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, the model produces empirical simulations of resilience, fragility, and optimal decision timing. In addition to capturing volatility and cost thresholds, the analysis introduces Regime Survivability Probabilities—quantifying the joint likelihood of sustaining or losing power under affordability and hazard constraints—and the Regime Survivability Frontier, which traces the tipping points where survival and failure probabilities converge. Results show how shifting volatility, erosion of political capital, and rising exit hazards shape strategic urgency and force leaders toward difficult trade-offs. The approach offers a predictive and diagnostic tool for political survival analysis, grounded in the theory of real options but adapted to the contingencies of political power.",

Drawing on Jung's concept of the Shadow and Self, Fenrir is explored not as a mere mythic antagonist but as an expression of ego's confrontation with primordial psychic force. The analysis focuses on Danish iconography, including the Jelling stones and burial constraints, to contextualize cultural responses to unbounded power. The paper proposes that Fenrir symbolizes the individuation crisis when ego faces annihilation by the unconscious. Such devouring figures demand not suppression but symbolic integration.

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the vargr-an Old Norse term connoting both \"wolf\" and \"outlaw\"-as a symbol of social exclusion and psychological projection. In early Scandinavian law, the vargr marked those expelled from society through outlawry, a formal ritual that maintained social cohesion. Drawing from Jungian depth psychology, the vargr can be seen as a scapegoat for the community's shadow-the rejected parts of the self, including rage, shame, and transgression. This mirrors René Girard's theory of scapegoating, where societies manage inner tension by casting blame onto an external figure. The wolf's wild and dangerous image reinforced its role as a symbolic container for threat. Norse sagas and Thing-site archaeology support the vargr's cultural and legal significance. In contemporary psychological terms, the vargr archetype illuminates how modern individuals manage exclusion and disowned identity. Understanding this figure highlights enduring patterns of exile, repression, and healing within both ancient and modern contexts.\n\nKeywords: Vargr, Norse mythology, outlawry, Jungian psychology, shadow archetype",

          "abstract": "Corporate risk-taking is a key factor in corporate decision-making, and in recent years, the influence of cultural factors as informal institutions on corporate decisions has attracted widespread attention from scholars. Confucian culture, which upholds core values such as benevolence and righteousness, forgiveness and tolerance, integrity, and loyalty and filial piety, has long permeated various levels of Chinese society. Using non-financial listed firms in China as the sample, this study measures the strength of Confucian cultural influence by the number of Confucian temples within varying distances around each firm and further explores the impact of Confucian culture on corporate risk-taking. The results show that Confucian culture is negatively associated with corporate risk-taking, indicating that in regions where Confucian culture is more deeply rooted, firms tend to exhibit lower levels of risk-taking. This study provides an in-depth empirical analysis of the factors influencing corporate risk-taking and the role of cultural factors, offering important guidance for corporate strategic development and risk management strategies while contributing to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the critical role of cultural factors, such as Confucian culture, in risk-taking decisions.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly used in sociology to generate causal evidence. While the uptake of RCTs in sociology has lagged behind other disciplines, recent growth signals a shift toward what some now call “experimental sociology.” However, the methodological promise of RCTs depends not only on random assignment but also on transparent reporting practices that allow readers to assess internal validity, implementation quality, and the generalizability of findings. In this article, we conduct a systematic scoping review of 91 field experiments published since 2000 in high-ranking sociological journals. Using an adapted version of the CONSORT-SPI checklist, we evaluate reporting accuracy across a range of design and implementation indicators. We find substantial variability and frequent omissions in how sociological RCTs are reported, with implications for replicability and the cumulative advancement of causal knowledge. Our findings suggest that sociologists have yet to fully adopt reporting standards developed in other disciplines, and that greater attention to documentation could strengthen the credibility and utility of experimental evidence. We offer concrete recommendations for researchers, reviewers, and journal editors to improve transparency and comparability in sociological field experiments.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the political polarization of public trust in science across Europe, distinguishing impact science, which addresses negative consequences of industrial activity and policy, from production science, which supports industrial development. Left-leaning Europeans trust impact science, while right-leaning ones favor production science. Education and closeness to a particular political party amplify ideological differences in impact science trust, reflecting motivated reasoning and partisanship. Exploratory path analysis suggests partisanship exerts a stronger effect than reasoning. These findings imply that skepticism is not a matter of ignorance but of political commitment, highlighting the challenge for science communication in politically polarized contexts.",

          "abstract": "Defining rurality is a persistent challenge in rural geography and spatial demography, where threshold-based classifications often obscure the heterogeneity of the rural-urban spectrum. The Index of Relative Rurality (IRR), a continuous and multi-dimensional measure, offers a theoretically-informed alternative. This study explores the areas of agreement and divergence between the 2020 IRR and the 2023 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) and investigates the methodological sources of these differences.\nOrdered logistic regression models confirm a significant, moderate association, with the IRR explaining approximately 21% of the variance in RUCC classifications. A subsequent analysis of the model's residuals reveals that this divergence is systematic: a county's spatial remoteness is a powerful and statistically significant predictor of the disagreement between the two measures. A structural examination further confirms the high inter-correlation between the proxy variables for the IRR's four components. The findings demonstrate that the IRR's primary value lies not in replicating official classifications, but in providing a distinct, spatially-informed perspective on rurality, making it a valuable complementary tool for nuanced research.",

Existing research highlights the benefits of race-matched instruction but often focuses on aggregate workforce diversity, obscuring students' structural opportunities for contact. We introduce race-match sufficiency—the probability that a student has at least one same-race teacher—and estimate it using administrative data from 8,691 Texas public schools serving 5.4 million students. We model sufficiency for Black, Hispanic, and white students as a function of racial composition, enrollment, grade structure, district context, and more. Same-race student concentration is the strongest predictor, with steep nonlinear effects varying by race. Secondary grade levels and larger enrollment increase exposure opportunities, but benefits remain profoundly unequal. White students experience near-universal sufficiency, Black students gain moderate access, and Hispanic students remain severely underexposed—even where they constitute over 70% of enrollment. Findings reveal systematic inequities and may support exposure-based staffing strategies.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To assess whether environmental concern is associated with fertility expectations and behaviours across the reproductive life course.\nBackground: Whether individuals consider climate change in their reproductive decisions is an emerging area of research. Prior studies have largely examined stated intentions or the influence of extreme weather events, leaving open questions about actual fertility behaviour in relation to environmental concern.\nMethod: Using individual-level panel data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), we followed 11,951 women and 8,117 men from 2009 to 2022. We first use linear probability models and regress fertility expectations and parenthood status on the environmentalism index as measured in the first wave. We then estimate Growth Curve models to model the transition to parenthood across the life course for men and women who report different levels of environmentalism at the first wave.\nResults: Environmentalism is associated with slightly lower fertility expectations among younger adults, particularly those in their mid-20s to early 30s. Notably, the negative association is stronger when it comes to actual parenthood status. Women aged 25 to 40 with high environmentalism scores are significantly less likely to have children. Growth curve analyses reveal that the fertility gap between high and low environmentalism groups widens between ages 25 and 35, but narrows again by age 42.\nConclusion: Our results suggest that the link between environmentalism and fertility behaviours may not necessarily be driven by deliberate decision to forgo parenthood but rather, by postponement.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The aim of the study is to explore the contribution of childlessness to changes in English cohort fertility over time and in relation to that in other European countries. The study found that during important historical periods of change in English completed fertility a change in childlessness played a very important role: contributing 56% of the large rise in fertility (of 0.42 children per woman) between the 1920 and 1934 cohorts and 44% of the large fall (0.44) between the 1934 and 1960 cohorts.  But for more recent cohorts (born since 1960) changes in childlessness played a varying but usually minor role in accounting for changes in English cohort fertility compared with other countries. The paper shows that there are, however, countries in which a rise in childlessness has made large contributions to a large decline in their cohort fertility since the 1960 cohort (e.g. Japan, Spain and Poland).  Also, high current levels of childlessness in these countries are an important reason why their cohort fertility is so low compared to England and some other countries of Northern and Western Europe (e.g. Sweden, France and the Netherlands).  Based on information on fertility intentions and historical experience it is argued that that changes in childlessness were mainly the result of an accumulation of usually unpredictable period influences on fertility.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative textual analysis explores the journalistic coverage of the deaths of eight British High Commissioners of Palestine between 1920 and 1948. The study draws on content from 282 volumes of 12 Jewish-Hebrew newspapers published in Mandatory Palestine during that period, including Haaretz, HaBoker, Doar Hayom, Davar, Hazit HaAm, Herut, Hayarden, LaMerhav, Maariv, Hamashkif, Al Hamishmar, Hatzofe, and Kol HaAm.\nThe newspapers’ portrayals of the High Commissioners in the week following their deaths were shaped primarily by the commissioners’ perceived attitudes toward the Jewish community in Palestine and their positions on Zionism. Commissioners regarded as sympathetic or neutral toward the establishment of a Jewish national home—as articulated in the 1917 Balfour Declaration—such as Herbert Samuel, Herbert Plumer, John Vereker-Gort, and Arthur Wauchope, were commemorated with warmth and respect, with only minimal to moderate criticism. By contrast, those seen as anti-Zionist and/or aligned with Arab interests, most notably Harold MacMichael, were subject to markedly critical, hostile, and often dismissive coverage.",

This line of inquiry occurs in 617 volumes of 29 different Jewish-Hebraic newspapers published in Ottoman Palestine, British mandatory Palestine, Eastern Europe, northern Africa or United States since Benjamin Harrison died in 1901 until Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) passed away in 1945.\nExcept for Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge, the Hebraic press covered these death cases comprehensively and rather admirably. Doing so, it dedicated front pages, editorials, columns, telegrams, photographs and obituaries to the POTUS, while maintaining a somber and respectful tone and displaying an admiring narrative towards the presidents in particular and the United States (US) in general. In addition, the Hebraic newspapers presented the POTUS as global political agents who are supportive of the Jewish people, the Zionist movement and the idea of building a Jewish national home based on The Balfour Declaration in 1917 – to a certain degree. Notwithstanding, some newspapers offered mild criticism while addressing US domestic issues, as well as the POTUS's foreign policy, Jewish relations and Zionist support (or non-support).",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "In the ongoing energetic transition to renewable energy sources (RES), increasing attention is paid to modes of energy storage. Modes of energy extraction and storage have historically played a pivotal role in the development of global capitalism. The shift from RES to fossil fuels in the 19th century caused a significant change in the relations between workers and capital. Since then, fossil fuels have been utilized as a dominant source of energy, reproducing specific abstract space and time that allowed capitalism to expand. However, this mode of energy has reached a limit and therefore, new ways of extracting, distributing, and consuming energy are sought. Due to the intermittent character of energy from RES increasing focus is oriented towards energy storage and its coordination via the information technologies. One of the predominant technologies for energy storage is apparently the battery. This paper analyzes the dynamics of energy valuation practices mediated by different types of batteries while it explores the battery as an information processing device rather than an energy source. The analysis focuses on three case studies of battery - the virtual battery, Bitcoin-as-battery, and Lithium-ion battery - while each case study focuses on a different aspect of the valuation process. Based on the case studies, three modalities of energy from RES are identified: account, waste, and stock. The virtual battery operates as an accounting device recording outputs and inputs of energy. It allows the semblance of delayed consumption. On the other hand, Bitcoin-as-battery transforms excess waste energy into a unique digital object with high liquidity on international markets. Lithium-ion battery allows energy from renewable sources to be stored and marketized in the form of stock. These modalities are a product of the valuation process, which aims to abstract the intermittent energy produced by RES and transform it into a commodified object.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This study examined the influence of leader empowerment behavior on the performance of state agencies in Kenya, with board composition evaluated as a moderating variable. The research was motivated by persistent underperformance and ethical challenges within Kenyan state agencies, often attributed to weak leadership and governance failures. Guided by theories including Ethical Leadership, Institutional Theory, Kohlberg’s Moral Development, and Social Learning Theory, the study employed a mixed-methods approach and a census sampling strategy targeting senior managers and board members of 135 state agencies. Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires and analyzed through both descriptive and inferential statistics, including correlation and moderated regression analysis. The results revealed that leader empowerment behaviors—such as power-sharing, team building, and capacity development positively and significantly influenced agency performance. Furthermore, board composition, defined by factors such as expertise, gender parity, and independence, was found to significantly moderate the relationship between empowerment behavior and agency performance. The analysis confirmed that effective empowerment practices, when complemented by well-structured and diverse boards, fostered organizational accountability, service quality, and policy implementation. Despite these positive outcomes, challenges such as political interference and lack of merit-based appointments remained significant barriers to the realisation of effective ethical leadership.The study concluded that promoting empowerment behaviours and strengthening board governance were vital to enhancing the operational efficiency of state agencies. Recommendations included implementing structured empowerment programs, fostering team-oriented cultures, improving board diversity, and reducing political influence in leadership appointments. Future research was recommended to explore the long-term impacts of empowerment strategies, the integration of digital tools in leadership, and the interaction between board dynamics and technological innovation in the public sector.",

Since the adoption of devolution in the 2010 Kenyan Constitution, healthcare functions have shifted from national to county governments, creating both opportunities and challenges. This study aimed to explore the extent to which devolved human resources for health affected service delivery in Kenya's county government hospitals. It sought to identify healthcare human resources for health challenges, evaluate the role of intergovernmental leadership, and propose strategies to enhance efficiency and service quality. The study employed a positivist research philosophy and mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) research design, analyzing data from 385 respondents across 137 county hospitals using SPSS version 27. The findings show that devolved human resources for health positively and significantly influenced service delivery. The moderating variable, intergovernmental leadership further strengthened this influence. The study concludes that devolved human resources for health influences service delivery. The study recommends that for service delivery to improve there is need for reform, as far as devolved human resources for health is concerned, as well as the need to enhance intergovernmental leadership. The study recommends the need for adequate staffing for both medical and non- medical staff, adhering to the organisation's staff establishment and that the employees be compensated commensurate with the services they render.",
