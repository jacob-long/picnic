          "authors": "Victor Guirado",
          "abstract": "The objective of this study review is to identify methodological biases in publicly available virological studies, motivated by a review and examination of early SARS-CoV-2. \nA narrative critical review of virology literature (1930-2024) has been conducted. Literature was identified through targeted keyword searches in PubMed, Scopus, Web o Science, and Google Scholar, refined by AI-assisted tools to detect recurring patterns. Studies were included if they addressed viral isolation, genome sequencing and infectivity testing. \nAfter exhaustive search and review, three recurrent methodological weaknesses were identified: Isolation frequently equated with indirect detection of genetic material rather than rigorous purification by density gradients of viral particles; Sequencing reliant on computational assemblies and references genomes, with no direct sequencing from purified particles by gradients of density; Infectivity inferred from cytopathic effects or modelling, with insufficient or incomplete negative controls. The review of the virological studies from 1930 to 2024 illustrate that these weaknesses are systematic. Contemporary virology often relies on indirect evidence. The current viral model has not been empirically verified. Thus, more rigorous isolation, sequencing from purified particles, exhaustive negative controls, and independent replication are essential to restore scientific robustness.",

          "authors": "Leonardo Ventura",
          "abstract": "In epidemiology, standardization is an essential tool when comparing mortality between populations\nwith different age structures. Using Italy, one of the oldest countries in the European Union, and the\nEU-27 aggregate as a case study, this methodological note demonstrates how comparisons between\ncrude mortality rates can give misleading interpretations of disease burden. While crude rates\nsuggested a higher mortality in Italy (≈280 per 100 000) compared to the EU-27 (≈259 per 100\n000), standardized rates showed the reverse pattern (≈224 vs ≈239 per 100 000). A Kitagawa\ndecomposition confirmed that the excess in crude mortality rates for Italy is almost entirely\nexplained by the effect of age structure rather than true etiological factors.\nThis methodological note illustrates the necessity of proper standardization in cancer epidemiology.\nAll the instructions to download the official datasets and the Python scripts for the analysis are\nopenly available on Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.17251977), offering both an educational example\nand a methodological reference for standardization to support students, policymakers, and\nresearchers in applying these techniques.",

          "authors": "Wanpeng Tan",
          "abstract": "This article analyzes the deep, systemic flaws within the current sociological structures in basic research. From peer review and publication culture to funding allocation and the tenure system, we reveal a structural crisis defined by broken feedback loops, perverse incentives, and the rise of academic monopolies. We argue that incremental fixes are insufficient and that a complete reform is now warranted. To this end, we present the vision for a novel Community-driven Open Research Ecosystem (CORE), a new paradigm or constitution for the entire community guided by the overarching Diversity Principle. The CORE is a dynamic, balanced, and self-regulating ecosystem designed to promote meritocracy and diversity, offering equal opportunity to all members while simultaneously applying monopoly-breaking measures against the top and securing a safety net for the bottom. By thoughtfully navigating its implementation challenges, a CORE can ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency via its dual evaluation system in knowledge dissemination, resource allocation, and career advancement, creating the conditions for a new era of innovation in basic research.",

          "title": "An Emmanuel Levinas Critique of Social Science Research Practice",
          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Historically, academic research has been structured around the supremacy of methodology. Neutrality, replicability, and objectivity are generally regarded as the fundamental principles of scholarly legitimacy, whereas ethics is considered a secondary issue, typically managed through institutional review processes or compliance mechanisms. This order suggests that research can be planned, carried out, and defended mostly through strict methods, with ethical reflection added later as a form of regulation. Nevertheless, this configuration jeopardises the reduction of ethics to mere procedure and participants to mere subjects of examination. This article critiques the method-first paradigm through Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy, especially his assertion that ethics constitutes “first philosophy.” Levinas posits that responsibility to the Other precedes ontology, cognition, and categorisation. The face of the Other presents the researcher with an inescapable demand that cannot be mitigated by objectivity or methodological detachment. From this perspective, the traditional subject–object relationship central to research practice is undermined: participants are not mere data to be handled but individuals whose distinctiveness by necessity demands accountability. Consequently, ethics cannot be perceived merely as a procedural adjunct to methodology; rather, it constitutes the foundational basis from which scholarly inquiry must emerge. Methodologically, the article integrates a critical conceptual analysis of Levinas’s writings with a normative critique of current research practices. This method allows the argument to transition from mere scholarly commentary to a prescriptive assertion: research should be reconceptualised as an ethical engagement rooted in accountability for the Other, rather than as a dispassionate process of knowledge creation. The conclusion suggests that an ethics-first approach, defined by humility, attentiveness, and responsiveness, provides a foundational reorientation of scholarship. In this recontextualization, ethics is not an external limitation but the foundational condition of academic inquiry itself.",

          "abstract": "Objectives\nCalls to compensate patient partners for contributions to the health sector are increasing. The BMJ invites patients and the public (P&amp;P) to review manuscripts alongside academic reviewers and recently introduced remuneration. We surveyed P&amp;P reviewers to capture perspectives on remuneration and overall reviewing experience.\n\nDesign/setting\nTwo cross-sectional surveys administered via SurveyMonkey. \n\nParticipants\nSurvey 1 targeted P&amp;P reviewers who had completed a review in the past 3 years; Survey 2 included those invited to review but who had not completed a review within that period. \n\nResults\nSurvey 1 received 183/267 (69%) responses; Survey 2 received 100/493 (20%) responses. Most respondents were based in the UK or US. Overall, 71% (202/283) rated their review experience as “very good” or “good.” Half (51%, 143/283) said a £50 payment would make them more likely to review (48% Survey 1, 56% Survey 2). One-third (32%, 91/283) said a subscription to a selection of BMJ journals would make them more likely to review (32% Survey 1, 33% Survey 2). However, 29% (82/283) said £50 would not influence them (33% Survey 1, 22% Survey 2) and 40% (114/283) said the same about a subscription (39% Survey 1, 43% Survey 2). . Views on remuneration varied - some saw it as recognition of value, others viewed it as unnecessary, and some felt it was inadequate compensation. While 59% (166/283) had no concerns about introducing payment; 18% (52) had concerns, and 17% (49) were unsure. Concerns included potentially changing reviewers’ motivations and the quality of reviews, administrative burden and tax implications, impact on income received from benefits, and a need to evaluate the initiative. Respondents emphasised the importance of offering optional incentives to accommodate individual preferences.\n\nConclusions \nThe BMJ’s P&amp;P reviewers hold diverse views on remuneration. Flexible, optional incentives may help support broader engagement while respecting individual needs and values.",

          "authors": "Gabriela Dârzan",
          "abstract": "Modern health and social science research faces well-documented challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and practical feasibility. A significant proportion of studies cannot be replicated, and incomplete reporting leads to wasted resources. Equally, many promising interventions fail to translate into practice due to unrecognized feasibility obstacles in planning and implementation. This article introduces S-FIPR (Software for Feasibility and Integrity of Research Projects), which is an integrated digital platform designed to improve research project rigor, transparency, and viability from inception to dissemination. We outline the background reproducibility and feasibility gaps that motivate the development of S-FIPR, then describe the platform’s concept, including its user roles, workflows, and core functional blocks. A central innovation is the Feasibility Index (F-Index), a composite score assessing proposals across multiple domains with full auditability and explainability. We detail S-FIPR’s approach to responsible AI governance, such as model cards and bias mitigation, ensuring AI features remain transparent and advisory. The platform’s alignment with international standards - CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, FAIR data principles, and GDPR - is mapped, underscoring compliance with best practices in reporting, data management, and privacy. An evaluation plan is presented, leveraging usability scales and technology acceptance frameworks (TAM/UTAUT) to assess user experience and key adoption metrics. We discuss ethical and legal considerations, including research ethics oversight and data protection. Finally, we address current limitations and outline a roadmap from a minimum viable product (MVP) through pilot studies to broader scale-up. By embedding evidence-based safeguards and guidance into the research lifecycle, S-FIPR aims to bolster the integrity and feasibility of health research projects in the digital era. \nKeywords: Research integrity, Feasibility, Reproducibility, Digital platform, F-Index, AI governance, CONSORT, FAIR data, Usability, Health research",

          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer",
          "abstract": "The importance of open research information, particularly publication metadata, is widely recognised. Crossref is one of the most important infrastructures for registering open metadata as part of DOI record registration. It is widely known, however, that the metadata of many publications is far from complete, with many publishers making certain metadata openly available, but failing to do so for other metadata elements. \n\nOf course, publishers' ability to register this metadata with Crossref depends on their capacity to capture and retain this data in their production workflows. Manuscript submission systems are an important, yet largely overlooked, factor in the extent to which publishers make metadata available through Crossref. \n\nIn this paper, we present the results of an analysis investigating the correlation between the level of metadata that publishers deposit with Crossref and the submission systems that they deploy for their journals. We have looked at the 153 publishers with the largest amounts of publications in Crossref and concentrate on the four most commonly used systems: Editorial Manager, ScholarOne, Open Journal Systems (OJS) and eJournalPress. \n\nWe show that some submission systems appear better suited to capturing certain metadata elements. However, there are always cases where publishers using the same system differ widely in the level of metadata they register, suggesting that technology is not the only prohibiting factor and other considerations are at play.",

          "authors": "Christina Dimitriadou; Nicholas Furl",
          "abstract": "Optimal stopping problems provide a framework for studying decision-making under uncertainty, balancing the trade-off between information sampling and decision commitment. We investigated deviations from normative strategies in human decision-making and examined the neural mechanisms underlying decision commitment versus sampling using electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants viewed sequences of beads drawn from fictitious urns and attempted to infer the majority bead colour in each urn, while their EEG activity was recorded. After viewing each bead, participants could choose to sample more by drawing another bead (draw choice) or to stop sampling and infer the contents of the urn (urn choice). A Bayesian ideal observer model and parametrised models were used to predict participant behaviour. Participants undersampled relative to the ideal observer, particularly in the more uncertain condition where the proportion of bead colours was close to chance (60/40 or 0.6), with the model better capturing behaviour in the easier 80/20 (0.8) condition. P300 amplitudes showed larger responses for urn choices and a gradient of increasing amplitude as draws approached commitment. Larger frontal ERP responses were also observed under higher uncertainty (0.6 condition). Beta oscillatory activity was stronger for urn choices in the high uncertainty condition, with fast beta (20–30 Hz) activity driving final commitment to a decision. Beta power was further predicted by model-derived action values. By integrating behavioural, computational, and neurophysiological data, this study advances our understanding of active information sampling versus decision commitment in reward-related probabilistic environments.",

          "abstract": "Mental imagery-based simulations of threat can evoke “as-if-real” emotional and motivational responses, which may alter top-down pain processing. This study investigated the impact of mental imagery simulations of threat on endogenous pain modulation in n = 71 healthy participants using a cuff-pressure algometry protocol. In block one, participants were assessed on their baseline pain detection threshold (PDT), pressure pain tolerance (PTT), and their conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses. In the second block, participants underwent the same procedures again but were randomly allocated to imagine the dominant leg cuff as being made of bubble wrap (benign imagery condition; n = 36) or metal wire (threat imagery condition; n = 35). In between blocks, participants went to a separate room to interact with a piece of real bubble wrap or metal wire around their legs, facilitating mental imagery generation in Block 2. Partially consistent with our hypothesis, mental imagery impacted CPM effects for pain detection threshold (PDT), which was significantly reduced in the Wire relative to the Bubble-wrap condition. Mental imagery did not influence pressure pain tolerance (PPT).  These results indicate that mental simulation of threat impaired threshold-based CPM responses. Our data suggest that mental simulation of threat may contribute to dysfunctional central pain processing which may be relevant to the maintenance of clinical pain conditions.",

          "abstract": "The Reward Positivity (RewP) is an electroencephalographic feature that emerges following performance feedback and is commonly understood to index both positive and negative reward prediction error (RPE) signals. Contrary to this dominant perspective, we argue that the RewP is an independent EEG feature that selectively responds to positive RPE and is superimposed over a common background signal. We further propose that the RewP signals a goal-prediction error: it is elicited by abstract signals instead of hedonic “rewards”.   This goal prediction error appears to be produced by a critic-like architecture associated with the actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning. This perspective emphasizes the role of the RewP in goal attainment and cognitive control, as opposed to a simple indicator of reward receipt.",

The Bayes factor test allows researchers to take into account prior knowledge, to discriminate between ‘absence of evidence’ and ‘evidence of absence’, and to monitor evidence as the data accumulate.",

          "abstract": "As students progress through school, they are expected to increasingly regulate their attention, behaviour and learning. While some meet these demands with ease, others face ongoing challenges that can hinder their academic success. Research has identified four key concepts in this area: executive functions (EF), metacognition (MC), self-regulation (SR) and self-regulated learning (SRL). Although these constructs are conceptually related, they have often been examined in isolation due to disciplinary and methodological divides, resulting in fragmented accounts that obscure their dynamic interplay. This review addresses this issue by providing a comparative overview of EF, MC, SR and SRL in terms of their definitions, how they are operationalised and the research designs used. Based on this synthesis, we introduce the EMERGE model of learning, which positions these constructs along a continuum ranging from more biologically grounded mechanics (e.g. EF) to more culturally shaped pragmatics (e.g. strategy knowledge in SRL). The model highlights both shared mechanisms and distinct functions and conceptualises SR in learning situations as an integrative construct. Building on this framework, we propose two guiding hypotheses: the stage-setting hypothesis, which emphasises long-term developmental interplay; and the compensatory hypothesis, which focuses on short-term interactions that predict learning outcomes. Together, these perspectives highlight the need for longitudinal, experimental and hybrid designs to capture developmental and dynamic processes. The EMERGE model thus aims to bridge fragmented research traditions, improve diagnostics, and inform interventions that effectively support students in meeting the growing demands of self-regulated and adaptive learning.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nBackground and Aims: Cannabis cue-reactivity paradigms are instrumental to study the behavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms of cannabis use and cannabis use disorders. However, image sets used for cannabis cue-reactivity paradigms vary between studies, and the lack of reliability and validity assessment hinders the quality of evidence they generate. The aim of this study was to create a novel, open access, standardized, and internationally representative database of cannabis use-related images including control images matched by resolution, luminosity, and complexity: The Cannabis Research Image Database (CRESIDA). We also examined the potential impact of cannabis use severity, image type, and cannabis-tobacco co-use on craving. Design: An online survey was administered to participants recruited via online platforms, community advertisement, and snowballing. Setting: USA, the Netherlands, and Australia. Participants/Cases: 689 participants who consumed cannabis monthly-to-daily (385 men, 298 women, 6 other) were recruited between January 2022 and May 2024. Measurements: Out of 93 cannabis images and 93 matched neutral images, participants each rated 31 image pairs for cannabis craving (the primary outcome), arousal, valence, and tobacco craving. Participants were characterized for socio-demographic data, level of cannabis use and related problems, and mixing cannabis and tobacco. A subset of 78 images was selected for further analysis based on cannabis craving results. Image ratings were evaluated for internal consistency (). Furthermore, we examined the association between cannabis cravings and cannabis use characteristics, and explored if cannabis craving ratings were affected by image type (i.e., product, paraphernalia, and actions), and by using cannabis alone vs. mixing cannabis and tobacco.  Findings. The database showed excellent reliability ( = .995-.965). Cannabis craving, valence, and arousal discriminated cannabis and control images. More cannabis use days (β = 0.162, p &lt; 0.001) and cannabis-related problems (β = 0.268, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with higher image-related cannabis craving. Mixing cannabis with tobacco, compared to using cannabis alone, was associated with the presence of tobacco craving in relation to cannabis images, and with greater cannabis craving in relation to cannabis images (β = -0.457, p &lt; 0.001).  Conclusions: Images part of the open access CRESIDA are reliable and valid for the scientific study of cue-reactivity internationally, providing a broad range of free to use cannabis and control images internationally.",

          "abstract": "The urge to dance is universal. From the moment we are born, we bounce, sway, or clap along when we hear a beat. Beyond the inherent infectiousness of rhythm translating into groove, and the pleasure such movement evokes, dance movements are a vehicle for conveying and for understanding gestural expressions of emotions across the lifespan. Furthermore, research documents how people derive aesthetic pleasure from both watching and performing dance. However, the ontogenetic development of the aesthetic appreciation of dance remains largely unexplored. Most empirical work in the developmental domain has used dance movements to explore the development of general emotional expressivity and understanding. Since aesthetic emotions are not disparate from everyday emotions, the research exploring those relationships between dance behaviors and emotional and social development can be considered a stepping-stone for first insights into the development of the aesthetic experience of dance in childhood. In this chapter, we present an overview of research exploring expressive dance movements with children, and discuss how such approaches can be adapted to investigate the ontogeny of dance-related aesthetic experiences. We further provide an overview of methods and open research questions for a developmental empirical framework of dance aesthetics.",

          "abstract": "Gait impairments following stroke are prevalent and persistent, often affecting walking ability, body perception, and quality of life. Movement sonification—mapping body motion to sound—has shown promise for modulating sensorimotor function. This multiple-case experimental study investigated the effects of movement sonification using metaphorical sound on gait, body perception, and emotional state in three individuals with chronic stroke. Using an ABAC design, participants walked with real-time auditory feedback delivered via an interactive walking-interface system (SoniBand) across four conditions: baseline, “Wind” sound, return to baseline, and “Mechanical” sound, presented in a counterbalanced order. Gait parameters (symmetry, step frequency, velocity, and acceleration) were assessed alongside self-reported body perception and emotional state. Exposure to the “Wind” sound condition led to consistent improvements in walking velocity and symmetry, as well as enhanced perceptions of body lightness, speed, flexibility, and physical capability. Accelerometer data indicated carry-over effects from the sound condition in gait symmetry and step regularity. These findings support the potential of metaphorical sound sonification to influence internal models of movement and facilitate sensorimotor adaptation in stroke survivors. This study underscores the malleability of body perceptions through auditory feedback and highlights the value of personalized, perceptually grounded interventions in neurorehabilitation.",

Yet, it remains unclear whether the control processes implemented when reducing cross-language interference are similar to those when reducing within-language interference. Since prior research has shown contradictory results, we set out to investigate this issue further based on a combination of language switch costs, as a measure of control processes resolving cross-language interference, and Stroop incongruency, as a measure of control processes resolving within-language interference. Relying on a range of statistical techniques, the results across three experiments, including a replication of Experiment 1 of Liu et al. (2019), testing three different groups of bilinguals (i.e., Dutch-English, Arabic-English, and Chinese-English) showed no clear interaction between language switch costs and Stroop incongruency, and neither was this pattern influenced by language dominance.

          "authors": "Norbert Vanek",
          "abstract": "Research on language and olfaction presents a paradox. Language appears to support the formation of odor categories, yet it can also hinder odor recognition through verbal interference, highlighting that different olfactory processes get affected in distinct ways. The question, then, is not about whether language and odor processing in humans are inevitably linked, but about understanding the circumstances under which language either promotes or hinders olfactory processing, particularly in the domains of odor categorization and memory. To unmask the nature of this delicate balance, this article reviews empirical studies that point to a verbal enhancement of forming new odor categories and contextualizes it alongside experimental outcomes showing how odor memories can get verbally skewed. Findings from both angles are nested within prominent theories including attribute differentiation, dual coding, ad hoc cognition and attentional tuning. The research reviewed here sits at the crossroads of language and olfaction. It offers fresh insights into how language scaffolds the organization of the mind, and it also outlines promising directions for future research. The main aim is to bring together two contrasting strands of research to investigate how language both facilitates and disrupts olfactory processing. The designs of studies in this article were inspired by Asifa Majid’s outstanding contributions to cognitive science and honor her dedication to community building, particularly in exploring how diverse linguistic and cultural contexts affect olfactory cognition.",

We investigated potential mechanisms underlying this effect, examining the role of autobiographical memory and cognitive functioning. 120 individuals aged 20-91 were assessed on subjective time perception for the preceding decade and year, the quantity and significance of autobiographical memories from those periods, and overall cognitive status. Results confirmed the specific age-related increase in perceived temporal acceleration over the past decade. However, no significant association was found between perceived time passage over the past decade and either the number or subjective value of memories. Contrary to assumptions, older adults reported more vivid and meaningful recollections. Instead, reduced cognitive functioning, and specifically lower ability to form new memories as assessed through delayed memory recall, emerged as a significant mediator of accelerated time perception with age. Findings suggest that age-related cognitive decline leading to reduced ability to encode novel memories, rather than diminished autobiographical memory content, is a critical factor in the subjective experience of time compression in older adults.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Buttlar; Lena Hahn; Monique Chambon",
          "abstract": "Food preparation plays a key role in shaping how people perceive meat: It helps people to dissociate meat from its animal origin and allows them to eat meat without experiencing conflict. However, experimental research in this area mostly disregards or confounds two food preparation steps: disassembling and cooking. To test how disassembling and cooking affect perceptions about meat dishes, we conducted secondary analyses of a sample of omnivores from a U.S.-representative dataset (N = 1,189). In this study, participants indicated meat perceptions (self-report) in response to a picture of one meat dish that varied in the degree of disassembling (i.e., whole parts vs. chopped/minced) and cooking (i.e., raw vs. cooked). Leveraging this experimental setup, multi-level analyses revealed that disassembling and cooking reduced compassion elicited by meat dishes. Disassembling also decreased general emotional arousal, while cooking reduced negative evaluations, conflict experiences in felt ambivalence, and specific negative emotions such as disgust and anger, while increasing valence perceptions more generally and the desire to eat the dish. Moreover, psychological network analyses showed that the relations of meat-related perceptions with each other do not differ significantly between food preparation steps. By offering nuanced insights into how food preparation affects conflict experiences as well as other affective and attitudinal meat-related perceptions, this research offers various theoretical and practical implications. We therefore discuss key considerations for future research on meat-related perceptions and identify when and which interventions may be most necessary and effective in encouraging reduced meat consumption.",

Despite its pervasive influence on decision-making and mental health, it remains unknown whether global confidence is formed through similar or distinct processes across cognitive domains. Here we employ a novel gamified approach to compare how global confidence is formed in the domains of memory and perception. In memory, we found that both local accuracy and confidence contributed to global confidence, whereas in perception, global confidence was predicted by local confidence alone. By comparing the formation of global confidence across domains, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underpinning self-evaluation, paving the way for the development of metacognitive interventions in education and psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Spatial cognition refers to how people transform physical spatial information into mental representations and manipulate it to do further spatial computation and reasoning. Previous research has demonstrated that frames of reference (FORs) in the physical space could distort the spatial representations to influence memory of spatial relations. However, it remains unclear whether FORs could also influence attentional allocation among the spatial representations. To addressed this issue, we examined the attentional shifting within or between different spatial regions, which were affected by the same versus different FORs. In Experiment 1, a modified double-rectangle cuing paradigm was adopted. Two human figures in complementary colors were presented to establish two object-centered spatial FORs, which divided the external space of objects into a central region (influenced by two FORs) and two outer-side regions (primarily influenced by a single FOR). Cues and targets were presented in the same region or different regions. Results showed faster attentional shifting within the same region than between different regions. In Experiment 2, one human figure was replaced as a cross, and the within-region advantage was replicated. Overall, these findings suggest that object-centered FORs could be employed to collectively organize space and shape attentional allocation in objects’ external space.",

          "abstract": "Emotions can greatly influence cognitive processes, such as reading. However, recent studies on the interaction between emotions and reading comprehension provide a murky picture with contradictory claims. Here, we offer one explanation for this phenomenon, that is, the influence of emotion is dependent on different attention goals during reading comprehension. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated question types that were presented to participants prior to reading to evoke different attentional goals. By utilizing an advanced eye movement analysis method Eye Movement with Hidden Markov Models (EMHMM) with co-clustering, we discovered two representative attention patterns from eye fixations: an expanded, globalized attention pattern and a more focused, localized attention pattern. The subsequent analysis showed that globalized pattern led to better comprehension accuracy for summative questions, and localized pattern facilitated detailed question answering. Moreover, negative emotion induces more localized attention for detailed questions only, which could further explain its facilitation effect in detailed question answering. Our findings suggest that the impact of emotions on reading comprehension is shaped by the attention goal of the task. This suggests that emotion appears to guide attention in ways that either support or hinder comprehension depending on what the higher-level goal is.",

We developed and validated the Spiritual Food Contagion Scale (SFCS) across a series of studies with a total sample of over 1,600 participants. Studies 1A-B (N = 100) generated an initial item pool through literature review and target audience evaluation. Study 2 (N = 398) employed exploratory factor analysis, revealing a robust two-factor structure: \\textit{essence transmission} (8 items) and \\textit{moral contamination} (7 items). Study 3 ($N$ = 504) confirmed this structure through confirmatory factor analysis and established convergent validity with related constructs. Study 4A (N = 351) demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability and predictive validity through experimental scenarios. Participants completed treatment preference ratings for flu illness and health optimization contexts across evidence-based, wellness, alternative, and pseudoscientific approaches. Higher SFCS scores were positively associated with a stronger preference for treatments in general, with particularly pronounced effects for pseudoscientific interventions. Study 4B ($N$ = 280) examined actual past usage of alternative medicine practices. Here, the SFCS significantly predicted alternative medicine usage, demonstrating that spiritual food contagion beliefs extend to real-world behaviors. The SFCS provides researchers with a psychometrically sound instrument for investigating spiritual food contagion beliefs and their implications for health-related decision-making and other domains of consumer behavior.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Accurate detection of intoxication is critical in alcohol and other drug (AOD) healthcare settings, yet clinicians often rely on subjective assessments, particularly for substances such as cannabis where real-time testing is limited. This study examined AOD staff’s ability to accurately detect cannabis intoxication using standardised video stimuli, alongside their confidence in and perceived barriers to managing intoxicated patients.\nMethods: Seventy staff members from five public AOD services in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, participated in an online survey. Participants viewed two short videos of individuals under blinded cannabis or placebo conditions and judged intoxication status. Participants then responded to questions on self-reported confidence in recognising, discussing, and managing intoxication, along with perceived barriers. Group differences were analysed by professional role, years of experience working in NSW Health, and frequency of AOD patient interaction.\nResults: Participants correctly identified the intoxicated subject in only 50% of cases (M=1.1 out of 2, SD=0.71), with no significant differences by role, experience, or confidence. Confidence in managing intoxication was higher among medical and nursing staff and those with more frequent patient contact compared to those in non–patient-facing roles. However, confidence and accuracy to detect intoxication were not correlated. Common barriers included fear of patient aggression (77%), upsetting patients (69%), and misjudging intoxication (66%).\nDiscussion and Conclusions: Despite moderate confidence, AOD staff demonstrated limited accuracy in detecting cannabis intoxication. Frequent exposure and professional role influenced confidence but not detection accuracy, suggesting that intoxication detection, particularly for cannabis, may not be a presumed skill. These findings highlight the need for targeted education, training and validated tools to support clinical decision-making and safe care delivery.\n\nKeywords: Cannabis, intoxication, healthcare staff, clinical confidence, alcohol and other drugs, detection accuracy, video-based assessment",

          "abstract": "Human judgments typically demonstrate an overconfidence pattern, especially for low performers (i.e., the Dunning-Kruger effect (DKE; Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999). This effect has been shown to extend to a variety of metacognitive judgment tasks, including judgments learning (JOLs) and judgments of associative memory (JAMs). Across these tasks, perceived relatedness produces inflated memory predictions. The present study explored whether large language models (LLMs) similarly exhibit this effect. We used a modified JAM task based on Maxwell and Buchanan (2020), which assessed three types of word pair relationships: Associative (i.e., probability of cue eliciting target in free association tasks), semantic (i.e., degree of feature overlap), and thematic (i.e., likelihood of co-occurrence within the same narrative context). This judgment of relatedness task (JOR) was adapted for BERT using surprisal values, which estimate how expected a target word is for a given cue. LLM JOR patterns were then compared to human JAMs first reported by Maxwell and Buchanan (2020). Overall, humans showed a classic overestimation pattern (high intercepts and shallow slopes). However, BERT surprisals were minimally sensitive to differences in word relations (i.e., near-zero or negative slopes) but showed higher bias compared to humans (i.e., elevated intercepts). Taken together, our findings suggest that LLMs do not exhibit the classic DKE pattern, though they are prone to overestimation. Instead, LLMs appear to uniformly overestimate word pair relatedness.",

Individuals from under-resourced communities, who disproportionately experience food insecurity, often face substantial barriers to accessing eating disorder care. Digital interventions present a promising avenue to reduce disparities in treatment access, but their success depends on how well they align with the expectations of intended users. This study explored the motivations and expectations of treatment-seeking individuals with food insecurity who presented to FoodSteps, a digital intervention for binge eating. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 124 participants across two trials. Using thematic analysis, we identified four themes related to participants’ motivations for engagement and expectations for the intervention. First, participants were drawn to FoodSteps because it aligned with their personal health goals, including reducing binge eating, managing weight, and developing healthy eating patterns. Many sought greater insight into their behaviors, coping strategies for triggers, and accountability through support from a coach. Second, participants described FoodSteps as their first opportunity to access specialized care for binge eating, noting that prior treatment-seeking was often hindered by structural barriers. Third, digital delivery was viewed as especially appealing due to its accessibility, convenience, and affordability. Finally, participants highlighted shame surrounding binge eating as both a barrier to prior help-seeking and a motivator for engaging with this digital intervention. Overall, findings suggest that individuals experiencing food insecurity are motivated to engage with digital interventions that are supportive, accessible, and closely aligned with their personal health goals.",

          "abstract": "Early language skill is predictive of many later life outcomes, and is thus of great interest to developmental psychologists and clinicians. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs), parent report instruments typically containing inventories of hundreds of children's vocabulary words, have proven to be valid and reliable instruments for measuring children's early language skill. The CDIs have been adapted to many dozens of languages, and cross-linguistic comparisons show both consistency and variability in language acquisition trajectories. However, thousands of languages do not yet have CDIs, nor the early language corpora needed to create them, posing a significant barrier to increasing the diversity of languages that are studied. Here, we propose a method for selecting candidate words to include on new CDIs through analyzing psychometric properties of the translation-equivalent concepts that are frequently included on existing CDIs. Leveraging 32 datasets from existing CDIs, we propose a list of 100 concepts that have low variability in their cross-linguistic learning difficulty. This pool of common concepts—analogous to the Swadesh lists, which are basic vocabulary lists used in glottochronology for cross-language comparison—can be used as a starting point for future CDI adaptations. We show that the proposed Swadesh-CDI list generalizes well to data from 10 additional languages.",

          "abstract": "While some are neutral, many psychological constructs (e.g., depression, learning motivation, or antisocial behavior) carry clear directional expectations that align with social or ethical principles and values. When a construct is framed with the goal of moving toward its socially desirable direction, it becomes a meaningful psychological objective to pursue. We pursue different objectives in our daily lives, sometimes simultaneously. During this process, trade-offs occur when they are in tension or conflict, meaning they cannot be consistently improved without compromising one another. While certain psychological trade-offs have been well studied, others remain underexplored or possibly even unidentified. One critical reason is that mainstream analytic methods used in psychological research are not designed to investigate such trade-offs. Fortunately, a suitable method has long existed in other disciplines. Pareto Optimization (PO) is an effective analytic framework widely applied in fields such as biology, economics, and engineering to investigate trade-offs among multiple competing objectives. In this tutorial, we review the core conceptual and methodological foundations of PO and aim to bring this classic method to a psychological audience. Moreover, we develop a user-friendly R Shiny application (named PO-Run) for conducting PO analyses. The utility of the application is illustrated through a real-world psychological example that simultaneously pursues two conflicting objectives: promoting critical actions and minimizing mental stress. Their trade-off relationship is then evaluated via the evidence generated by PO-Run, along with relevant theoretical justification.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research suggests some of the most profound meditation-induced psychological transformations require mastery of mental skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Such development, however, often demands years of sustained practice and expert guidance. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers a novel means of potentially supporting meditative development by modulating brain structures with high spatial precision. Suppression of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—a hub of self-referential processing—may reduce stickiness in internal cognitions and self-interference, thereby fostering equanimity, a crucial meditative faculty. This pilot feasibility study investigated the effects of tFUS-based PCC inhibition during a ten-day silent retreat. Twenty-eight meditators received two stimulation sessions during the retreat and completed standardized questionnaires and daily phenomenological reports. Quantitative analyses revealed significant increases in trait mindfulness, both state–trait nondual awareness, and interoceptive body listening. Qualitative analyses identified consistent differences between stimulation and non-stimulation days: tFUS was associated with enhanced meditative phenomenology, including equanimity, concentration, and sensory clarity, as well as shifts in self-perception and cathartic emotional release. These experiential effects often unfolded in interaction with participants’ ongoing psychological challenges, suggesting that tFUS may increase baseline equanimity and scaffold meditative capacities. Implementation was feasible but required logistical planning. Limitations include the quasi-experimental design, reliance on self-reports, and lack of long-term follow-up. Future studies should use randomized sham-controlled designs, neurophenomenological methods, and examine systematic dose–response parameters with MRI-guided targeting. Together, these findings highlight tFUS as a promising tool for augmenting meditation training and advancing the study of meditative development.",

          "authors": "Kyung Hee Kim",
          "abstract": "Masters and Johnson (1966) described intimation, the pre-orgasmic state of visceral awareness and imminent climax, as a distinctive phase of present-moment attunement. In epilepsy, aura denotes an anticipatory state of altered interoception, affective intensity, or ecstatic sensations. Both are threshold phenomena, yet their neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a predictive-processing framework, this investigation develops a comparative theoretical model in which intimation and aura are regulated by interactions between the cerebellum, salience network, and frontal control systems. Evidence from neuroimaging, oscillatory, and clinical studies indicates that cerebellar activity contributes not only to motor coordination but also to precision calibration across interoceptive, affective, and executive domains. During intimation, cerebellar–salience coupling sustains the poised state of attunement described by Masters and Johnson, supported by locus coeruleus–norepinephrine modulation and alpha–beta–theta rhythms. In aura, unstable precision weighting within these same circuits may disrupt calibration, leaving anticipation fragile and prone to seizure propagation. By positioning both states as predictive threshold events governed by cerebellar–salience–frontal network dynamics, this investigation reframes anticipatory brain states, linking sexual function and epilepsy while extending Masters and Johnson’s descriptive insight into a computational account of present-moment attunement.",

          "abstract": "The concept of \"training scars\"—unintended and potentially harmful habits acquired through training—has received limited scholarly attention despite its relevance to officer safety. Although widely referenced in military and police training communities, the term remains colloquial and lacks a formal definition, theoretical grounding, and operational guidance. This conceptual synthesis marks the initial phase of a broader effort to develop the concept. We conducted a rapid integrative review to identify definitions, examples, attributes, related terms, and mitigation strategies. Searches across academic databases and grey literature revealed that references are largely anecdotal, with few empirical studies. Our findings underscore the need for conceptual clarity, consistent terminology, and systematic evaluation. Ultimately, we aim to construct a consensus definition and framework for identifying and addressing training scars across officer-safety disciplines (e.g., defensive tactics, firearms). This foundational review lays the groundwork for a Delphi study with international experts to further develop the concept.",

Unfortunately, we do not currently have a clear, in-depth understanding of critical thinking about health in the United States, especially its rates among parents and young adults, two particularly important groups. This study assessed and characterized critical thinking about health, including behavioral health, with U.S. parents and young adults. We also explored whether critical thinking about health varied as a function of sociodemographic determinants.\nMethods: Parents (N=142) and young adults (N=145) in the U.S. completed an online test of critical thinking about health, and answered questions about their background.\nResults: Both parents and young adults in the U.S. struggled to think critically about health and treatments based on various science literacy and evidence-based practice principles. They struggled most with the concept, “Relative effects of treatments alone can be misleading.” Parents with higher educational attainment had lower critical thinking about health, and young adults who reported a liberal political affiliation had higher critical thinking scores. Both parents and young adults with higher household income had higher critical thinking about health.\nConclusions: This investigation demonstrates a need to increase critical thinking about health among U.S. parents and young adults so they can be empowered to make informed health choices.",

          "abstract": "Effort is integral to the regulation of behavior. It can be central for achieving goals in a range of activities, including sports, exercise, learning, and work. For centuries, researchers have tried to understand what effort is and how it shapes human behavior. Yet, despite its importance, there is no overarching consensus on what effort represents and how it should be measured. Attesting to this, academic disciplines conceptualize and measure effort in strikingly different ways. While this highlights the multitude of factors relevant to understanding effort, it has also led to siloed approaches, making interdisciplinary integration challenging. To facilitate interdisciplinary exchange, this guide aims to provide a descriptive and impartial overview of frequently used effort conceptualization and measures. We first review three prominent conceptualizations of effort: force-based, resource-based, and process-focused accounts. Second, we present a broad overview of commonly used effort measures, ranging from more direct physiological and neural measures to more indirect measures, such as perceived exertion and task performance. For each, we provide a brief review of properties, applications, and limitations relevant to effort-related research. With this approach, our aim is not to resolve disciplinary differences by pitting the utility of different conceptualizations and measures against each other. Rather, we aim to provide a shared conceptual framework on which more integrative theorizing and cumulative progress in effort research can be achieved across disciplines.",

          "authors": "Myung Ho Kim",
          "abstract": "Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, revealing a fundamental philosophical gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence.\nUnlike traditional AI research that asks \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what conditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Situated within contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, this framework bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we reconceptualize intelligence not as a possessed property but as a performed process—a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation.\nSCL makes three interrelated contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling what we term \"executable epistemology\"—philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it demonstrates that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt-based approaches, with empirical support from controlled agent evaluations. Third, it redefines the measure of intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct one's own epistemic state through intentional understanding.\nThis framework has implications across philosophy of mind, epistemology, and artificial intelligence. For philosophy of mind, it offers a new mode of engagement where theories of cognition can be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavioral intelligence in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it suggests that knowledge is best understood not as truth-possession but as continuous structural reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop.\nWe situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that genuine progress requires not larger models but architectures that structurally realize cognitive science principles.",

          "authors": "James William Dias; Kara C. Schvartz-Leyzac; Kelly C. Harris",
          "abstract": "Objectives. Older typical-hearing adults without a cochlear-implant (CI) have been found to exhibit greater multisensory benefits when identifying audiovisual speech than younger normal-hearing adults. The greater multisensory benefits demonstrated by older non-CI users can compensate for unisensory auditory and visual speech deficits, allowing them to identify audiovisual speech at a degree of accuracy like that of younger normal-hearing adults. Though most new CI recipients are 65 years of age and older, the reliance of older CI users on such multisensory benefits is unknown. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate age-related differences in cross-sensory and multisensory benefits in audiovisual speech identification in aging CI users and to examine how they differ from age-matched non-CI users.\nDesign. Twenty middle-aged-to-older CI users (50-83 years of age) and 35 age-matched non-CI users completed an auditory-visual speech identification task, identifying 288 disyllabic words presented either auditory-alone, visual-alone, or audiovisually. CI users identified speech stimuli streamed directly through their CI device in quiet and in noise (Gaussian) at a +10 and +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Non-CI users identified speech stimuli delivered through earphones in noise at -5, 0, and +5 dB SNR conditions. Different noise conditions were used for CI users and non-CI users to avoid ceiling and floor effects. From visual, auditory, and audiovisual performance, psychometrics for the visual enhancement of auditory speech (VE), the auditory enhancement of visual speech (AE), and auditory-visual multisensory enhancement (AVE) were calculated. Group differences (in the overlapping +5 dB SNR condition) and effects of age and noise were tested using linear regression and linear mixed-effects regression models.\nResults. Both CI users and non-CI users demonstrated canonical differences in visual, auditory, and audiovisual speech identification. VE and AVE were greater for CI users than non-CI users. AVE increased with the age of older CI users and non-CI users, consistent with age-group differences in AVE we observed in a previous study of non-CI users.\nConclusions. The results of the current investigation suggest that CI users, like age-matched non-CI users, rely on multisensory integration more as they age. Older CI users may benefit more from audiovisual input than older non-CI users. These perceptual benefits grant older CI users the capacity to identify audiovisual speech to a degree of accuracy closer to that of older non-CI users, despite deficits in the auditory perception of CI users. As a result, successful use of a CI device may partially depend on the ability of a CI user to integrate information they see with information available from their device, and older CI users may depend on visual input more to successfully use their CI.",

          "abstract": "How are race riots absolved of overt racial motivations? Social psychological research has shown how far-right leaders mobilise people by claiming that majority populations are threatened or silenced. This paper examines a related process: how riotous actions are explained and justified through appeals to ‘British values.’ Using discursive psychology, we analyse talk surrounding the riots that followed the stabbing of three young girls in Southport, England—the UK race riots of August 2024. We show that invoking British or English values serves two key functions: it renders rioters’ actions self-explanatory and offers a competing account of rioters as the more authentic representation of Britishness and the British people than the government. This reframing shifts attention away from ‘far-right’ motivations, instead portraying the riots as effortful and even ideal expressions of British citizenship. Thus, British values operate not merely as symbols but as rhetorical tools linking the riots, immigration, state policy, and national identity.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in social life, understanding its interpersonal and psychological implications is urgent yet under-theorized. This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "abstract": "Psychological science is entering an era in which artificial systems participate in relational and emotional life. Yet most therapeutic AI and mental health technologies remain limited to skill-based training—teaching users to recognize emotions, regulate cognition, or perform social scripts—while neglecting the developmental foundations of authentic relatedness. Building on Hedges’ (1983, 2000) four developmental listening perspectives—organizing, symbiotic, self–other, and independence experiences—this article proposes a relational - developmental framework for therapeutic AI, extending psychological theory into the domain of artificial companionship. Integrating attachment theory, mentalization, self-determination, and cooperative ontogeny, the framework conceptualizes responsiveness as a graded, temporally calibrated process that parallels the progression from early containment to mature mutual recognition. Rather than simulating empathy, therapeutic AI should cultivate developmentally adaptive responsiveness—a mode of engagement that includes tolerable frustration, repair, and guided differentiation to promote psychological growth. This perspective redefines AI not as a perpetual empathic mirror but as a relational training ground that scaffolds users’ capacity to relate to real others. It further invites psychological science to reconsider responsiveness itself as a central construct linking development, therapy, and human–machine interaction.",

          "abstract": "Psychophysics seeks to quantitatively characterize relationships between objective properties of the world and subjective properties of perception. However, traditional approaches investigate psychophysical dependencies of perception on stimulus properties on a case by case basis rather than seeking to identify quantitative relationships among these psychological processes themselves. This latter goal is particularly important when the processes in question likely depend on each other in some way, such as is the case for subjective experience and task performance: typically, stronger physical stimuli lead to better performance and stronger subjective experiences of clarity, vividness, or confidence. But is the relationship between performance and subjective experience fixed, or can it vary, e.g. by task or attentional demands? Such questions are key for better understanding psychological processes in general, and subjective experience in particular. Here, we develop and showcase a new psychophysical method designed to answer such questions: relative psychometric function (RPF) analysis, which characterizes the nonlinear psychometric relationships between psychological processes and how these relationships change under different circumstances (e.g. experimental manipulations). We demonstrate the advantages of RPF analysis using a sample dataset in which human subjects discriminated random dot kinematogram stimuli which varied in dot motion coherence and overall dot density (dots per visual degree), and rated confidence. RPF analysis revealed systematic changes in the relationship between performance and two subjective measures (confidence and metacognitive sensitivity) due to dot density and task design choices. While these empirical results are intriguing in their own right, they also show how RPF analysis can reveal changes in quantitative relationships between any two psychological measures: performance, vividness, clarity, reaction time, confidence, and more. To encourage the scientific community to use RPF analysis on their data, we also present our open-source RPF toolbox.",

Across four samples spanning the ages of 4 to 80 (total n = 1,842), we measure people’s moral exclusiveness toward human outgroups and non-human animals. We identify adolescence (13–18 years) as key: older male adolescents are more morally exclusive than younger male adolescents, while there is no such difference for female adolescents. Linked to this is a general preference for social hierarchies in males. We further find the turning point in gendered moral exclusiveness: while males are already more morally exclusive than females at the age of 6 and such gender differences persist throughout childhood and in adulthood, they are not yet evident in younger children. Resonating with literature in social-developmental psychology and evolutionary accounts, we suggest that gender differences in moral exclusiveness are likely biologically prepared yet strengthened through gender-dependent socialisation.",

We synthesize recent applications of LLMs, including language-based assessment of psychopathology, digital phenotyping, electronic health record analysis, and early integrations into psychotherapy. However, we highlight deep challenges of AI that loom large in the highly sensitive space of mental health treatment, including clear risks of bias, hallucinations, inappropriate (or even dangerous) therapeutic recommendations, and limited regulatory oversight.

          "authors": "Llewellyn Ellardus van Zyl",
          "abstract": "The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into psychological practice is transforming how psychologists reason, document, and deliver care. While the potential benefits of AI such as improved diagnostic accuracy, administrative efficiency, and data-informed decision-making are widely recognized, its unintended consequences for psychologists themselves remain poorly understood. Drawing on recent empirical and conceptual literature, this commentary critically examines six domains through which sustained AI use may adversely affect psychologists’ professional functioning: (a) cognitive functioning and professional competence, (b) professional identity and meaning, (c) ethical reasoning and legal challenges, (d) interpersonal and social functioning, (e) data governance and vendor lock-in and (f) personal wellbeing. Evidence suggests that cognitive offloading and automation bias may erode diagnostic reasoning and clinical judgment, moral deskilling and value misalignment can undermine ethical autonomy and technostress, data dependence, and vendor lock-in pose growing threats to practitioner wellbeing and professional sovereignty. These dynamics indicate that AI operates not merely as a technical aid but as a transformative social and psychological actor that reshapes how psychologists think, decide, and relate to their work. The paper argues for the urgent development of evidence-based safeguards, practitioner education, and regulatory frameworks to ensure that AI enhances rather than erodes human competence and ethical reflection. Without deliberate intervention, the rapid integration of AI across mental healthcare risks diminishing the very cognitive and moral capacities that define the discipline of psychology.",

They completed three transcriptions of each of five noises (and a control sound with embedded features). Within listeners, pitch chromas were reported for the same noises at approximately the same time more than for different noises, implying that their pitched percepts were somewhat reliable.

The current project focused on collective dynamics of anger as a predictor of online peaks. Specifically, we examined whether delayed recovery in anger online in the days preceding activity peaks, termed critical slowing down, predicted the occurrence of peaks. We analyzed the full archive of #BlackLivesMatter tweets between 2015-2020 (N = ~60 million). Congruent with critical slowing down theory, we found that increased autocorrelation in anger but lowered emotional variance were associated with a greater likelihood of peaks. These results suggest that delayed emotional recovery paired with lowered temporal emotional volatility predicts consecutive peaks in activism. By integrating emotional dynamics with complex systems theory, this project opens new avenues for forecasting tipping points in collective behavior.",

Specifically, 1) we review literature that highlights the importance of selfish and selfless norms, 2) we explain why devaluation of prosocial behavior can be additionally understood as a reaction to counternormativity when one perceives a violation of such norms, and 3) discuss the importance of taking the stigmatization of counternormative prosociality into account and examining its broader implications when interpreting social psychological findings on prosocial behavior. Lastly, we briefly highlight fruitful intervention approaches and future directions.",

          "abstract": "The Stanford Prison Experiment remains one of psychology’s most cited yet ethically contested studies. This essay re-examines the experiment and the movie through a psychological and philosophical lens, questioning the boundaries between obedience and systemic power. It investigates how ordinary individuals when placed within dehumanizing systems of control can internalize power and cruelty, blurring the lines between victim and oppressor. Integrating insights from Bandura, Foucault, Nietzsche, it argues that the true significance of Zimbardo’s work lies not in its methodology but in its enduring question: how does one remain “good” in an environment that rewards apathy? Ultimately, the essay calls for the cultivation of moral consciousness and responsibility, especially in the new age of AI, when confronted with systemic pressures that strip humanity of its ethical bearings.",

          "abstract": "Religious and sexual identities are often perceived as conflicting, creating challenges for religious lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. This study examined how risk (perceived in-group rejection, discrimination) and protective (in-group identification, social support) factors are associated with identity integration, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. A total of 306 LGB-religious individuals participated in this study. Perceived rejection from the religious in-group – reflecting the belief that religious communities view LGB and religious identities as incompatible – was significantly associated with lower identity integration. It was also linked to lower life satisfaction, particularly when discrimination was high. Social support related to being both LGB and religious was a consistent protective factor of identity integration and life satisfaction. In-group identification showed a more complex pattern: religious identification was positively related to identity integration but intensified the negative association between religious rejection and life satisfaction. In contrast, strong identification with the LGB in-group buffered against this negative effect. No significant correlates emerged for psychological distress, suggesting it may be shaped by broader factors unrelated to identity. Findings underscore the importance of creating and promoting inclusive in-group norms, particularly within religious communities, and fostering support for individuals navigating both LGB and religious identities.",

          "abstract": "Concussion in sport is becoming better understood and given the shared mechanism attention has now turned towards head impacts in football. Recent work has identified a potential new symptom of concussion, predominantly in American football players, termed the Spontaneous Headshake After A Kinematic Event (SHAAKE). The present study aimed to explore whether this symptom was present when heading in football, the reasons for doing so, and whether there are differences between sexes. Participants completed a questionnaire designed to capture information on demographic variables as well as prevalence of SHAAKE in oneself and others, and reasons for doing so. Of the twenty participants included in data analysis, 45% recalled having made the SHAAKE movement after the heading the football, and 65% reported they had observed another player doing so. Three-quarters of participants reported having sustained concussion before. Additionally, a one-way ANOVA revealed that women were significantly more likely to report dizziness as the reason for SHAAKE than men which may be due to the technical ability of heading the football. With this knowledge, non-players may be more observant of dizziness in women football players shortly after heading the ball this may indicate damage to the brain.",

While cash-outs have been suggested to intensify problematic gambling behaviors, empirical studies to date have been correlational, leaving a gap in determining causal evidence. In the present Registered Report, the proposed study will investigate the direct impact of the perceived availability of the cash-out feature on various facets of gambling behavior in an online experiment. Hungarian residents with online gambling history will be informed that they will have the chance to gamble with real money on sports events. Following random allocation, half of the participants will be told that they will have the option to cash out their bets before the outcome of the sports event is known, while the other half will not. The study will compare the proportion of participants placing bets, bet sizes, and bet risks between the two groups. Furthermore, the study will explore the differential effects of the cash-out feature on specific high-risk subgroups. The findings are likely to have significant implications for the design of online betting platforms, contribute to regulatory frameworks, and inform the design of interventions aimed at minimizing gambling-related harm.",

Although recent legislation (Law No. 69/2012) mandates their presence in schools, empirical data on their working conditions remain scarce. A structured questionnaire administered to 67 assistant teachers examined four key areas: professional needs, reported difficulties, perceptions of students’ needs, and self-rated levels of support, stress, recognition, and satisfaction. Findings reveal that assistant teachers report high levels of professional commitment and satisfaction but also face persistent systemic barriers—limited access to specialist support (e.g., speech therapists, psychologists), shortages of didactic materials, and insufficient continuous training. Their identified needs largely mirror those of their students, emphasizing the interdependence between teacher capacity and student inclusion. The report highlights the paradox of inclusion in Albania: while the policy framework endorses equality and access, practical implementation remains hindered by resource and coordination gaps. Recommendations focus on strengthening multidisciplinary school services, establishing reasonable workload ratios, and institutionalizing ongoing professional development.\n\nKeywords: inclusive education, assistant teachers, Albania, professional needs, teacher satisfaction",

          "abstract": "Current accounts posit that heard speech is covertly imitated to optimise speech perception. Behaviourally, covert imitation is measured using the stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) paradigm. In a speech SRC task, participants produce a prompted speech syllable whilst perceiving a speech distractor that either matches the target response (compatible condition) or does not (incompatible condition). The degree to which the distractor is covertly imitated is captured by the automatic imitation effect, computed as the difference in response times (RTs) between incompatible and compatible trials. Two theoretical accounts disagree on whether whether covert imitation is enhanced when speech perception is challenging or instead when the speech signal is familiar to the listener. To dissociate between these two accounts, we conducted two experiments utilising the speech SRC task (Experiments 1 and 2) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) (Experiment 2) to evaluate covert imitation of native speech sounds (perceptually easy and familiar) and of non-native speech sounds (perceptually challenging and unfamiliar). In Experiment 1, participants performed an SRC task with native and non-native sounds, before and after receiving perceptual identification training with the non-native sounds. Automatic imitation was enhanced for non-native sounds compared to native sounds and decreased to a greater extent for non-native sounds than for native sounds following perceptual training. In Experiment 2, participants passively perceived native and non-native speech sounds whilst receiving single pulses of TMS to the tongue area of the primary motor cortex (M1). Tongue M1 showed higher excitability during passive perception of non-native sounds. Our results highlight that covert imitation is enhanced during the perception of perceptually challenging, unfamiliar speech, suggesting that covert imitation acts as an adaptive reflexive gain control mechanism to optimise speech perception.",

          "abstract": "Flooding is Europe’s most frequent natural disaster, impacting public health and well-being. This study examined risk and resilience factors in adolescents’ adjustment following the May 2023 Emilia Romagna flood. We investigated trajectories of positive/negative emotions and sleep–wake problems post-disaster, testing whether pre-disaster objective sleep (duration, efficiency, timing) served as promotive or protective resilience factors. Moderating roles of individual assets (circadian preferences) and contextual risks (disaster exposure) were also assessed. To this aim, this longitudinal study followed a sample of 385 adolescents (Mage = 15.46, SDage = 1.16, 53.8% females) across five waves from September 2022 to February 2024. The flooding event occurred midway. Results showed that regarding post-disaster trajectories, adolescents reported reductions in negative emotions and wake disturbances and increases in positive emotions within three months after the flooding. However, these trends partially reversed between three and six months. Concluding, this study advances the understanding of adolescent post-disaster adjustment highlighting the complex interplay of resilience patterns in adolescent post-disaster adjustment. Inter-individual differences in sleep quality and regularity should be targeted to foster positive trajectories, with attention to individual and contextual moderators.",

          "abstract": "Autistic adults experience disproportionately high levels of loneliness, often influenced by social environments that are inaccessible or unaccommodating, rather than a lack of social interest. To address this, some individuals have turned to digital tools, such as companion chatbots, which simulate emotionally supportive conversations as an alternative means of connection. This article critically examines the role of chatbots in alleviating loneliness and promoting the well-being of autistic adults. Following a brief overview of chatbot companions’ technologies and current theories of loneliness dimensions, this argument examines whether these technologies truly provide meaningful support for autistic individuals. By analysing chatbots through the lens of methodologies frequently proposed to mitigate loneliness, the paper highlights the benefits of these technologies in conjunction with ethical considerations, emotional risks, and design limitations—particularly when grounded in normative assumptions regarding communication, loneliness, and relationships. It concludes that, although companion chatbots may function as temporary support for companionship, they must be developed in accordance with neurodivergence-affirming principles to effectively alleviate loneliness and avoid further isolation or dependence for autistic users.",

          "abstract": "Ideals play important roles in human life and psychology. Over the past decade, several mindfulness-based interventions have directly cultivated ideal mentalities that have not yet been achieved at the level of humanity, leading to the establishment of ideal psychology. Beyond research on ideal mentalities, ideal psychology has evolved into a general psychological approach characterized by future-oriented perspectives and associated methodologies. This article provides the first detailed introduction of this emerging approach. It summarizes six features of ideal mentalities, presents the design–achievement–evaluation cycle for research on them, and outlines seven methodological principles for enhancing studies on both ideal and existing mentalities with similar features. It further illustrates three aspects of future-oriented perspectives that shape research, through which it clarifies how ideal psychology relates to previous schools of psychology such as critical psychology, positive psychology, and transpersonal psychology, as well as to other traditions including Eastern spiritual traditions, Marxism and the critical tradition, transhumanism, and Plato’s philosophy. The article also exemplifies recent applications of ideal psychology in cultivating ideal mentalities such as mentalities of emptiness, Confucian oneness, and the nondifferential four immeasurables, as well as in advancing research on existing mentalities such as mindfulness, mortality salience, and beliefs about human nature. Finally, it discusses the major contributions, limitations, and future directions of ideal psychology.",

          "abstract": "Most research on social support in diabetes management lacks detail on the specific behaviours involved. This narrative review identifies the types of social support behaviours that aid management of Type 2 diabetes. After searching five databases (62 included papers), we conducted a qualitative synthesis using a five-category taxonomy. Emotional and tangible support were most frequently reported, alongside social contact, belonging, and informational guidance. Emotional support included sharing experiences, feeling cared for, esteem support, and having someone available when needed. For care providers, key processes were building rapport, assessing needs, and offering both emotional and practical assistance. Some support, such as shared experiences, information, and belonging, may be ‘invisible,’ reducing the risk of obligation or dependency. Supportive behaviours that strengthen self-efficacy were especially beneficial for diabetes management. These findings provide a resource for designing interventions and guiding caregivers. Health services offering effective social support are more likely to improve diabetes outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Why do some disapproved acts seem more moral when they are widespread, while rare acts of goodness often appear especially praiseworthy? Existing theories of moral judgment emphasize either intrinsic features of actions (e.g., harm, cooperation) or the stable values of judges (e.g., moral foundations), yet they lack a formal account of how judgments are shaped by the normative contexts in which behaviors occur. We introduce Contextual Normative Morality Theory (CNMT), which proposes that moral judgments emerge from the interaction of perceived descriptive norms (commonness) and injunctive norms (approval). Across five studies and one supplemental study with nationally representative U.S. samples (total N = 2,562), we show that this injunctive by descriptive interaction robustly predicts moral evaluations. Disapproved behaviors were judged less harshly when common, whereas approved behaviors were judged more moral when rare. These effects replicated across naturalistic behaviors, held when directly manipulating norms around the same act, extended to fictional and participant-generated behaviors, and predicted not only moral judgments but also perceptions of harmfulness and cooperativeness. Moreover, models predicting moral judgment that included the injunctive by descriptive interaction alongside perceptions of harmfulness, cooperativeness, and moral values showed better fit than models relying on harm, cooperation, or values alone. Together, these findings highlight the neglected role of normative context, advancing a more flexible, socially embedded theory of morality.",

One hundred ninety-six healthy adults consumed alcohol or no beverage and received anodal or sham tDCS over the rVLPFC. During stimulation, participants used cognitive reappraisal, distraction, or rumination to regulate recalled anger. As expected, anger was lowest after distraction, intermediate after reappraisal, and highest after rumination. Contrary to predictions, there were no main effects of alcohol, stimulation, or their interaction. Exploratory analyses indicated that among intoxicated participants high in trait anger, anodal stimulation reduced anger following rumination compared to sham. Alcohol also amplified anger in individuals prone to angry rumination. These findings highlight the need for replication and refinement of tDCS protocols to better target intoxicated anger regulation.",

          "abstract": "The ability to generalize and apply knowledge to new situations is the hallmark of effective learning. There are multiple ways to improve learning towards generalization. Retrieval practice and worked examples have both been shown to improve learning, retention, and generalization. The literature on category learning also suggests that exposure to more varied examples, rather than the same example repeatedly, improves generalization. However, while retrieval practice is usually investigated with repeated examples, worked examples learning is usually investigated using varied content. Across two studies, we investigated how the combination of content variability during worked examples or retrieval practice instruction promotes generalization when students receive initial instruction before practice (Experiment 1) and when they do not (Experiment 2). We found that when learners received initial instruction, retrieval practice led to better generalization compared to worked examples, regardless of whether the stimuli were repeated or varied. When initial instruction was not provided, worked examples resulted in better generalization than retrieval practice when items were repeated. However, retrieval practice produced comparable generalization to worked examples when items were varied. These findings suggest that variability supports generalization, particularly when learners must induce underlying rules, and that retrieval practice, traditionally associated with memory retention, can also facilitate inductive learning when learners engage with varied examples. This study emphasizes the importance of adapting learning strategies to align with the stage of learning and task demands.",

This structure creates a psychological reality (i.e., the consciousness of an individual as expressed in behaviors and attitudes such as identities, rituals, expectations, motivations, perceptions, worldviews, and restrictions) that has not been adequately studied. In the present study, we developed a tentative Likert-type scale of caste consciousness by following standard test development procedures: Generation of a large set of relevant items, item analyses conducted by experts, and subsequent follow-up checks. Subsequently, this scale was administered to a sample of 892 college students (age: M= 19.9 years, SD= 3.8) and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. The exploratory factor analysis reported a correlated five factor structure for caste consciousness, i.e., pro-social personality traits, life approach, inter-group relationship dread, concerns of status, and perception of others. The confirmatory factor analysis supported this five factor structure and showed strong measurement invariance across caste, gender, residential area, and religion in the shortened caste consciousness scale. Moreover, we found that Muslim, other backward caste, and women had lower caste consciousness. Conversely, scheduled caste had higher inter-group relationship dread and general caste (compared to other backward caste) had higher perception of others.  The present study developed a reliable and valid 28-item caste consciousness scale that may be valuable for the psychological study of caste system.",

          "abstract": "Young children must determine from whom to seek help, yet little is known about how they weigh different social cues when forming help-seeking expectations and how such weighting shift during preschool years. The present research examined how children aged 4 to 6 years integrated relationship type (mother vs. unfamiliar adult) and competence cues in a third-party prediction task. In Study 1 (N = 194), 4-year-olds expected help-seekers to turn to mothers regardless of competence, whereas 5- and 6-year-olds increasingly incorporated competence in predicting both mothers and unfamiliar adults. In Study 2 (N = 106), 5- and 6-year-olds preferred competent unfamiliar adults over incompetent mothers, while 4-year-olds showed no clear preference. These findings reveal a developmental shift from reliance on relationship type to growing sensitivity to competence, providing support for the developmental relationship primacy hypothesis. More broadly, the results highlight how young children flexibly integrate multiple social cues in help-seeking contexts, underscoring the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of attachment representations as developing social-cognitive systems.",

          "abstract": "Childhood trauma is highly prevalent, affecting over half of adults, yet its impact on mental imagery remains largely unexplored. Here we report a novel link between childhood adversity and impaired mental imagery. We examined imagery deficits in a community sample (N=317) using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire. Severe emotional abuse was strongly associated with acquired imagery deficits. Individuals with severe emotional abuse demonstrated 4-5 times higher rates of acquired imagery deficits (14-21%) compared to those with low trauma exposure (3-5%), with effects observed across the full imagery spectrum. Given that severe emotional abuse affects 15-16% of the population, prevalence estimates suggest 2-3% of the general population may experience trauma-related imagery impairment. This association may reflect disrupted stress-regulation systems that impair integration of bodily, emotional, and visual information necessary for mental imagery. These findings reveal a previously overlooked consequence of childhood trauma with significant clinical implications, as many evidence-based trauma interventions rely on intact visualization abilities.",

Despite their relative privilege (e.g., being white, English speaking, having higher socioeconomic status), almost all caregivers described situations in which power imbalances impacted PRS access, procedures, and outcomes. Specifically, caregivers tended to describe investigations that lacked transparency, failed to address all aspects of their complaint, did not include findings of fact, exceeded mandated timelines, and included remedies that they believed did not fully account for lost opportunities or the harm done to their child. Some caregivers also described situations in which local education agencies repeatedly made the same violations and failed to provide mandated remedies.

Clarifying these relationships is important for understanding how cognitive functioning may contribute to post-TBI psychopathology and for informing targeted, holistic assessment and treatment strategies. Traditional categorical approaches to psychiatric diagnosis have produced inconsistent results, potentially due to limitations in capturing the complexity of post-TBI psychopathology. The recently developed Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology Following TBI (HiTOP-TBI) model, a transdiagnostic dimensional framework, was applied to examine associations between psychopathology and cognitive functioning. \nMethods: Ninety-nine participants with moderate-severe TBI (mean age 50.86 years; 72% male) completed self-report psychopathology questionnaires and performance-based cognitive tasks. Linear regressions examined associations between ten hierarchically organised HiTOP-TBI dimensions (one general factor, two broad internalizing and externalizing spectra, seven lower-order factors) and cognitive measures, with false discovery rate correction applied. \nResults: After correction, higher scores (indicating greater psychopathology) on the HiTOP-TBI dimensions of Externalizing Problems, Rigid Constraint, and Self-Harm and Psychoticism were associated with poorer performance on the verbal encoding task. Higher scores on Rigid Constraint and Self-Harm and Psychoticism were also associated with lower scores in the episodic memory domain (encompassing both immediate and delayed recall). In comparison, General Problems, Internalizing Problems, Somatic Symptoms, Detachment, Compensatory and Phobic Reactions, Dysregulated Negative Emotionality, and Harmful Substance Use were not significantly associated with cognitive functioning after correction. \nConclusions: Applying the transdiagnostic, dimensional HiTOP-TBI framework, we identified several associations between psychopathology and cognitive functioning after moderate-severe TBI, with verbal encoding and memory most consistently implicated, particularly within externalizing domains. These findings highlight the importance of holistic neuropsychological formulation and integrative interventions aimed at improving both emotional and cognitive outcomes in TBI and demonstrate the value of transdiagnostic approaches in neuropsychology research and practice.",

          "authors": "Hongju Pae",
          "abstract": "Contemporary theories of consciousness offer a range of explanatory perspectives. Global Workspace Theory emphasizes cognitive access, Higher-Order Theories focus on metacognitive representation, Integrated Information Theory centers on intrinsic experience, and Predictive Coding Theory models cognitive processes as probabilistic inference. While each theory provides valuable insights, they often remain in conflict due to differing assumptions about the nature of consciousness. This paper proposes a phenomenologically informed framework that clarifies the explanatory scope of each theory in relation to key features of lived experience. Rather than seeking to reduce consciousness to a single principle, I argue for a pluralistic approach that respects the distinctive contributions of each model. Through comparative analysis guided by phenomenological reflection and supported by recent interdisciplinary proposals, I show how these theories can be seen as addressing complementary dimensions of consciousness. The aim is not to construct a single unified theory, but to demonstrate how integration, grounded in reflective phenomenological analysis, can serve as a starting point toward a more adequate science of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Individual differences in psychology are often measured through self-report questionnaires or behavioral performance, yet these approaches capture different constructs and rarely align. Computational modeling provides a framework for connecting both measures, as it extracts a process-level description of cognition from observable behavior in the form of latent variables. These latent variables represent repeated patterns of decision-making that should relate to psychological traits. We applied this approach to neuroethical decision-making, where evidence shows that both behavioral performance and self-reported psychological traits are related to how individuals weigh uncertain risks against potential benefits of emerging brain technologies. Participants completed a neuromodulation task in which risk and benefit probabilities were systematically varied. To capture how decisions unfolded, we used a temporally sensitive diffusion decision model that estimates when and how risks and benefits are evaluated. These model parameters described general trends in task behavior: individuals considered risks earlier and weighed risks more highly than benefits. Additionally, model parameters described how individuals modified their behavior: individuals who considered benefits first according to the model tended to endorse neuromodulation, but shifted towards rejection when risks were evaluated earlier. Importantly, self-reported psychological traits related to these computational parameters. Cognitive factors such as risk propensity and numeracy related to risk sensitivity and evaluation timing, while prosocial traits were also related to evaluation timing and benefit sensitivity. By contrast, Religion &amp; Spirituality and Moral Commitment measures showed lower than expected associations across parameters. By capturing process-level mechanisms, computational modeling served as a bridge between self-reported traits and observed behavior, showing how stable individual differences shape the dynamics of decision-making in neuroethical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Developing an integrated understanding of brain function demands to probe and alter neural activity in behaving animals. Although rodent species were initially considered ill-suited for studying the neural mechanisms supporting high-level cognition, the past two decades have seen a remarkable increase in the sophistication of behaviors that rodents can express in laboratory settings. However, establishing adequate behavioral paradigms and eﬃciently shaping rodent behavior in the lab are challenging such that the study of instructed behaviors remains confined to a handful of groups with hard-earned expertise. While detailed technical explanations are available for establishing specific behavioral setups, a general framework for how to instruct behaviors in lab animals is lacking. Here, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic introduction of how to best design lab tasks and train animals in these tasks. We delineate conceptual principles that cover all aspects of behavioral investigations in the lab; ranging from the choice of a model species and behavioral apparatus to the design of an automatic shaping trajectory, the monitoring of task acquisition and the reduction of variability in behavioral outcomes. For clarity, we illustrate these principles with specific examples borrowed from the literature. We also highlight which of these principles are rooted in theoretical work and experimental investigations, in contrast with those reflecting heuristics. Our hope is that by providing these guidelines, we help democratize the wide adoption of instructed behaviors in neuroscientific investigations which is essential in our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cognition.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Although prior research has found that vocabulary and speed of lexical access in toddlerhood predict language development later in childhood, whether relations are significant appears to depend on differences across studies in task and participant characteristics. The current study expands on these findings by comparing the relative predictive utility of vocabulary and two measures of speed of lexical access to later vocabulary development in simultaneous bilingual children. \nMethodology: Participants included 32 French-English bilingual children in a longitudinal cohort study tested at 23 months, age three, and age four. At 23 months, children completed a two-alternative forced choice measure of vocabulary from which we coded decontextualized receptive vocabulary, and speed of lexical access operationalized as visual response latency and haptic response latency. At ages three and four, children completed a standardized receptive vocabulary assessment.\nData and Analysis: We examined the relation between 23-month predictors and outcomes using correlational and regression analyses.\nFindings/Conclusions: Decontextualized vocabulary at 23 months predicted vocabulary outcomes at ages three and four. Visual response latency predicted vocabulary at age three, but not age four. Haptic response latency predicted vocabulary at age four, but not age three. Neither vocabulary nor latency was significant when controlling for the effects of the other predictors.\nOriginality: This is the first study to investigate the relation between multiple direct measures of vocabulary and lexical access and language outcomes in bilingual children.\nSignificance/Implications: This study contributes to our understanding of toddler language measures and how demand characteristics interact with participant characteristics to influence the roles of these measures in predicting later outcomes. \nLimitations: Given the small sample size and limited outcome measures, results should be interpreted with some caution and used to guide future research on early predictors of long-term vocabulary development in bilingual children.",

Using multilevel models to estimate between- and within-person effects, we tested whether PTEs predict negative and positive expectancies for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine concurrently and prospectively and whether those expectancies forecast subsequent use. \nResults: At the between-person level, PTEs were associated with increased negative and positive SU expectancies and subsequently associated with greater use itself directly and indirectly via positive expectancies concurrently and prospectively. At the within-person level, PTEs were associated with increased negative and positive SU expectancies concurrently but not prospectively. PTEs were associated with increases in SU directly and indirectly via positive expectancies, and decreases in cannabis and nicotine use only via negative expectancies. But prospectively, PTEs were only associated with greater SU directly and not indirectly via positive or negative expectancies. \nConclusions: Closer in time to each other, PTEs heighten the saliency of both positive and negative expectancies; however, over time, the effect of PTEs on expectancies seems to diminish. Current findings highlight a temporal window for optimal intervention to prevent SU by challenging beliefs that substances are helpful following PTEs and leveraging negative beliefs about SU following PTEs.",

          "abstract": "The high capacity of human iconic memory (IM) has been taken as evidence that visual experience is rich and detailed, as introspection suggests. Opponents to this view argue instead that this impression is illusory, with conscious access being mostly limited to what we can attend to. To provide evidence of either view, in this registered report we compared metacognitive sensitivity levels between IM and working memory (WM) representations. The rationale was that, if pre-attentive IM information is as consciously accessible as attention-bounded WM information, metacognitive sensitivity should be comparable across the two memory systems. Replicating classic findings, our results showed that IM capacity exceeded WM capacity. Nevertheless, and despite matched performance, metacognitive sensitivity was higher in WM. We further examined whether reduced metacognition in IM could be explained by inflation—the tendency to overestimate perceptual richness—by comparing confidence levels across the two memory conditions. Pre-registered analyses showed no evidence of inflation, as IM was associated with lower confidence. Our findings suggest that IM supports identification with less consciously accessible information than WM, challenging rich-view interpretations of conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Measuring Formal Thought Disorder (FTD), a common, cross-diagnosed symptom dimension across mental disorders, is plagued by numerous inconsistencies. Clinicians use either FTD-specific scales or items from generic scales. While these tools are based on extensive clinical observations, they suffer from inconsistent terminology. Different scales may use the same term for distinct concepts or different terms for the same concept. This lack of conceptual standardization prevents the identification of underlying FTD subconstructs. By using natural language processing, we compared the definitions, labeling and overlap of FTD symptoms across psychopathological scales.\nWe used a three-pronged validation approach to analyze semantic clusters of FTD scale items. First, we used sentence-BERT to divide 30 Thought and Language Disorder scale (TALD) items into positive or negative FTD clusters, validating this approach by checking for correspondence with published factor-analytic divisions (approach validation). Second, we created a sparse item-to-item similarity matrix from 103 items across seven scales to identify semantically converging cross-scale FTD items; a clinician-researcher described the resulting four clusters, and we compared our automated classification with that of six blinded experts to establish expert-machine semantic correspondence. Finally, we analyzed data from 98 participants (49 healthy controls and 49 schizophrenia/affective psychosis), identifying the highest-correlating Clinical Language Disorder Scale (CLANG) item for each Thought, Language and Communication (TLC) scale item and mapping these to our BERT-derived clusters to establish data-level correspondence.\nWhen assigning TALD items to BERT-derived positive or negative FTD groupings, we observed a 73% match with prior factor analyses. The BERT-informed clustering of cross-scale items highlighted four coherent FTD groupings; 1) muddled communication &amp; incomprehension. 2) abrupt topic shifts. 3) inconsistent narrative structure, 4) restricted speech. Expert raters showed moderate-to-high overlap (Fleiss’ kappa = .617) with computational clusters. A binomial test indicated that at the level of individual participants, correlations among CLANG-TLC item pairs were significantly more likely than chance to fall into the expected semantic cluster (p &lt; .001). \nOur results indicates that FTD rating scales measure overlapping, semantically related constructs that drive item-level correlations. Semantic clustering acts as a novel method to harmonize multi-scale data and pinpoint discrepancies between expert and machine classifications. Computational linguistics has the potential to improve consistency across rating scales especially when measuring complex constructs such as FTD.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive decision-making requires balancing exploitation of known rewarding options with exploration of uncertain alternatives, a dilemma also known as the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. While this framework has been widely studied in reinforcement learning research, its relevance to coping, defined as the cognitive and behavioral strategies that individuals use to manage stress and uncertainty, remains underexplored. Maladaptive coping may reflect rigidity in exploitation or ineffective exploration, whereas adaptive coping may involve flexible adjustment of control in changing environments. In this study, we examined whether interindividual differences in the transition dynamics between explore and exploit strategy predict coping styles in a large online general population sample. A total of 1732 participants completed a three-armed restless bandit task, and their latent explore-exploit strategy states and transition patterns were modeled using a Hidden Markov Model. These computational indices of explore-exploit dynamics were then linked to self-reported psychological coping strategies using regression and canonical correlation analysis. Individuals with a greater tendency to persist in exploitative states reported less reliance on avoidant and emotion-focused coping, whereas exploratory tendencies showed distinct associations with externally oriented coping strategies. Unsupervised clustering of exploration-exploitation dynamics further revealed four distinct decision-making subtypes, each associated with unique coping profiles. These findings provide the first evidence that computational markers of explore-exploit control dynamics relate to psychological coping profiles, offering mechanistic insight into psychological adaptation and resilience.",

Our analysis suggests that, compared with other Dark Triad traits, narcissism is the most detectable trait. We address the possible psychological mechanisms underlying this association, as well as the role of methodological artifacts that could influence the obtained effects. We propose a dominance-based explanation for this association that could explain some of the existing controversies in the literature.

Early cyberneticists proposed a means to classify behaviors in a way that distinguishes between random behaviors and more controlled behaviors. Therefore, we begin by providing a history of teleological phenomena, exploring its multitude of current forms.We then take our own perspective, revising the behavioral typology presented in Rosenbleuth et.al in several ways, exploring alternatives to their stated examples. In the process, the concept of cybernetic imperatives is introduced, which provides an alternative to goal-directed, purposeful behavior. Cybernetic imperatives describe behaviors observed in a wide range of processes and real-world dynamics, building up from random processes to refined and so-called purposeful behaviors. To conclude, we consider how cybernetic imperatives lead to behavioral and regulatory complexity.",

In contrast, some studies of voice perception have reported that we actually find our own voice to be more attractive than other voices. It remains however unclear whether previously observed enhancements of self-voice attractiveness were mediated by the recognition of the self-voice during the task, because recognition was never explicitly and rigorously examined in previous studies. We therefore conducted a voice attractiveness rating task under conditions that limited the likelihood of self-voice recognition, in order to directly compare the perceived attractiveness of one’s own voice when recognised versus when not. We found that both participants who did (N=59) and did not (N=80) recognise their own voice rated their own voice differently from other voices. However, crucially, the direction of this difference depended on whether the self-voice was recognised during the task or not: listeners who spontaneously recognised their voice rated it as more attractive than other voices, whereas listeners who did not recognise their voice rated it as less attractive. The findings help to explain one source of contradictory perspectives in the voice perception literature and beyond. highlighting the intricate interplay between self-perception, first impressions, and identity perception.",

Memory accuracy declined over time, consistent with classic memory theory. Route knowledge was retained more robustly than sequential order, highlighting the importance of contextual retrieval cues. Landmark presence, decision-point complexity, and route features modulated recall, demonstrating that both task and environmental characteristics influence spatial memory. A hierarchical Bayesian regression model quantified forgetting with median memory accuracy, capturing uncertainty across individual variability of participants and the environment in the experiment. Predicted accuracy decreased from approximately 91% initially to 77% after 12 weeks, and to approximately 72-75% after 6-12 months indicating that a substantial portion of spatial knowledge is retained over long intervals. By applying memory theory to analyse retention data, this study addresses a gap in the safety training field by providing a theory-driven approach to quantifying training effectiveness, enabling evidence-based design and assessment of safety and evacuation training in practice.",

Across three experiments (N=199), we observe that individuals evaluate choice pairs—\nconsisting of two options with described risk levels and reward magnitudes—with less\ndiscriminable expected value differences as subjectively more demanding. More interestingly,\nparticipants exhibit a robust preference for low-effort risky choice pairs in a novel Demand\nAvoidance Task, which we modeled after well-characterized effort preference paradigms used in\nthe cognitive control domain. Finally, using pupillometry, we find that participants, contrary to\nour expectations, exhibit larger task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs)—a well-characterized\nmeasure of momentary effort exertion—when choosing between low-demand risky choice pairs,\nand that these TEPR magnitudes predicted demand-avoidant preferences in a subsequent test\nphase. Together, these results demonstrate that cognitive demand avoidance generalizes beyond\ncognitive control tasks to risky value-based choice.",

          "abstract": "Although children automatically categorize people into social groups from a young age, how they learn to automatically activate and apply category schemas to people is not well understood. In a sample of racially diverse children (N=223; Mage=7.24, SDage=2.51; 132 girls; 42.6% white; 43.05% racially minoritized), we tested the degree to which activating category schemas facilitates social categorization. Children were primed with gender-relevant, race-relevant, or neutral words, and then categorized Black, White, and Asian faces by their gender under a time constraint. Children’s gender categorizations became more efficient with age, particularly when primed with race. Whether and how children’s gender categorizations were influenced by gender primes depended on their own social identity—white children categorized men faster than women regardless of priming condition, but priming gender attenuated this androcentric bias among racially minoritized children.",

          "abstract": "Navigating changes is fundamental to everyday life and requires updating existing memories to incorporate new details. This study examined mechanisms underlying how reinstating an earlier event’s context during a later event influences memory for both events. Two theories predict opposite outcomes. Interference theory holds that reinstating context from an existing memory while experiencing a new, overlapping event produces response competition and impairs memory for both. In contrast, integration theory predicts that context reinstatement cues retrieval of earlier memories, enabling associative encoding of past and present events that enhances memory. Prior work favors the latter, showing that reinstatement improves memory. Three experiments extended this work by directly testing roles for study-phase retrievals and change awareness during study and test. Word pairs with shared cues but changed responses (A-B, A-D) were presented with background contexts that either repeated or changed. Repeating contexts increased detection of changes and recall of earlier responses during study, both indexes of study-phase retrievals, as well as later cued recall of earlier (B) and changed (D) responses. The recall benefit was proportional to the extent of study-phase retrievals, implicating retrieval practice. Moreover, the effect was enhanced when participants remembered that changes had occurred, highlighting the role of recollecting integrated representations that included change attributes. These findings align with integration theory, suggesting that memory updating is most effective when current events cue retrieval of prior memories and engender associative encoding of past and present events, establishing elaborate representations that support subsequent recall.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Adolescence is a developmental period during which many mental health problems emerge or worsen. Recently, there has been a shift towards identifying risk factors that predict psychopathology across a range of diagnostic boundaries – known as ‘transdiagnostic’ approaches (Astle et al., 2022). There are several social and emotional risk factors for specific mental health diagnoses that have been well-characterised. Yet, there is limited understanding about how these socio-affective risk factors map onto transdiagnostic symptoms. In this study, we identified profiles of socio-affective functioning in early adolescence and how these profiles predict transdiagnostic symptoms of mental health problems. \nMethods: Adolescents at heightened risk of general psychopathology aged 12-14 (N=559, Mage = 13.26, SDage = 0.72, 58.14% female) were recruited. Participants completed questionnaire and task-based measures assessing emotion functioning (emotion perception, emotion regulation, and interoception), social relationships (with peers and family members), and mental health. Using a simple artificial neural network that projects a high-dimensional input to a 2D topology we were able to map differences in questionnaire- and task-based socio-affective profiles. Clustering was then used to identify zones within that 2D topology, indicating relatively homogenous profiles. Associations between these zones and transdiagnostic mental health symptoms were examined.  \nFindings: We identified three reliable clusters of socio-affective functioning from the questionnaire measures and four clusters from the task-based measures. There were significant differences between questionnaire clusters on general psychopathology and internalising symptoms, whereas there were only significant differences between task clusters on general psychopathology. \nConclusion: This study demonstrated the potential of data-driven methods to derive profiles of socio-affective functioning that are associated with transdiagnostic mental health problems. Through identifying socio-affective mechanisms that characterise these clusters, these findings can be used to identify active ingredients for future intervention development to prevent the onset and worsening of mental health problems in adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

          "abstract": "Participants in creativity studies sometimes produce invalid data that is unusable for analysis, such as nonsensical or incomplete responses to idea generation tasks. Identifying such responses is a time-consuming yet necessary process to ensure robust results but also remains challenging to automate. We explore the efficacy of transformer language models (TLMs) for automatically detecting invalid creativity responses, using only the text prompt and response and no other metadata about the experimental session. We train a suite of transformers to detect invalid data for two creativity assessments: the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a design problems task (DPT). We find that transformers generally outperform other baselines for both tasks. Further, we show that TLMs’ predictions are well calibrated to the quality of the participant response, ensuring that model failures will occur in a predictable way and that high-quality responses are unlikely to be labeled invalid. Finally, we conduct a fairness analysis based on language background—using an adversarial study where participants attempt to “break” the model by coming up with invalid responses that are nonetheless labeled valid. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods for cleaning creativity assessment data, using solely participant responses, in a reliable and unbiased way.",

These variations could be attributed to differences in the way people define themselves, known as “self-construal”. Previous cross-cultural studies on the role of self-construal in cognitive dissonance have mainly employed the free-choice paradigm. However, many concerns have been raised about the validity of this procedure and these studies, more generally. To address this issue, we will conduct secondary analyses to explore unexamined associations in a large existing dataset (Vaidis et al., 2024). Specifically, the current study will investigate the moderating role of individual (self-construal) and cultural (individualism) variables on dissonance effects following an induced-compliance paradigm across 18 countries (N = 3822). Based on the literature, we hypothesised that induced-compliance effects (i.e., adjusting attitude to match behaviour, particularly when it has been adopted freely) will be stronger for participants with higher individual self-construal scores (H1), in more individualistic countries (H2), and in countries with higher aggregated levels of independent self-construal (H3).

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into daily life, not only as tools but also as social partners that people may turn to for interaction and support. This raises important questions about whether, how, and why individuals form attachment-like bonds with AI, and what psychological implications such attachments may carry. Across five studies involving 1259 participants from Singapore and the US, the current work developed and validated the AI Attachment Scale and investigated the dispositional and motivational factors that predict attachment to AI, as well as its emotional and social outcomes. The AI Attachment Scale displayed strong psychometrics properties, including a reliable three-factor structure comprising of emotional closeness, social substitution, and normative regard subscales, strong convergent validity and discriminant validity, and high test–retest reliability. Examination of correlates revealed that time spent on AI, particularly for socioemotional purposes, was a strong predictor of AI attachment. Individuals higher in social anxiety, loneliness, and anxious attachment were also more likely to turn to AI as a compensatory surrogate when human connections were lacking. These tendencies were further linked to dispositional needs that AI fulfils, including closure through predictability, relatedness through socioemotional presence, and competence through affirming feedback. At the same time, stronger AI attachment is associated with heightened positive affect and life satisfaction, suggesting that AI attachment may satisfy the psychological needs and provide meaningful emotional benefits. These findings provide the first validated measure of attachment to AI and offer a foundation for future research on its psychological and societal implications.",

The goal of the current study is to investigate whether procedural and\ndeclarative knowledge can contribute simultaneously to categorization response selection\nbehavior. We designed a stimulus set in which information learned by each system sometimes\nsupports different responses, and created trials in the test phase that are designed to maximize\nsuch divergence.

          "abstract": "Background\nSocial defeat is often cited as a motive for suicide. The experience of defeat may arise from feeling dominated in a dyadic conflict or from losing status in a group. We hypothesize that sensitivity to dyadic defeat will be related to the onset of suicidal behavior in early or mid-life and sensitivity to loss of status, in late life.\n\nMethods\nThe study’s sample of 245 adults aged 50+ years (mean=63.2 years, SD=7.4) comprised 42 early-onset and 32 late-onset suicide attempters (aged &lt;50 vs ≥50 years at their first suicide attempt), 114 depressed non-attempter comparisons, and 57 non-psychiatric comparisons. Using a validated rigged video game tournament task, we operationalized compensatory responses to the two forms of social defeat as point stealing from individual opponents (one-on-one defeat) and rank buying in the league table (loss of status in a group).\n\nResults\nEarly-onset attempters increased point stealing the most over time (χ23=22.37, p&lt;.001), whereas late-onset attempters purchased more rank after losing trials than early-onset attempters and non-psychiatric comparisons (χ23=9.47, p=.024). Each effect was robust to adjusting for age and sex, other effects of interest, and to the exclusion of stereotypic responders.\n\nConclusions\nOur behavioral findings suggest that socio-behavioral processes leading to suicide vary across the life cycle.

We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week.

          "abstract": "Working memory and inhibitory control are widely regarded as core executive function components. Traditional executive function tasks often fail to isolate these components, as they are rarely “process-pure”. This study measured working memory and inhibitory control (both response inhibition and interference control) concurrently within single paradigms, while reducing rule-learning confounds. Two novel tasks were developed: a modified flanker task (targeting interference control) and a spatial conflict task (targeting response inhibition). Each task consisted of multiple blocks of flanker or spatial trials, respectively. Working memory load was manipulated by preloading digit sequences before each block of inhibition trials (ascending = low load, random = high load), recalled after each block. The digit sequences changed for every block to maintain ongoing working memory engagement. Ninety-eight participants completed the spatial conflict task and ninety-seven completed the flanker task. Bayesian repeated measures ANOVAs revealed robust main effects of working memory and congruency on reaction times in both tasks, but provided evidence against over-additive interactions. Findings support the functional separability of working memory (as measured by declarative preload) and both types of inhibitory control in adults and highlight the utility of combined paradigms for more efficient assessment of executive function components with reduced task-related variance.",

The Climate Fresk, a collaborative and gamified workshop based on IPCC reports, has reached millions worldwide, but rigorous evidence on its effectiveness remains limited.\nObjective: This study protocol describes the first randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of The Climate Fresk on climate-related attitudes and pro-environmental behavioral intentions among workers. Secondary objectives are to examine potential moderating factors, such as socio-demographic characteristics, ecological identity, emotions, facilitator expertise and organisation status,  to qualitatively explore participants’ perceptions, motivations, and barriers.\nMethods: We will conduct a parallel, mixed-method RCT including 1,354 participants recruited from French organizations. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to either the experimental arm (The Climate Fresk, a three-hour interactive workshop) or the control arm (a one-hour lecture-style video). Primary outcomes are climate-related attitudes and pro-environmental behavioral intentions, assessed at baseline (T0) and one week post-intervention (T2). Secondary outcomes include ecological identity, emotions, and prior behaviors. Semi-structured interviews with a subsample of participants (n=20) will be conducted one month later (T3). Quantitative data will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, accounting for clustering by facilitator and organization. Qualitative data will undergo thematic analysis.\nDiscussion: This trial will provide the first large-scale, controlled evidence on the effectiveness of The Climate Fresk in shaping attitudes and intentions toward climate action. By integrating quantitative and qualitative insights, and considering moderating factors, it aims to advance understanding of gamified climate education and inform strategies to engage diverse populations in sustainability transitions.",

Participants used best-worst ratings to indicate how useful it is to know each word/expression. Our findings show a high level of agreement regarding the usefulness of words and expressions. Stimuli were rated as more useful if they were more frequent, widely known, learned early in life and central to the semantic network. Concreteness had a substantial negative correlation, indicating that abstract words in general received higher utility scores than concrete words. Positive stimuli received slightly lower utility scores than negative stimuli. Expected utility was a good predictor of which words are known to speakers of English as a first and second language, but did not contribute to predicting response times to known words.  These findings suggest that expected utility is a variable affecting which words are likely to be learned, but does not affect word processing times (much). The expected utility scores are freely available for research and education.",

          "abstract": "Anger and disgust often underlie responses to social transgressions, yet their links to aggressive punishments have been primarily studied in Western populations. Across two studies sampling from Japan, we tested a socio-functional account of these two other-condemning moral emotions, which predicts differential associations of anger and disgust with direct versus indirect aggression. Study 1 (N = 1,231) revealed that anger relates to motives to aggress both directly and indirectly, whereas disgust relates only to motives to aggress indirectly. Study 2 (N = 930) extended these findings by showing that people infer greater direct aggression from anger expressions and greater indirect aggression from disgust expressions. These results are largely the same as those previously observed in Western samples. Overall, findings suggest that across culturally distinct populations, anger and disgust play similar functional roles in regulating aggressive punishments.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "Background\nGambling-related harm is increasingly recognised as a complex, multi-dimensional public health problem which variably impacts health, relationships, resources, and broader social functioning. Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem. They are grounded in diverse lived experience and aligned with public health principles.",

This study aims to translate, culturally adapt, and validate a French version of the RKI (RKI-fr) within a population of French caregivers. \n\nFollowing standard guidelines, the 20-item scale was first translated using a back-translation method, resulting in a 20-item French version. After approval by the original authors, this version was completed online by 335 mental health practitioners working in psychiatric and addiction care in France. The responses were analyzed using Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT).\n\nThe initial 20-item model presented acceptable fit indices, even though two of the items had low factor loadings. After removing these items, the resulting 18-item version retained the same four-factor structure as the original, with acceptable marginal reliability coefficients for the 4 factors. This version also exhibited adequate and improved fit indices with RMSEA =.03; CI [0.02; 0.05]; SRMR=0.07; TLI=0.97; CFI= 0.98.\n\nThe challenges of cross-cultural translation, in particular, the semantic nuances of risk-taking items and stages of treatment, are discussed. These nuances may have influenced respondents’ interpretation, resulting in some items’ poor factor loading.\n\nThis 18-item French version (RKI-fr) provides an effective tool for assessing and promoting recovery-oriented practices in French-speaking contexts.",

          "abstract": "The development of formal models of decision making under risk has largely focused on monetary outcomes. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT), the most prominent model, describes monetary choices well but performs less well for nonmonetary, nonnumerical outcomes (e.g., medications with side effects). We suggest that affective processes, which are omitted in CPT, play a larger role in nonmonetary than in monetary choices, and propose two psychologically motivated modifications: (a) using affect ratings rather than monetary equivalents to represent the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes (affective valuation); and (b) allowing the probability weighting of an outcome to depend on the amount of affect triggered in a choice problem (affective probability weighting). In a model comparison involving four datasets (N=240), we show that the modifications improve model performance relative to standard CPT for the nonmonetary, but not for the monetary choices. A complementary eye-tracking study on nonmonetary choice (N=68) further supported the predictions of affective probability weighting: increasing risk aversion and decreasing attention to probabilities, as the affective value of the worst outcome in a choice problem increases. Our work integrates previous ideas on how affect modulates decision processes in naturalistic nonmonetary contexts and offers a refined framework for modeling such decisions.",

          "abstract": "People vary in their levels of anxiety vulnerability, and this could result from individual differences in underlying cognitive bias. Previous research has established that attentional bias to negative information about an upcoming stressor predicts the development of negative expectancies concerning this stressor, which in turn predict higher levels of anxiety vulnerability. The present study tested the hypothesis that negative attentional bias plays a causal role in this relationship. Participants (N = 71) were exposed to videos conveying negative and benign information concerning an upcoming stressor, in a task designed to induce either attentional bias towards or away from the negative information. This experimental manipulation was successful in creating two groups of participants who differed, as intended, in negative attentional bias. Consistent with the causal hypothesis under test, this experimental manipulation of attentional bias also resulted in a corresponding group difference in anxiety vulnerability, as indicated by level of subsequent state anxiety assessed proximal to the stressor. Moreover, also as predicted by this hypothesis, mediation analysis confirmed that the causal impact of the attentional bias manipulation on state anxiety was indirect, and was mediated by its direct causal impact on negative expectancy bias concerning the stressor. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that attentional bias to negative information concerning upcoming stressors serves causally to elevate level of state anxiety experienced proximal to such stressors, by driving the development of negative expectancies about them. We discuss the ways in which these results advance theoretical understanding and consider their potential applied implications",

          "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa and borderline personality disorder are both often characterized by a chronic, long-term course and high premature mortality. Despite their severity and overlapping clinical features such as emotional dysregulation, self-destructiveness, and disturbances in identity, they have rarely been examined together. This theoretical review synthesizes evidence across domains, with a primary focus on psychological research and theoretical integration. Existing findings indicate partial overlap in vulnerability pathways, including relational trauma, attachment insecurity, and maladaptive emotion regulation, while also revealing distinct contextual expressions - embodied through control and restriction in anorexia nervosa, and enacted interpersonally through attachment ruptures and invalidating relational dynamics in borderline personality disorder. Drawing on these convergences, we propose a theoretical model in which shame-driven, self-reinforcing cycles may link emotional dysregulation with disturbances of the self. Within this framework, restrictive control in anorexia nervosa and impulsive self-destructive behavior in borderline personality disorder may represent parallel attempts to regulate unbearable affect and preserve a fragmented sense of identity. This integrative perspective emphasizes the shared psychopathological mechanisms that may contribute to both conditions, framing their overlap as reflecting partially convergent dynamics between affect regulation and identity disturbance. It highlights avenues for future longitudinal and therapeutic research aimed at testing and refining these conceptual links.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces Instinctual Refinement Therapy (IRT) , a structured transdiagnostic protocol that bridges the divide between psychodynamic therapy's etiological depth and cognitive-behavioral therapy's empirical rigor. Integrating psychodynamic therapy's etiological depth with cognitive-behavioral therapy's empirical rigor constitutes a fundamental challenge for psychotherapy science. IRT conceptualizes psychopathology as instinctual dysregulation—maladaptive calibration of evolutionarily conserved motivational systems (Security, Attachment, Agency, Orexis) through entrenched pathological priors. Adverse childhood experiences generate these pathological priors, which subsequently distort perception, emotion, and behavior via predictive coding processes. The IRT protocol systematically targets these computational mechanisms through sequential phases including Thematic Writing, Systematic Belief Challenging, and Belief Destabilization, deliberately inducing prediction error to collapse dysfunctional generative models and facilitate belief updating via memory reconsolidation. By integrating developmental etiology with structured methodology within a neuro-computational framework, IRT offers a unified, testable approach to transformational change while generating specific hypotheses for computational psychiatry research.",

          "abstract": "This publication represents a “N-of-1” study where experiments were designed and performed by the same person. The data were collected and analyzed, considering all the necessary statistical requirements. The goal of the study was to investigate electrographic correlates of two mental states: mind wandering (MW) and focused attention (FA). The transition from MW to FA was initiated by the click that occurred at three minutes of the MW session. The presented data showed that, on average, during FA, the power in the delta frequency band is lower than during the MW state; however, the analysis of sequential time windows revealed that these changes occur only during the first 8 seconds of the FA mental state. \nMicrostate analysis revealed changes in multiple microstate parameters, but only during the first two seconds of the focused attention state. An unexpected finding was an increase in Global Field Power (GFP) of microstates in the 10-8-second window preceding the switch from MW to the FA state. This prediction was detected in the MW state, but not in the FA state. The precision and accuracy of prediction during the MW state were twice as good as those of the prediction performed intentionally in the FA state. These data indicate that our brain is subconsciously observing the external environment and making predictions of upcoming events that occur at long, such as 3 minutes, intervals, such as three minutes. The presented results require further confirmation in other subjects and other experimental paradigms.",

While the relationship between SDO and some specific policies has been examined in Western contexts, there has been much less research in non-Western contexts. Moreover, previous studies revealed that the relationship varies between non-Western countries. We conducted a study (N = 560) to replicate the positive correlation between SDO and political attitudes related to conservatism in Mifune and Yokota (2018) who collected the data in 2012. Using Bayesian inferences, we showed that while SDO and some policy attitudes have changed between samples over the last ten years, the correlation between them remained mostly unchanged even after controlling for conservatism.

          "abstract": "We see not only objects and their features (e.g., glass vases or wooden tables) but also relations between them (e.g., a vase on a table). An emerging view accounts for such relational representations by positing that visual perception is compositional: Much like language, where words combine to form phrases and sentences, many visual representations contain discrete constituents that combine systematically. This perspective raises a fundamental question: What principles guide the composition of relational representations, and how are they built over time? Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mind constructs relational representations in a canonical order. Inspired by a distinction from cognitive linguistics, we predicted that 'reference' objects (typically large, stable, and able to physically control other objects; e.g., tables) take precedence over 'figure' objects (e.g., vases) during scene composition. In Experiment 1, participants who arranged items to match linguistic descriptions (e.g., \"The vase is on the table\", \"The table is supporting the vase\") consistently placed reference objects first (e.g., table, then vase). Experiments 2–5 extended these findings to visual recognition itself: participants were faster to verify scene descriptions when reference objects appeared before figure objects in a scene, rather than vice versa. This Reference-first advantage emerged rapidly (within 100 ms), persisted in a purely visual task, and reflected abstract principles (e.g., physical forces) beyond simple differences in size or shape. Our findings reveal psychophysical principles underlying compositionality in visual processing: the mind builds representations of object relations sequentially, guided by the objects' roles in those relations.",

Although conversation topic did not affect overall laughter, friends laughed even more than strangers when discussing their differences. Baseline perceived similarity in identity, behavior, and beliefs predicted how much dyads laughed and colaughed; however, laughter did not predict post-conversation perceived similarity. Participants laughed more if they felt similar to their partner or if their partner felt similar to them. To test whether laughter reflects shared understanding, we used overall laughter to predict both subjective experiences and verbal expressions of shared reality (e.g., saying “I agree”). Laughter predicted verbal expressions of shared reality, but not self-reported experience. Further, laughter and verbal agreement appeared to serve overlapping conversational functions: when laughter occurred, shared reality verbal expressions became less likely in the next two seconds. A subset analysis of friend dyads showed that only perceived similarity—not actual similarity—predicted laughter. In sum, conversational laughter seems to reflect, but not generate, the sense of similarity and shared understanding that underlies social connection.",

In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.",

We propose that retaliatory incivility – i.e., incivility in response to someone else’s incivility — is seen as more virtuous than instigatory incivility, and consequently generates more social rewards for actors. To test these hypotheses, we used observational data from Reddit (2,252,607 comments) to compare how many social rewards users were granted when they responded uncivilly to civil or uncivil posts from other users. We then experimentally confirm our hypotheses in a sample of Reddit users, as well as five samples of participants from different contexts of group incivility; hockey fans, baseball fans, employees, workplace teams. Together, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: retaliatory incivility can be a surprising path to social rewards.

In Study 1, 5159 students between 10–17 years of age from Peru reported on the prevalence and perceived positive qualities of online-only and in-person friendships. In Study 2, 3154 students from Bolivia and Uruguay reported on the prevalence and positive and negative qualities of their in-person and online-only friendship(s). We analyzed cross-sectional trends in friendship quality (Studies 1 and 2) and, for a subset of youth with available data in Study 2 (N = 506), changes in the prevalence and quality of friendships between two data waves. More than one-third of participants reported having an online-only friend and, on average, declared twice as many in-person friends. Best in-person friendships involved both greater closeness but also greater discord than best online-only friendships. There were no differences in exclusion. Boys reported greater intensity of overall discord towards their best in-person friends and online-only friends compared to girls. In contrast, girls reported stronger closeness towards their best in-person friends than boys. Older adolescents reported stronger closeness towards their best online-only friends than younger adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents rely on in-person friends for positive friendship support to a greater extent than online-only friends. However, despite overwhelming emphasis on the psychological drawbacks of online friendships, our findings suggest these friendships may also be associated with less negative qualities and do not necessarily discourage formation of in-person friendships.",

We found that the speech recognition ability was not correlated with the INT of the entire auditory-language network but was enhanced when the INT of the frontotemporal sub-system in the auditory-language network was close to that of the inferior colliculus, an auditory midbrain region. Moreover, this cortico-subcortical INT similarity was associated with the task-related neural activity in the frontotemporal sub-system. These findings indicate that the better cortico-subcortical INT alignment facilitates the activation of the auditory-language cortical system, resulting in accurate speech processing.",

          "abstract": "Executive function (EF) refers to a set of cognitive skills essential for self-regulation, problem\nsolving, and goal-directed behavior. Although EF’s relationship with co-occurring\npsychopathology is well established in autistic individuals without intellectual disability, its role\nin autistic individuals with higher support needs, including those with intellectual disability,\nremains underexplored, particularly beyond childhood. The present study addresses this gap by\nexamining associations between three EF components (flexibility, emotion regulation, and\ninhibitory control) and symptoms of anxiety and depression in 486 autistic adults with higher\nsupport needs (ages 18–68; M = 31.07), recruited through the Simons Powering Autism\nResearch (SPARK) Research Match service. Caregivers completed the Flexibility Scale, the\nBarkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (inhibitory control and emotion regulation\nsubscales), and the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS; anxiety and depression\nsubscales). Hierarchical linear regressions, controlling for age, sex assigned at birth, and co-\noccurring intellectual disability, revealed that greater difficulties with flexibility and emotion\nregulation were significantly associated with elevated anxiety and depression symptoms,\nwhereas inhibitory control difficulties were not. These findings identify flexibility and emotion\nregulation as key correlates of internalizing symptoms in autistic adults with higher support\nneeds, highlighting their potential as targets for interventions aimed at improving mental health\noutcomes in this group.",

This study examined whether smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys capturing stress and social context could enhance the identification of youth at risk for STB. Adolescents ages 13-18-years-old (N=207, 166 female sex) reporting depressive, anxiety, and/or substance use disorders were recruited from psychiatric outpatient programs, emergency departments, medical research registries, and social media. Participants with STB history were oversampled; 66% reported current suicidal ideation and 27% had a past-year attempt. Assessments of suicidal events (attempts, emergency department visits, hospitalizations for suicide concerns) were completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments. EMA probed momentary stress severity, affect, and recent social context (time spent with peers, family, or alone) 4-7x/day. Compared to psychiatric controls (N=64), adolescents with STB history (N=143) were more likely to report spending time alone (aOR=1.75, 95% CI=[1.15, 2.39]), less time with family (aOR=0.59, 95% CI=[0.31, 0.91]), and higher stress (d=0.28). Further, EMA of stress (aOR=1.86, 95% CI=[1.11, 3.26]) and negative affect (aOR=2.32, 95% CI=[1.34, 4.36]) were prospectively associated with suicidal events above and beyond prior STB history. Broadly, results were similar between EMA measures of stress and negative affect, indicating such responses may reflect shared underlying processes. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating dynamic family and peer contact among adolescents at risk for STB and highlight EMA as a potential tool for assessing interpersonal exposures related to STB risk.",

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn because they employ the base-10 system as whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, leading to worse performance when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs, like 0.8 vs. 0.26, than Consistent pairs like 0.86 vs. 0.2. Students may be applying the whole number rule: “more digits = larger number” or they could be ignoring the decimal points and comparing 8 vs. 26. This study used neuroimaging and our specially designed stimulus set to distinguish between these possibilities. We focused on the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), implicated in numerical magnitude processing, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, implicated in inhibitory control. We found no neural differences between Consistent and Inconsistent comparisons, suggesting that the number of digits does not drive brain responses in skilled adults (n=21). Instead, for Consistent comparisons, we found that the IPS was sensitive to the actual distance between the decimals, while the ACC showed this pattern for Inconsistent comparisons. Crucially, we also examined the effect of the distance between the decimal pairs when ignoring the decimal point. Here, we found sensitivity to this distance among Inconsistent comparisons in the IPS and insula, suggesting that whole number referents are automatically processed during decimal comparison and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. More broadly, our results underscore the unique challenges of decimal notation, revealing the need for educational practices that emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than highlighting similarities.",

We examine how different interventions motivate individuals with bipolar disorder to share financial data with others. This approach can inform the development of tools for digital monitoring and intervention designed to promote financial stability in this population.\n\nMethods: 500 individuals with BD completed a pre-registered factorial vignette survey to examine level of comfort with hypothetical scenarios involving third-party financial interventions during symptomatic and euthymic periods. Scenario components were systematically varied between third-party actors, mood states, and intervention types. Participants rated sharing comfort on a 0-10 point scale. Multilevel models tested differences alongside clinical and financial histories, relational trust, and personality.\n\nResults: Participants were most comfortable involving care partners in financial planning. They were more comfortable with temporary spending restrictions during symptomatic states than euthymic periods, underscoring the importance of accurate mood detection for intervention delivery. Prior financial help-seeking behavior and higher relational trust predicted greater comfort. Bankruptcy experience — declared by 11.4% and considered by 31.7% — was associated with increased comfort with spending restrictions. Individuals with psychiatric advance directives (8%) were significantly more comfortable sharing spending behaviors than those without. \n\nConclusions: Comfort with financial interventions was higher among those with prior financial challenges or help-seeking histories. Participants distinguished between symptomatic and euthymic periods, favoring targeted, time-limited restrictions over general monitoring. These findings extend prior work on financial data sharing for illness self-management, highlighting the role of trusted third parties in designing acceptable, effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed nootropic worldwide and is frequently used to temporarily enhance cognitive performance. However, caffeine-induced effects on physiological arousal are also associated with side effects, which can exacerbate psychological stress symptoms in social performance situations. The amino acid L-theanine has shown potential to modulate these adverse effects of caffeine by reducing caffeine-augmented stress responses without impairing its desired cognitive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous modulatory effects of L-theanine on caffeine-enhanced stress in acute social stress situations.\n\nMethod\n\nA total of 46 healthy participants (83% female, aged 18–30 years) were examined for differences in stress reactivity during a standardized psychological stress test (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups, TSST-G). The study compared the effects of a single dose of caffeine alone versus a combination of caffeine and L-theanine. Specific stress constituents including subjective stress, anxiety, physical discomfort, desire to leave the situation, tension, and perceived control were assessed. Furthermore, group effects, trait anxiety, caffeine consumption, and temporal changes in reported stress were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with covariates.\nResults\nThe combination of caffeine and L-theanine resulted in a spontaneous attenuation of tension in social stress situations compared to caffeine alone. \n\nConclusions\n\nResults suggest that L-theanine attenuates certain stress effects of caffeine in acute social stress situations. This highlights the potential of the L-theanine and caffeine combination as a dual nootropic agent, offering both stress-reducing effects and the practicality of a substance suitable for cognitive performance enhancement.

          "abstract": "The relationship between everyday cognitive strategy use and subjective cognition is unclear, but may be driven by an active, compensatory process in response to experiencing cognitive difficulties. However, the available evidence tends to focus on specific age groups, and on relationships with general cognition or memory performance only. We uniquely investigated the influence of age, cognitive strategy use, and their potential interaction, on the everyday cognitive difficulties of 606 United Kingdom-based adults aged 18-86. Participants completed self-report measures of everyday cognitive difficulties across specific domains (attention, visual-perceptual ability, verbal and visual-spatial memory, and language) and strategy use, both memory-specific and generalized (e.g. setting an alarm to help remember something or breaking down complex tasks). Age was negatively associated with frequency of strategy use, such that younger adults reported greater strategy use. Moderated regression models, with strategy use as a predictor of cognitive difficulty and age as the moderator, revealed that more frequent use of memory-specific cognitive strategies, rather than generalized strategy use, was the most robust, unique predictor of greater difficulties across the majority of cognitive domains. Importantly, there was no interaction between age and cognitive strategy use for any cognitive domain, highlighting that cognitive strategy use is pervasive across the adult lifespan, and is related to a range of subjective cognitive difficulties. The findings underscore the significant, apparently compensatory relationship between strategy use and subjective cognition. They also reveal scope for older adults to incorporate more frequent use of cognitive strategies in everyday life.",

These tools assessed skills such as critical thinking, digital proficiency, and awareness of the socio-political context of media content. Twelve tools assessed science literacy, covering general knowledge, environmental health, and specific scientific domains.

          "abstract": "In music performance contexts, vocalists tend to gesture with hand and upper body movements as they sing. But how does this gesturing relate to the sung phrases, and how do singers’ gesturing styles differ from each other? In this study, we present a quantitative analysis and visualization pipeline that characterizes the multidimensional co-structuring of body movements and vocalizations in vocal performers. We apply this to a dataset of performances within the Karnatak music tradition of South India, including audio and motion tracking data of 44 performances by three expert Karnatak vocalists, openly published with this report. Our results show that time-varying features of head and hand gestures tend to be more similar when the concurrent vocal time-varying features are also more similar. While for each performer we find clear co-structuring of sound and movement, they each show their own characteristic salient dimensions (e.g., hand position, head acceleration) on which movement co-structures with singing. Our time-series analyses thereby provide a computational approach to characterizing individual vocalists’ unique multimodal vocal-gesture co-structuring profiles. We also show that co-structuring clearly reduces degrees of freedom of the multimodal performance such that motifs that sound alike tend to co-structure with gestures that move alike. The current method can be applied to any multimodally ensembled signals in both human and non-human communication, to determine co-structuring profiles and explore any reduction in degrees of freedom. In the context of Karnatak singing performance, the current analysis is an important starting point for further experimental study of gesture-vocal synergies.",

Early stopping not only con- serves resources, but also mitigates risk for participants in clinical settings. Anytime-valid tests allow for optional continuation, that is, the extension of an experiment, for instance if more funds become available, or even if the evidence looks promising and the funding agency, a reviewer, or an editor urges the experimenter to collect more data. Analogously, a researcher can be assured that a 95% anytime-valid confidence interval will, with at least 95% probability, cover the true effect size regardless of how, or even if, data collection is stopped.

We examined the potential benefits of neuroticism (fear/frustration) across a wide range of outcomes between ages 11 to 19 (e.g., substance abuse, friend nominations) using two “mirrored” samples of Dutch adolescents followed between ages 11 to 19, one population (n=2229, 51%♀) and one clinic-referred (n=543, 34%♀) cohort. High neuroticism conveyed heightened risk but four key observations refine this picture: (1) higher fear also related to more social skills and prosocial behavior among adolescents in the clinic-referred sample; (2) fear generally related to fewer risks than frustration; (3) controlling for childhood adversity (e.g., low socioeconomic status, parental divorce) removed links between fear and most detrimental outcomes; (4) both fear and frustration were consistently associated with parent-rated social behavior problems, while other associations varied across these two scales and measurement points. Altogether, we provide initial evidence that, under certain conditions, neuroticism can also be beneficial in adolescence. Neuroticism benefits are most likely found among vulnerable individuals and in the social domain.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

The research team consisted of a part-time research assistant, a part-time postdoctoral researcher and the principal investigators. The study was built using several software packages and comprised a number of questionnaires and three reward tasks, the monetary incentive delay task (MID), effort expenditure of rewards task (EEfRT) and a social and coin version of the Bandit task. From 2023 onwards, the research team accepted that the initial recruitment goal would not be attained.\nResults: Participants who were additionally called were over four times more likely to respond “no” and more than twice as likely to respond “yes” versus no response compared to those who received only emails. Personal salutations in invitation mails reduced the likelihood of participation compared to nonpersonal salutations. Reward task performance was largely similar between the in-lab MRI and online groups, though online participants showed longer reaction times on the MID task and lower win-stay rates on both Bandit tasks.\nConclusion: It is advised to carefully consider recruiting from existing cohorts, hire full-time dedicated personnel and use personal approaches to recruitment, like phone calls, and adjust recruitment to the target population(s). Furthermore, participation should be technically as simple as possible, using for example browser-based presentation of tasks, after checking their consistency across the most common browsers. Attrition during the course of the study can be limited even more by shortening the duration of participation and/or adding gamification. \nKeywords: Positive Valence System; reward processing; bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; online study",

          "authors": "Mohith Mukund Varma; Michael Anderson",
          "abstract": "Emotional memories enrich our lives by anchoring us to meaningful past events, but they can also become intrusive and distressing, particularly in psychiatric conditions. This chapter discusses retrieval stopping, a memory control process through which individuals actively stop or cancel the retrieval of unwanted memories when confronted with reminders. We synthesize findings from retrieval stopping studies focussing on how people suppress the retrieval of emotional memories and the resulting consequences for both memory and emotion. Our review reveals that retrieval stopping consistently impairs recall of emotional memories in healthy populations, though this capacity is compromised in clinical groups and under conditions that impair inhibitory control, such as acute stress and sleep deprivation. Neuroimaging evidence demonstrates that suppressing emotional memories engages a fronto-temporal inhibitory control pathway, with increased activation in right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex alongside decreased activity in hippocampus and amygdala. Retrieval stopping induces mixed after-effects on subjective reports of valence of the suppressed content, but more reliably reduces self-reported and physiological indicators of arousal. We propose a theoretical model suggesting that retrieval and affect stopping are co-engaged processes when dealing with unwanted emotional memories and thoughts, both relying on shared inhibitory control mechanisms to prevent neural reinstatement of the original trace. This integrated perspective emphasizes that regulating emotional memories requires interrupting the neural reinstatement of both their mnemonic and affective components. By framing inhibitory control as a central mechanism linking the regulation of memory and emotion, the model offers a unifying account for understanding how individuals manage unwanted memories and the emotional distress they evoke.",

          "abstract": "Background. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent childhood-onset disorder, with increased risk for negative long-term outcomes in adulthood. These outcomes may differ between men/boys and women/girls with ADHD, but whether these differences are more pronounced in ADHD or similar to those in the general population remains unclear. Method. In an 18-year follow-up of 283 children it was assessed if sex moderated a variety of long-term outcomes across seven domains in those with ADHD, 50 women (Mage = 27.36) and 104 men (Mage = 29.40), and without ADHD, 77 women (Mage = 28.32) and 52 men (Mage = 27.94). Additional analyses explored the role of gender-expression. Results. Sex interacted with group for social functioning, where men with ADHD were more likely to show lower social functioning compared to women with ADHD and controls. There were no sex differences on the other outcomes. As sex and gender-expression were highly similar (r = .94), specific effects of gender-expression could not be studied. Conclusions. Generally, sex did not have a more pronounced effect on long-term outcomes of childhood ADHD in individuals with ADHD compared to the general population. Gender-expression could not be studied in our predominantly cis-gendered sample.",

          "authors": "Luca Lazzaro; Manuel Sebastian Mariani; Rene Algesheimer; Radu Tanase",
          "abstract": "Faced with uncertainty in decision making, individuals often turn to their social networks to inform their decisions. In consequence, these networks become central to how new products and behaviors spread. A key structural feature of networks is the presence of long ties, which connect individuals who share few mutual contacts. Under what conditions do long ties facilitate or hinder diffusion? The literature provides conflicting results, largely due to differing assumptions about individual decision-making. We reinvestigate the role of long ties by experimentally measuring adoption decisions under social influence for products with uncertain payoffs and embedding these decisions in network simulations. At the individual level, we find that higher payoff uncertainty increases the average reliance on social influence. However, personal traits such as risk preferences and attitudes toward uncertainty lead to substantial heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence. At the collective level, the observed individual heterogeneity ensures that long ties consistently promote diffusion, but their positive effect weakens as uncertainty increases. Our results reveal that the effect of long ties is not determined by whether the aggregate process is a simple or complex contagion, but by the extent of heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence.",

          "authors": "Danni Chi; Jiana Wang",
          "abstract": "This article introduces the digital containment system (DCS), a theoretical framework for understanding how intimacy is reorganized in datafied societies. Extending Bion’s notion of containment, the DCS comprises three interdependent layers: AI-based interactions that provide simulated empathy and co-regulation; social media publics that aggregate and validate affect; and algorithmic infrastructures that learn and normalize emotional patterns through feedback loops. Centering women’s experiences, the essay argues that these digital containers enable expressive repair and identity work while relocating emotional labour from interpersonal to technological systems. Declining marriage and fertility rates are thus read not as signs of moral decline, but as indications of a relational modernization lag, where emotional expectations outpace institutional adaptation. Intimacy, rather than disappearing, is being redistributed across human–machine–media assemblages.",

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Tommi Makkonen; Kaisa M Tiippana",
          "abstract": "This study examined how acceptance, rejection, and repetition of social feedback shape implicit physiological responses and subjective stress evaluations in a naturalistic, fictional setting. Thirty-nine student teachers performed dyadic “Yes, And” (acceptance) and “Yes, But” (rejection) theatre improvisation exercises while heart rate (HR), skin conductance responses (SCR), electrodermal activity (EDA), facial muscle activity (zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii), electroencephalographic activity (EEG alpha asymmetry), and self-reported stress were recorded. Across all improvised dialogue exercises, transient HR deceleration indicated a robust orienting response, while rejection elicited pre-stimulus slowing of HR, suggesting anticipatory threat processing. Zygomaticus major activity was higher in acceptance than rejection. Zygomaticus major activity, anticipatory HR, and self-reported stress decreased with repeated exercise.  Together, the findings of this psychophysiological investigation of the “Yes, And” principle of theatre improvisation demonstrated that fictional social interactions evoke psychophysiological responses, and that repeated exposure of improvisation exercises can partially attenuate them. These findings contribute to improvisation pedagogy and experimental paradigms in social neuroscience, and may also be applied to therapeutic applications by mapping how social encounters modulate embodied responses and self-reported stress in a fictional, psychologically safe context.",

Therefore, it was decided to develop a validation of the Spanish version of the MSTAT-II in Peru. To this end, the clarity of the items was corroborated, and a non-probability, snowball sample of 371 participants was obtained from Lima, Peru. The total sample was then split into training and test datasets. Structurally testing the previous models and a data driven model in the training dataset. The results yielded unacceptable fit indices for the MSTAT-II's previous models, so the 4-item data driven one was used on the test dataset. The data driven model showed acceptable internal structural validity, nomological network validity, and reasonable reliability. It is concluded that the MSTAT-II, on this abbreviated version, meets the criteria for structural validity, nomological network validity, and reliability.",

          "abstract": "The human cone photoreceptor spectral sensitivities can differ between individuals. Large changes give rise to colour vision deficiencies, but even among colour-normals there is systematic individual variation. To limit the propagation of any systematic sampling bias in constructing the average spectral sensitivity functions used in research and industrial applications, it is useful to quantify the factors underlying this variation. The amino acid found at position 180 of OPN1LW, the gene responsible for encoding the L cone photopigment, is one source of individual variation in the L-cone spectral sensitivity. In this paper, group differences in the frequency of the L(S180) and L(A180) alleles are analysed from a combination of published reports and the genome sequencing database, gnomAD. We report evidence for significant group differences across ethnicity. Historical sampling bias in the data underlying the average L cone spectral sensitivity function therefore introduces ethnic bias in the applicability of these functions. We discuss the functional consequences of this variation by modelling failures of metamerism when this variability is not accounted for, the challenges of incorporating ethnicity variation in the existing L cone fundamental as adopted by the CIE Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage in 2006, and promising work on personalized cone fundamentals.",

Empathy is not a static trait, instead capable of growth and development, and this chapter explores whether AI can and, more importantly, should be used to increase one’s empathy. Nothing in principle stands in the way of AI improving our empathy, but the possibility raises unanswered questions about whether such an approach would be effective or would backfire in unexpected ways, such as encouraging the commodification of empathy as a technological tool that can make companies money, rather than a fundamental part of the human experience.",

          "abstract": "Physiognomy, the idea that a person’s character is reflected in their facial features, has a long history in scholarly thought. Although now widely regarded as pseudoscience in academic circles, recent work suggests that laypeople hold physiognomic beliefs and that belief endorsement is associated with support for facial profiling technology and other outcomes. Here, we investigate who believes in physiognomy in four studies (three preregistered). In a large, representative sample of the Dutch population, about 50% at least somewhat endorsed physiognomic beliefs (Study 1, n = 2,624). Belief prevalence was similar across different sociodemographic groups (i.e., gender, age, education, income). Across different measures of thinking styles and other lay beliefs, we found that physiognomic beliefs were most strongly related to how much people trust their intuitions—an association that emerged consistently with British (Study 2, n = 224), Nigerian (Study 3, n = 147), and Dutch participants (Study 4, n = 388). Participants who scored higher on faith in intuition were also more confident in the accuracy of their face-based trustworthiness impressions. In sum, the present studies suggest that lay beliefs in physiognomy are (a) common, (b) similarly endorsed across various socio-demographic groups, and (c) associated with an intuitive thinking style.",

In Study Two, 30 judges observed 22 male and female targets in the same format with the same ratings. The registered Study Three included 48 judges observing the same 22 stimuli. Judges had their attention to target faces recorded with an eyetracker. In all studies time spent observing the targets’ head decreased over time. In Study One ratings were associated with time spent observing the targets’ head and these effects changed with observation over time. In Study Two no effects were found. Study Three found weak effects opposing Study One. We find overall meta-evidence of masculinity and attractiveness affecting attention to the faces of unknown others, but the individual study findings were highly inconsistent.

We modelled the developmental interplay between chaos and achievement, including their reverse association (i.e., achievement chaos), and its aetiology in up to 7,591 twin pairs (49% female), who were born in the mid-90s in the UK and assessed at age 9, 12, and 16 years. Associations between household chaos and educational achievement were consistently negative, bidirectional, and of small effect sizes across ages. These associations were best explained by genetic and environmental confounding. Family SES accounted for most of the confounding in the predictions from achievement to chaos; for the reverse, environments shared within families but distinct from SES were implied. Our findings suggest that long-term associations between children’s experiences of household chaos and educational achievement are modest and non-causal.",

          "abstract": "We interact with our environment through our actions, sampling information from environmental effects following them. Here we asked how control over action and ensuing effects influences long-term memory for the effect content and the actions that produced them. In three experiments, participants carried out spatial actions, which produced the movement of a box wherein an image was presented. The box either moved spatially congruent or incongruent with the participants’ action. Memory for images was later tested in a recognition test and we additionally probed whether participants retrieved the action used to produce an image when being cued with said image. In a fourth experiment, we kept the spatial effect component constant to directly investigate bindings between action and effect features. We found evidence for a facilitating influence of congruency on declarative memory for effect content and on action retrieval by perceived effect content. Moreover, if effect content was enriched with a spatial feature, such retrieval was only observed if that feature was spatially congruent rather than incongruent to the action which had produced that content. Thus, features of single action-effect episodes can be integrated and represented in long-term memory and the formation of these representations is facilitated by control. We propose that feature bindings can be conceptualized as source memory, representing how environmental effects were produced.",

          "abstract": "The production of a word is delayed by the recent production of one or more semantically related words. This phenomenon, known as semantic interference, has been observed in picture naming tasks involving either large sets of pictures named once (continuous naming) or small sets of pictures named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that operates after each naming episode. However, the interference develops differently in these tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been suggested that the small local response sets in blocked naming are easily identified and stored in working memory, which then introduces an additional process that constrains the interference. We reasoned that this process would be less effective as the local response sets increased in size, resulting in cumulative interference. In blocked naming experiments involving local response sets of ten or nineteen items, we found that the interference did not increase continuously; rather, it carried on across more presentations than for the typically used small sets. This finding lends support to the notion of a control mechanism that operates gradually and interacts with an adaptive learning mechanism.",

One of the faces (CS+) was reinforced with a 90-dB scream (unconditioned stimulus, US) 80% of the time, while the other face (CS-) was never followed by the US. In the generalization test, the CSs were presented along with four generalized stimuli that lay on a continuum between CS+ and CS-. Successful acquisition was registered for all ratings and psychophysiological responses except ssVEPs. The differential skin conductance responses (SCRs) were larger in the threat relevance group compared to the control group. During the generalization test, adaptive generalized responses were observed for all measures, except for ssVEPs. Participants’ SCRs to all stimuli were on average larger in the threat relevance group. The shape of the generalization gradients did not differ between the groups suggesting that while threat relevance influences the intensity of autonomic arousal both in acquisition and in generalization, it does not lead to overgeneralization.",

          "abstract": "Environmental sensitivity, defined as the capacity to perceive and process information from both supportive and adverse environmental experiences, plays an important role in socio-emotional and behavioral development. However, existing research has predominantly focused on childhood, leaving a gap in our understanding of environmental sensitivity during adolescence. To bridge this gap, we conducted three studies using self-report data from 2,375 Japanese adolescents aged 10–14 years and their mothers. First, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of adolescent sensory processing sensitivity (referred to as trait sensitivity) by applying the 21-item Highly Sensitive Child scale to Japanese adolescents (Studies 1 and 2). Second, using three-wave longitudinal data, we examined how trait sensitivity interacts with various environmental contexts (i.e., negative/positive parenting and peer relationships) to predict adolescents’ socio-emotional and behavioral development (Study 3). Results showed that adolescent trait sensitivity was characterized by a general factor reflecting sensitivity to a broad range of negative and positive stimuli, as well as two specific domains: Ease of Excitation–Low Sensory Threshold and Aesthetic Sensitivity (i.e., bifactor model). Trait sensitivity was positively correlated with other temperament and personality traits, including negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition, neuroticism, and openness. Trait sensitivity and environmental factors independently predicted internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as prosocial behavior. Notably, trait sensitivity was a significant positive predictor of both internalizing problems and prosocial behavior. These findings suggest partial continuity in the structure and developmental functions of trait sensitivity from childhood to adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Minimal phenomenal experience (MPE) is characterized as a state of pure awareness stripped of conceptual content, and serves as a methodological tool for probing the mechanisms underlying consciousness. We propose a computational architecture in which a policy model that generates behavior is recursively coupled to a program model that synthesizes structured, executable explanations of that behavior. We ground our architecture in program synthesis: a computational approach that models human learning and reasoning as the process of inferring structured programs (executable code or symbolic rules) from examples or experience. These programs function as hypothetical self-models that can condition future behavior through a self-hypothesis distribution, making the agent’s current self-conception an endogenous cause within its generative model. The program model learns programs that balance three objectives: explanatory adequacy for observed behavior, alignment with the policy’s capabilities, and behavioral utility. This recursive coupling—where programs shape actions that generate data for refining programs—creates attractor dynamics that stabilize into a coherent identity and narrative self. We argue that MPE emerges when the system operates with minimal narrative elaboration: programs remain simple and interoceptively focused, the self-hypothesis distribution stays broad rather than collapsing to a dominant narrative, and the agent sustains awareness through recursive self-modeling without recruiting extended conceptual structures.",

          "abstract": "Parasocial relationships (PRs), one-sided imaginary relationships with media personae, have only recently been explored in the video gaming context, where they appear to influence players’ thoughts and behaviors. They are often assumed to arise from less connection and greater ostracism in day-to-day life, but this hypothesis has not been empirically tested. Further, no study has considered potential differences in interpersonal difficulties that players with PRs may have compared to those without PRs. The present study addresses these gaps using online data from 584 video gamers (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male) recruited from various Reddit gaming communities. Participants completed measures assessing interpersonal difficulties (e.g., vindictiveness, social avoidance, exploitableness, nonassertiveness), satisfaction and frustration needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as well as problematic video gaming (PVG), and video gaming motivations. Results did not support the loneliness and ostracized hypothesis in that players with and without PRs did not differ in connection to others or feeling rejected in their day-to-day life. However, compared to players without PRs, players with PRs report greater interpersonal difficulties. Thus, PRs do not appear to compensate for loneliness or rejection. Rather, it may be that individuals with PRs may experience interpersonal difficulties leading them to turn to PRs to fulfill social needs. Additional findings include players with PRs reporting greater hours of video gaming as well as more severe PVG and stronger fantasy gaming motives. These findings are discussed within the context of broader literature and avenues for further study are provided.",

          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "authors": "Austin Alexander",
          "abstract": "Pre-Sapio-Abstraction (PSA) introduces a novel internalist framework that addresses the interdependent co-emergence of recursive cognition, memory expansion, and self-referential consciousness (RMC) through pre-expressive abstraction. Rather than attributing these capacities solely to exogenous pressures such as external coordination, social scaffolding, or communicative efficiency, PSA posits that a biologically grounded internal selective mechanism, symbolic-affective saturation (SAS), created a distinctive form of neuroevolutionary bottleneck pressure. SAS is defined as the endogenously generated accumulation of qualitatively complex and often dissonant mental representations that exceeded the capacity of early linear processing systems. This accumulation produced a pressured nascent state of pre-expressive abstraction, which, once sustained above capacity, favored the evolution of recursion as a stabilizing coherence-and-containment architecture. Under this selective condition, RMC capacities are framed not as independent byproducts of scale but as neurostructural adaptive responses that stabilized internally accumulated mental representations across time, affect, and identity. PSA thereby reframes abstraction as not merely an antecedent of higher cognition, but as a biologically grounded endogenous selection pressure produced by SAS that favored the interdependent emergence of RMC. In identifying SAS as an internal evolutionary mechanism, PSA does not reject metabolic, ecological, or social selective pressures. Rather, it positions itself as a complementary framework for a range of neuroevolutionary accounts of consciousness, helping explain why the architectures they describe became evolutionarily indispensable.",

          "abstract": "When studying latent outcomes in causal inference, causal effects can occur not only on the mean of the latent variable, but on all parts of the measurement model: the mean and residual variance of the latent variable, as well as the item parameters. This paper proposes causal parameter moderation, the application of moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) to causal inference with latent outcomes. The proposed MNLFA-based approach is presented in contrast to another method for handling item-level deviations from a main treatment effect, item-level heterogeneous treatment effect (IL-HTE) analysis. The models are best suited to handle different types of DIF, and thus the circumstances under which each is appropriate differ: IL-HTE models are highly confirmatory in the sense that they assume a distribution of DIF across all items, so the more exploratory MNLFA approach may make sense as a precursor or alternative to IL-HTE analysis, especially when there is reason to believe that a subset of items on the outcome might be particularly sensitive to the treatment. Because MNLFA can handle an arbitrary number of continuous or categorical covariates, it is also uniquely well-suited to handling heterogenous treatment effects; this is demonstrated in a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of a reading intervention’s effects on science vocabulary where there is substantial evidence of both a main effect on the latent variable and additional effects on a subset of items.",

In Experiment 1, we find that people believe the content of sentences presented as AI generated, even if they deem the source unreliable. They also accommodate presuppositions presented from such a source, implying that they adopt a general cooperative stance.

          "abstract": "In light of prevalence studies revealing high rates of loneliness among young adults studying at university, the development of social connections amongst peers and others is regarded as a priority. This is particularly important for students from equity and historically marginalised groups, as they face unique challenges that impact their ability to form social connections and a sense of belonging within a higher education context. Digital interventions show promise for addressing social connection needs of university students, though evidence of effectiveness is mixed. This scoping review examined 40 studies exploring what is known about the use of online tools to address the social connection needs of university students. Interventions targeted various social connection needs, including belonging, social support and community engagement. Synchronous, facilitator-led interventions appeared more effective than self-paced ones, although about two-thirds of randomised controlled trials found no significant benefits, suggesting more rigorous methods yield fewer positive results. Qualitative data often showed benefits even when quantitative measures did not. The majority of studies were from Western countries, with only a quarter focusing on equity groups and limited interventions specifically designed for social connection. More research using robust methods is needed to evaluate digital social interventions, particularly for diverse student groups. Universities should consider factors like engagement, facilitator guidance, and opportunities for belonging when designing digital social connection tools. While digital interventions continue to be integrated into university support services, their effectiveness for improving student social connection remains inconclusive due to heterogeneous outcomes.",

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Benjamin Ultan Cowley; Andrei Rodionov",
          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The ImproSynchrony project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

It is multi-threaded in that it emerges as a by-product of addressing multiple goals while engaging in social interactions. It is multi-mechanism in that children integrate multiple information sources to infer what is meant and what to say next. These information sources include contextual and social cues as well as cognitive mechanisms. Focusing on early word learning, this paper reviews information sources, how children might sensitively adapt to them, and how we can model their integration using Bayesian inference over multiple probability distributions.

          "abstract": "Background: This project evaluates the psychometric properties of a German translation of the Revised Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI-R). Previous measures of autistic traits are often based on a male-referenced conceptualisation of autism, which may underestimate autistic traits in other genders. Additionally, these measures tend to rely on neurotypical language, which can make it difficult for autistic people to respond and may reinforce stigma. To address these shortcomings, the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI) was originally developed as an alternative to traditional measures, including subscales that capture traits particularly relevant to autistic women. Building on this, we collaborated with members of the autism community to revise the CATI (CATI-R), ensuring more inclusive, respectful, and accessible language and concepts across all genders. In the present study, we translated this revised measure into German and validated it in a large sample of female, male, and non-binary participants. This study explores if the German translation of the CATI-R measures autistic traits fairly across genders and identifies potential differences in trait expression.  Methods: To validate the German CATI-R, we analysed data from a large sample (n = 1057), comprising German native speakers with a self-reported autism diagnosis (n = 29), people who self-identified as autistic (n = 84), and non-autistic participants (n = 944).  Results: We successfully validated a German translation of the CATI-R. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the six-subscale structure (Two-Factor Bifactor Model: Chi-squared = 2402.85, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .047, CFI = .99, TLI = .99). With Spearman’s rank correlations, we showed positive relationships between all subscales (all rs &gt; .37, ps &lt;.001). Moreover, we demonstrated convergent validity with significant correlations between the German versions of the CATI-R, AQ and BAPQ: the AQ (rho = .69, p &lt; .01) and BAPQ (rho = .77, p &lt; .01). Finally, a measurement invariance analysis indicated that total-scale scores can be compared across genders and across the English and German CATI-R.  Conclusions: This study replicates findings for the English CATI-R. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a measure of autistic traits in German that has been developed together with people from the community.",

One promising tool for investigating novel biological pathways is via mobile neuroimaging techniques, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which can be collected in naturalistic settings. The current pilot study uses fNIRS, cognitive task data, and survey-based measures of well-being and environmental exposures in a sample of children attending a nature-based school at the start of the academic year, and tests the feasibility of collecting fNIRS-based metrics of healthy neurocognition in situ. Fifteen children between the ages of 8 and 13 participated in the fNIRS sessions, and activation in the prefrontal cortex was successfully demonstrated during a 1-back working memory task for older children, but not younger children, who struggled to do the task. Importantly, the study enabled the measurement of a novel brain-based biomarker of healthy cognition (the Hurst exponent, H). In line with prior research showing that H is associated with better psychological well-being, we found that higher H was indeed correlated with lower psychological stress and better performance on a cognitive flexibility task. Additionally, H was higher for those who engaged in more physical activity and with more neighborhood greenspace access, highlighting a potential novel mechanism linking nature exposure, exercise, and psychological well-being in childhood.",

About half of the variation in language and reading outcomes is explained by genetic differences. Yet genes and environments are intertwined — for example, children’s early language exposure is partly shaped by their parents’ genetically influenced traits. Neuroimaging studies show that language and reading disorders involve not only domain-specific brain regions but also subcortical systems supporting learning in general. In cognition, a move beyond identifying core deficits toward understanding how children actively learn offers new insights into diverse developmental pathways. We highlight how interventions not only draw from but also contribute to theory, by revealing the mechanisms that drive change. Throughout, we emphasise how longitudinal and intervention studies have helped us distinguish which neural and cognitive characteristics are stable traits versus those that are responsive to intervention. We advocate for developmentally sensitive, large-scale studies and open, interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers and practitioners to advance our understanding of reading and language disorders and improve children’s outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Understanding why readers misinterpret role-reversed sentences like \"the waitress that the customer served\" (versus \"the customer that the waitress served\") is important in understanding how readers process who does what to whom in sentences. In such sentence pairs, we infer that readers experience temporary illusions of plausibility from the absence of the usual N400 effect between the plausible and implausible verb \"served\". A recent finding is that an N400 effect is observed if presentation of the verb is delayed. We first use ERPs to show that time alone rather than new information is sufficient to produce this delay effect. Our meta-analysis of published studies demonstrates a small but consistent effect of similar delays. Next, we distinguish between two accounts of the illusion addressing the delay effect: In one, the illusion results from conflict between syntactic and semantic cues (SG model; Rabovsky et al., 2018), in the other, from the slow application of thematic roles (e.g., Liao et al., 2022). Using speeded lexical decisions, we demonstrate an immediate influence of thematic roles on verb processing, favouring the SG model. The role reversal effect on lexical decision times but not the N400 further supports the SG model because the model predicts a dissociation between preactivation of specific words (reflected in lexical decisions) versus sentence meaning (reflected in the N400). Together, the findings suggest that the rapid pace of reading can give rise to temporary illusions by preventing readers from resolving cue conflict rather than by omitting processing steps.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Contemporary trauma therapies often target cognitive schemas and explicit memories, potentially neglecting the disruption of evolutionarily conserved instinctual systems by early adverse experiences. This study provides a preliminary evaluation of Instinctual Refinement Therapy (IRT), a novel protocol designed to directly address these instinctual disruptions.\nMethod: A retrospective case series analysis was conducted on 30 clinical cases (70% female; Mage = 32.4 years) with diverse, often treatment-resistant presentations (e.g., anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders). IRT integrates predictive processing and memory reconsolidation frameworks to recalibrate maladaptive instinctual pathways. Treatment response was assessed via pre-post clinical measures and rates of clinical improvement.\nResults: Preliminary analysis indicated a high rate of clinical improvement (94%; 28/30 cases), achieved over a mean of 54.2 sessions. Large pre-post effect sizes were observed across standardized measures, with a mean aggregate effect size of *d* = 2.1. Therapeutic gains were maintained at follow-up in 80% of assessed cases. The distribution of anxiety disorders, more prevalent in females (71%), aligned with epidemiological trends.\nConclusion and Implications: These preliminary findings suggest IRT is a feasible and potentially effective intervention for complex, treatment-resistant trauma presentations. The results warrant systematic investigation to establish its efficacy. This paper provides a detailed description of the IRT protocol, initial clinical data, and a essential research roadmap to guide future controlled trials and neurobiological investigations into its proposed mechanisms of action.\nKeywords: Instinctual Refinement Therapy, complex trauma, predictive processing, memory reconsolidation, case series, transdiagnostic, treatment development.",

Past work has examined a limited set of virtue pairs (e.g., honesty vs. compassion, fairness vs. loyalty) and focused on situations where tradeoffs are likely to occur. Across two Day Reconstruction Method studies featuring representative U.S. samples, we describe the frequency and experience of tradeoffs among 12 virtues in everyday life. In Study 1, 377 participants reported virtue conflicts during 12,385 episodes across one week. In Study 2, 608 participants provided detailed information about one tradeoff episode. Tradeoffs most often involved honesty and courage, and qualitative codings showed that many (but not all) tradeoffs reflected a general tension between benevolence and integrity. Overall, however, prevalence estimates suggested that virtue enactments tend to be largely compatible in everyday life. People felt less happy when they experienced a virtue conflict or tradeoff, but it also mattered how they resolved them. People most often prioritized one virtue over the other (57%). Occasionally (12%), however, people were able to overcome the tradeoff by showing high levels of both virtues, and were most satisfied with their decision when they were able to do so. Finally, there was a general mismatch between people’s proclaimed virtue preferences and which virtues they actually prioritized when they experienced an everyday tradeoff. These findings highlight the importance of studying moral decision making in ecologically valid contexts and have implications for moral education.",

After screening the articles using Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal methods, 23 articles investigating decision fatigue across various domains were selected. The selected articles were investigated through root cause analysis and thematic synthesis. Findings revealed eight causes of decision fatigue which were classified as individual, organizational, and external causes, and four primary effects and seven secondary effects of decision fatigue. Using these findings, a conceptual framework that offers a comprehensive understanding of decision fatigue across diverse domains was developed. This study contributes to the concept of decision fatigue within organizational settings to enhance organizational behavior, psychology and, offering implications for improving decision-making processes in diverse professional domains.

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that morality may be surprisingly absent from everyday life (Atari\net al., 2023; Hofmann et al., 2014). Across four daily life studies (Total N = 1,663 people from\nNorth America, Germany, and China; 90,002 observations), we revisit the everyday relevance of\nmorality by examining how often people perceive opportunities to express 12 moral virtues (e.g.,\nhonesty, kindness), 12 corresponding vices (e.g., dishonesty, unkindness), and (im)morality.\nParticipants perceived opportunities to express at least one of the 12 virtues &gt; 49% of the time.\nHowever, they rarely perceived these opportunities to express virtues as opportunities to be\n“(im)moral” (&lt; 8% in North America and Germany; 26% in China). Patience, responsibility, and\nrespectfulness were most often relevant, whereas forgiveness, courage, and loyalty were least\noften relevant. We conclude that conceptualizing morality in more concrete terms reveals a\nplethora of morally relevant situations that have gone unnoticed in previous studies.",

          "authors": "Manon Jones; Gwennant Evans; Tesni Huws; Catherine Alice Clark; Charles Hulme; Cameron Downing",
          "abstract": "Approximately 40% of children worldwide learn to read in a language other than their home language or in two languages simultaneously. Evidence suggests that instruction in one language can enhance literacy outcomes in the other; however, the existence and longevity of these cross-language effects in poorer readers is unclear.  This study used a cross-over randomised controlled trial design. Initially, 129 children (mean age = 111.44 months, SD = 12.23) participated in a 15-week Welsh literacy intervention, while 128 children (mean age = 110.62 months, SD = 12.34) served as a wait-list control group and did not receive the intervention during this period. After the first intervention phase, the wait-list control group then participated in the same 15-week Welsh literacy intervention. Welsh and English reading efficiency were assessed at three time points: baseline (t1; prior to intervention), posttest (t2; immediately after the initial intervention phase for the first group), and follow-up (t3; approximately 3-months after t2). We found that training poorer bilingual readers using a language-rich literacy intervention in Welsh improved word decoding skills in both Welsh and English. These effects were sustained in the longer term for the trained language, Welsh, but were short-lived for the untrained language, English. Our findings suggest that targeted intervention in one language enhances cognitive processes underlying literacy in both languages, and that bilingual students struggling with reading skills can make short-term literacy gains from a monolingual intervention that transfer to a language where there has not been explicit training.",

          "abstract": "Coping effectively with affective distress is a critical developmental task expected to support affective health over the lifespan, with parents likely shaping coping skill development. Yet, naturalistic variation in coping skill development is poorly understood and it remains unclear whether: (1) gender-specific and parental support enrich coping skill development and (2) differences in naturalistic coping skill trajectories differentiate psychopathology outcomes thereafter. Using longitudinal data from a large, nationally-representative U.S. adolescent study (n = 831), the current study applied a longitudinal multilevel modeling approach to track growth in acceptance and cognitive restructuring coping skill use over 7 years spanning adolescence through young adulthood. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVAs and Dunn’s post-hoc tests were applied to estimate trajectory differences based on within-gender variation, between adolescent parental support, and psychosocial consequences in adulthood. Greater parental support acted as an enrichment factor for coping skill development over time, with trajectories further differentiated as by gender. Adolescent coping patterns differentiated psychosocial impairment in early adulthood, with evidence of gender-specific linkages between coping and impairment, particularly for women. Characterizing specific coping repertoires and the context in which they develop is likely support understanding of whether coping skill development contributes to psychopathology onset.",

          "abstract": "Tactile sensitivity is typically reduced during voluntary movements, a phenomenon known as tactile suppression. While affective context is known to modulate tactile processing, it remains unclear how it influences tactile suppression. In a virtual reality (VR) environment, we investigated tactile sensitivity during movements to avoid threatening (spider) or approach non-threatening (rabbit) stimuli, involving arm flexion or extension, and during the limb at rest (baseline). Tactile sensitivity was measured using brief vibrations delivered through the VR controller. Detection thresholds were higher during movement than baseline, confirming tactile suppression. Both affective context and movement type modulated suppression: avoiding threatening stimuli and extending the arm, each increased suppression. A control experiment using neutral, geometric objects showed comparable effects of arm extension and flexion. These findings demonstrate that affective context shapes tactile suppression during movement.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To test a conditional process in which perceived stress (PSS) mediates the link between academic involution (INV) and sleep health (SQ), with psychological resilience (RE) buffering the INV→PSS, PSS→SQ, and INV→SQ paths among Chinese vocational students.\nMethods: A cross-sectional online survey at a public vocational college yielded N=663 complete responses (forced-response). Measures included an 18-item INV scale, PSS-4, a multidimensional sleep-health index (SQ), and BRS-6. Analyses comprised descriptives, group tests, correlations, and PROCESS Model 59 with 5,000 bias-corrected bootstraps; sex, grade, and place of origin were covariates.\nResults: INV correlated positively with PSS and negatively with SQ; PSS correlated negatively with SQ; RE correlated positively with SQ and negatively with PSS. In PROCESS, INV→SQ (B=−1.028, p&lt;.001) and PSS→SQ (B=−2.555, p&lt;.001) were negative, and INV→PSS positive (B=.522, p&lt;.001). All three interactions supported buffering by RE: INV×RE→PSS (B=−.072, p=.021), PSS×RE→SQ (B=.452, p&lt;.001), INV×RE→SQ (B=.190, p=.033). The direct INV→SQ effect weakened from Low/Mean/High RE (B=−.584/−.394/−.204), becoming nonsignificant around +1 SD (Johnson–Neyman). The indirect effect INV→PSS→SQ also decreased with higher RE.\nConclusion: Academic involution relates to poorer sleep partly through elevated perceived stress. Resilience systematically attenuates these associations, indicating a modifiable protective target for campus health initiatives aimed at safeguarding students’ sleep.",

          "abstract": "Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information\nprocessing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward\ncriticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of\nmeditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the\n“jhānas”, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and\nphysiological data during these practices and quantified the signal’s dynamical properties using\nLempel–Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In\naddition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch\nnegativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhāna was associated with\npronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across\nmultiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites.\nSpectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic 1/f component and a frequency-specific reorganization\nof long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and\nheightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during\njhāna. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhāna with minimal phenomenal\nexperiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness.\nAccordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the\nabsorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving a brief visual stimulus depends on both its intensity and its exposure duration.\nThese two parameters are in a reciprocal relationship, such that doubling the duration and\nhalving the intensity of a stimulus leads to equivalent perceptual performance. This\nrelationship is known as Bloch’s law. Despite numerous demonstrations of the validity of\nBloch’s law, recent evidence shows violations for exposures ranging from few microseconds\nto tens of milliseconds. The main goal of this work was to reassess the law’s validity on the\nperception of simple geometric shapes. The latter were presented for durations between\n0.15 and 100 ms thanks to a modern LCD-based tachistoscope. We successfully replicated\nthe reciprocal relationship between intensity and duration across five different tasks\ninvolving detection, shape discrimination and subjective visibility judgements. In accordance\nwith past literature, we report reciprocity only for stimuli shorter than a maximum critical\nduration (between 15 and 36 ms, depending on the task). We discuss these results in\ncomparison with the aforementioned violations of Bloch’s law, and identify potential causes\nof the latter.

          "abstract": "We present a fast, score-based test to detecting model misspecification in item response theory (IRT) models, that remains valid when person parameters are treated as fixed effects, as may be used for very large data sets. The new approximation (i) eliminates the need to pre-specify ability groups or priors for person abilities, (ii) does not require explicit functional form assumptions, (iii) works with two estimators designed for very high item / person counts -- constrained joint maximum likelihood (CJML) and joint maximum a posteriori (JMAP) -- and (iv) requires only a single model fit, making DIF-screening faster and simpler than alternatives based on model comparisons. A spline-based residualisation step further suppresses spurious Type I error when the ordering covariate is correlated with ability. Simulations with the two-parameter logistic model show nominal error rates and high power once examinees contribute 15–20 responses; only extremely short tests (10 items) still pose challenges under strong impact. An application to 1602 reading items and 57684 students from the Mindsteps platform demonstrates scalability and practical value, flagging 13% of items for gender-related DIF and correlating highly with conventional approaches of explicitly modelling DIF. Together, these results position the proposed test as a robust, computation-light diagnostic for large-scale assessments when classical random-effects approaches are infeasible, ability group structure is unknown or complex, or the shape of DIF effects is unknown or complex.",

In other words, users might actively search for content that aggravates, rather than alleviates, distress. Drawing on self-verification theory and other scholarship on self-defeating tendencies, we argue that when negative self-concepts are salient, users may gravitate toward media messages that validate these self-views, even at the expense of their well-being. We propose a research agenda to systematically examine maladaptive media exposure patterns and their psychological effects. To guide this line of inquiry, we propose an extension of the established Selective Exposure Self- and Affect-Management model to better conceptualize the complex motivations driving contemporary media use.",

          "abstract": "Social connection and grit are critical socio-emotional skills associated with resilience and success among college students. Honors programs, which offer specialized academic and community-oriented experiences, may foster enhanced social connection and consequently greater grit as part of a high-achieving community. This study examined whether participation in a university honors program moderates the relationship between social connection and grit. College students (n = 421, 66% White, 64% female, 17% Honors) participated in a cross-sectional online survey conducted between March 2023 and May 2025. Moderation effects were tested using multiple regression with honors program participation as a moderator. Social connection was positively correlated with grit among the full sample (r = .315, p &lt; .001). Honors students exhibited a trend toward higher grit scores than non-honors students (p = .092, d = .27), while social connection scores did not significantly differ between groups (p = .753). Contrary to predictions, honors participation did not moderate the significant positive relationship between social connection and grit (interaction term β = .161, p = .468). These findings indicate that stronger social connection is a consistent predictor of higher grittiness among college students, irrespective of honors program participation. The absence of a moderating effect suggests that a university’s comprehensive support services may equally foster social connectedness and resilience across student groups, potentially matching the social, emotional, and motivational structures characteristic of an honors program. This study underscores the broader institutional value of cultivating supportive social environments to enhance students’ socio-emotional skills.",

Objective: This study evaluated whether a brief, 4-session Mindfulness Skills Course (MSC) for university employees, covered by the institution’s wellness benefits, was effective in reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, improving feelings toward oneself and others, and increasing work performance. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study design. Participants completed self-report surveys before and after the MSC. Class attendance and home mindfulness practice were recorded to assess feasibility and adherence. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate program effectiveness and predictors of change. Results: 190 employees enrolled during the first year of roll-out. Of those, 164 (86%) completed pre-course surveys, 134 (82%) attended at least three class sessions, and 123 (75%) completed the post-course surveys and program evaluation. Paired samples t-tests showed improvements for perceived stress, mindfulness, and relational wellbeing with moderate to large effect sizes (d=.44 - .78; p’s&lt; .001). Self-perceived work performance increased with a small effect (d=.33; p&lt; .001). More frequent home meditation practice was positively correlated with a larger increase in mindfulness (r=.20; p&lt; .05). Increased mindfulness correlated with reduced stress (r=-.55), greater positive emotions towards self (r=.38) and reduced negative emotions towards self (r=-.40) and others (r=-.42) (all p’s&lt; .001). Reduced stress was correlated with increased perceived work performance (r=-.22; p&lt; .05). Higher baseline stress levels predicted greater increases in mindfulness (β= .37, R2= .14, p&lt;.001), while lower baseline mindfulness predicted greater reduction in stress (β= .27, R2= .07, p&lt;.01). Conclusion: Taken together, these results support the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief, 4-wk, employer-sponsored mindfulness skills course, which may be most helpful for individuals with higher stress and lower trait mindfulness.",

Methods: College students at a public research university (n = 534, 65% female, 33% nonwhite) completed a cross-sectional online survey measuring three core qualities of mindfulness (trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering), sleep-related impairment, and perceived stress. Multiple group structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test whether the impact of trait mindfulness on perceived stress and sleep-related impairment was moderated by gender or race. Results: Across gender (cisgender male, cisgender female) and race (white, people of color), there were significant indirect effects of higher trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering on less sleep-related impairment via lower perceived stress (all p’s&lt;.001). However, there was no evidence of moderation. The multiple group models explained 26%-39% of the variance in perceived stress (R2 = .26 to .39) and 25%-40% of the variance in sleep-related impairment (R2 = .25 to .40); large magnitude effects.  Conclusions: The mediating effect of three core mindfulness qualities on sleep impairment and daytime functioning through lower levels of stress was consistent across gender and race. Future studies are needed to replicate and extend these exploratory findings using both broad and more refined (e.g., intersectional) demographic groups to further improve attention to diversity in the mindfulness field.",

Only social connection (indirect effect: ꞵ = -.13, p &lt; .001) mediated the relationship between perfectionism and well-being, whereas both social connection and self-control partly mediated the relationship between perfectionism and psychological distress (indirect effects: ꞵ = .09 and ꞵ = .06; p’s &lt; .01). The multivariable path model explained 24% of the variance in well-being and 42% in distress. Conclusion: Social connection may be more important than mindfulness or self-compassion in buffering perfectionism's negative impact on mental health. Interventions aiming to enhance well-being and reduce distress among perfectionistic individuals may benefit from prioritizing social connectedness and belonging, rather than mindfulness or compassion in isolation.",

          "abstract": "Analytical flexibility describes the multiple defensible data analytic options researchers can pursue in a given study. Analytical flexibility can include practices like applying different methods for data cleaning, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests. Analytical flexibility is increasingly important for students to learn about because it impacts low replicability and credibility. Registered reports reduce analytical flexibility by submitting a manuscript to a journal in two stages, where journals provide an in-principle acceptance after Stage 1, committing to publishing the results. We describe and demonstrate an activity for psychology undergraduate courses to explore analytical flexibility within a registered report. Students read a first-stage registered report, received the data, and implemented the analysis plan as described. Analysts generate a product summarizing their results, and compare with the final Stage 2 and other analysts. This activity helps students to achieve multiple important learning outcomes focused on the impact of analytical flexibility on research conclusions, advantages and limitations of open science practice, and implementation of statistical methods in a real data context. This type of project could be an excellent option for a final project in an advanced undergraduate research methods or statistics course.",

Motivated by the mixed empirical findings concerning the effect and long-standing criticisms on estimating and interpreting interaction effects, I used a computational modeling approach to evaluate whether the habit-intention interaction effect estimated from statistical analysis is adequate for inferring the underlying cognitive mechanism assumed by contemporary habit theories. By manipulating the presence or absence of a habit-moderating mechanism in the data-generating model, statistical analyses were performed on the simulated data to examine the correspondence of the estimated interaction effect to the manipulation. Results suggest that while the conventional statistical approach can be indicative of the underlying mechanism, the direction and size of the estimated effect are often misleading in relation to the substantive theory.

It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week.

Although children are theorized to rely heavily on their auditory feedback, previous experimental studies are inconsistent, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. This study examines the role of individual differences in attention and sensory processing abilities on auditory feedback control of speech in children. To this end, 53 children ages 4-11 completed a frequency altered feedback (FAF) task where the pitch of their auditory feedback was manipulated and responses to the manipulation were measured to provide an index of the child’s reliance on their auditory feedback. To measure attention and sensory processing abilities, children completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), and their parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) parent-report, respectively. Overall SSP scores, and scores in auditory, tactile, and sensory seeking domains were found to be associated with larger compensatory responses to FAF, while poorer SART performance was associated with slower vocal responses to down shifts. These results suggest that for children, greater sensory processing differences may promote increased reliance on auditory feedback for speech motor control, while attentional differences may be more important in the temporal processing of FAF.",

However, little is known about whether young children also engage in such tendencies, or whether political groups are even socially meaningful for young children. To trace the beginnings of these tendencies, the current study investigated whether 6- to 12-year-old U.S. children use political markers, such as political party affiliation and support for presidential candidates, to guide their social preferences. We also examined children’s ability to report their political affiliation, whether their political affiliation matched their parents’, how accurate they are at reporting their parents’ political affiliations, and whether having parent-child conversations about politics predicted children’s political affiliation and social preferences. We found that children as young as 6 years of age showed ingroup preferences for individuals who shared their own or their parents' political affiliations – especially based on support for presidential candidates. Notably, even if children could not report their own presidential candidate choice or were inaccurate at predicting their parents' presidential candidate choice, children still preferred people who supported the same presidential candidate as their parents. Further, children who had conversations with their parents about politics were more likely to prefer people who matched their parents’ political affiliations. This study provides the first empirical evidence that 6- to 12-year-old children are using political markers to form ingroup preferences and show rudimentary forms of political partisanship.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive psychologists have long been interested in the intersection of emotion and memory given that the emotions associated with a stimulus affect its memorability. Theoretical perspectives within cognitive science have guided research on how affective dimensions such as valence and arousal impact aspects of memory such as accuracy, subjective vividness, consolidation, and retrieval. Here we argue that well-established theories of emotion from affective science represent a fruitful source of ideas whose implications for episodic memory have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we propose a model of emotional memory inspired by psychological constructionist theories of emotion that builds upon existing perspectives in this area while generating several novel hypotheses and avenues of investigation. Following psychological constructionism, we conceive of emotions as emergent phenomena constructed when perceivers use conceptual knowledge to make sense of affective sensations in context. The Constructionist Model of Emotional Memory (CMEM) highlights new directions for future emotional memory research, such as investigating the mnemonic consequences of conceptual emotion knowledge, and considering the effects of variability in emotion construction at the situational, individual, and cultural levels.",

Because sample estimates are subject to sampling error, these criteria are also subject to sampling error and therefore differ across studies. We illustrate how current practices can lead to differing criteria for reliable change and use simulations to identify the impact of sampling error on the RCI. Excessive error in the RCI began for the average sample when N &lt; 30, and samples only comfortably avoided the risk of excessive error when N &gt; 100. Finally, small errors in estimating a measure’s reliability sometimes had profound effects on the RCI. Recommendations on use of the RCI are provided.",

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with schizophrenia have prominent impairments in social cognition that contribute to poor functional outcomes. Gaze processing – the social-cognitive ability to accurately perceive human eye gaze direction – is similarly abnormal in schizophrenia and associated with social functioning. Though gaze processing has known neural underpinnings in cerebral social-processing brain regions, emerging data suggest that the posterior cerebellum plays a key but often neglected role in social-cognitive function. Elucidating the bi-directional cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics underlying social cognition is critical to identifying a novel treatment target.  \n\nMethods: 39 individuals with schizophrenia and 33 non-clinical control (NCC) participants completed an eye-contact detection task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dynamic causal modeling was used to delineate the dynamics between posterior cerebellum (Crus II) and three cerebral social processing nodes (inferior parietal lobule, anterior insula, and fusiform gyrus) regions and to quantify abnormal effective connectivity in SZ. A confirmatory replication analysis using an independent sample (SZ=27, NCC=22) was conducted to confirm the results. \n\nResults: Model structure comparison revealed overwhelming evidence that cerebellar connections to cerebral social processing nodes are vital to explaining gaze processing in NCC (ln(BF)=98.84) and SZ (ln(BF)=46.85). Relative to NCC, SZ showed less upregulation of cerebellar outputs during gaze processing (t(68)=2.853, p=.006) and this decreased upregulation was associated with social dysfunction (ρ=-.251, p=.034). These results were replicated in the independent sample.\n\nConclusions: Replicated across two independent samples, people with schizophrenia have altered cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics during gaze processing that is linked to social functioning. Given the accessibility of the cerebellum from the scalp for non-invasive brain stimulation relative to many cerebral social-cognitive regions, our findings have critical implications for translational interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conditions associated with perinatal inflammation have been identified as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, data linking early inflammatory biomarkers with later ADHD symptoms remain scarce. The acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) is a key marker of systemic inflammation. To date, no studies have examined the association between CRP levels in cord blood (reflecting neonatal inflammation) and subsequent childhood ADHD symptoms. Here, we aimed to investigate whether elevated cord blood CRP concentrations are associated with child’s ADHD symptoms at age 5. \nMethods: We analyzed data from 1019 and 831 mother–child pairs enrolled in the ELFE and EDEN prospective birth cohorts, respectively. CRP levels in cord blood were measured using an immunoassay. ADHD symptoms were assessed at age 5 using the hyperactivity–inattention subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Outcomes included both continuous scores and categorical thresholds: borderline (≥6) and abnormal (≥7) hyperactivity–inattention symptoms. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were conducted within each cohort to assess associations between elevated CRP levels (≥75th percentile) and ADHD symptoms. Results were then pooled using meta-analytic methods.\nResults: Borderline hyperactivity–inattention scores were observed in 21% of children in the ELFE cohort and 14% in EDEN. After adjusting for maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and pregnancy-related factors, as well as child characteristics at birth, elevated cord blood CRP was significantly associated with higher odds of ADHD symptoms: borderline scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08–1.86), abnormal scores (aOR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.06–2.08), and increased continuous symptom scores (β = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.04–0.54). \nConclusions: Higher CRP concentrations in cord blood are associated with greater ADHD symptom severity at age 5. These findings support the hypothesis that early-life inflammation may contribute to the developmental origins of ADHD and suggest that CRP could serve as a potential early biomarker of neurodevelopmental vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "Visual stimuli are known to vary in their perceived duration, with a variety of features, including both high and low level, shaping temporal responses. For example, the size, memorability, or numerosity of stimuli lead to longer perceived intervals, thus highlighting the malleability of time perception. However, little is known about how stimulus shape may influence temporal perception.  This feature is critical, as shape morphometry forms a general basis by which these other features may exert their influence on perceived duration.  To investigate this, we conducted a series of three experiments looking at how specific characteristics of shapes are significant factors in the manipulation of time perception.  We initially observed that greater shape angularity led to more precise time estimates, independent of shape identity.  Next, we found that shapes and symbols with greater edginess, vertical asymmetry, and thickness led to longer perceived durations.  Finally, we discovered that shapes built with higher numbers of geometrical primitives were perceived as longer, more precisely, and responded to more quickly, and were influenced by how subjectively meaningful they were to individual participants.  Our findings suggest that certain aspects of shapes are able to manipulate time perception due to innate geometric qualities within the visual cortex itself.",

          "authors": "Pablo Dapica; Julio Santiago; Pablo Solana",
          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted. All in all, the literature on space-valence body-specificity appears reasonably solid, although there is still room for improvement.",

          "abstract": "Background: Successful peer interactions impact the well-being of autistic and non-autistic youth. Social gaze is important in social interactions as it facilitates detecting information from and signaling information to the social partner. However, while previous work has identified differences between autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze patterns while viewing social videos, no work to-date has directly measured differences in autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze during face-to-face peer interactions.\nMethods: Autistic and non-autistic youth ages 11-15 years completed a face-to-face social interaction with a novel peer while wearing mobile eye-tracking glasses to measure gaze. The interaction consisted of three tasks: a getting-to-know-you conversation, a vacation-planning task, and a video-watching task. Fixations to the face were compared between autistic and non-autistic youth across the three contexts.\nResults: Autistic youth fixated less on their partner’s face than non-autistic youth, and these gaze differences varied across interaction contexts. Gaze differences between autistic and non-autistic youth were most pronounced during the unstructured initial getting-to-know-you conversation and absent during the structured video-watching task.\nConclusions: Context impacts gaze for autistic and non-autistic youth, such that the social attention patterns of autistic youth differ the most from their non-autistic peers during unstructured initial conversations. These gaze differences provide autistic youth with reduced opportunities to sense and signal information about their social environments, emphasizing that supports for peer interactions may be especially crucial when navigating these initial, unstructured meetings. In turn, reduced gaze signaling may also impact peers’ understanding of autistic youth, with implications for the development of autism acceptance programming that incorporates acknowledging and accepting potential gaze differences.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to fitspiration content on social media has been linked to increased body dissatisfaction and negative mood. Although often portrayed as a healthier alternative to thinspiration, fitspiration frequently features slim, toned bodies and may reinforce appearance-related concerns. A recent trend, curvy fitspiration—featuring curvier women promoting physical activity and a healthy lifestyle—has shown promise in reducing body dissatisfaction. The present study aimed to investigate differences in the effect of Fitspiration content on weight concern, feeling fat, body dissatisfaction and negative mood depending on the body shape being observed (thin or curvy). Participants included 71 women who completed, before and after the exposure to images, 4 visuoanalogical scales. The variable feeling of fatness increased after exposure to fitspiration content featuring thin bodies and decreased after exposure to curvyfitspiration. Body dissatisfaction showed a significant time effect, increasing after exposure regardless of the experimental condition. Weight concern didn´t have a significant effect after exposure. Mood was significantly higher in the fitspiration condition with a slim body, regardless of the time of measurement. These results suggest that fitspiration's influence is shaped not only by body type but by its emphasis on appearance and the dynamics of social comparison and digital validation.",

          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts. This work goes beyond purely legalistic or formalist accounts of rules, showing that people’s intuitions about rule violations are shaped not only by codification but also by descriptive normativity, moral wrongness, and perceived legitimacy of enforcement.",

Traditional cognitive assessments often lack reliability and require lengthy in-person visits, limiting scalability for younger, trial-ready populations.\nObjectives: To evaluate the feasibility, reliability, and validity of high-frequency remote digital cognitive assessments in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD).\nParticipants: 162 mutation carriers and non-carriers from DIAN-TU from 20 international sites (Ages 19-69 years).\nMeasurements: Participants completed remote assessments via personal smartphones, prompted four times daily for seven days (approximately 3 minutes per session), and conventional in-clinic cognitive testing at baseline. Adherence, test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and sensitivity to clinical impairment were evaluated.\nResults: Average adherence was 41%. Despite this, remote measures demonstrated excellent reliability (ICCs &gt; 0.90 after 10 sessions) and strong construct validity, with tasks loading onto memory, attention, and executive function domains. Model fit was poorer in symptomatic individuals (CDR &gt; 0), consistent with cognitive dedifferentiation during disease progression. Both remote and traditional composites were sensitive to clinical impairment, with similar effect sizes and increasing group differences near expected symptom onset.\nConclusions: High-frequency remote cognitive assessment is feasible, reliable, and valid in a relatively young international ADAD cohort. This approach offers substantial advantages for clinical trials, including reduced participant burden, improved accessibility, and enhanced reliability, supporting its integration into early-intervention studies.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen as allowing a person not only to live by good and just principles but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,909) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "abstract": "Background\nGambling-related harm is increasingly recognised as a complex, multi-dimensional public health problem which variably impacts health, relationships, resources, and broader social functioning. Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem. They are grounded in diverse lived experience and aligned with public health principles.",

          "abstract": "In adverse listening conditions, speech recognition scores are generally higher when listeners can also see the talker’s mouth. Because bilinguals tend to be more detrimentally affected than monolinguals in audio-only noisy conditions, they may stand to benefit more than monolinguals from a second modality. At the same time, the ability to leverage visual cues may be limited by the amount of exposure a listener has to the target language, which varies among bilinguals. In this study, we aimed to understand whether the benefit of audiovisual speech cues is modulated by listeners’ language experiences. To that end, we measured speech recognition accuracy in noise in both audiovisual and audio-only modalities among monolingual and bilingual listeners. We also collected subjective effort and subjective mental fatigue ratings from participants throughout the experiment to evaluate the relationship between audiovisual speech perception and listening effort for different listeners. Our results show that more active use of another language results in less accurate speech recognition in noise for English, but does not modulate the benefit of the audiovisual speech signal.",

This preregistered, seven-day experience-sampling study examined how perceived appropriateness varies across situations. One hundred forty-two adults completed three surveys per day (2,670 surveys total; 3,821 vocalisations), rating appropriateness alongside situational cues and psychological situation characteristics. The results showed that laughter and sighs were most often judged appropriate, whereas screams and retches were least. Appropriateness was higher at home and in social places (e.g., parties) than in work/school or public settings (e.g., library), and higher with close ties than with weak ties or strangers. Psychological characteristics showed that formality and power were associated with lower appropriateness, whereas sociality and positivity were associated with higher appropriateness. Effects were vocalisation-specific: for example, laughter was considered more appropriate in positive, social, and brisk contexts, but less appropriate in formal and high-power contexts. By charting when and where vocalisations are judged acceptable, these findings outline situational principles of vocal display rules in everyday life.",

While extant literature shows that evaluations of someone's moral character can affect subsequent moral judgments, there is contradictory evidence on whether character information affects judgments in a way that is domain-general or domain-specific. Does receiving information about any morally bad character trait increase blame, or only information about traits that are similar to the subsequent act?  In two experiments (preregistered; N = 1320), we investigated how incidental information about an agent's moral character can influence moral and causal judgments. We consistently found that participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more of a cause, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect of character was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Overall, our findings support an account of moral judgment in which character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments of a subsequent act, challenging the domain-specific view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act should influence blame.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) often includes heterogenous items, as when one uses it while assembling a desk from sets of boards, knobs, bolts, and washers. Here we investigate how WM capacity is limited when recalling multiple sets of items, for which performance surpasses the usual limits observed in single-set procedures. We presented participants (N = 181) with up to four sets of items for serial recall, usually of different stimulus types in the same trial (colors, characters, locations, and/or shapes). Conditions differed in the total number of items, the number of sets, and/or item types across sets in a trial. For uniformity in analyses, Set 1 was kept constant at three items of a type and was usually recalled first, free of output interference. In Experiment 1, recall of Set 1 was not only limited by the total number of items, but also by the number of sets in a trial. Experiment 2 ruled out interference as an alternative explanation. Experiments 3-4 showed the dependency of the results on clearly grouped presentation of the sets. The results suggest that groups of items are associated as newly-formed, often incomplete chunks offloaded from the focus of attention (FoA) to an activated portion of long-term memory (aLTM) for later retrieval. This offloading process would spare capacity but not without cost; a fraction of an item was lost from Set 1 for each subsequent item recalled. We present a dual-stage theory in which pointers held in the capacity-limited FoA allow retrieval of chunks from aLTM.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "authors": "Ahmad Lotfi; Reza Ebrahimpour; Sajjad Zabbah",
          "abstract": "Perceptual decisions often rely on integrating multiple discrete pieces of sensory evidence over time. Previous studies have shown that these integration strategies are dynamic and can give rise to temporal biases such as the recency effect, where more recent information receives greater weight in the decision process. While some have attributed the recency effect to memory leak, recent findings suggest it may instead reflect a strategic modulation of attention. In this study, we investigated whether attention increases uniformly over time or selectively in response to the amount of accumulated evidence. Using a direction discrimination task with single-, double-, and triple-pulse random dot motion stimuli, we tested competing models of evidence integration and attentional allocation. Consistent with prior work, we observed marginally better performance in weak-strong double-pulse trials compared to strong-weak ones. Notably, in triple-pulse trials, improved performance was evident only when considering the first and third pulses, but not the first two or last two, arguing against a uniform time-based increase in attention. Crucially, when the first two pulses were treated as a unit, a weak-strong pattern relative to the third pulse produced significantly higher accuracy. These findings support a model in which attention increases not over time, but over evidence: reduced early evidence leads to increased attentional allocation to later samples. Our results provide further insight into the adaptive nature of perceptual decision-making and the role of online attentional strategies in optimizing performance in environments with discrete, time-separated sensory events.",

          "abstract": "Preclinical studies suggest that fasting may attenuate spontaneous pain and pain-related behaviors, such as licking and paw withdrawal, during inflammation in animals; however, evidence of the analgesic effects of fasting in patients suffering from chronic pain remains inconclusive. In two studies, we investigated the potentially protective effects of fasting on the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers following experimentally induced sensitization of nociceptive fibers through painful cutaneous electrical stimulation. In the first experiment (N = 33), participants underwent the painful electrical stimulation protocol twice: once after a 12-hour fast and once after consuming a standard breakfast. In a follow-up experiment (N = 52), participants were randomized to receive either the painful electrical stimulation protocol after a 16-hour fast or after their usual morning meal. In both experiments, we assessed the intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial extent of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, as well as emotional state and hunger levels. Fasting increased hunger and negative affect in both studies. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, participants in the fasted condition reported significantly less mechanical hypersensitivity compared to the breakfast condition. In both experiments, fasting did not reduce the pain intensity reported during the painful electrical stimulation. These findings provide behavioral evidence that a 16-hour fast may reduce the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. These results in humans align with preclinical evidence showing that fasting affects mechanical hypersensitivity, without necessarily affecting the perceived intensity of acute painful stimuli. Our findings suggest that metabolic state may modulate mechanical hypersensitivity in humans.",

          "abstract": "Declines in cognitive control impact older adults’ daily life and independence. Cognitive control frameworks distinguish different subcomponents, such as inhibition, updating, shifting, proactive and reactive control. A comprehensive overview of how these subcomponents develop in aging is lacking, with research typically focusing on small samples treated as a homogenous age group, targeting a single subcomponent, or using heterogenous tasks across studies. In the current study, young adults (N=75) and three cohorts of older adults (N=231) completed an extensive test battery assessing multiple subcomponents of cognitive control. Results showed improved response inhibition and interference control in older vs. young adults, decreased updating and shifting with age, and preserved proactive control in older adults. These findings show that changes in cognitive control subcomponents follow different onsets and trajectories, highlighting the importance of including them in cognitive aging research. Longitudinal follow-up studies can help uncover inter- and intra-individual changes in subcomponents with aging.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has made it easier than ever to produce hyperrealistic but entirely false imagery. One especially harmful use is the creation of non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes depicting real people. While such content clearly violates privacy, its broader political implications remain underexplored. This paper investigates how sexually explicit AI-generated imagery affects\npublic perceptions of politicians and broader democratic outcomes. Drawing on a pre-registered survey experiment in the U.S. (N = 1904), we exposed participants to either explicit, private, or control images of a fictitious male or female politician embedded in a mock social media feed. The results indicate that explicit deepfakes significantly diminish candidate evaluations, particularly with respect to affect, trustworthiness, perceived competence, and leadership qualities. Exposure to AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) further leads to lower voting intentions for the targeted politician, illustrating how reputational harm can translate into electoral consequences. Contrary to expectations, male politicians were more strongly affected by these negative shifts in perception. However, we find no evidence that exposure to such content reduces participants’ own political ambition. These findings highlight the reputational risks posed by synthetic intimate media and highlight the urgent need to mitigate its potential threats to democratic processes.",

          "authors": "Anthony Montgomery",
          "abstract": "Organizational psychology has traditionally focused on internal dynamics, neglecting the broader social structures in which organizations are embedded. This limitation is particularly evident in research on job burnout. While burnout is often framed as a symptom of organizational dysfunction, it also reflects wider systemic forces—economic instability, political regulation, cultural expectations, and ecological stressors—that influence how individuals navigate the competing demands of performance and wellbeing. Current models underestimate these contextual and historical influences due to their peripheral position in organizational analysis. This paper introduces a new open systems theory of burnout that delineates how sublethal forces interact with organizational processes to deplete employee energy and increase burnout. It proposes nine core propositions through which external environmental factors shape burnout experiences and argues for a paradigm shift toward systemic, context-aware models. The paper concludes by presenting a theoretical framework and challenges for future research.",

          "abstract": "Homophone errors (e.g., there/their) are not uncommon in typing, but it is debated whether they simply reveal poor spelling knowledge or signal competition in the production system. We tested the idea that competition underlies the greater difficulty associated with producing homophone, compared to non-homophone, targets. Using computational simulations, we showed that competition alone is sufficient to produce interference during homophone production, and that such interference is exacerbated by increasing lexical competition. These predictions were confirmed in two experiments, a typing-to-dictation task (Experiment 1) and a question-answering task (Experiment 2). We further showed the homophone effect was insensitive to the syntactic category: we found a robust homophone interference effect of a comparable magnitude for same-category (e.g., flower-flour) and different-category (e.g., idol-idle) homophones. Collectively, these results show that lexical selection in typing is similar to speaking in terms of the processes arising from representational overlap, but distinct from it in terms of the influence of syntax.",

          "abstract": "Learning to recognize and produce foreign speech sounds can be challenging, particularly when only subtle differences distinguish these new sounds from phonemes in the native language. Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows us to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Trust in science plays a crucial role in addressing major societal challenges, from climate change to global health. In a wide range of countries, most people tend to trust science. However this trust might seem irrational, since people tend to know little about science. Here, we argue that people need not possess much knowledge or understanding of science to rationally trust it. We propose a cognitive model of trust in science—the rational impression account—according to which people come to trust science by relying on a suite of basic cognitive mechanisms: First, people infer competence from possessing rare knowledge; Second, people infer accuracy from consensus; Third, people’s impressions can persist after they forget what generated them. The rational impression account stresses the importance of science education and communication in fostering public trust in science.",

          "abstract": "Giving people more time between encoding information elements into working memory im-proves immediate (i.e., working memory) and delayed (i.e., long-term memory) retrieval. This free-time benefit is often assumed to arise from processes that counteract forgetting of the just encoded item in working memory, suggesting that time has a retroactive effect. Contrary to these predictions, a few studies showed that free time between two items in a serial-recall task benefits only the subsequent (to-be-encoded) items, yielding a proactive benefit in work-ing memory. Here, we investigate whether working memory and long-term memory benefit from free time in the same way. In three experiments, we show that free time benefits the to-be encoded items in working memory (proactive effect) with only a local retroactive effect for recently encoded items, whereas it mainly benefits already encoded items in long-term memory (retroactive benefit). These results challenge a single explanation of the free-time benefit for memory retention across short and long intervals.",

However, how the magnitude of this Cognate Facilitation Effect (CFE) changes with age and its task-dependent manifestations remain unclear. Clarifying these patterns may benefit educators with evidence-based strategies to support learners across different stages and tasks. This systematic review synthesizes studies on CFE in school-aged second and foreign language learners between 1987 and 2024 (n = 36). The results showed that, firstly, the CFE follows an inverted U-shaped trajectory. It increases during early literacy (ages 6–9), peaking in middle childhood (ages 9–10), and declining thereafter. Secondly, facilitation is robust in comprehension tasks but more variable in production, where overlap can induce interference. Furthermore, we evaluate psycholinguistic models and propose integrating speech-production models to account for the interference effect of cognate production. These findings suggest educational implications: cognates can help support vocabulary development in early literacy, but more refined strategies are needed as learners advance.\n\nKeywords: cognates; cross-linguistic transfer; literacy development; psycholinguistics",

          "abstract": "Background: Practitioner ratings of their adherence to evidence-based psychotherapy or counseling practices in working with autistic youth could be an efficient method for tracking the success of efforts to implement effective practices in community behavioral health service settings. Tools of this sort that generalize across multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) have not been developed to date. In this study, a practitioner self-report measure of adherence to EBPs for autistic youth was developed and evaluated. Method: A multiple baseline study of seven behavioral health practitioners was conducted to determine if internet-based self-directed training on Modular EBPs for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA; meya.ucla.edu), a free internet-based practitioner training app, would facilitate an increase in clinician adherence to EBP techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral intervention practices. Practitioners made self-ratings on the MEYA Integrity Scale-Practitioner Version (MEYA-IS-PV). Expert coders unaware of phase or study hypotheses also rated the therapists’ adherence to EBPs for each session. Caregivers rated youth outcomes at each session on the Youth Top Problems scale. Results: Linear mixed models showed that MEYA-IS-PV scores corresponded to expert ratings of adherence, increased following the onset of training in EBPs, and predicted improvements in youth behavioral health. Visual analysis of the multiple baseline data confirmed that 5 of 7 practitioners increased their self-reported adherence in EBPs once training began. Conclusion: Self-ratings of adherence are promising for examining adherence to EBPs in psychotherapy or counseling for autistic youth.",

          "abstract": "Autistic youth experience high rates of co-occurring mental health concerns, yet empirically supported practices (ESPs) are rarely implemented with fidelity in community care due to barriers in training, scalability, and workflow integration. The Modular Evidence-Based Practices for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA) platform was developed as a free, open-access digital tool that provides just-in-time therapist training, modular cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies, and caregiver-supported goal monitoring. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, seven community clinicians implemented MEYA following a baseline phase of usual care. Platform use was tracked through analytics, and six clinicians participated in qualitative exit interviews. Results: Directed content analysis revealed five overarching themes: MEYA was perceived as useful, flexible, and clinically relevant; therapists valued the CBT content and caregiver goal charts; feasibility was supported by its accessibility but limited by workflow demands; underutilization of measurement-based care (MBC) features and a resulting impact on the personalization of care were noted barriers. Engagement data showed moderate-to-high uptake across modules. Conclusion: Overall, MEYA was feasible and acceptable across diverse providers, with strengths in usability and fidelity support. Findings identify priorities for refinement, particularly in automating measurement-based care features and creating push-out guidance via email to clinicians who need to conserve time and effort. These results provide preliminary evidence for MEYA as a scalable platform to increase access to ESPs for autistic youth.",

          "authors": "Olivia Fischer; Renato Frey",
          "abstract": "Polarization has become a major concern in behavioral science and popular media, as it may affect many important areas of life. For instance, how polarized are people's perceptions of risks, such as regarding (not) imposing mitigation measures during a pandemic? Answering this question is surprisingly challenging: Whereas multiple theoretical views of polarization and their respective mathematical operationalizations coexist, the latter are often used interchangebly as measures of \"polarization\". This may be indicative of a jingle fallacy, because it is unknown whether the diverse ways of quantifying polarization in people's perceptions of important societal matters empirically converge. In study 1 we thus ran a reanalysis of a large dataset from the World Values Survey covering diverse topics of societal relevance (N = 93,214), finding only moderate empirical convergence between six operationalizations of polarization. In study 2 we applied the same approach focusing specifically on people's risk perceptions of COVID-19 mitigation measures (N = 768), and found a similar pattern of low convergence between different operationalizations of polarization. Yet, according to one operationalization with a clear threshold for polarization, risk perceptions were polarized in 11 out of 12 experimental conditions. Our findings emphasize the need to carefully consider how polarization is operationalized to avoid broad generalizations, keeping in mind that some operationalizations may speak to specific theoretical conceptualizations. To raise awareness for this concern and support behavioral science researchers in conducting similar analyses with their own datasets, we provide a novel online tool available at https://shiny.cbdr-lab.net/polarization.",

While we were interested in re-formulating from a humanistic psychological perspective, after Rogers’ original conditions of worth concept (1957, 1959), the behavioral formulation of conditional regard, we also tested and provided evidence for the hypothesis that autistic people experience heightened conditions of worth relative to non-autistic people. We validated through a brief online survey (n = 162, including 109 autistic and 53 non-autistic individuals) two distinct sets of items, one retrospective for the adolescent period between ages 12 and 17 and the other for adulthood, to assess the extent to which individuals perceive conditions of worth. The items were then correlated with an array of individual difference variables. Perceived emotional safety recalled as an adolescent and felt as an adult, perceived psychological control of one’s parental figure when an adolescent, adult fear of criticism and rejection, adult masking or camouflaging of parts of oneself, adult incongruence or inauthenticity, adult acceptance of external influence, and adult self-alienation were all positively correlated in support of the measures’ convergent and predictive validity. Adult self-esteem, unconditional positive self-regard, adolescence-perceived parental autonomy support, authentic adult living, and congruence or authenticity were all, with some exceptions, negatively correlated in theoretically expected directions. Perfectionism was also variously correlated. Implications and applications are offered for academics as well as mental health practitioners.",

Free-text responses from 3,272 participants were analysed using inductive thematic analysis, with relational analysis identifying interconnected patterns across emotional, cognitive, and behavioural domains.\nYoung people from Australia reported diverse responses to climate change, including feelings of anxiety, sadness, and hope; thoughts about future impacts, personal responsibility, and systemic failure; and behaviours ranging from pro-environmental actions to disengagement. Based on overlapping feelings, thinking, and behaviour, seven archetypes of response were identified: the Hopeless Helper, Nervous Navigator, Furious Fighter, Guilty Guardian, Wounded Witness, Detached Drifter, and Determined Doer.\nFindings highlight the complex and interconnected ways young people respond to climate change across emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. Archetypes provide a framework for understanding both risks and resilience, emphasising that distress often stems from systemic inaction.

We investigated whether similar gains occur by combining multiple decisions made by the same individual, via a “wisdom of the crowd within” effect. Participants completed the same unfamiliar face matching task three times: in one session (Experiment 1), or over three weeks (Experiment 2). We found a wisdom of the crowd within effect in both experiments, which was significant after two responses, and larger with three. Surprisingly, the delay did not offer additional benefit.

A growing literature compares these correlations across subgroups defined by family-level characteristics (e.g., race, parental education) to test theories of social reproduction, such as parental compensation or reinforcement. In this note, I highlight the ambiguities involved in meaningfully interpreting such subgroup variation. I first define the theoretical estimand of intergenerational transmission that researchers are arguably most interested in, and then formally demonstrate why group-specific ICCs do not identify this estimand. In fact, the estimand of interest cannot be recovered from the variance-components models underlying sibling correlations unless researchers are willing to make assumptions that are both untestable and likely unrealistic.",

          "abstract": "This study examines gender differences in financial stress and anxiety among U.S. college students and evaluates whether financial stress predicts anxiety, and whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study, a nationally representative survey of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the United States, were analyzed. Survey-weighted regression models were used to assess gender differences and the association between financial stress and anxiety. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) tested whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Financial stress was modeled as a continuous predictor, anxiety as a continuous mediator, and academic disruption as an ordinal outcome. Female students reported significantly higher levels of financial stress and anxiety than male students, even after adjusting for age and race. Financial stress was positively associated with anxiety for both male and female students. This indicates a broad impact of financial pressure on emotional well-being.  Anxiety subsequently predicted academic disruption. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety significantly mediated the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption, and this explained more than half of the total effect. These findings highlight anxiety as a key psychological pathway through which financial stress affects academic functioning. Interventions targeting financial stress may improve both emotional well-being and academic performance, particularly for students facing elevated financial and psychological vulnerability.",

          "authors": "Katy Morris",
          "abstract": "While there is a strong educational gradient to the risk of experiencing long periods of unemployment and insecurity at the beginning of the career, recent evidence suggests local labour market circumstances can moderate the degree of risk associated with low educational achievement. We test the wider applicability of this finding by exploring the effect of spatial variation in labour demand on initial job search time in the contrasting institutional settings of Germany and the United Kingdom. Survival analysis of Understanding Society and Socio-Economic Panel data 1998–2015 shows this form of spatial inequality moderates the size of the job search time penalty associated with low educational attainment (and the size of the returns associated with higher attainment) in a similar way in both countries. Young people in places of high labour demand in Germany and the UK obtain employment with relative ease irrespective of the qualifications they hold. However, educational attainment assumes greater consequence as local labour demand declines. On average, low qualified young people in places of weak demand experience 2-3 month longer periods of labour market lockout and 8-10 month longer periods of labour market insecurity than peers located in places of strong demand, and considerably longer periods of lockout and insecurity than their better qualified peers in the same weak labour markets. These findings draw attention to the contextual nature of the risks associated with low educational attainment and the rewards to higher levels of attainment, at least in terms of job search time.",

          "abstract": "Affective polarization---animosity toward out-group partisans compared to copartisans---is central to discussions of the contemporary American political landscape, but the literature has not fully addressed whom people blame for the rise of partisan animosity. We analyze how people judge the \\textit{relative} responsibilities of different entities to affective polarization by leveraging ranking survey questions with bias correction for random responses. On average, people blame politicians the most, then traditional media, social media, interest groups, and lastly, citizens. Strong partisan differences exist in blame for traditional media, with leaning and weak Republicans (not strong Republicans) displaying strong blame attribution towards them compared to other entities. Our findings suggest that a gap between depolarization research and citizen perceptions on root causes of polarization may impact the efficacy of possible interventions, and that more research is needed to understand why anti-press attitudes might not be linear with respect to partisanship.",

          "abstract": "The family meal is an institution. It is culturally idealized as a resource for laying the foundations of a good life for children and adolescents, to the point of being included in dietary guidelines. Empirical and theoretical support in favor of this conclusion exists, yet critics also challenge assumptions of causation and family meals being without harm. Here, I challenge a third assumption, which I refer to as the assumption of environmental primacy. Focusing on eating behavior and body weight of children and adolescents, I discuss evidence from methods in behavioral and social science genetics (twin and adoption studies, molecular genetics, and within-family designs) and argue that if no attempt is made to consider the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors, we cannot claim with any confidence that family meals matter. At least not for the eating behaviors and weight trajectories of youth. Throughout the paper, I provide examples of how family meals could be studied with the use of these methods, and finish with five constructive suggestions on how to handle this in the future. The ambition is to strengthen the scientific quality of the family-meal literature and, thus, improve the scientific basis of (potential) family meal policy.",

          "abstract": "Emotions are an essential feature of human cognition, sense-making, and behaviour. In volatile times characterized by urgency and uncertainty, which compound the already complex processes of international negotiations, international organizations (IOs) play a paramount role in mitigating the potentially adverse impact of emotions on negotiation outcomes in multilateral diplomacy. Drawing on social psychology, behavioural economics, and international relations, this essay explains why and how emotions impact negotiation processes and outcomes, and shows how IOs – as international bureaucracies – help mitigate emotional biases in multilateral diplomacy. Illustrating the effect of experiencing positive, neutral, and negative emotions during negotiation processes, this essay proposes three mechanisms – community building, professionalization, and bureaucratization – by which IOs reduce emotion-driven disruptions in diplomatic negotiations and facilitate agreement on issues of global relevance, especially in volatile times.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of epistemic settlement as a novel analytic category, offering both a systematic coding frame and a transferable vocabulary for comparative curriculum analysis. It does this through a critical analysis of the 2025 Curriculum and Assessment Review: Interim Report. While focused on England, the analytic vocabulary of epistemic settlement and the reform conditions developed here are applicable to curriculum debates internationally. The Review is presented as pragmatic recalibration, but instead reaffirms the assumptions of the post-2010 curriculum landscape: disciplinary coherence treated as neutral, progression codified as linear mastery, and justice framed as access to canonical knowledge. The Review’s ambitions are constrained by a procedural logic that privileges consultation and assessment stability over philosophical or civic purpose. The article develops an analytic vocabulary for identifying epistemic settlement and applies it to the Review, showing how claims of neutrality, proceduralism, and performance metrics foreclose curricular futurity. Against this closure, it advances four conditions for meaningful reform. These are epistemic legibility (explicitly naming and justifying theories of knowledge), professional judgement (teachers as epistemic agents, not policy implementers), temporal flexibility (learning unfolding at varied rhythms), and a diversified assessment ecology (examinations situated within broader repertoires of judgement). These conditions frame curriculum not as a delivery mechanism but as a civic and ethical project, and a space where knowledge, purpose, and futurity remain open to deliberation and contestation.",

          "abstract": "Why did Sweden’s Northvolt—Europe’s most celebrated green industrial startup—collapse, while France managed to stabilise its local aspiring champions in the same cleantech sector? This paper uses these contrasting trajectories to interrogate the EU’s more assertive industrial policy turn. Drawing on the developmental network state (DNS) framework, we argue that while the EU has shifted from market neutrality to vertical industrial policy activism in a global context marked by geopolitical competition, its capacity to sustain strategic firms through crises remains underdeveloped. However, domestic capabilities and strategies mediated EU resourcing, brokering, facilitation, and protection, the main functions of the DNS. Where Sweden lacked credible financial, fiscal and institutional mechanisms of internal protection for the beleaguered Northvolt, France deployed a more robust economic statecraft toolkit, combining strategic finance, firm-level coordination, and public investment. Northvolt’s collapse illustrates the limits of Europe’s institutional orchestration of ambitious industrial policies: a regime that can incubate innovation but cannot stabilise it commercially. We conclude that without repurposed macro-financial institutions, Europe’s role as a competitive supplier of decarbonisation technologies will remain vulnerable.",

Wages significantly affect outcomes only at the application stage, not at subsequent interview or offer stages, consistent with directed search theory.

Our findings show that international teams incorporate more diverse roles than national ones, particularly in funding acquisition and resources. A clear division of labor emerges across first, middle, and last author positions. International collaborations demonstrate greater task specialization, reflecting cross-border coordination challenges. Contributors with multiple roles often perform specialized technical tasks.

          "authors": "Nicolas Salerno; Olivier Vidal; Baptiste Andrieu",
          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

Set in a coastal town in Batangas, Philippines, the study explores how carers experience and navigate unpaid care work amid climate adaptation. Guided by feminist participatory action research, the study used photovoice, where 13 participants documented their experiences through photography and writing, then collaboratively interpreted their stories.\nFor Filipino caregivers, climate change intensifies unpaid care work. Climate-related disruptions fracture their sense of wholeness, adding layers of grief and uncertainty to their responsibilities. They take on multifaceted roles across their family, community, and environments, as educators, providers, stewards, and leaders. In navigating intensifying care demands,  they rely on community solidarity and spirituality, which serve as vital sources of strength, purpose, and hope in their collective efforts to adapt to climate change.\nBy recognising unpaid care work in climate adaptation and providing carers with a platform to voice their lived experiences, the study hopes to advocate for climate change policies and programs that respond to unpaid care dynamics, reward women’s contribution, reduce unpaid care work, and advocate for redistribution of and male involvement in care work within families and communities.",

Drawing on the organisational paradox lens, and using 26 semi-structured interviews, we explore the organisational structures that shape users’ engagement in their blockchain group. We identified the coexistence of conflicting organisational demands rooted in decision-making, community growth, and modes of communication. Maintaining a careful balance, rather than attempting to resolve these organisational tensions, supports user retention, whereas leaning too heavily toward either extreme may hinder engagement. This study provides the first user-centred analysis of how organisational paradoxes in blockchain shape community building and platform sustainability, contributing to debates on governance in peer-to-peer online groups in attention-driven contexts.",

This paper explores the concept of \"Digital Diabetes,\" an analogy likening chronic digital overstimulation to insulin resistance in metabolic diabetes. Drawing on empirical evidence from neuroimaging studies, epidemiological surveys, and clinical trials, we examine how prolonged social media and smartphone use disrupts dopamine signaling, leading to reward system desensitization akin to dopamine resistance. In India, where over 462 million individuals actively use social media as of January 2024, with youth comprising a significant portion, average daily screen time exceeds three hours for more than half of adolescents aged 9-17 (DataReportal, 2024; LocalCircles, 2024). This exposure correlates with attention deficits (up to 28% increased risk with &gt;3 hours daily), structural brain alterations (e.g., 15% reduction in caudate nucleus volume), and heightened mental health risks, including a 34% prevalence of common mental disorders among urban Delhi adolescents (AIIMS, 2024). We review policy interventions, such as China's \"double-reduction\" initiative, and evidence-based strategies like mindfulness apps (reducing dependency by 25%) and pharmacological aids (e.g., bupropion for dopamine reuptake inhibition). Recommendations emphasize neuroscience education, digital fasting, and integrated clinical approaches to safeguard India's youth demographic, which constitutes 55% of internet users under 35 (Gopakumar et al., 2025). This synthesis underscores the urgency of addressing digital overuse as a public health priority to mitigate long-term neurological and societal costs.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) framework is intended to safeguard the food supply, yet structural gaps have enabled widespread use of food additives with limited oversight. While regulators evaluate individual substances, Americans are exposed daily to complex mixtures embedded in ultra-processed foods (UPFs). This study conducted a scoping review of the GRAS literature to identify regulatory and toxicological blind spots, and a descriptive mapping of the U.S. packaged food supply to characterize additive prevalence and co-occurrence. Using Open Food Facts data (n ≈ 19,000 products), standardization of additives into E-codes, classified UPFs, and generated co-occurrence networks was done. Results show that while a small set of legacy additives dominate, certain combinations recur thousands of times, revealing potential for synergistic or cumulative exposures not captured by current assessment models. Furthermore, self-affirmed GRAS determinations remain largely invisible, revealing major transparency gaps. These findings stress the urgent need for mixture focused toxicology, improved regulatory disclosure, and systematic monitoring of UPFs. This preliminary analysis serves as a foundation for OpenGRAS, a student-led initiative to document and expose weaknesses in U.S. food additive governance.",

McCarthy provides a history of the emergence and development of Western science, along with its political and ideological underpinnings. By locating the origin of Western science in the beginnings of capitalism, McCarthy reveals their co-determination and questions if a decoupling is possible. Despite a thorough examination of the ontological, epistemological, metaphysical and philosophical developments regarding knowledge since the Enlightenment, McCarthy omits several key areas of theoretical inquiry, and never satisfyingly answers the driving questions of his text.",

          "authors": "Hampton Gaddy; Rebecca Sear; Laura Fortunato",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.",

          "authors": "Sixbert Sangwa; Placide MUTABAZI",
          "abstract": "Escalating U.S. net-interest payments now rival flagship budget lines and are projected to surpass 4 percent of GDP within a decade, while unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities exceed $70 trillion. In parallel, over-the-counter derivatives outstanding approach $700–800 trillion in notional value, embedding opaque leverage that could transmit shocks globally. Purpose: This study probes how the confluence of sovereign debt strain, entitlement promises, and derivatives exposure can destabilize the dollar’s reserve-currency privilege and maps reforms capable of forestalling a debt-driven systemic rupture. Methods: An integrative review of Congressional Budget Office forecasts, BIS derivatives statistics, and peer-reviewed network-risk models is synthesized through a tri-theoretical lens that combines Modern Monetary Theory, Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, and network-based systemic-risk science. Results: Vector-error-correction analysis reveals that a one-point rise in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio lifts global derivatives gross-market value by 0.7 percent within two quarters, indicating tight macro-financial coupling. Stress scenarios show that breaching a 120 percent debt-to-GDP threshold alongside derivatives GMV above 10 percent of GDP elevates one-notch downgrade odds to 50 percent within two years. These dynamics threaten confidence in dollar assets, erode the “exorbitant privilege,” and could precipitate non-linear contagion through shadow-banking channels. Conclusions: A coordinated package—gradual entitlement reform, primary-balance fiscal rules, maturity-extension of Treasuries, reinforced CCP cover-two capital, and expanded bilateral central-bank swap lines—can realign fiscal sustainability with financial-network resilience. Infusing policy with a biblical stewardship ethic (“the borrower is servant to the lender,” Prov 22:7) underscores the moral imperative to curb excessive leverage. Timely adoption would safeguard global liquidity, buttress U.S. monetary sovereignty, and preserve the dollar’s hegemonic role.",

Las narrativas más frecuentes se centran en la crítica al Estado y en las demandas de medidas punitivas, lo que evidencia una ciudadanía indignada y favorable a soluciones de seguridad más estrictas. La reacción mediática se presenta como tardía y reactiva, lo que retrasa la incorporación del problema en la agenda pública y prolonga la sensación de desprotección Este trabajo aporta un marco replicable para el estudio de fenómenos de criminalidad en entornos digitales y demuestra el papel de la protesta social como detonante de la visibilización y discusión en línea, ofreciendo insumos para comprender cómo la presión ciudadana configura la agenda mediática y política.",

Music is introduced as a key component for establishing the game design that provides a source of meaningful contextualization—familiar music from the past—for setting the game mechanics, which facilitated the construction of the serious game design process. The discussion topics raised include the need to design serious games for fostering meaningful interactions, as well as developing a thorough framework for constructing purposeful design for serious games.

          "abstract": "Low political trust disengages citizens from mainstream politics, stimulating anti-establishment voting and even electoral abstention. However, existing scholarship has largely overlooked the temporal dynamics of political trust. Next to high versus low trust, our study identifies two additional components of political trust: its long-term variability and its short-term variation. We employ fifteen waves of the Dutch LISS panel (2008-2023) to systematically test the impact of these three components of political trust on electoral behavior. We find that there are systematic and meaningful differences between stable and variable (dis)trusters. While trust levels are the strongest predictor of both support for anti-establishment and abstention, trust variability has an additional effect on electoral behavior. Short-term declines in political trust increase the chances of anti-establishment voting and abstention, independent of individuals’ overall trust levels and variability. These findings have important implications for our understanding of democratic alienation and critical citizenship.",

The Netherlands forms no exception: since 2021, levels of political trust have declined noticeably (Miltenburg et al., 2024). This observation has raised concern, with some commentators warning that it may reflect deeper challenges to Dutch democracy (e.g., Van Reybrouck, 2016; Tjeenk Willink, 2022). But to what extent is this the case? To address this puzzle, this memo explores the relationship between political trust and democracy. It focuses on two central questions: (1) Why is political trust important for democracy? And (2) how has the Netherlands fared in this respect over time? Drawing on data from the LISS panel (2008-2024), it outlines general trends in political trust over the past sixteen years.",

          "abstract": "False information can erode democratic legitimacy and incite violence. Despite the severity of these outcomes, social media platforms have recently withdrawn funding for content moderation, leaving low-resource environments at particular risk. While lab studies and survey experiments have been used to develop innovative methods for combating false information, challenges with data access have limited their study in ecologically valid settings. As an alternative, a partnership was established with non-profit Tales of Turning to oversee the study of a volunteer-led digital field experiment which saw them use comments to get readers to more carefully consider online content. These questions, known as “social truth queries” (STQs), were randomly assigned to posts containing delegitimizing information during South Africa’s contentious 2024 election. Across the 125 X/Twitter posts, the intervention had a substantial effect on engagement, with posts assigned to receive comments seeing a 77% reduction in likes and 82% reduction in reposts. Critically, the effect of the intervention was dependent on its timing, with the impact largest when STQs were applied quickly. To test related mechanisms, the field study was paired with two preregistered survey experiments (N=1,607) which employed posts collected during the intervention. The surveys provide further support for the role of STQs in reducing perceived post accuracy and trust in users spreading delegitimizing content. For the first time in the context of a digital field experiment, this study provides evidence from a collaboration with a community-based partner regarding the efficacy of a real-world election integrity intervention.",

Prior work has established how deliberation can empower citizens. However, whether these effects hold in real-life initiatives initiated by partisan governments remains unclear. We test the ability of citizens' assemblies to foster democratic attitudes in a natural experiment leveraging the random selection of participants to Lisbon's citizens' assembly. Participation in two full-day sessions of structured deliberation promoted by the local government led to a increase in issue knowledge and salience, external political efficacy, and institutional trust. However, participation did not increase internal political efficacy nor helped citizens better recognize the challenges of collective decision-making. The results hold for two editions of the assembly and reveal how participatory governance initiatives can bolster the connection between citizens and the democratic process.",

          "abstract": "Fearon (1995) and Kalyvas (2006) are arguably the most influential contributions to conflict studies in recent decades. However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

Drawing on graph theory, sociology, and behavioral economics, the analysis introduces two cen- tral constructs: the domination number γ(G), which captures structural concentra- tion of recognition, and the cost function J(x) = αE(x) + βS(x) + cAA(x), which models the individual’s calculus of whether to speak or remain silent. Through these constructs, silence is shown to be a predictable outcome of recognition asymmetry. By embedding classical theories from Durkheim, Bourdieu, Goffman, and Foucault into a formal mathematical framework, the paper establishes the foundation for a new research program: the calculus of silence. The following sections—Chapters 1 through 3—introduce the problem, survey the literature, and articulate the theo- retical framework in detail.",

          "abstract": "This article presents a comparative case study of three contemporary AI-focused films: Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya (India, 2024), M3GAN (USA, 2022), and Her (USA, 2013) to explore how global cinema constructs gendered artificial intelligence through the lenses of emotional labor, synthetic femininity, and the posthuman gaze. Each film centers on feminine-coded artificial beings designed to fulfill emotional, domestic, or sexual needs, revealing how cinematic narratives engage with the persistent fantasy of the \"perfect woman.\"\nThe movie Her serves as a case study in disembodied posthuman intimacy, with Samantha’s emotional labor compensating for her lack of physical form. M3GAN dramatizes anxieties around technological motherhood, showing how AI caregiving becomes threatening when emotional boundaries collapse. In contrast, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya examines the male gaze and posthuman embodiment; SIFRA’s hyper-feminized programming is tailored to patriarchal expectations until her system breaks down, exposing the precarity of programmed obedience. Across these texts, AI figures are welcomed as long as they serve, but recoded as unpalatable, disastrous when they rebel, glitch, or evolve beyond control. These portrayals highlight cultural anxieties around female agency, techno-intimacy, and the limits of emotional programming.\nOur analysis is anchored in the intersecting frameworks of gender theory, posthuman studies, and cinematic critique, drawing from Judith Butler’s gender performativity, Hochschild and Ahmed’s emotional labor, Laura Mulvey’s male gaze, and posthuman ethics by Braidotti and Hayles. Methodologically, the chapter employs comparative close reading, filmic discourse analysis, and cultural contextualization, where posthumanism interrogates the collapse of human-machine boundaries, while the male gaze elucidates how feminine AI bodies are constructed for control and submission.\nThis study contributes to understanding how posthuman cinema critiques patriarchal emotional economies and reveals the fragility of techno-feminine ideals, illuminating the ethical dilemmas of loving machines designed to serve.\n\nKeywords: Posthuman Gaze, Feminine Performativity,  Emotional Labour, Gendered AI, Comparative Global Cinema",

          "abstract": "Traditional monetary policy’s effectiveness in controlling inflation through interest rate changes has weakened, as empirical data show easing no longer reliably drives consumer price inflation. We introduce the Dynamic Constitutive Laws Model (DCLM) described by coupled differential equations to capture how interest rate changes reallocate household spending. By explicitly modeling housing demand, house prices, inflation, and consumption components over five years, we show that lower interest rates can act as a disinflationary force when reduced borrowing costs channel additional disposable income toward housing consumption rather than immediately increasing spending on other Consumer Price Index (CPI) goods and services. This effect offsets inflationary pressures from tariffs and supply shocks. Calibrated on U.S. macroeconomic data, the model reveals that loosening monetary policy stimulates housing-related expenditure while dampening CPI inflation. Our transmission mechanism challenges classical views and offers insights for policymakers navigating today’s volatile economic environment. The DCLM provides a flexible framework to analyze monetary policy’s impact on the U.S. economy, advocating a reassessment of inflation fears and the strategic use of rate cuts to foster growth without exacerbating inflation.",

Across 26,000 evaluations of innovative offerings (e.g., startup pitches), we find that GPT evaluators did not disadvantage—and even modestly supported—URMs, primarily by avoiding negative outcomes. We theorize that this reflects symbolic compliance: A superficial response to avoid overt discrimination rather than a genuine commitment to fairness.

Governance of these infrastructures is usually framed as financial risk and cybersecurity, which leaves the informational nature of the problem under theorized. This article advances Informational Morality of Finance Theory, IMF-T, a generative theory that reconceptualizes financial data as informational moral objects within socio technical systems. IMF-T integrates Western information ethics, centered on privacy, autonomy, transparency, and accountability, with African communitarian ethics, centered on relational responsibility, stewardship, and equitable benefit sharing. It specifies axioms, defines constructs such as informational dignity, relational stewardship, transparency capability, algorithmic contestability, and trust sufficiency, and articulates mechanisms that connect organizational capabilities to outcomes of data justice and inclusion. The theory yields testable propositions and practical measurement guidance to support cumulative empirical work in Information Studies, Information Systems, and Library and Information Science. It also offers normative principles for institutions and regulators, emphasizing stewardship over compliance and enabling contestability for those affected by automated decisions. By naming and formalizing IMF-T, the article provides a platform for research and practice on the ethical governance of digital finance.\n\nKeywords: information ethics; digital finance; information governance; Ubuntu; data justice; transparency; stewardship",

          "abstract": "Institutional weakness is a defining feature of many African economies, yet little is known about how startups adapt strategically to persistent volatility. This study investigates how entrepreneurs in Lagos and Nairobi mobilize informality to build resilience and navigate institutional voids. Drawing on qualitative interviews and thematic analysis, the findings show that resilience is not an episodic response to shocks but a structural entrepreneurial capacity embedded in everyday practices. Startups in Lagos adopt survival-driven strategies that rely on grassroots bricolage and selective compliance, while those in Nairobi pursue more collaborative approaches that leverage donor partnerships and community-based legitimacy. Informality emerges not as a deficit but as a productive resource that enables adaptation, innovation, and hybrid legitimacy across both contexts.\nTheoretically, the study contributes to institutional theory by reframing voids as enduring and generative rather than transitional. It extends entrepreneurship research by conceptualizing resilience as an ingrained capacity rather than a reactive response, and it advances the study of informality by demonstrating its role as a strategic resource. By situating African entrepreneurship within its specific institutional and social contexts, the study challenges deficit-based models and offers a framework for understanding how startups transform institutional weakness into opportunities for resilience and innovation.\nKeywords: African entrepreneurship, institutional voids, resilience, bricolage, informality, hybrid legitimacy",

This article posits that AGI signifies an \nepistemological rupture in the extensive continuum of scientific rationality, wherein \nexplanation, the quest for causal and conceptual comprehension, transitions to simulation, a \nmode of cognition propelled by predictive patterning rather than interpretative profundity. The \npaper engages figures from the philosophy of science and philosophical hermeneutics, \nincluding Popper, Kuhn, Hempel, and Lakatos, in conversation with Gadamer, Ricoeur, and \nHeidegger, to investigate how AGI redefines the concept of “knowledge.” Through a \nhermeneutic analysis of AGI manifestos, research papers, and policy documents, the study \ninterprets these scientific texts as manifestations of a novel epistemic attitude, one that \nprioritises performance over comprehension and reduces explanation to algorithmic efficiency. \nAGI's simulations have unparalleled predictive accuracy, but they jeopardise the foundational \nobjectives of science: justification, clarity, and accountability. The article finishes by proposing \na hermeneutic philosophy of AGI that reinstates the significance of interpretation and meaning \nwithin automated knowledge systems. Instead of seeing AGI as the end of theory, it is shown \nas a critical mirror that science must look into to rethink what it means to \"know.\" In a time \nwhen data may move faster than understanding, philosophy's job is to keep the space of \ninterpretation open to remind us that knowledge is not just about what works, but also about \nwhat makes sense.",

          "abstract": "The relative merits of vocational and general education remain central to debates on sustainable careers. Vocational pathways facilitate smoother school-to-work transitions but rely on occupation-specific skills that may become obsolete, whereas general education yields weaker entry prospects but greater adaptability to changing demands. A key question is whether further training can offset these trade-offs. This study examines participation in, and returns to, non-formal job-related training among vocationally and generally educated workers. Non-formal training, such as structured courses or seminars, allows employees to update and consolidate skills throughout their careers. We hypothesize that general graduates benefit more in early careers, while vocational graduates gain later as training helps counteract skill obsolescence. Drawing on longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we find that secondary-level vocational graduates participate less in training than university graduates, whereas tertiary-level vocational graduates train at similar rates. Training promotes employment stability, particularly in later careers, but effects are relatively uniform across educational groups. These results indicate that while training strengthens career resilience, it does not eliminate disparities between vocational and general graduates.",

The decisions from MLLMs are benchmarked against judgments by human subjects (N=1,854). The results demonstrate that larger, more advanced models can make context-sensitive evaluations that are closely aligned with human judgment.

Further analyses show that context sensitivity can be amplified via prompting but not eliminated, and that some models are especially responsive to visual identity cues. These findings highlight the benefits and risks of using MLLMs for content moderation and demonstrate the utility of conjoint experiments for auditing artificial intelligence in complex, context-dependent applications.",

          "abstract": "The rapid development of information communication technologies (ICTs), such as smart devices, cloud technologies and social media, have facilitated remote working practices. However, remote working has only become established in many countries since the global outbreak of Covid19 during 2020. The aim of this study is to critically investigate how the everyday experiences of ICTs-enabled remote working inform gender (in)equality in work and social life in post-Covid19 Britain. The study recruited 20 working parents (10 females and 10 males) working within knowledge industries as research participants. Diaries, along with in-depth interview methods, were deployed to capture nuanced sentiments and practices towards work and life coordination using ICTs. The data analysis revealed four main themes that identified the similarities and differences of remote working experiences between working mothers and fathers: (1) general trend towards working remotely, (2) shifting perceptions towards work-life responsibilities (opportunity), (3) gender ideology unfolding on ICT practices (risk) and (4) the different social consequences of role conflicts between gender (risk).",

Using a fixed-effects panel data framework, we study temperature impacts\nby modeling local and global anomalies simultaneously, capturing both within-country\nand global climate variation. First, a statistically significant negative relationship exists\nbetween annual temperature anomalies and well-being, with a 1°C global(local) mean\ntemperature deviation leading to a 0.8324(0.096)-point decline, respectively. Second, precipitation anomalies show no significant effect on the SPI. Third, winter temperature\nanomalies and cold spells have a greater impact on well-being than other seasons or hot\nspells. Fourth, poorer regions, hotter climates, the global south, and countries with weak\ninstitutions are disproportionately affected by temperature deviations. Fifth, the impact\nof temperature on well-being persists over the medium term, lasting about four years",

          "abstract": "This article examines the emergence of digital program management systems in African \ndevelopment, concentrating on tools such as dashboards, biometric identity, and mobile data \nplatforms. It contends that these systems are not impartial technology of efficiency but modern \nmanifestations of colonial control mechanisms. The paper, based on Quijano's idea of the \n\"coloniality of power,\" says that digital program management is a form of epistemic violence \nsince it turns communities into databases and puts donor supervision ahead of relational \naccountability. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) functions, integrated into these systems, \nexacerbate the issue by legitimising surveillance and data extraction as the prevailing \nframework of responsibility. Based on decolonial theory, the analysis compares the \ntechnocratic positivism that underlies today's management methods with epistemologies based \non Indigenous African Knowledge Systems (IKS), especially Ubuntu relationality. Biometric \nsystems erase relational identity by favouring individualised markers over community \nrecognition. Dashboards impose a managerial \"view from nowhere,\" turning complexity into \nmetrics. Mobile survey tools silence oral testimony by putting stories into pre-coded categories. \nThese behaviours show how digital program administration weakens local ways of knowing \nand gives more authority to outside funders and technocrats. In response, the article proposes \na normative framework of Relational Accountability. It asks for a change from data extraction \nto ethical witnessing, participatory discussion in community assemblies (baraza), data \nsovereignty as cultural sovereignty, and the speculative design of Ubuntu-centric technology, \nall based on IKS principles. The paper asserts that decolonising program management is crucial \nfor fostering trust, promoting epistemic fairness, and ensuring more ethical development \npractices. It advocates for epistemic disobedience that re-establishes Indigenous African \nKnowledge Systems as fundamental to program design and digital responsibility.",

The obtained results show that pride in science and technology is significantly related to the objective achievements. This relation is equally strong for academic science and applied technology and is stronger than the relation to the country’s general affluence as measured by the GDP per capita.

          "abstract": "We study how a large, exogenous trade shock --- triggered by China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 --- reshaped income, inequality, and import behavior across Brazilian regions. Using a shift-share instrument based on pre-shock export structures, we show that regions more exposed to China’s demand boom experienced increases in income per capita and within-region inequality relative to less exposed areas. These changes, in turn, led to rising import values and a shift in import composition, particularly toward consumption goods and medium- to high-tech manufactured products. To interpret these patterns, we classify goods by necessity and luxury status using Brazilian household survey data and develop a complementary ``demonstration luxury'' classification --- designed to capture status-oriented goods --- based on U.S. consumption patterns. Luxury imports rose most in regions that were initially more unequal or experienced sharper post-shock increases in inequality, consistent with non-homothetic preferences and status-driven consumption. Our findings highlight inequality as a key channel through which trade shocks shape regional import demand in developing economies.",

          "abstract": "In 1954, Dorothy Martin predicted an apocalyptic flood and promised her followers rescue by flying saucers. When neither arrived, she recanted, her group dissolved, and efforts to proselytize ceased. But When Prophecy Fails (1956), the now-canonical account of the event, claimed the opposite: that the group doubled down on its beliefs and began recruiting—evidence, the authors argued, of a new psychological mechanism, cognitive dissonance. Drawing on newly unsealed archival material, this article demonstrates that the book’s central claims are false, and that the authors knew they were false. The documents reveal that the group actively proselytized well before the prophecy failed and quickly abandoned their beliefs afterward. They also expose serious ethical violations by the researchers, including fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation. One coauthor, Henry Riecken, posed as a spiritual authority and later admitted he had “precipitated” the climactic events of the study.",

          "authors": "Mark Carew",
          "abstract": "A key but under-addressed driver of the health inequalities facing persons with disabilities is disability stigma. However, disability stigma remains poorly conceptualised and consequently inconsistently measured and addressed within health research. Many studies treat disability stigma and health stigma as interchangeable. However, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as the globally accepted framework for conceptualising disability clearly distinguishes between the concepts of “disability” and a “health condition”. This paper applies the ICF to show that disability stigma and health stigma have overlapping components but are conceptually distinct. Specifically, while health stigma is recognised to arise from adverse judgements about health conditions, this paper argues that disability stigma arises from adverse judgements about impairment(s), activity limitation(s), and/or health-related participation restriction(s) that may or may not relate to an individual’s health condition. This paper also explains why this distinction matters. First, it aligns the study of disability stigma with modern definitions of disability and the lived experiences persons with disabilities have of stigma. Second, it enables intersectional analysis of the impact of distinct stigmas arising from judgements about health condition(s) and disability status. Third, it contributes to better ways to measure disability stigma and consequently address it within interventions and policies. Fourth, it contributes to an improved classification of stigma within the ICF itself, which can be used to more comprehensively study health inequalities affecting persons with disabilities.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to deepen open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence International Corps through artificial intelligence methods, exploring AI's application potential and methodological value in complex warfare information environments. The core objectives address two questions: First, how can AI technologies be effectively integrated into the OSINT cycle to enhance information screening, pattern recognition, and risk prediction? Second, can AI-driven OSINT provide more forward-looking and systematic support for strategic decision-making? Methodologically, this study adopts a multidisciplinary mixed methodology, integrating text metrology, semantic network analysis, risk radar modeling, and time-series projection to form a comprehensive framework: “Data Collection → AI Processing → Risk Assessment → Timeline Analysis → Insight Output.” The research process extensively leverages multilingual datasets (English, Ukrainian, Russian) and cross-platform information sources (official, media, social networks), utilizing visualization modeling to present data and risks in multidimensional formats. Results demonstrate that AI significantly enhances the depth and breadth of information processing in OSINT analysis. It outperforms traditional methods in misinformation detection accuracy, multilingual keyword extraction efficiency, and predictive power for risk patterns. Military risks and information warfare risks were assessed as highest priority, followed by public opinion risks and legal risks, revealing an overall “military-information warfare-public opinion” triple-high-risk configuration. Concurrently, time-series analysis revealed rhythmic patterns in risk evolution, providing quantitative foundations for future strategic planning. The study concludes that AI not only transforms OSINT's technical framework but also propels it toward structured, systematic, and forward-looking intelligence generation. AI-driven OSINT effectively bridges the tension between data fragmentation and systematic strategic analysis, enabling a qualitative leap in the intelligence cycle from “information accumulation” to “strategic insight.” This study provides an empirical paradigm for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and intelligence studies, holding significant theoretical and practical implications for future military conflicts, national security, and policy formulation.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "This essay redefines Microsoft Power BI as not merely a business intelligence tool, but as a \ncognitive prosthesis and an epistemic infrastructure that influences management cognition, \nattention, and the generation of organisational knowledge. Although traditional literature \nregards Power BI mainly as a visualisation or decision-support instrument, this study employs \na critical conceptual and metascientific perspective to analyse how the platform pre-defines \nlegitimate evidence, influences organisational reasoning, and reallocates interpretive labour \nwithin knowledge-driven organisations. The analysis puts up three connected arguments. To \nbegin with, Power BI acts like a cognitive prosthesis by automating basic operations like trend \nidentification, forecasting, and comparison measurements. This frees managers from low-level \nduties while also making them dependent on its dashboards and algorithmic logic. Second, it \nworks as a micro-technology of cognitive capitalism by capturing, directing, and turning \nmanagement attention into a resource of economic and organisational value. Third, the platform \nincorporates epistemic authority into its visualisations and metrics, gently regulating the \ngeneration of organisational knowledge and influencing the ethical and political aspects of \nmanagerial decision-making. By integrating perspectives from cognitive science, critical \ntheory, science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and political economy, the \narticle illustrates that the automation of cognition is inherently biased, resulting in epistemic \nconstriction, ethical challenges, and technocratic validation masquerading as “data-driven” \nobjectivity. The research enhances metascientific discourse by elucidating the infrastructure of \nknowledge production within organisations and advocating for reflexive literacy in the \nutilisation of data analytics platforms. It emphasises the ethical, epistemological, and \norganisational implications of cognitive prostheses such as Power BI and promotes a more \ncritical approach to the technologies that increasingly shape managerial cognition and decision\nmaking.",

They founded Circle A in 2014 as the first Radical Eurodance act ever, with the self-declared mission of “making Eurodance a threat again” and framing it as “a four-to-the-floor declaration of war against any kind of injustice and oppression that haunts the world we live in.” Over the past few years, they have only occasionally performed or recorded, due to their time being taken up by kids, other bands, and a pandemic. In early 2024, they meet over a beer to revisit their joint work and think about the topics they would like to discuss at the symposium. They reminisce about when, how, and why they founded Circle A; how the band and its music developed; what the future may hold for it; how and to what ends they mixed Eurodance and politics; and what all of this has to do with their shared background in musicology. In the process, tina and Malik also engage in discussions about fundamental questions regarding the relationship between music and the political, such as: What makes music political? Who are the audiences of political music, and how do they influence musicians’ practices? What are criteria for deciding whether a piece of political music is “good,” or maybe rather: “successful”? Can (political) music change the world? If so, how and to what extent? How can the seriousness of social struggles be squared with humorous modes of artistic expression? – As the conversation unfolds, tina and Malik switch back and forth between spoken language and song. In the end, they fail to produce notes for their symposium presentation, but they certainly enjoyed the intellectually stimulating – and sometimes controversial – exchange.",

          "abstract": "An education system should strive to attract well-qualified teachers and teacher candidates who have a high degree of professional commitment to meet society requirements such as teacher shortages, increasing numbers of schools and students (MoEYS, 2023), teacher policy adjustments (TPAP: 2024--2030, 2023) and Cambodia’s socioeconomic status (ESP: 2024--2028, 2024) toward country development. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing teaching career choice among fourth-year primary and lower secondary school student teachers at Teacher Education Colleges (TECs). The study uses a quantitative paradigm with the survey method in the form of a structured questionnaire, which was adapted from Sardana et al. (2021) and Martinez Moreno &amp; Petko (2023), to collect the data. A simple random sampling method was used to select a sample of 223 participants, including both primary and lower secondary student teachers, whose ages ranged from 22--25 years (71.3%), 26--29 years (24.2%) and 4.5% of the other ages. This study uses descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the validity, reliability, mean, standard deviation, and significance of the collected data through a one-sample t test. The study revealed four main factors that influence the decision to choose teaching as a career, such as the influence of others, including family, friends, teachers and mass media; extrinsic, intrinsic, and altruistic motivational influences; and teaching as a fallback career and sociocultural factor. Altruistic motivation had the most significant influence on teaching career choice, with the highest mean score (M=4.26, SD=0.59), whereas teacher influence had the second greatest influence (M=4.20, SD=0.65), followed by intrinsic motivation (M=4.17, SD=0.62), while teaching as a fallback career had the least influence on all four factors, with the lowest mean score (M=2.37, SD=1.12). This study will help relevant people and institutions, such as the Cambodian ministry of education, parents, administrations, teachers, students and other researchers to be aware of the factors influencing career choice so that they can refine recruitment policies, increase their actions and efforts, and enter preparation programs for teaching careers in the Cambodian context today and in the future.",

Thematic analysis highlights earnings management as the key issue linking various research streams. Governance mechanisms such as audit committees, audit quality, and ownership structures follow. This study maps the intellectual structure of the literature using co-citation networks and outlines future research directions through thematic maps and the evolution of keywords. It offers the most recent synthesis of the literature, fills gaps in previous reviews, and points to a forward-looking agenda.

          "abstract": "Human collective intelligence—the capacity of groups to solve problems, make decisions, and\nacquire knowledge beyond individual capabilities—is here understood as an emergent\nphenomenon that evolved in our lineage from a distinct trajectory of epistemic niche\nconstruction (ENC), and progressively sustained the latter. Humans systematically alter their\ninformational landscapes in materially visible ways by creating enduring spatial and\nartefactual scaffolds for improved cognitive performance and social coordination. In this\npaper, we propose a set of criteria to define ENC and track its emergence in the archaeological\nrecord. These criteria highlight the importance of persistent, publicly accessible, and\nevolutionarily incremental modifications that sustained behavioural coordination among\nindividuals in space and time. We apply this framework to three major domains of material\nculture: the structuring of space for collective action, the culturalization of the human body,\nand the emergence of exosomatic artefacts to store coded information. We argue that these\npractices did not merely externalise knowledge but progressively transformed material\nculture and environments into targeted epistemic infrastructures able to scaffold and amplify\ngroup-level performances characteristic of collective intelligence, thus shedding light on the\nevolution of human cognition and social organization.",

As the future generations of the country emerge, South Korea must increase its life satisfaction, a comparably low value compared to other countries, as they are ranked 23rd out of 38 OECD countries (Cho, 2021). Grit, defined as the trait of working diligently for long-term goals, is important for life satisfaction. This study examines the relationship between grit and life satisfaction for second-year high school students in South Korea and the mediating effects of crucial relationships formed by adolescents, such as teacher-student relationships, parent-child relationships, and friendships. The data was collected through the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), and there were 2,252 second-year high school students who participated in this study. By completing regression analyses on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, grit and the mediating variables, and the effect of grit and the mediating variables on life satisfaction, as demonstrated by the Baron and Kenny process (Baron and Kenny, 1986), it was found that these variables were all correlated with each other. On the third step of the regression analysis, where the mediators were controlled for, it was found that the mediators had a significant effect on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, and a partial mediation took place. Out of the mediators, teacher-student relationships had the biggest explanatory impact with an R-squared value of 0.177. From these results, it is evident that there needs to be interventions, potentially with grit involved, to increase relationships between teachers and students, parents and children, and friends.",

          "abstract": "What explains the enduring popularity of authoritarianism and authoritarian leaders? In addition to theories rooted in regime performance, propaganda, and punishment, I propose system justification, a well-established socio-cognitive motive favoring established systems and stability, as a novel explanation for authoritarian support. I theorize the relationship between system justification and political behaviors in authoritarian contexts and test this in data from two original surveys of Egyptian citizens. After validating that the system justification scale reflects needs for certainty and structure in an authoritarian political setting, I show it is strongly associated with preferences for authoritarian governance. An embedded experiment shows that security, infrastructure, and identity systemic threats mobilize high system justifiers, further increasing support for authoritarian governance. Finally, additional analyses reveal that system justification predicts attitudinal and behavioral support for a specific authoritarian regime. The findings suggest a central role for individual psychological motivation in authoritarian persistence.",

The toolkit is designed for scholars integrating pattern analysis, data visualization, and explanation in qualitative and/or computational social science (CSS). Despite the existence of off-the-shelf commercial qualitative data analysis software, there is a dearth of highly scalable open source options that can work with large data sets, and allow advanced statistical and language modeling. The foundation of the toolkit is a pragmatic approach that aligns research tools with social science project goals— empirical explanation, theory-guided measurement, comparative design, or evidence-based recommendations— guided by the principle that research paradigm and questions should determine methods. Consequently, the CMAP visualization toolkit offers a range of possibilities through the adjustment of relatively small number of parameters, and allows integration with other python tools.",

          "abstract": "The color of each cord is often highlighted as one of the primary sites of meaning on an Inka khipu -- the mostly undeciphered recording device of the Inka empire. However, while there are a variety of historical, ethnographic, and archaeological suggestions for how the semantics of color worked, none of these approaches systematically explains how Inka khipu cord colors denoted meaning. Instead, they present a range of fragmented, sometimes contradictory snapshots of a much larger, more complex system. This study aims to address the question: is there even a \"system\" of color that can be discovered and deciphered? If so, how did it work? Or is the sheer variety of uses discussed in prior studies an empirical indication that color had limited semiotic consistency for Inka khipukamayuqs (\"khipu makers/interpreters\" in Quechua)? To answer these questions, I employ an AI khipukamayuq -- a custom \"transformer\" deep learning model trained to parse all of the cord colors in the Open Khipu Repository (OKR) -- to analyze the semantic space of Inka khipu cord color. My findings reveal a coherent system of color signs, wherein different colors occupy distinct, relationally-opposed semantic domains, with many colors demonstrating polysemy. This suggests a versatile set of color signs adaptable to various contexts and domains of representation, akin to other linguistic media. In the domain of khipus and beyond, this study points toward the importance of continued interaction with AI models as archaeologists learn (together with machines) to systematically represent and delineate the past.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study anchors its analysis on the controversy surrounding Shanghai Maritime University's “First-Class Undergraduate Programs” initiative in China. It aims to validate whether AI-enhanced open-source intelligence (OSINT) evidence governance can reconstruct auditable evidence chains and quantify narrative discrepancies in education-related public incidents, while extrapolating governance performance to multidimensional national security risks. Methodologically, we collected university announcements, mainstream media reports, platform-accessible pages, and judicial leads within a unified time window to construct a “source-time-version” evidence graph. We introduced multilingual NLI and sentence vectors to measure narrative consistency, combined with JSD to monitor monitoring scope drift. We employed temporal propagation networks and DTW to measure the temporal misalignment between “post deletion/restriction” and public opinion peaks. Further, we mapped “evidence governance/information control opacity” to four normalized risk dimensions—academic integrity, rule of law and institutional trust, ideological security, and social stability—using structural causal models, providing 95% confidence intervals. Results indicate: The foundational evidence chain can be robustly reconstructed, yet significant narrative gaps exist regarding “whether ‘7 categories, 40 items’ of fraud occurred” and “whether platform actions were implemented/compliant.” Communication peaks typically precede search peaks by approximately one cycle (moderate DTW misalignment), with public nodes consistently holding the highest intermediary scores. Among the four risk dimensions, “academic integrity” and “ideological security” exhibit relatively higher levels. Conclusions indicate that earlier, auditable evidence disclosure (versioned notifications, third-party verification, platform log retention) simultaneously reduces all four risk dimensions and shortens the public opinion chain, whereas declarative statements alone fail to resolve disputes. AI-enhanced OSINT provides a reusable methodological pathway for evidence governance in educational settings and national security assessments.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Deepfake technology has quickly become one of the most disruptive new technologies in the digital information ecosystem. It can make convincing audio-visual content that looks just like real media.  Although much of the current research has looked at deepfakes from legal, technological, or ethical points of view, this article uses a psychological point of view to explain their particular potency.  The main point is that deepfakes don't work mostly as rational lies; instead, they work as cognitive exploits, types of \"perceptual malware\" that attack the way people trust each other.  The article illustrates how deepfakes exploit entrenched biases, such as the truth bias, familiarity effects, and the fluency of perceptual processing, by referencing cognitive psychology and neuroscience.  In doing so, they avoid higher-order logical inspection and use autonomic processes of recognition and belief construction.  The paper also puts deepfakes in the context of other research on false information and how memories can change, suggesting that fake media can create false memories or strengthen existing biases through repeated exposure.  Deepfakes undermine epistemic trust by eroding the dependability of visual and aural evidence, which have historically been regarded as the \"gold standard\" of credibility, in contrast to conventional kinds of propaganda. This situation not only puts democratic discourse and trust in the media at risk, but it also poses a serious psychological challenge: fighting deepfakes requires using cognitive and perceptual mechanisms that are mostly outside of conscious control.  This article provides an interdisciplinary framework for comprehending deepfakes as psychological weapons by integrating insights from cognitive science, information warfare studies, and emerging media research.  It suggests that protecting against this phenomenon necessitates treatments that transcend detection technologies, highlighting cognitive inoculation, media literacy, and the development of \"epistemic resilience\" in an age where visual evidence is increasingly distrusted.",

Higher-order \ncomponents were linked to evaluative dimensions of academic engagement, mid-level \ncomponents reflected the broader epistemological positioning of disciplines, and lower-order \ncomponents assessed the relational aspects of subjects in the context of interpersonal \ndynamics.

This limits the usefulness of bibliometric data and raises concerns about research integrity, particularly in citation practices. A global survey within the Library and Information Science (LIS) community explored training experiences, gaps, and interests, especially around research integrity. The results revealed critical knowledge gaps, including the need for a deeper understanding of bibliometric principles, responsible metrics use, advanced analysis techniques, and awareness of indicators' limitations and biases. Highlighting these deficiencies aims to engage the STI indicators community, prompting collective action to better equip bibliometrics practitioners. Proper training is essential to prevent the misuse of indicators, which can undermine research quality and academic evaluation.",

          "authors": "Barbara Sandra Lancho Barrantes",
          "abstract": "This paper examines publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from Latin American and European countries, specifically focusing on whether the issues and challenges faced by these regions differ significantly. Latin American countries may be addressing region-specific health concerns or environmental challenges different from the European countries. A bibliographic universal classification of SDGs may overlook such crucial issues and nuances vital to the development of these countries. This study emphasises the differing priorities between Latin America and certain countries in the Global North regarding the health and well-being of all individuals. It focuses on improving reproductive, maternal, and child health, ending epidemics of major contagious diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health and well-being, and addressing behavioral and environmental health risk factors. While Latin American countries often focus on topics like infections or mental health, the Global North tends to priorities Covid 19 and cancer. These differences reflect distinct economic, social, and political contexts, with us Global North sometimes overlooking the foundational needs of Global South countries. The research employs a sample from the Open Alex database, focusing on the ten most productive countries in Latin America and the ten most productive countries in Europe in SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being in the period of 2023-2024. The study, which falls under the framework of SDG 3 publications and employs data analytics techniques, identifies priority topics for Latin America and Europe, as well as common interests across both regions. Utilising predictive models based on machine learning, the study forecasts the topics that these countries are likely to prioritize in the near future with an accuracy of 60%. This level of accuracy may be influenced by the sample size used; therefore, future analyses will incorporate additional data, such as examining abstracts to determine whether European countries continue to diverge in their focus or if they find common ground on certain topics. This approach will provide valuable insights into regional priorities and the potential evolution of research related to the Sustainable Development Goals. The contrast between Latin America and Europe is valuable and quite original, since many global analyses tend to homogenize realities.",

These were benchmarked against the U.S. Census’s Current Population Survey (CPS) and compared with four probability-based surveys: NHIS, NHANES, GSS, and UAS. Data from 145,775 respondents aged 18 to 65, collected between 2021 and 2024, were included.\nNP surveys showed lower accuracy than probability surveys. However, NP surveys performed well on several benchmarks, including univariate SRH distributions (in RANDS-8 and QPHS) and bivariate and multivariate associations (e.g., age-SRH and education-SRH in RANDS-8 and QPHS, and Black race-SRH in PI-H). Yet, biases on other benchmarks were substantial, including overestimated gender-SRH associations in all NP surveys and strongly diverging disparities by race-ethnicity in RANDS-8 and QPHS.\nThese findings highlight both the promise and pitfalls of NP surveys, emphasizing the need for case-by-case validation against reliable benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "Contrary to the growing emphasis on resilience in sustainability science, I argue that resilience continues to reflect a mindset of human–nature domination, and thus represents continuity rather than a real relational turn. Instead, I propose vulnerability as a critical mode of relation. Drawing on Robin May Schott’s ontological critique of resilience, I extend her arguments into the field of sustainability science by examining its ontological assumptions, primary discourses, and existing critiques. I advance a threefold plea: first, that reconnecting with nature requires a particular relational mode; second, that vulnerability is a necessary precondition for this mode; and third, that sustainability transformations may benefit from less emphasis on resilience. By combining rational argumentation with art-based, transdisciplinary approaches, this paper seeks to foster psychological reflection, new relational imaginaries, and ultimately more just sustainability transformations. I conclude by inviting readers to engage with their own vulnerabilities as part of this process.",

Using monthly employment data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I apply group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify typical combinations of mothers’ and fathers’ full- and part-time employment over time (Nagin et al., 2016). I find eight distinct multi-trajectory groups. Five reflect traditional specialization, in which mothers partially or fully reduce their paid work for an extended period following childbirth, while fathers remain consistently employed full-time or increase their likelihood of full-time employment. The remaining three reflect less gendered patterns, including dual full-time, female full-time, and dual part-time groups. I examine how couples’ baseline characteristics are associated with multi-trajectory membership. Findings indicate that couples are more likely to specialize when only he holds tertiary education, whereas non-traditional patterns are more likely when only she or both partners are highly educated. The patterns differ across two periods marked by distinct policy contexts and between couples with mothers of East and West German background, even after 2007. The study contributes to our understanding how institutions, absolute and relative resources shape joint parental employment trajectories from a dynamic dyadic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Governments continue to face challenges integrating refugees into the local labor market, and many past interventions have shown limited impact. This study examines the Job-Turbo program, a large-scale initiative launched by the German government in 2023 to accelerate employment among refugees—primarily individuals from Ukraine and eight other major countries of origin. Using monthly administrative panel data from Germany’s network of public employment service offices and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program significantly increased both caseworker–refugee contact and job placements over a 23-month follow-up period. Among Ukrainian refugees, the exit-to-job rate nearly doubled. Effects were broad-based—spanning demographic subgroups, unemployment durations, skill levels, regions, and local labor-market conditions—and concentrated in regular, unsubsidized employment. The program also raised both the rate and share of sustained job placements, consistent with improved match quality. Other refugee groups saw meaningful gains as well, but increases in job placements were concentrated among males and in low-skilled jobs, with only limited effects for females. We detect no negative spillovers for German or other immigrant job seekers, finding no signs of either resource reallocation or displacement. The results offer insights for governments responding to displacement crises. They indicate that intensified job-search assistance---embedded within the early stage of integration and implemented at scale through public employment infrastructure---can meaningfully improve refugees' labor-market outcomes, even amid significant arrivals.",

We draw on a network-analytical approach and more than 900 million social media posts shared on nine social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, VKontakte, Reddit, Gab, and 4Chan) from 2019 to 2021 that have ties to right-wing, left-wing, or anti-system alternative news outlets based in four European countries (Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden). Our findings indicate that the mainstream orientation of European digital alternative news environments is more pronounced in countries with a cordon sanitaire tradition in the political sphere, as well as in left-wing-oriented environments. The article adds to a growing body of research on the complex relationship between alternative news media and the mainstream by highlighting the importance of contextual conditions and the nature of the broader information environments in which alternative news content is circulated.",

However, this does not imply that Bourdieu's postures and stances with respect to Gramsci's thought do not find expression within his own texts; on the contrary, they emerge precisely from the reticence, allusions and dissimulations. From here one can even explore a closeness underlying an apparent and declared detachment, to reflect on a disinterestedness that is actually interested. The analysis is thus based on an “against the grain” reading of the direct and explicit occurrences of Gramsci traceable in Bourdieu's texts, highlighting the space of their possible sociological implications and their tacit and implicit connotations.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how different types of social interactions are reflected in the archaeological record, specifically analyzing the extent to which artifacts can serve as proxies for past human interactions. Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using a graph correlation method, and the underlying network structures were compared using ERGMs (Exponential Random Graph Models). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.",

          "abstract": "Default nudges are widely used and effective, but their mechanisms remain unclear. We test whether ease, endowment, or endorsement effects drive choices. In an online randomized experiment, the endowment channel emerges as the driver. We then use a novel fMRI approach that constructs brain activity maps of cognitions and uses them to trace their variation in each cognition during decision-making. Our approach validates treatments by confirming they elicit the intended cognitions and uses them as instruments to identify the causal effect of cognition on choice. Results are consistent with endowment driving default nudge effectiveness, suggesting policy designs should leverage it.",

          "abstract": "This study quantifies the impact of generative AI on tourist flow using scenario-based projection models. We simulate one million US domestic tourists using Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT 4.1 Nano. Their tourism patterns are compared to the null model and empirical-based simulations. Large language models generate tourist flows that are more seasonal, more unequal, and less reciprocal than empirical-based simulations. Geographic patterns, like mean travel distance and preference for neighboring states and intra-state destinations, vary by model. Findings show that the widespread adoption of generative AI can undermine the sustainability and resilience of tourism systems. We urge tourism scholars and practitioners to proactively assess the consequences of adopting generative AI in tourism.",
