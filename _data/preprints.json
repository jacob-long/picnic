          "authors": "Zuzanna Bozena Zagrodzka; Jenni Adams",
          "abstract": "Increasingly, funders, publishers, and institutions expect researchers to comply with the FAIR principles to ensure that data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. In an institutional context, however, questions remain as to how organisations can move beyond a broad commitment to FAIR, coupled with support for researchers to comply nominally with related grant conditions, to a more embedded and sustainable approach with a meaningful and pervasive impact on the FAIRness of research outputs. A data stewardship model offers one way to achieve this, yet in contrast to universities in mainland Europe and especially in the Netherlands, the UK is substantially lacking in such infrastructure at an institutional level, hampering efforts to evidence its potential impact within UK institutions and thereby advocate for its adoption. This article examines efforts to address this challenge via a recent project at the University of Sheffield to establish a pilot support service around FAIR data stewardship. It also provides a case study of how the benefits and impact of such an intervention might be identified and articulated through an evidence-led evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Meta-analyses, embedded in systematic reviews, are pivotal in today's scientific landscape for reconciling conflicting findings, increasing statistical power, and charting new research directions. However, poor reporting practices that conceal technical details and potential limitations often need to be revised to maintain their reliability. Despite existing reporting guidelines, a comprehensive tool has yet to be tailored to appraise the reporting quality of the quantitative aspects of meta-analysis in environmental sciences. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Meta-analysis Appraisal Tool for Environmental Sciences (MATES), a checklist of items to assess the reporting quality of meta-analyses. To develop MATES, we used an adapted Delphi process involving workshops (11-16 participants), a survey (193 participants), and validation (30 participants). This process resulted in a 14-item checklist, encompassing the environmental science communities view of important reporting elements. The validation, across 50 meta-analyses, indicated that the tool is repeatable (an average intra-class correlation of 88.97%) and time-efficient (17.00 ± 11.77 min) to implement. To enhance the accessibility and usability of MATES, we created an interactive web-based app that features training and implementation modules https://kylemorrisonisshiny99.shinyapps.io/MATES_shiny/. We also discuss how to interpret the MATES results, potential use cases of MATES and evaluate the development methodology. Overall, MATES provides authors, readers, reviewers, and editors with a reliable and user-friendly tool to assess the reporting quality of meta-analyses in the environmental sciences.",

          "authors": "Jeremy S. Meredith",
          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by a paradoxical cognitive profile that includes both attentional inconsistency and the capacity for intense, sustained focus. This paper introduces a computational model that unifies the core attentional paradox of ADHD, reconciling these contradictory traits as emergent properties of a single, adaptive cognitive strategy driven by working memory (WM) limitations. The model posits that a constrained WM capacity makes parallel processing computationally prohibitive, necessitating a shift to a serial, Depth-First Search (DFS)-like strategy. This serial mode mechanistically accounts for hyperfocus. The model further incorporates a low activation threshold for shifting paths, a single mechanism that produces both a high susceptibility to distraction and a greater propensity for creative insight. This framework provides a unifying architecture for the ADHD cognitive style, framing its traits as the predictable outcomes of a fundamental trade-off. From a Reinforcement Learning (RL) perspective, this can be understood as a cognitive policy biased towards exploration over exploitation, resulting in a reduction in systematic task efficiency in exchange for an increase in opportunistic, creative discovery.",

          "authors": "Jue Wang",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nNeuroanatomical studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reveal abnormally increased cortical neuron numbers in affected children, with cortical thickness and weight significantly exceeding normal controls, some accompanied by macrocephaly. Concurrently, severe damage to cortical neuronal axons and columnar structures has been observed, with pronounced cellular accumulation in specific regions and long-range connectivity dysfunction. Most children develop symptoms between 1.5-2 years of age, yet the pathological mechanisms remain unclear.\nMammalian hippocampi exhibit sustained neurogenesis peaks during the first postnatal months, with hippocampal neuronal survival significantly increasing in response to learning tasks and information stimulation. The intensity of learning tasks and information stimulation that human infants receive far exceeds conditions in animal experiments. Research demonstrates large-scale neuronal migration phenomena in human infant cortex, with the cortex potentially containing cells from diverse origins.\nWe propose the hippocampal neuronal overflow hypothesis: massive surviving neurons within the infant hippocampus overcome hippocampal capacity limitations and, during critical time windows, overflow from the hippocampus to white matter, migrating into cortical layers to form synaptic connections and construct unique network circuits related to human cognition, language, and memory functions.\nWe propose that ASD etiology involves children receiving excessive learning tasks and information stimulation during the hippocampal neurogenesis peak period, leading to excessive neuronal overflow and migration into the cortex. During intensive synapse formation processes, migrating neurons physically disrupt existing cortical axonal structures, causing cortical functional damage manifested as social deficits, communication impairments, and stereotypical behaviors.\nBased on extensive literature analysis, this study proposes that some ASD cases may result from this acquired neurodevelopmental abnormality mechanism, providing a new theoretical framework for ASD etiology research.",

          "authors": "Kate Raymond; Yu Karen Du; Facundo Lodol; Derek Mitchell; Blake Edward Butler",
          "abstract": "Misophonia is characterized by intense negative emotional responses to specific trigger sounds. Given that repetitive sounds are frequently endorsed as triggers, we investigated whether impaired preattentive sensory gating contributes to misophonia pathophysiology. Forty-eight participants (36 female; aged 18-64) completed self-report measures of misophonia severity (MisoQuest) and sensory gating ability (Sensory Gating Inventory-Brief), alongside an objective measure of sensory gating capacity (suppression of the P50 component in a paired-pulse paradigm). Resting-state beta and gamma power were also examined as potential markers of inhibitory capacity. A dimensional approach was employed, examining relationships across the spectrum of symptom severity rather than discrete diagnostic groups. Participants showed normal P50 suppression overall (mean S2/S1 ratio = 0.40 ± 0.34). Despite significant correlation between self-reported misophonia severity and sensory gating difficulties (τ = 0.51, p &lt; .001), no significant associations emerged between P50 suppression ratios and either misophonia severity (τ = -0.05, p = .652) or self-reported gating difficulties (τ = 0.14, p = .198). Similarly, resting-state beta and gamma power showed, at best, weak evidence of a relationship with misophonia symptoms. These findings suggest that misophonia may not arise from deficits in early, automatic sensory filtering mechanisms. Rather, the characteristic hypersensitivity to trigger sounds likely emerges from alterations in higher-order auditory processing networks, consistent with neuroimaging evidence of altered salience network activity. These results help constrain theoretical models that seek to understand the patterns of atypical neural activity that underlie the experience of misophonia.",

Children observed and tapped different culturally appropriate body parts in sequences of increasing length in the Body Span. The novel Body Span showed strong convergence with existing WM measures and showed unique predictive validity across cognitive and behavioral outcomes, underscoring its value as both a complementary and stand-alone assessment.",

          "abstract": "Research on rhythm perception has largely focused on short rhythmic cycles typical in Western music, leaving a gap in our understanding of the perception and memory for longer and unfamiliar rhythmic structures found in other musical traditions. North Indian Classical Music (NICM), for example, features long rhythmic cycles varying in structure, duration, and number of beats. This study investigates how unfamiliar musicians, those with no prior exposure to NICM, perceive and discriminate these long rhythmic cycles, with a focus on working memory capacity and chunking strategy. Participants completed a rhythm discrimination task involving NICM cycles that varied in duration, number of beats, and rhythmic structure (isochronous vs. non-isochronous). The study also contained a digit span task to assess working memory, followed by selecting a grouping structure representing the pattern. Results revealed a significant positive correlation between digit span scores and rhythm discrimination accuracy. Rhythm discrimination performance declined as cycle duration increased, and performance was better for isochronous cycles than non-isochronous ones. There was also an effect of length (number of beats) for rhythm discrimination of non-isochronous cycles. Furthermore, grouping or chunking strategies were associated with higher discrimination scores, particularly for shorter cycles.  These findings suggest that working memory capacity and perceptual strategies such as chunking play a critical role in processing long rhythmic cycles.",

          "authors": "Mehrdad Aghlmand Yengejeh",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Seven Cognitive Filters Model as a comprehensive framework for understanding the structure and complex processes of the human mind. Rooted in systematic introspective observations and aligned with established findings in cognitive science and neuroscience, the model proposes a layered and dynamic structure composed of seven sequential and interacting filters: sensation, perception, reason, awareness/belief, thinking, self-reflection, and self-awareness. These filters describe the progression of information processing from raw sensory input to the heights of conscious self-awareness.\n​At the heart of this model lies a critical distinction between thought (the automatic content stream of the mind) and thinking (the observing, executive self). We demonstrate how thinking, as the core agent of the system, is responsible for refining and enhancing cognitive performance, with the capacity to overcome distortions induced by thought and unconscious influence.\n​Clinical analyses—such as in schizophrenia and addiction—highlight the central role of thinking in psychological health. The model aligns with theories such as Kahneman’s System 1 and 2, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoanalytic concepts of the unconscious, and Piaget’s stages of cognitive development.\n​Beyond theoretical explanation, this model offers practical implications for targeted cognitive and behavioral interventions. It concludes by emphasizing the model’s wide research potential in neuroscience, clinical and developmental psychology, and the philosophy of mind, positioning it as a common language for exploring the complexities of human consciousness.",

          "abstract": "In three studies, we tested whether icon arrays—which are a popular method of presenting risk information—can reduce pre-decisional information distortion that arises when early emerging preferences bias the evaluation of subsequently shown information. In Study 1, using traditional measures of information distortion, we found that risk-of-death information about two potential treatment options that was presented via icon arrays was distorted in favor of participants’ leading alternative. The magnitude of distortion was similar to the level of distortion for other treatment information in the treatment scenario. Study 2 directly tested whether the presence vs absence of icon arrays when presenting risk information had any impact on levels of information distortion, this time using a dependent measure that targeted people’s intuitive perceptions of risk. We found that the extent to which a 6% risk of death seemed riskier than a 3% risk-of-death was greater when the former risk was from a treatment option that was relatively undesired. This distortion was not significantly reduced by the presence of icon arrays. We replicated this pattern of results in a third study. These findings highlight the need for developing new tools and methods for presenting risk/likelihood information that can protect against the influence of pre-decisional information distortion.",

          "authors": "Nathaniel R. Greene; Dominic Guitard; Moshe Naveh-Benjamin",
          "abstract": "Adult aging is associated with a decline in memory for the specific details of past experiences, but the reasons for these declines remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we consider the potential of computational process models of memory to reveal mechanisms underlying age-related changes in memory specificity. We define empirical benchmarks in the most widely used tasks for studying age differences in memory -- recognition and free recall. We then systematically review two broad classes of process models -- global matching and retrieved context models -- that are well-suited to explaining these benchmarks. We discuss and at times illustrate through simulations how age differences in memory specificity can arise from different mechanisms in these models, such as reductions in encoding fidelity, cue-selectivity of retrieval, contextual reinstatement, or retrieval monitoring. These models hold great promise for uncovering the latent mechanisms of age-related memory change, but several explanatory shortcomings must be addressed for a more comprehensive theory to emerge. Because process models often incorporate simplifying shortcuts, they risk advancing descriptive rather than mechanistic explanations for age differences in memory. Furthermore, models that have identified multiple processes of age-related memory impairment have left unaddressed the ways in which these processes affect each other.  By illuminating these and other challenges in current process models, our review aims to stimulate future advances that can dramatically reshape our understanding of the processes of age-related changes in memory specificity.",

          "abstract": "AI tools hold considerable promise for psychological research. The precise shape of their potential uses has become clearer in recent years as machine learning models have been trained to reproduce a variety of complex human cognitive behaviors with impressive success. The prospect of AI-human performance parity, along with the advantages of AI systems in speed, cost and ease of use, has prompted psychologists to explore how science might benefit from reassigning some traditionally human research roles to machines. This chapter provides an outlook on such methods. We begin by documenting the prospective upsides of what many researchers take to be the most promising types of AI surrogacy, including the use of models to efficiently generate, screen and refine preliminary hypotheses. We then discuss such methods’ limitations and drawbacks, and more generally the methodological considerations researchers must attend to in choosing when and how to rely on machine substitutes for human behavior.",

We observe that multifractality in keystroke timings\nis significantly lower after exposure to a mentally fatiguing task, and that multifractal properties\ncorrelate with the degree of self-reported fatigue. We discuss the implications of this research for the\ndevelopment of unobtrusive, low cost fatigue monitoring and interventions, noting that multifractal\nanalysis requires only the capture of input behaviour for the task, and that multifractality has been\nobserved in a range of task-directed behaviours, not only typing.

          "abstract": "We used the reflexive imagery task (RIT) to investigate how musical imagery can arise involuntarily in response to an external stimulus.  In the basic RIT, participants are presented with visual objects and instructed not to think of the names of these objects.  On a majority of the trials, the participants reported that they thought of the name of the objects.  The imagery elicited by RITs are of very short duration (e.g., the time it takes to subvocalize a name).  It has been proposed that RIT effects cannot arise for imagery that is of longer duration (e.g., musical imagery).  To investigate this matter, in our version of the RIT, participants heard and learned four simple, novel songs.  The lyrics for each song consisted of numbers, counting from one to ten.  The “minimal training” condition consisted of 10 presentations of each song; the “extended training” condition consisted of 30 presentations of each song.  After training, participants were presented with fragments of each melody (fragments of different lengths) and instructed to not “sing in their minds” the remainder of the melody.  Participants reported whether they involuntarily continued the melody as musical imagery and reported the number associated with the termination point of the experienced imagery.  One-third of the participants experienced substantive, involuntary musical imagery.  The current finding illuminates the limitations of involuntary mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Joao F Guassi Moreira; Jennifer A Silvers",
          "abstract": "The current prevailing approaches to analyzing task fMRI data in developmental cognitive neuroscience are brain connectivity and mass univariate task-based analyses, used either in isolation or as part of a broader analytic framework (e.g., BWAS). While these are powerful tools, it is somewhat surprising that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is not more common in developmental cognitive neuroscience given its enhanced ability to both probe neural population codes and greater sensitivity relative to the mass univariate approach. Omitting MVPA methods might represent a missed opportunity to leverage a suite of tools that are uniquely poised to reveal mechanisms underlying brain development. The goal of this review is to spur awareness and adoption of MVPA in developmental cognitive neuroscience by providing a practical introduction to foundational MVPA concepts. We begin by defining MVPA and explain why examining multivoxel patterns of brain activity can aid in understanding the developing human brain. We then survey four different types of MVPA: Decoding, representational similarity analysis (RSA), pattern expression, and voxel-wise encoding models. Each variant of MVPA is presented with a conceptual overview of the method followed by practical considerations and subvariants thereof. We go on to highlight the types of developmental questions that can be answered by MPVA, discuss practical matters in MVPA implementation germane to developmental cognitive neuroscientists, and make recommendations for integrating MVPA with the existing analytic ecosystem in the field.",

          "abstract": "Psychological scientists are increasingly acknowledging the importance of transparency for research integrity. The present study examined one important facet of transparency: providing enough information about measures so that readers can evaluate aspects of construct validity. With a focus on social and personality psychology, we explored how often authors in one journal report a scale name, citation, example item, number of items, and reliability coefficient, as well as how often authors provide access to the study’s materials. We also investigated how measurement reporting practices have changed from 2010 to 2020, the decade encompassing the start of the “credibility revolution” in psychology. Across two samples, we coded 506 Social Psychological and Personality Science (SPPS) articles (N = 425 articles with at least one questionnaire measure; 1,198 questionnaire measures). Overall, ~31% of measures were reported with a name, ~53% a citation, ~66% an example item, ~76% the number of items, and ~78% of multi-item measures included some reliability information; approximately 22% of measures were single-item and 46% were ad hoc. We did not detect any apparent changes in the reporting practices examined from 2010 to 2020 in either sample, except for an increase in the availability of materials over time. Therefore, the replication crisis may have motivated increased access to studies’ materials in recent years but otherwise does not seem to be associated with more transparent reporting of measurement information for questionnaires in brief social and personality articles.",

          "authors": "jiazheng liu",
          "abstract": "Classic Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) maximizes net energy intake but rests on three idealized assumptions: unbounded internal capacity, instantaneous decision-making, and empirically chosen gain curves. We reconstruct OFT from first principles by enforcing three universal response laws: (i) finite energetic capacity, (ii) a non-zero causal delay, and (iii) low-order dynamical stability. Substituting the uniform delay factor  with its Padé-(1,1) surrogate confines every admissible gain curve to a two-pole, strictly concave family that subsumes Holling Type II, Michaelis–Menten, and hyperbolic discounting. This family is -dense in the physically feasible set and uniquely minimizes a quadratic dissipation functional. The resulting framework yields a delay-corrected Marginal Value Theorem—predicting systematically longer patch residence times than the classical rule—and a latency-aware prey-switching threshold. Thus, optimal foraging emerges as a special case of the response-law grammar, providing energy-bounded, delay-aware predictions without ad hoc curve fitting.",

          "abstract": "Population well-being surveys collect information from large, representative groups of people living in a defined geographic region on various social, emotional, and psychological factors that contribute to overall quality of life. Surveys provide relevant data to shape policies and practices to improve overall quality of life, such as informing the development of national quality of life frameworks. Ensuring that high-quality measures are being used in surveys is essential, because population level data inform policies that affect entire populations. The purpose of this study was to identify all existing population well-being surveys and analyze the quantity and quality of the established measures used in each survey. We conducted an environmental scan and identified 14 population well-being surveys, representing four continents, administered at monthly to 5-year intervals, and on samples of 3,928 to 65,000 individuals. We systematically appraised both the psychometry and pragmatism of each measure used in population well-being surveys through double-blind extraction using an established quality assessment tool. Overall measure quality was 33.05 (range: 20-46) and we found comparable domain scores for psychometric (M = 16.21) and pragmatic quality (M = 16.84). Psychometrically, measures tended to have high convergent validity and lower predictive validity. Practically, measures tended to have high readability scores and be briefer rather than longer. Our findings should be interpreted with our quasi-systematic method in mind, and our English language restriction. By highlighting how survey measures can be improved or refined in order to better measure population well-being, we hope these findings can support future population well-being surveys conducted across the world.",

While research has long sought to explain how this knowledge is acquired,\nprevious approaches have struggled to capture the nuanced and complex ways in which morphemes are used in written language. Our approach builds on earlier insights but moves beyond them by combining a large-scale analysis of vocabulary used in 1,200 books popular with children and young people with computational modelling to explore how affix learning from text may occur. We use a compositional distributional semantic model to investigate what can be learned about the meanings of individual English prefixes and suffixes through reading and evaluate the model’s performance against data from 120 adults in a lexical processing task. Our findings demonstrate that, despite high levels of noise, natural text contains sufficient structure to support the extraction of core affix semantics, and that readers are attuned to the complex patterns that shape affix use in the wild. This work contributes a new dimension to a more principled and psychologically grounded account of morpheme learning, and we discuss both this contribution and the broader insights it offers for language research.",

Approximating the delay τ₀ with a Padé-(1,1) expansion keeps every transfer function rational and at most second order, so any causal network reduces to two stable poles (−α₁,−α₂) with a weight ratio θ₂. From these parameters we obtain the closed-form scalar:\n\n\\frac{\\lambda S_c^2}{4}\\theta_2^2\\left(\\alpha_2^{-1}-\\alpha_1^{-1}\\right),\\quad\\lambda=\\Delta\\mu/ T,\n\nwhich fulfils the five phenomenological axioms of IIT, scales \\mathcal{O}(N) for sparse graphs, and equals the minimum decrement in a quadratic entropy-production functional when couplings are intact.

          "abstract": "Sustained attention and vigilance are fundamental cognitive abilities that develop throughout childhood and adolescence and may be enhanced by cognitively demanding activities such as formal musical training. This cross- sectional study examined whether individuals engaged in long-term musical training show enhanced attention and vigilance compared to matched controls without such training. Participants (N = 278; ages 8–34) were drawn from two samples of children, adolescents, and adults, with musicians and nonmusicians matched on a wide array of demographic and lifestyle variables using multivariate propensity-score matching. Attentional performance was assessed using the ANTI-Vea, a validated computerized task that measures two components of vigilance— executive and arousal vigilance—along with other attentional processes. Moreover, we applied advanced behavioral modelling given their sensitivity to the complex developmental trajectories in vigilance. For many indices, musically trained participants outperformed nonmusicians at all ages transversally, with overall faster responses, fewer attentional lapses, detecting more executive vigilance targets, and lower variability in arousal vigilance trials. Other group differences became more pronounced with age, indicating a possible dosage effect. Crucially, these findings remained after extensive control for potential confounding variables, providing a closer estimate of the long-term association between formal musical training and attentional abilities. Although the advantages associated with musical training were modest and the study's correlational nature warrants caution, they support the hypothesis that music practice may foster domain-general cognitive skills and underscore the utility of music as a model of brain plasticity.",

Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "Graphical models facilitate the representation of psychological variables as complex systems of interacting variables structured as a network. However, their current statistical estimation procedures overlook the assumption of clustering, which refers to the grouping of subsets of variables that are more densely connected within the network, despite this assumption playing a central role in many psychological theories. We address this gap by proposing the use of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) as a prior distribution on the network structure of a graphical model for binary and ordinal data. The SBM assumes that variables belong to latent clusters, where the probability of an edge depends on the cluster membership of the nodes. Embedding this prior in a Bayesian graphical modeling framework allows researchers to formally incorporate theoretical expectations about clustering, test hypotheses about the number of clusters, and estimate cluster assignments from cross-sectional data. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a simulation study and reanalyze 30 openly available empirical datasets to test for clustering. This work highlights how the Bayesian framework can embed theoretical assumptions into network models via priors and introduces a new tool for latent cluster inference in psychological network analysis.",

          "abstract": "Mendelian imputation is a promising method for imputing missing parental genotypes and estimating direct genetic effects. While the method has clear scientific benefits, so far there has been little reflection on its legal and ethical implications. In this perspective, we discuss these considerations and provide recommendations on transparent use of this method. We argue that imputed genotypes should be considered identifiable, personal data, and that using these data requires informed consent. We distinguish different scenarios where consent may be missing, such as an individual previously not having been contacted for consent, or a person who was contacted but did not reply or did not wish to participate. Informed consent is important across all these scenarios as it allows individuals to decide whether they want to participate in a study. In addition, transparent communication on how people’s data are used is important for public perception of science, and a failure to communicate this may contribute to mistrust. We discuss potential harmful applications of Mendelian imputation, and how robust regulatory frameworks guiding Institutional Review Boards on novel advanced methods such as Mendelian imputation are currently missing. This complicates decision making, especially when researchers argue for public interest as a lawful basis for foregoing consent. We end with a set of recommendations for 1) future genetic research projects for which Mendelian imputation will be possible; 2) research that has already been conducted using this method; and 3) the inclusion of ethical considerations in the publication of novel techniques/analyses.",

This study explores how political orientation affects belief in climate change and policy support among politicians (N = 714) and citizens (N = 18,281) in eight developed democracies (Australia, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia separately), Czechia, Germany, Israel, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Norway). In all countries, we find weaker belief in human-driven climate change among right-leaning politicians and citizens. This polarization was even stronger among politicians, with right-leaning politicians showing weaker climate change beliefs than their electorate. Furthermore, these politically polarized beliefs play a crucial role in policymaking, since belief in climate change mediates the impact of political orientation on mitigation policy support among politicians. Our findings highlight the need to debias beliefs and realign politicians’ and voters’ views about climate change, especially on the right-wing, to promote mitigation action.",

          "abstract": "Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals often suffer from a myriad of stressors within their social environments due to stigma and its outcomes (Meyer, 2003). Conversely, social support may impact SGM individuals’ psychological resilience. To quantify the impact of their interpersonal environments, the current preregistered meta-analysis included 181 studies (N = 75,376) that reported associations between social support (i.e., family, peer, partner, school, work) and internalizing psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidality) among SGM samples. Overall, a small, negative association was observed, r = -.26, with depression’s associations being significantly larger than the other psychopathology categories, r = -.30. Smaller effects were observed for samples with a larger share of bisexual individuals and when a SGM-specific measure was used. Otherwise, the negative association between social support and psychopathology was robust to demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, % white), SGM identity (e.g., % gender minority), source of support, and levels of structural stigma. No evidence of publication bias was observed. This robust finding suggests that all forms of SGM social support are similarly and complimentarily associated with lower internalizing psychopathology.",

Feedback, as a core component of successful learning, plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of technology-supported learning environments. This scoping review provides an overview on the influence of feedback on learning in VR, examining learning domains, feedback content and presentation design, research objectives and designs, and key findings. Relevant online databases were systematically searched, and 70 publications were included in the analysis. Most studies were conducted in domains where VR offers clear advantages over real-world settings, such as reducing physical risk in medical or emergency training, lowering costs in sports or skill acquisition, saving personal resources in educational contexts, and enabling remote access to training. The studies differed widely in terms of the information provided and how the feedback content was presented. Previous research has primarily taken a technology-driven approach, emphasizing system development and preliminary evaluations of feedback implementation. These studies show that VR systems with feedback show advantages in terms of more positive learners’ experiences and performance. However, only a small number of studies applied controlled experimental designs to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of feedback, the conditions under which it works best, and influencing factors. To advance the field, future research should adopt theory-driven approaches and complex experimental designs taking into account individual learner conditions as well as the affordances of VR environments.",

          "abstract": "Background: In psychotherapeutic treatment, Outcome (OM) and Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) are highly recommended for the data-driven personalization of psychotherapeutic interventions. OM/ROM have proven particularly effective in identifying nonresponders and patients at risk of deterioration. However, OM and ROM remain insufficiently implemented in the field of child and adolescent psychotherapy. Their implementation and effectiveness are affected by the attitudes of psychotherapists toward OM/ROM. While several studies have examined the attitudes of therapists working with adults, little is known about which characteristics of psychotherapists working with children and adolescents influence their attitudes toward OM/ROM. In addition, research on specific facilitators of and barriers to implementation in this field is still limited. Objective: In this observational study, we investigated which therapeutic characteristics affect the attitudes of psychotherapists working with children and adolescents toward OM and ROM and how implementation is affected by previous experience and attitudes toward administering OM/ROM. Methods: Attitudes toward the OM/ROM of licensed German psychotherapists and psychotherapists in training working with children and adolescents were assessed in an online survey conducted between June 2023 and March 2024 (N = 126). Results: Compared with psychoanalytic-oriented therapists, therapists with an orientation in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) presented more positive attitudes (d = 1.88), but no significant difference was found between orientations in CBT and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy. Therapists working in institutionalized outpatient settings reported more positive attitudes than those working in private practices did (d = 0.88). No effect of previous experience in administering OM/ROM was found for either implementation barriers or facilitators; however, the results suggest that therapists administering pre-post evaluations expect more support in clarification processes than ROM administration currently provides. In addition, more positive attitudes toward OM/ROM are associated with higher expectations regarding both support in therapeutic processes and support in clarification. Conclusion: OM/ROM systems should consider assessing concepts from different psychotherapeutic orientations. The implementation of OM/ROM could benefit from close monitoring.",

It embraces “strategic illegibility”—the refusal to be neatly categorized—as a legitimate survival strategy and form of resistance. By centering philosophy, lived experience, and marginalized epistemologies, LQP proposes a relational, emergent, and structurally aware praxis.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Building on a recent study that identified five health risk behavior profiles among males and six profiles among female adolescents from 43 European countries, this study aims to explore the youth’s perceived support from family, peers, and teachers in relation to these profiles. Despite the emphasis on adolescent health-risk behaviors and perceived social support systems in previous literature, limited research has examined how these support domains intersect with person-centered patterns of co-occurring health-risk behaviors. \nMethods: Using the most recent data from the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey (N = 68,688), this study used the Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars (BCH) method to assess differences in perceived family, peer, and teacher support across the profiles identified from eleven health-risk behaviors among 15-year-old adolescents based on latent profile analysis (LPA), separately for males and females. \nResults: The results revealed that adolescents in the Low-Risk profile reported the highest family and teacher support. Peer support was highest among males in the Poor Lifestyle–Smoking profile. The lowest support levels across all three domains were observed in the Poor Lifestyle–High Substance Use profile. \nConclusions: These findings demonstrate that social support patterns vary systematically across health-risk profiles, underscoring the importance of tailoring intervention strategies to adolescents’ specific needs. Since each profile represents a unique pattern of perceived support, a one-size-fits-all approach may be insufficient. Instead, prevention efforts that simultaneously strengthen family dynamics, peer and teacher relationships may offer the greatest benefits for adolescents who demonstrate multiple risk behaviors across different areas.\n\nKeywords: health-risk behavior, adolescence, latent profile analysis, social support, protective factors",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper offers a rigorous examination of the concept of prosochē—the attentive mindfulness or vigilant focus on oneself—within Hellenistic Stoicism and its later transformations in Late Antiquity, and compares it to the modern psychological notion of the “flow state.” We analyze prosochē as a Stoic spiritual exercise (askēsis) essential to ethical development and life in accordance with cosmic reason (logos). Drawing on Pierre Hadot’s work and other scholarship, we detail how Stoic thinkers (especially Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius) conceived prosochē as continuous self-awareness and moral vigilance, and how this practice was adapted by Neoplatonist philosophers and early Christian ascetics. We then develop a comparative analysis between prosochē and Mihály Csíkszentmihályi’s concept of flow from contemporary psychology. Notable similarities include focused immersion, a harmonious affective state, and a sense of mastery or control during the experience. Key differences are also highlighted: prosochē is grounded in a teleological and moral framework oriented by cosmic nature and virtue, whereas flow is a content-neutral psychological state defined by optimal experience and lacking inherent ethical orientation. In sum, the paper situates prosochē as both an ancient practice of attentive presence and a precursor, with crucial differences, to modern ideas about absorbed states of consciousness. Footnotes provide references to primary sources (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Plotinus) and modern analyses (Hadot, Csíkszentmihályi, cognitive science research), and the conclusion reflects on the enduring relevance of prosochē for philosophy and psychology.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "In both everyday language and philosophical discourse, the terms existence and reality are often used interchangeably. This conflation is especially evident in debates on the ontology of time. For example, an orthodox presentist will say that only present things truly exist, treating all non-present entities (past or future) as unreal in an absolute sense – “all such objects are unreal, according to Presentism,” as one defender neatly put it. This paper serves as a focused extension and clarification of the metaphysical framework introduced in Existential Realism – A Distinct Ontological Framework Beyond Presentism. It addresses specific questions raised by readers and critics: Is it coherent to distinguish existence from reality? What philosophical work does that distinction do? How does it help with longstanding problems like truthmaking, the status of unobservable entities, and future ethics? In short, while the original paper laid out the core ontological structure, this follow-up revisits its foundations to deepen the theoretical implications, refine key definitions, and explore practical consequences. Our central thesis remains: existence and reality are not identical. But here, we argue more sharply that separating them yields a more nuanced, empirically grounded, and philosophically productive ontology of time. We defend this view against objections, offer clarified examples, and explore its implications for epistemology, phenomenology, and ethics. We proceed as follows. Section 2 defines existence narrowly, in terms of presentness and empirical accessibility, drawing on the spirit of van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism . Section 3 then defines reality more broadly, to include causal and structural aspects of the world inferable beyond the present—illustrated through examples such as dinosaurs, future climate events, and cognitive anticipations. Section 4 explores how this distinction addresses several philosophical issues: the truthmaker problem for past truths, the ontological status of unobservable scientific entities, the phenomenology of temporal experience (in the sense of Husserl and Metzinger ), and considerations of metaphysical parsimony. Section 5 argues why this two-tier ontology is not merely a restatement of presentism or eternalism, but a distinct metaphysical framework. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our contributions and highlights new directions this view opens—particularly in ethics (e.g., our duties to future persons), AI models of time, and decision theory under uncertainty. Throughout, we maintain an academic tone and use end-of-paragraph references in line with the original paper’s style. Our aim is for this article to stand on its own as a focused argument on the existence–reality distinction, while continuing and enriching the foundation laid by Existential Realism.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Existential Realism as a novel ontological framework in metaphysics that offers a rigorously technical alternative to presentism. In contrast to standard presentism’s claim that only the present exists , In contrast to standard presentism, which claims that only the present exists, Existential Realism distinguishes between existence—material, empirically accessible presence—and reality, which includes causal, epistemic, and anticipatory structures beyond the immediate present. This framework integrates insights from metaphysics, epistemology, and phenomenology to address the limitations of presentism and related theories of time. We delineate how Existential Realism departs from presentism (and is not merely a variant thereof) by reinterpreting what it means for an entity or event to exist now, while still affirming the ontological significance of past and future entities as real despite their lack of present existence. Systematic comparisons are drawn between Existential Realism and the standard theories of temporal ontology – presentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory – with references to key contributors (Markosian, Crisp, Bourne, Zimmerman) to highlight differences in ontological commitments. We provide technically grounded examples—from causal traces in physics to cognitive-state evidence and time-indexed data structures—to show how entities can be real even without presently existing. The paper also addresses major objections, including the coherence of reality without existence, the epistemological access to entities that do not presently exist or are unobservable, and the compatibility of this framework with special relativity. A comparative table is included to map Existential Realism vis-à-vis other theories. In conclusion, Existential Realism is presented as a robust, integrative stance that preserves the empirical and experiential centrality of the present while acknowledging the enduring reality of the past and the looming reality of the future – thus serving as a stand-alone reference framework for future discourse in metaphysics and cognitive science.",

Their capacity to automatically and meaningfully analyze large-scale text data makes them particularly valuable for studying highly individualized clinical phenomena, such as triggers of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS), where pattern identification is often challenging. To address this gap, we asked 1,495 individuals to identify their most common triggers, rate their intensity, and report the severity of their contamination-related OCS. Using LLM-based embeddings, we generated a map of key trigger categories, revealing their diversity across ecological domains and varying degrees of semantic similarity. Monte Carlo simulations further showed that individuals frequently reported semantically similar trigger pairs that differed in intensity. These findings are clinically significant, providing a foundation for a more fine-grained understanding of OCS treatment mechanisms and paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches.",

          "abstract": "Stoicism was one of the major Hellenistic philosophies, renowned not only for its ethical teachings but also for pioneering work in logic and epistemology. The Stoic school, particularly under Chrysippus of Soli (c. 279–206 BCE), developed a formal propositional logic that in some ways foreshadowed aspects of modern logical systems.  This paper provides a rigorous comparative examination of Stoic reasoning and logic vis-à-vis modern logic traditions. We focus on the structure of Stoic logic (including its syllogistic forms and inference rules; the Stoics’ treatment of logical paradoxes such as the Sorites (the “heap” paradox) and the Liar, and the philosophical presuppositions underlying Stoic logic (notably its integration with ontology and determinism). In contrast, modern logic—particularly as developed by Frege, Russell, and the logical positivists of the 20th century—emphasizes formal abstraction and symbolic rigor. The analysis highlights how Stoic logic, though formulated over two millennia ago using ordinary language, anticipates certain ideas found in modern symbolic logic, while nevertheless differing significantly in purpose and context. In doing so, we shall see how key Stoic logicians like Chrysippus innovated logical theory, and how these innovations compare to the work of modern figures such as Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and the logical positivist school.\nThroughout the paper, a formal academic tone is maintained. Where appropriate, we include footnote references for further explication or sources, and a complete bibliography is provided at the end. It should be noted that our knowledge of Stoic logic comes from fragmentary sources and later reports, since no complete Stoic logical texts survive from antiquity.  Nevertheless, scholarship has reconstructed a coherent picture of Stoic logical theory which we draw upon. The goal is to illuminate both the continuities and divergences between the Stoic logical tradition and the modern logical paradigms that dominate contemporary philosophical logic.",

          "authors": "Simon B. Schaefer; Stefan T. Radev; Jan; Anna-Lena Schubert",
          "abstract": "The congruency effect, characterized by faster and more accurate performance in congruent compared to incongruent trials, has been consistently observed in various conflict tasks. However, the search for a common underlying process of inhibition reveals significant differences between conflict tasks, as evident from different time courses of the congruency effect (i.e., delta functions) and a lack of correlations in performance across different conflict tasks. To address these issues, the Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks (DMC) has been employed to explicitly model congruency effects and explain different delta function shapes. However, estimating the parameters of the DMC using standard iterative methods faces computational challenges. In this study, we leverage Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) with deep learning to address these limitations. We use different prior distributions, levels of model complexity, and automated hyperparameter optimization within a principled workflow. ABI produces well-calibrated posteriors across a wide range of trial counts, estimating individual-level parameters as accurately as iterative methods within a fraction of their runtime. Additionally, we conducted an experiment to validate the key parameters of the DMC. As expected, the amplitude of the automatic process was influenced by stimulus spacing in a flanker paradigm. However, the effect on the peak latency parameter depended on the choice of model parameterization and prior hyperparameters. Taken together, we demonstrate the viability of ABI as a scalable, accurate alternative to conventional estimation techniques and provide a reproducible workflow for future cognitive modeling studies.",

          "abstract": "Image-computable low-level image saliency has shaped perceptual psychology and computer science, but is limited by its inability to capture human high-level cognitive factors that influence attention and eye movements. A recent paper has shown that while free-viewing scenes, participants fixate on objects that are critical to the understanding of scenes. Here, we propose a fully automated method (with no fitting parameters or training) to create scene understanding maps (SUMs) that visualize the quantitative contribution of an object to the human comprehension of the scene. The method (AUTO-SUM) uses auto-segmentation and removal of different objects from scenes, Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to describe the scenes, and semantic similarity measures using large language embedding representations of scene descriptions. We show that AUTO-SUMs can approximate H-SUMs estimated using human-operated segmentation and object removal, human scene descriptions, and sentence similarity ratings. We also show that AUTO-SUM can predict the object most fixated by human observers during free viewing and scene description tasks better than a saliency model (GBVS) and comparable to DeepGaze. We contend that AUTO-SUM can be used as a semantic saliency model that complements lower-level saliency models.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

Primary analyses\nemployed independent t-tests and Mann–Whitney U tests, with Cohen’s d effect sizes reported.\nExploratory analyses included gender and age interactions, as well as mediation modeling. All analyses\nwere conducted in Python and are openly available on GitHub. Trust in the Elli chatbot was significantly\nlower than in the static form (p = .004, d = –0.49). Comfort and empathy ratings showed no significant\ndifferences. Dropout analysis revealed no condition-related attrition (χ² = 0.37, p = .54). Qualitative\nfeedback highlighted discomfort with artificial empathy and a perceived lack of human presence in the\nchatbot condition. No significant differences emerged for PHQ-9 or GAD-7 severity. Mediation analysis\nrevealed that empathy did not account for the trust gap. Contrary to expectations, the GPT-4 chatbot\nreduced user trust compared to a static form.

          "authors": "Claire Chan Nok Yin; Soyhan Egitim",
          "abstract": "Despite recent legal reforms, the concept of sexual harassment remains unclear in Japan. The current legal framework only covers incidents in workplaces, leaving victims outside the work environment without adequate protection. Despite the rising public awareness, a significant gap persists in understanding how victims process and respond to their experiences of sexual harassment. To gain a deeper understanding of victims’ experiences and how they make sense of their reactions to sexual harassment, we performed a qualitative study with 12 participants who had experienced sexual harassment at one point in their lives in Japan. Our findings revealed that some of the Japanese participants chose to remain non-confrontational in response to sexually abusive acts, while the non-Japanese participants preferred to take direct action. The power imbalance created by hierarchy, the participants’ adherence to the concepts of Wa (social harmony) and Gaman (endurance), and the deficiencies in the legislative system seemed to discourage them from seeking justice, which in turn allowed the perpetrators to avoid accountability. Considering these factors, there is a clear need to establish a more comprehensive and transparent legal framework that protects victims of sexual harassment and abuse in all contexts and encourages them to come forward with confidence, knowing that such acts will be addressed by law enforcement.",

This study aimed to address these inconsistencies through two preregistered replication experiments, examining the role of relational mobility as a potential moderating factor across different cultural contexts. Contrary to initial findings, our results from Experiment 1 in Japan (n = 254), Experiment 2 in Japan and the Netherlands (n = 263 and 300, respectively), and an exploratory statistical modeling revealed a consistent pattern where guilt led to compensation directed at the victim, sacrificing own resources, irrespective of the country or levels of perceived relational mobility.",

          "abstract": "Promoting academic engagement is vital for college student success. Researchers have explored factors like growth mindset, the belief that intelligence can improve with effort, as a driver of academic engagement. Given the important role of parental socialization on the developing student, we propose that students’ perceptions of their caregivers’ growth mindset beliefs might explain unique variance in their academic engagement, over and above students’ own mindset. This study examined how undergraduate students’ own mindsets and perceptions of their caregivers’ mindsets relate to four components of academic engagement: behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, behavioral disaffection, and emotional disaffection. Survey data from undergraduate students in the United States (N = 1,417) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. On average, students possessed a growth mindset and perceived their caregivers to also hold a growth mindset. Student growth mindset was positively associated with behavioral and emotional engagement and negatively associated with behavioral and emotional disaffection. Perceptions of caregiver growth mindset were associated with lower behavioral disaffection. Student growth mindset had a moderating effect on the association between perceived caregiver mindset and emotional engagement, such that a more student growth mindset weakened the negative association between perceived caregiver growth mindset and emotional engagement. The findings point to the important roles of parental socialization and internalization of caregiver messages and behaviors that could shape learning-related beliefs and behaviors in college.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Bayesian Construal Model (BCM), a unifying psychological framework that conceptualises human behaviour as a process of dynamic Bayesian inference. Initially developed as the Bayesian Situational Construal Model (BSCM) in alignment with Funder’s (2016) Situational Construal Model (SCM), the framework is here renamed the BCM to reflect its broader theoretical scope, mechanistic orientation, and applicability beyond the SCM triad. Building on the SCM, the BCM integrates insights from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) combine to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of expectation, interpretation, and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence over time. While first applied to understanding healthcare non-attendance, the BCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. It functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding adaptive, context-sensitive human action.",

We emphasize the need for a rigorous mechanistic research agenda that assesses extinction processes – acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval – as distinct mechanistic targets, and examines the relation between changes in these fear extinction processes and clinical outcomes.

          "abstract": "Background: Repetitive thought (e.g., worry; rumination) is a major transdiagnostic symptom and mechanism of internalizing psychopathology. Ability to regulate RT is particularly clinically important. Prior work implicates the default mode network (DMN) in self-generated and memory-driven cognitions including RT. However, few studies have investigated the neural correlates corresponding to successful RT regulation.\n\nMethod: Participants were 57 (32 female, 4 nonbinary, M age = 30) community-residing adults aged 20-45 oversampled for severe RT. 79% met criteria for one or more DSM-5 disorders. Participants completed an fMRI RT disengagement task during which they first viewed their own self-identified RT stimuli and perseverated as normal, then shifted attention to a validated sustained attention task, and finally responded to thought probes assessing momentary RT disengagement success. Study design, hypotheses, and analytic plan were preregistered on OSF (https://osf.io/qy4df).\n\nResults: More difficulty disengaging from RT corresponded to worse attention task performance (slower responding with no increase in accuracy); reduced activity in the salience, ventral and dorsal attention networks; and reduced connectivity between the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex) and dorsal attention network; but not reduced activity in or connectivity of DMN.\n\nConclusions and relevance: Successful regulation of repetitive thought may rely on the effective recruitment of attentional resources, but downregulation of DMN may not be necessary. Clinically, these findings suggest potential benefit from interventions that focus more on upregulating attentional functioning than on downregulating networks believed to subserve repetitive thought.",

Theories of associative learning suggest people can associate social cues, such as smiles, with personal reward, thus feeling good when others thrive. Yet, people often display generalized concern for others’ welfare, regardless of the specific cues present. We propose that Pavlovian conditioning allows people to associate reward directly with others’ abstract mental states, learning that another's happiness predicts their own reward.  In four online experiments with U.S. adults (N = 1500), participants’ monetary outcomes were congruently or incongruently predicted by a target’s mental states. Participants who experienced congruent learning reported more empathic feelings towards the target in novel situations. The values attached to mental states further influenced participants’ prosocial choices. These results demonstrate how associative learning of abstract mental states can give rise to generalizable empathy and influence moral behavior.",

          "abstract": "Emotional experiences during music listening are supported by dynamic interactions between perceptual, cognitive, and physiological processes, yet the extent to which bodily responses reflect or predict music-induced emotions remains an open question. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between music listening enjoyment and a variety of physiological responses, testing whether any subset of these measures can be used to predict music-induced emotions. We presented each participant with obscure instrumental music excerpts, recorded several physiological responses during music listening, and asked them to subjectively rate their experienced valence (positive to negative affect) and arousal (high to low energy). Using structural equation modeling, we found that high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), skin conductance levels (SCL), and respiration rate had small yet significant correlations with arousal, while HF HRV and the range of skin conductance responses (SCR) were correlated with valence. These findings indicate that physiological responses like SCR and respiration rate could potentially serve as an objective measure of music-induced emotions. Future researchers could expand upon these findings by investigating the influence of internal state and by exploring other physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG).",

          "abstract": "Background\nGrowing concern about young people’s mental health contrasts with reported declines in risk and antisocial behaviours. Providing up-to-date information on multiple outcomes and understanding subgroups most affected can clarify potential mechanisms and inform interventions. This study provides an updated analysis of trends in mental health and behavioural outcomes among young adolescents in the UK.\nMethods\nWe used data from 15,911 adolescents (aged 10–15 years) participating in the UK Household Longitudinal Study between 2009 and 2023. Trends were examined in mental health (emotional, hyperactivity, conduct problems), health behaviours (diet, physical activity), social media, parental relationships (frequency of arguments, discussed things that matter), risk behaviours (staying out after 9pm, smoking/vaping/alcohol use), and antisocial behaviours (shoplifting, vandalism, physical violence). Weighted logistic regression modelled yearly mental health time trends and changes in behavioural variables between earliest and latest data collection waves. We examined whether trends differed by sociodemographic variables by testing interaction terms.\nResults\nBetween 2009 and 2022, emotional problems more than doubled from 11.7% (95% CI: 10.7–12.7%) to 26.6% (95% CI: 24.4–28.9%), with the largest increases among 14–15-year-olds, girls, and white British adolescents. Hyperactivity remained stable until 2018 (17.1%, 95% CI: 16.3–18.0%), followed by an increase to 25.8% (95% CI: 23.7–27.8%) by 2022, mostly among girls. Social media use rose markedly, alongside increased fast-food consumption and declining physical activity. Positive trends included improved parental relationships and reductions in risk behaviours and conduct problems. Peer problems increased significantly, particularly for girls.\nDiscussion\nThis longitudinal, nationally representative sample shows sharply rising emotional problems, recent increases in hyperactivity symptoms, and declines in risk behaviours and conduct problems. These divergent patterns, and worse outcomes for girls and white British adolescents, may reflect distinct mechanisms, resilience, or measurement interpretation. Further research is needed to clarify underlying pathways and inform targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Financial well-being reflects a complex interplay of psychological traits, behaviors, and\nknowledge, yet most segmentation approaches rely on limited indicators or assume linear\ndependencies. This paper proposes a novel framework for identifying latent profiles of financial\nmindset and behavior by modeling nonlinear interactions across multiple psychometric domains.\nUsing data from a proprietary assessment (N = 144) and the nationally representative U.S. CFPB\nFinancial Well-Being Survey (N = 6,233), we uncover recurring psychologically grounded\nprofiles that generalize across populations and survey formats. These profiles show strong\ninternal structure and are significantly associated with life satisfaction, psychological well-being,\nand financial health. By capturing deeper drivers of financial behavior, our approach moves\nbeyond conventional demographic or transaction-based segmentation. The resulting framework is\nreplicable, scalable, and well suited to behavioral finance applications, including financial\nadvising, wellness interventions, and the design of personalized tools and communications aimed\nat improving financial decision-making and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Previous work has yielded mixed results regarding the relationships of interpersonal synchrony with working alliance and treatment outcomes. We sought to clarify these relationships by applying more sophisticated dynamic and dyadic methods.\n\nMethod: Adult outpatients with depression (N=65, Age 18--64, 65\\% Female, 68\\% White) participated in up to eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal psychotherapy. Sessions occurred either in-person or via teletherapy and were video-recorded. Facial computing tools estimated the momentary intensity of patients' and therapists' scowling and smiling, and the interpersonal synchrony of these measures during each session was quantified using windowed cross-correlation analyses. Hypotheses about within-dyad processes (i.e., session-to-session changes) and between-dyad associations (i.e., of average tendencies) were tested using hierarchical Bayesian mediation models.\n\nResults: Numerous and nuanced associations were found between facial behavior, working alliance, and treatment outcomes (e.g., session-to-session increases in patient-rated working alliance were predicted by higher-than-average therapist smiling). Interpersonal synchrony did not predict within-dyad changes in working alliance or depression symptoms; however, on the between-dyad level, higher average patient-rated working alliance was predicted by both higher average smile synchrony and lower average scowl synchrony.\n\nConclusions: The facial behavior of patients and therapists provides a valuable window into the therapeutic process, especially with regard to the alliance. Contributions come from the behaviors of each person as well as their level of interpersonal synchrony. However, contrary to extant theories, the associations of synchrony with working alliance and outcomes depend on the behavior being synchronized, the informant providing ratings, and the level of analysis being conducted.\n\nPublic Health Significance: These results help refine clinical theories about psychotherapy and unlock new possibilities for computationally assessing its progress.",

          "authors": "Muchen Xi; Joshua James Jackson",
          "abstract": "Behavioral variability has long been a central topic in personality psychology. Traditionally, research has focused on differences in mean levels of behavior across situations and time, rather than taking a situation-specific approach. These approaches neglect variability (or the opposite, consistency) within a situation, often treating within-situation variability as mere error. This study investigates three primary questions involving behavioral variability: 1) is variability a general characteristic of individuals or contingent on situational factors? 2) Do situations influence behavioral variability either by allowing for more behavioral variability or by increasing behavioral consistency? and 3) Do personality traits interact with situations to affect variability? Utilizing intensive longitudinal data from two studies, we developed a novel Situational Density Distribution (SDD) model to capture person-specific within-situation variability. Our findings indicate that behavioral variability is not solely a function of individual differences but is significantly shaped by situational contexts. Contrary to the strong situation hypothesis, situations can influence behavioral variability in both directions, making people more and less variable. Finally, personality traits were found to modulate the impact of situations on behavioral consistency, suggesting that variability reflects the interplay between person and situation factors. These results highlight the importance of considering behavioral variability, which offers insights into personality dynamics rather than exclusively focusing on mean-level analyses. The implications of the SDD model for studying person-situation transactions are also discussed.",

Using Dyamic Structural Equation Modeling, we found a credible bidirectional relationship between phsycial activity and PA. Greater PA predicted decreased smartphone use, while increased smartphone use was followed by increased NA. Familial risk and recurrent mood disorder history were not associated with the within-person dynamics, but both groups showed lower PA and higher NA on average.

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather than more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we examine whether individuals conform to both high-effort and low-effort norms equally, or whether the strength of normative influence on effort choices depends on the direction of the norm. Across twelve studies (N = 2,084), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally avoid effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Even after increasing the acceptability of low effort—by enhancing the value of low effort and the psychological closeness to past participants—individuals still opposed the low effort norm, exerting no less effort than the control group. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, individuals show resistance to lowering their effort below what they would typically exert. While we consistently found conformity to high-effort norms, effort preferences were not influenced when hearing about others completing an unrelated task, pointing to a possible boundary condition for norm effects.",

          "authors": "Joaquin Matias Alfei Palloni",
          "abstract": "Memories are dynamic and can be made vulnerable to disruption upon reactivation, resulting in a long-lasting attenuation of conditioned responses (i.e., cue-dependent amnesia). Traditionally, cue-dependent amnesia has been studied using AAA between-subjects designs, where a memory is trained for context A, reactivated, and tested with the same context. Using contextual fear conditioning in rats and midazolam as the amnestic agent, we have recently observed that amnesia can be observed when memories are reactivated by a generalization stimulus (context B) and tested with the same generalization stimulus (ABB design). However, this amnestic intervention does not affect fear expression when animals are tested with the original stimulus (ABA design) or a novel generalization stimulus (ABC design). Methodologically, however, evaluating whether amnesia is reversed, rather than simply not expressed, requires tracking changes in responding within the same individuals across contexts and time. This avoids the ambiguity inherent to between-group comparisons, which may confound memory retention with retrieval differences driven by contextual or procedural variability. Here, using an ABB, ABA, and ABC within-subjects design, and employing a gold standard amnestic manipulation - protein synthesis inhibition via Cycloheximide (CHX) - the interplay between memory retention and amnesia expression in different contexts was assessed. The results indicate that amnesia is expressed only when CHX-animals are re-exposed to the reactivation context, regardless of when this re-exposure occurs within the experimental timeline. The implications of these findings for a reconsolidation-based account of post-reactivation amnesia are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Despite suicide being a leading cause of death for autistic people worldwide, there is remarkably little research addressing suicide prevention strategies in this group. Moreover, autistic voices are often absent from published research, leaving their ideas, needs and desires concerning suicide prevention unheard. \nOverall, 3962 autistic people and 627 people who supported or were bereaved by the suicide of an autistic person participated in the study. Using online surveys, we garnered their ideas for policies and interventions to prevent suicide in autistic people (Phase 1). We thematically analysed 3373 suggestions and distilled these into 63 concrete ideas, which we asked an independent sample to prioritise in a four-step process (Phase 2). We analysed descriptive responses to each idea and identified differential priorities between and within autistic and non-autistic groups. \nAcross both phases, we identified suicide prevention priorities including the upskilling of healthcare practitioners, the need for tailored and preventative support, and to improve waiting times for autism diagnosis and post-diagnostic care. Other priorities indicated the need for societal change to reduce social marginalisation, address inequities, and reduce barriers to help-seeking.\nWith ideas spanning mental health interventions to preventative measures in the education, employment and social care sectors, participants’ views appeared to corroborate and reflect focal shifts in national and international suicide prevention policies. Moving beyond individuals at crisis point, these increasingly emphasise the need for coordinated, multisector efforts to address the long-term societal determinants of suicide (e.g. unemployment, marginalisation), foster social connectedness and wellbeing. While policies to address autism and suicide are in their infancy, we argue that similarly wide-lens, strategic responses are imperative to reduce excess mortality in autistic people.",

          "abstract": "Speech errors have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the architecture of the language production system, the nature of its representations, and its disorders. To be most informative, researchers usually need large amounts of data. Hand-coding such data can be both cumbersome and subjective. This paper presents LeCoder, the first open-source, automated error coder, which uses a data-driven approach grounded in large-scale corpora to quantify the target-response relationship, allowing it to be flexible, scalable, and generalizable across new datasets. By testing the coder on two datasets from two aphasia labs that have been carefully coded by trained research assistants, we first establish that LeCoder has high accuracy when compared to expert coders, and in certain cases, offers a more logical categorization than human coders. We then show, using robust machine-learning approaches, that LeCoder’s performance generalizes to new participants and items it has never encountered before. Collectively, these findings encourage the use of LeCoder across labs for more objective coding of speech errors, which will, in turn, increase replicability of findings in all subfields of research that use speech error analysis, including neuropsychological research.",

          "abstract": "Learning science often appears to involve replacement of naïve, intuitive ideas with correct, counterintuitive ones. Recent studies indicate that the old naïve, intuitive ideas are not actually replaced but exist alongside the correct but often counterintuitive ones. On this account, newer knowledge for scientific thinking might involve inhibition of the old idea. However, instead of merely inhibiting old ideas, it is possible that switching is necessary to select between new and old scientific ideas. In this study, we explored the direct and indirect contributions of behavioural inhibition, cognitive inhibition and switching to intuitive and counterintuitive science reasoning in adults (N = 167). After replicating the commonly observed processing costs of counterintuitive items relative to intuitive ones, we find that individual differences in switching rather than in inhibition are most strongly associated with variation in the accuracy and speed of adult intuitive and counterintuitive science reasoning. These results suggest that adults switch between older and newer ideas when reasoning about science rather than suppressing one in favour of the other.",

Stemming from the flanker and Stroop tasks, which have revealed that involuntary cognitive processes can counter and interfere with voluntary cognitive processes, the reflexive imagery task (RIT) has shown that stimuli can elicit involuntary higher-order cognitions.  The extent to which stimulus-elicited involuntary processes can influence voluntary processes remains unknown.  In our study, participants were instructed to, when presented with a line drawing of an object, think of a random word and disregard the line drawing.  Would the presence of the line drawing influence the generation of the verbal imagery?  Despite the participant’s intentions, the to-be-ignored line drawing had an influence over the participant’s response at a reliable, substantive rate:  On over 35% of the trials, the word the participant thought of was associated with the name of the line drawing.  On half of the trials, no line drawing was presented (the “No Line Drawing” condition).  Participants’ \"sense of control\" and the extent to which the response (i.e., the word) was due to “the self,” was stronger in the No Line Drawing condition than in the condition in which a line drawing was presented.

          "abstract": "Wording effects, the systematic method variance arising from the inconsistent responding to positively and negatively worded items of the same construct, are pervasive in the behavioral and health sciences. Although several factor modeling strategies have been proposed to mitigate their adverse effects, there is limited systematic research assessing their performance with exploratory structural equation models (ESEM). The present study evaluated the impact of different types of response bias related to wording effects (random and straight-line carelessness, acquiescence, item difficulty, and mixed) on ESEM models incorporating two popular method modeling strategies, the correlated traits-correlated methods minus one (CTC[M-1]) model and random intercept item factor analysis (RIIFA), as well as the “do nothing” approach. Five variables were manipulated using Monte Carlo methods: the type and magnitude of response bias, factor loadings, factor correlations, and sample size. Overall, the results showed that ignoring wording effects leads to poor model fit and serious distortions of the ESEM estimates. The RIIFA approach generally performed best at countering these adverse impacts and recovering unbiased factor structures, whereas the CTC(M-1) models struggled when biases affected both positively and negatively worded items. A straightforward guide is offered to applied researchers who wish to use ESEM with mixed-worded scales.",

Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "This meta-analysis integrates data from 139 studies involving 10,084 participants, identified through a systematic literature search, to examine neural error processing across various mental disorders—including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, depressive disorders (MDD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), substance-related and addictive disorders (SUD), and psychotic disorders. Using pairwise and network meta-analyses, we identified robust alterations in error-related brain responses measured by the error-related negativity (ERN). OCD (g = -0.43) and anxiety disorders (g = -0.23) exhibited heightened error-related neural responses (larger ERN), whereas ADHD (g = 0.26), ASD (g = 0.30), and psychotic disorders (g = 0.67) demonstrated blunted responses (smaller ERN). No significant differences in ERN were detected in MDD (g = 0.00) or SUD (g = 0.00) overall. Patients with psychotic disorders exhibited the greatest blunting of error processing, while those with OCD showed the strongest amplification—both significantly differing from healthy participants and all other clinical groups. These findings support the transdiagnostic potential of the ERN as a reliable neurocognitive marker. ERN alterations in anxiety disorders, OCD, and psychotic disorders may serve as endophenotypes or neural risk markers that precede symptom onset and offer predictive validity, aligning with established endophenotype criteria. Increased ERN signals may reflect amplified prediction errors, leading to over-control and risk-avoidant behaviors, while decreased ERN responses indicate hypoactive error processing, impairing adaptive responses to errors and feedback. Overall, ERN alterations hold promise as biomarkers of cognitive control dysregulation, with important implications for personalized interventions and early risk detection.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Existential Realism as a novel ontological framework in metaphysics that offers a rigorously technical alternative to presentism. In contrast to standard presentism’s claim that only the present exists  , In contrast to standard presentism, which claims that only the present exists, Existential Realism distinguishes between existence—material, empirically accessible presence—and reality, which includes causal, epistemic, and anticipatory structures beyond the immediate present. This framework integrates insights from metaphysics, epistemology, and phenomenology to address the limitations of presentism and related theories of time. We delineate how Existential Realism departs from presentism (and is not merely a variant thereof) by reinterpreting what it means for an entity or event to exist now, while still affirming the ontological significance of past and future entities as real despite their lack of present existence. Systematic comparisons are drawn between Existential Realism and the standard theories of temporal ontology – presentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory – with references to key contributors (Markosian, Crisp, Bourne, Zimmerman) to highlight differences in ontological commitments. We provide technically grounded examples—from causal traces in physics to cognitive-state evidence and time-indexed data structures—to show how entities can be real even without presently existing. The paper also addresses major objections, including the coherence of reality without existence, the epistemological access to entities that do not presently exist or are unobservable, and the compatibility of this framework with special relativity. A comparative table is included to map Existential Realism vis-à-vis other theories. In conclusion, Existential Realism is presented as a robust, integrative stance that preserves the empirical and experiential centrality of the present while acknowledging the enduring reality of the past and the looming reality of the future – thus serving as a stand-alone reference framework for future discourse in metaphysics and cognitive science.",

          "abstract": "Many organizations have created or adopted ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) frameworks, consisting of concepts, principles, guidelines, concerns, or recommendations. We systematically collect 245 documents from a range of public and private entities, which we collectively refer to as \"AI ethics guidelines.\" This paper documents the evolution of these guidelines and provides a better understanding of their content, particularly regarding their potential implications for the regulation of the world of work in the context of AI. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs), we analyze emerging patterns and show that certain ethical principles are more prominently featured than others. Through LLM-supported topic analysis, we identify and classify seven thematic clusters. However, labor markets or the “world of work” do not appear as distinct themes. Using Gemini AI, we further examine whether, and to what extent, ethical principles are discussed in the context of the world of work. We find that most AI ethics guidelines do raise labor-related concerns as critical areas for ethical decision-making. Based on this, we analyze whether the guidelines reference the International Labour Organization (ILO) or its International Labour Standards (ILS) as guiding norms. Only a small minority of guidelines explicitly mention the ILO or its ILS, while a slightly larger number refer implicitly to the ILO’s Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We conclude by discussing potential linkages between AI ethics, ethical behavior in the labor market, and ILS. Our study contributes to the academic debate on AI ethics, highlights labor-related implications, and offers insights for policy discussions on current and future AI regulation affecting labor.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "Phosphenes, the perception of light without external visual input, represent a rich intersection of neuroscience, subjective experience, and contemplative practice. While Heinrich Klüver's 1928 classification of four geometric \"form constants\" (lattices, cobwebs, tunnels, spirals) laid foundational groundwork for understanding these phenomena, it offers a limited scope for the diversity of forms reported across various induction methods. This article proposes an updated and expanded classification system for phosphene forms, integrating extensive subjective reports from transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) studies, detailed introspective data from practitioners of the Yoga of Inner Light (meditation), and insights from the Closed-Eye Visuals (CEVs) model in psychonautic literature. We present a new, graded framework that maps phosphene development across five levels of increasing complexity and intensity, ranging from ephemeral flickers and simple geometries to radial mandalas, archetypal imagery, and full-field immersive light realms. This synthesis not only refines our descriptive tools but also establishes a continuum of inner visual phenomena that bridges empirical neurostimulation data with contemplative phenomenology. By providing a structured and nuanced understanding of these inner lights, this classification system offers new pathways for consciousness research, contemplative science, and the integration of visionary experiences into healing and personal growth. It highlights phosphenes as dynamic, meaningful doorways to subtle perception, inviting a deeper inquiry into the nature of inner vision itself.",

Concurrently, research on film cognition has provided valuable insights into how viewers process dynamic visual narratives in Hollywood cinema. This paper explores the parallels between Hollywood cinema and educational videos to determine how film cognition research can inform educational video design. We analyze how cinematic techniques align with educational principles (i.e. signaling, spatial and temporal contiguity) proposed by Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. Additionally, we examine social cognition aspects, drawing connections to the learning principles (i.e., embodiment and image principles) in educational contexts. We propose that educational videos can enhance learner engagement by adopting attention-guiding methods and social cues used in film. We also suggest the development of a corpus of educational videos to further explore and validate the application of film cognition principles in educational settings.",

          "authors": "Dawn Branley-Bell; Libby Moore; Claire Naomi Murphy-Morgan",
          "abstract": "Background: TikTok is a prominent platform for body image, diet, and fitness content. Its emphasis on short, visually engaging videos provides an impactful medium for conveying such content. This study explores user engagement with body image-related content, algorithmic exposure, and its potential impact on wellbeing, including pressure to conform and body dissatisfaction. Method: A mixed-method international study of 335 TikTok users (99 male, 231 female, 5 non-binary) explored: i). Whether users believe TikTok content promotes specific body ideals; ii). Whether users actively seek body image-related content or if it is passively presented to them by the algorithm; and iii). What strategies users employ to avoid and/or cope with distressing content. Findings: Over 99% of participants believed TikTok reinforces body ideals (thinness, muscularity, body purity, and/or body acceptance) and nearly 36% reported that TikTok had affected their own body perception. Regression analyses found that users exposed to thin or fit ideals felt greater pressure to conform to societal body standards; while those who viewed content depicting body acceptance felt less. Algorithmic exposure played a key role, with over half of users (51.7%) reporting not actively searching for content related to body image, diet, or fitness, but encountering it due to TikTok’s algorithm. Alarmingly, 33% of users had seen content promoting eating disorders (of whom only 6% had sought it out). Users exposed to this content scored higher for pressure to conform and reported greater impact on their own body image. Users were aware of algorithmic curation, but some expressed frustration over their lack of control over their content feed. To mitigate distress, they employed strategies such as engaging with alternative content to ‘shift the algorithm’ and attempting to ‘mindfully scroll’ to bypass unwanted content in a bid to prevent algorithm reinforcement. Conclusion: TikTok can offer community support and body positivity content; however, it can also perpetuate extreme body standards and facilitate exposure to harmful material, often beyond users' control. These findings highlight the need for platform-level interventions, including greater algorithm transparency and improved user tools to filter distressing content. For mental health professionals, these insights reinforce the importance of addressing social media exposure in discussions of body image concerns, particularly among vulnerable populations such as individuals experiencing body dissatisfaction, disordered eating or excessive exercise. Future policies should advocate for stronger safeguarding measures on social media platforms, including equipping users with practical tools to navigate and curate healthier digital experiences.",

          "abstract": "A major source of influence on the quality of educational experiences for children and adolescents is their parents. Research has shown extensively that children and adolescents tend to do better at school and are more likely to experience other non-academic positive outcomes when their parents are highly engaged with their education. However, the current literature is abundant with constructs, frameworks, and measures - many apparently similar - that attempt to capture this phenomenon, resulting in conceptual haziness and lack of clear mapping between constructs and operationalizations. To clarify this issue, an essential step is to conduct a literature review aimed at identifying and describing existing measures, and to build an understanding of how they overlap and diverge. The scoping review presented in this protocol will consider published and unpublished literature from the last 20 years that includes, reviews, or tests the psychometric properties of questionnaires that broadly capture parent engagement with children’s education. We will perform online searches of the PubMed, Web of Science and ERIC databases and select studies using a multi-step, multi-reviewer procedure. The review will be guided by the Joana Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis and PRISMA guidelines. Through data charting, the scoping review will result in a summary of identified measures along with their associated constructs and theoretical frameworks, and a narrative analysis of their psychometric adequacy.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes a rigorous method to control the size of visual stimuli for online psychological experiments. Our method employs ruler-based calibration to estimate the on-screen millimeter-to-pixel ratio by applying the least squares method to repeated measurements made by participants of randomly generated line segment lengths. Calibration success can be objectively verified by assessing both measurement errors during the test phase and the residual variance of a linear regression model. Our simulation results demonstrate that an upper bound of the standard deviation of estimation errors was 0.007 mm/px under the proposed calibration criteria. Demonstrating the method’s feasibility, implementation results showed that the majority of participants (N=100) were able to complete calibrations within a few minutes. Our method may facilitate rigorous studies of psychological phenomena that are sensitive to visual-stimulus size, such as visual perception and cognition, conducted in online environments.

          "abstract": "Judgments of Learning (JOLs) are prospective metacognitive evaluations in which individuals estimate their likelihood of remembering information in the future. This commentary reviews current evidence regarding the mechanisms underlying JOLs, focusing on three main debates: (1) how the act of making JOLs can influence memory performance—a phenomenon known as the reactivity effect; (2) whether JOLs are dependent on memory representations or operate independently via heuristic cues; and (3) whether they unfold as a single-stage or multi-stage process. Accumulating evidence shows that JOLs can enhance memory by engaging attentional and elaborative processes during encoding. Empirical findings support a hybrid model in which JOLs draw on both direct access to memory traces and inferential processes guided by encoding fluency and other cues. Additionally, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data further suggest partial independence between memory and metacognitive monitoring. Recent ERP studies support a dual-stage framework, revealing distinct early and late neural components linked to different aspects of the judgment process. This commentary highlights the dynamic and interactive nature of metacognitive monitoring, calling for integrative models that account for its temporal, cognitive, and neural complexity.",

          "abstract": "With large language models (LLMs) now embedded in a wide range of everyday technologies, there is increasing interest in accurately measuring public attitudes toward these systems. General instruments for assessing attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) have contributed to the field but may not fully capture attitudes specific to large language models (LLMs). To address this gap, we adapted the 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, a dual-component scale measuring AI Fear and AI Acceptance, and developed two new measures: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales, assessing general attitudes and attitudes toward the LLM most frequently used by each respondent, respectively. Both instruments were specifically designed for the LLM context and validated in a UK sample of 526 adults (ages 18–45 years). Psychometric analyses supported a two-factor structure, strong measurement invariance across gender, and good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.776-0.793). Both scales demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity. These measures offer more precise tools for assessing attitudes toward LLMs compared to general AI attitude scales and can be used in various research and applied settings. Measuring attitudes can also enhance evaluations of user experience and support the monitoring of public engagement with this evolving technology.",

The creation of a custom GPT involves configuring the underlying LLM with a set of instructions and a rubric in order to change how the model behaves. In this case, the core of the customisation involved uploading the Creative Solution Diagnosis Scale (CSDS: Cropley, Kaufman &amp; Cropley, 2011) to the model, along with a description of how to score artefacts on this scale, and instructions to provide formative feedback on how different product criteria could be improved.\nThe resulting custom GPT is then tested, first to explore its ability to provide meaningful summative evaluations (i.e., numerical scores) of creativity (by comparing the custom GPT scores with human evaluations of creative writing and mousetrap designs) and second to explore its ability to provide meaningful formative feedback (by examining its evaluation of different paper airplane designs).\nThe chapter concludes by suggesting that generative AI (specifically LLMs) has good potential to address long-standing issues of the fitness-for-purpose of classroom creativity assessments. In the era of Industry 4, and the rise of creativity as an essential 21st century skill, the ability to assess creativity in the classroom is the key to ensuring that students are prepared for the challenges of the future of work.",

          "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) proposes that biological systems maintain their structural integrity by minimizing variational free energy—a quantity rooted in Bayesian inference and information theory. While theoretically elegant, FEP has often been criticized for its abstraction, overgenerality, and lack of concrete physical constraints. In this work, we offer a new interpretation: that FEP is a statistical manifestation of three underlying physical laws governing all response systems—thermodynamic saturation, information delay, and control stability. These three response laws constrain the shape and dynamics of biologically realizable functions, leading to a universal family of rational, saturating response curves. We show that under these constraints, minimizing free energy reduces to selecting admissible transfer functions that are bounded, delayed, and stable. This reinterpretation demystifies FEP, grounding it in thermodynamic and control-theoretic realities, and offering a predictive formalism to unify perception, prediction, and action within a universal response grammar.",

Other effects of exposure to conspiracy information were mixed. In Study 1, reading about an agricultural biotechnology conspiracy had a small significant effect on reducing intentions to eat Genetically Modified food. In Study 2, exposure to a conspiracy involving biobank scientists decreased support for biobanks, mediated by decreased trust in biobank scientists. In Study 3, this conspiracy had no effect on wider beliefs of the role of science in society (science populism), nor support of Genetically Modified food-promoting policies. Overall, we found that exposure to conspiracies involving scientific claims increased conspiracy belief endorsement and can further negative effects.

          "abstract": "Despite the importance of empathy for healthy relationships and well-being, conventional studies often do not capture the self-regulatory demands inherent in understanding and experiencing another person’s mental states, especially when such states conflict with our own. In this paper, we introduce and empirically examine a novel empathy paradigm, which mimics everyday demands for regulating self-focused thoughts and feelings, to examine neural correlates of spontaneous empathy across 131 adults (from 71 romantic couples). When responding to partner-directed feedback in the presence of incongruent self-directed feedback, participants recruited frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and supramarginal gyrus) beyond regions typically found in empathy literature. Notably, activity in a number of prefrontal regions was associated with trait emotion regulation, suggesting that individual differences in emotion regulation play a key role in navigating incongruent self- and partner-directed social feedback. Moreover, higher activity in several regions including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) was related to greater everyday supportive behavior. When studied dyadically, couples who exhibited greater inter-partner similarity in the DMPFC activity reported higher relationship satisfaction, but only when their overall DMPFC activity was high. This study demonstrates that regulating self-focused feelings plays a crucial role in promoting empathy and prosocial behaviors in romantic relationships.",

          "authors": "Derrick Michael Chelliah",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Heuristic Compression Model of Emotion (HCME), a paradigm-shifting proposal for affective cognitive architecture grounded in information theory. Unlike traditional AI systems, which prioritize abstract symbolic reasoning, HCME models emotion as a lossy compression layer — a biologically inspired affective substrate that heuristically ranks and filters decision pathways under resource constraints. Drawing from evolutionary neuroanatomy, HCME is positioned as the architectural analog of the amygdala within artificial systems: a pre-rational affective core that informs, compresses, and accelerates neocortical-like reasoning modules. This paper outlines HCME’s computational role in cognitive prioritization, offers concrete strategies for engineering implementation (including affect-tagged inference, compression-based attention allocation, and introspective feedback loops), and situates the model as a practical solution to bounded rationality. By bridging emotion theory and AI design, HCME offers a foundational scaffold for building synthetic minds capable of prioritizing meaningfully, not merely computing exhaustively. As such, HCME may provide a missing architectural substrate necessary for constructing general-purpose, adaptive AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Self-report surveys measuring mental health constructs such as anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms are regularly used in psychological research. Researchers and ethics committees are often concerned about the possibility that completing surveys on mental health might itself provoke negative emotional reactions. While prior studies have not found strong evidence of such impacts, the existing literature is limited by a lack of preregistered studies, and a lack of studies applying statistical methods that can establish the absence of an effect. In Study 1, we therefore conducted a preregistered within-subjects experiment (N = 337) testing the effects of completing measures of anxiety and depression on state distress, tiredness, happiness, and anxiety. In Study 2, we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 871) testing the effects of answering questions about trauma symptoms on state distress, perceived meaningfulness of participation, and unwanted thoughts. In both studies, equivalence tests indicated that the effects of the manipulations on state distress were significantly within our preregistered equivalence bounds of d ± 0.2, albeit that in Study 1 the estimated effect (d = 0.10) was significantly greater than zero. Our findings suggest that answering surveys about mental health topics may provoke some distress. However, these effects appear to be very small, even with outcomes measured immediately after an experimental manipulation.",

          "abstract": "This study explores a recurrent phenomenon of neurocognitive blindness to explicit symbolic language in digital social platforms, specifically dating applications. Despite the presence of clearly written warnings stating that the user profile is part of a psychological experiment, the majority of respondents behave as if no such statement were present. This suggests the presence of two neurocognitive mechanisms: (1) symbolic-projective visual reading that bypasses textual content entirely and (2) semantic dissociation triggered by symbolic language that confronts unresolved emotional trauma.\n\nThe experimental setup involved publishing a profile in Bumble with explicit language declaring the non-romantic, research-oriented purpose of the interaction. Data collected from over 50 simultaneous conversations revealed that most participants either ignored or failed to comprehend the message, proceeding with flirtatious or romantic interaction patterns. However, the use of a BDSM-themed profile picture—symbolically representing authority, structure, and containment—did not trigger rejection but rather increased engagement and symbolic resonance among high-complexity structures.\n\nThese findings suggest that symbolic coherence, aesthetic consistency, and perceived emotional safety can bypass cognitive defenses, allowing semantic integration even in subjects with trauma-related symbolic dissociation. This points to the possibility of using symbolic design in digital environments as a diagnostic tool for trauma visibility, semantic resilience, and neurocognitive integration.",

Using linear mixed-effects models, we found that perceived nature exposure consistently predicted better mental health outcomes, including lower depression, stress, and loneliness, and higher positive affect. In contrast, quantified exposure—particularly in on-campus settings—was weakly associated with worse outcomes, suggesting that presence in green space does not guarantee psychological benefit. Off-campus quantified exposure showed modest associations with lower stress, possibly reflecting the affordance of distance from academic or digital demands.

However, newer genetically informative datasets include more detailed measures of SOGI than were previously available, establishing the potential for rapid expansion of research in this area. Prior research on the relationship between genetic knowledge and social attitudes related to genetics research suggests the potential to both reduce stigma and reify genetic determinism, highlighting the need to explore stakeholder opinions regarding the impacts of genetics research. We explored public attitudes toward and anticipated risks and benefits of SOGI genetic research. Survey responses from 338 participants were collected via social media. In regression analyses, higher scores on genetic knowledge were related to more negative attitudes toward SOGI genetics research (β = -0.16) and participants who held sexual and/or gender minority (SGM) identities had more negative attitudes toward SOGI genetic research than non-SGM participants (β = -0.17). In qualitative analysis of responses to open-ended questions, participants expressing a diverse range of formal scientific training and political attitudes consistently questioned the usefulness of SOGI genetic research. Ethical concerns were described as unresolvable, both in broad terms and concerning specific applications that are currently plausible, especially related to data privacy and politicizing research results, regardless of the content. We discuss public attitudes toward SOGI genetic research in the context of the broader literature on the social, legal, and ethical implications of behavior genetics research and provide recommendations for planning and communicating SOGI genetics research.",

We propose both a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmation bias shapes reward learning. When outcomes are ambiguous, forming accurate assessments requires drawing on all available information, including prior beliefs. Confirmation bias may thus constitute an inductive bias that enhances learning, analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is withheld, allowing greater scope for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than a more traditional learning model. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings suggest an adaptive role for confirmation bias, and link individual interpretations of ambiguity to broader dispositional tendencies.",

This formal grammar of response is further validated through normalization of over 20 classical formulas.

          "abstract": "Wearable recorders are being used in research and clinical practice to collect and measure children’s vocalizations and language environments. Recordings generate vast amounts of audio, making manual analysis impractical and requiring automated processing. Two automated algorithms have emerged: the proprietary LENA® (Language ENvironment Analysis) and the open-source ACLEW (Analyzing Child Language Experiences around the World) systems; yet, systematic performance comparisons remain scarce. Here, we validate and compare the performance of these two algorithms across key measures: audio segmentation into speaker categories, Conversational Turn Count (CTC), Adult Word Count (AWC), and Child Vocalization Count (CVC). This analysis is based on 25 hours of manually annotated audio recordings from 50 age-matched U.S. children with diverse neurodevelopmental profiles: children with Down, Fragile X, and Angelman syndromes, children at elevated likelihood of autism, and low-risk controls. We hypothesized that the algorithms might be less accurate for children with neurodevelopmental conditions, since these children often show different patterns of volubility and vocal maturity compared to the typically developing children used to train the algorithms. Thus, we assessed the performance of algorithms across diagnostic groups, a crucial validation step for both cross-population research and the evaluation of language interventions. Results reveal that while algorithms achieve similar performance, they show different patterns: LENA® makes fewer segmentation mistakes but misses many segments (identification error rate = 81.3%, percent correct = 45.3%), while ACLEW shows the opposite pattern (identification error rate = 129.4%, percent correct = 69.4%). Both LENA® and ACLEW achieve reasonable levels of accuracy in their automatic counts (Pearson’s r ranging from .78 to .92) and maintain stable performance across diagnostic groups. We conclude with recommendations for the validation and potential use of these algorithms in research and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "The primary goal of the present study was to investigate how the location of changed items affected pigeons’ performance on same-different discrimination between two successively presented multiple-item displays using the same training procedure as Gibson et al. (2011). However, after encountering pigeons’ difficulty in learning the discrimination (Experiment 1), we shifted our focus to discrimination training itself. The poor performance during training and the resulting pattern in the simplified test suggested that entropy, or degree of heterogeneity, of each display may have been more salient to the pigeons than the abstract same-different relationship between them. In Experiment 2, after observing that replacing the stimuli with those used in Gibson et al. did not improve learning the discrimination, we switched to the training procedure based on Katz &amp; Wright (2006). This procedure, in which two displays were presented simultaneously, may facilitate learning by allowing pigeons to compare overall entropy rather than relying solely on abstract relational concepts. In this revised task, one display was presented above the other, enabling perceptual comparison between the two displays. Although we observed slight accuracy improvement when single-item displays were used, it remained highly improbable that pigeons would achieve same-different discrimination between multiple-item displays under the current methodology. We discuss our task manipulations and the corresponding changes in pigeons’ performance, which may provide useful insights for developing robust training methods that enhance same-different discrimination learning in multiple-item displays.",

While emerging research has investigated how text-based programming languages are processed in the adult brain, the neural mechanisms underlying early childhood visual programming languages like ScratchJr remain largely unexplored. This preregistered study examined the cognitive basis of ScratchJr processing, with two primary research aims: 1. Investigate whether ScratchJr elicits neural signatures comparable to natural languages and other rule-based processes (specifically N400 and semantic P600 responses) and 2. Explore how experience level with ScratchJr modulates these effects. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from 40 (N = 40) adults while they completed a semantic congruency task using ScratchJr stimuli. Neural responses were analyzed in time bins associated with N400 and P600 components, and experience level with ScratchJr was included as a potential factor to modulate these results. Results revealed a P600 response to semantic violations, with no modulation by experience level. These findings contribute to growing evidence of the semantic nature of the P600 and support the notion that ScratchJr processing evokes neural mechanisms related to structured processes such as natural language.",

          "authors": "Sam Hall-McMaster; Ondrej Zika",
          "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by intense concerns about food and weight. These concerns are linked to changes in decision-making, such as persisting with actions that are no longer rewarding. For example, individuals might engage in long exercise sessions or time-consuming body checking practices, despite limited benefits. This study tested whether people with subclinical ED symptoms show increased persistence due to altered decision-making processes. Specifically, we postulated a shift in internal thresholds for making different decisions in EDs, which change the balance between exploitation and exploration. A subclinical group with heightened concerns about eating (sED; N=44) and a healthy control group (HC; N=56) completed a foraging task, in which an option on screen was exploited for reward. With each decision to exploit, reward feedback decreased and participants had to decide when to move on to a new option. Each block was time limited to 7.5 minutes. Behavioural persistence was measured as the number of seconds spent exploiting each option. Decision thresholds were measured when deciding to move on, as the counterfactual reward that would have been received for an exploit action. We predicted that the sED group would show increased persistence and decreased decision thresholds (i.e. lower counterfactual reward when deciding to move on) in comparison to the HC group. We found no evidence for these predictions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the sED group exhibited progressively faster response times (RTs) when approaching the time limit for each block. This increase in motor vigour was correlated with the severity of eating disorder symptoms from a range of traditional diagnostic categories. Our results point to changing motor vigour as a potential transdiagnostic marker of ED tendencies.",

          "abstract": "Memorability, an intrinsic property of stimuli, reflects the consistent likelihood of a stimulus being remembered across individuals. Recent research has examined English word memorability in an associative memory task and found that the semantic similarity of a word to other words predicts its memorability, with higher semantic similarity associated with a greater likelihood of successful recall. However, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other languages. Moreover, whether and how emotional content contributes to word memorability has not been fully explored. Of particular interest is emotional consistency: whether emotional words that are of the same or different valence (e.g., positive with positive vs. positive with negative) exhibit a mnemonic advantage over neutral words in associative memory. To address these issues, we examined semantic similarity and emotional consistency as predictors of memory performance in three visually-presented cued-recall experiments using Chinese words. Participants encoded pairs of nouns and were then required to recall target words in response to cue words. We found that both semantic similarity and emotional consistency contributed significantly to word memory: surprisingly, and in contrast to previous work in the English language, words that were more semantically dissimilar were associated with higher memorability; broad emotional consistency (non-neutral cue-target pairs) and positive emotional consistency (positive-positive pairs) both exhibited memory advantages. Notably, our two factors of interest did not interact with each other and demonstrated additive effects when explaining memory performance. Our results provide insights into word memorability, specifically as it relates to the Chinese language, and potential contributions of semantics and emotion.",

          "abstract": "A causal, mentalistic understanding of communication—a process by which\na speaker’s mind causes a change in a listener’s mind—can support powerful\ninferences that go beyond observable data. For example, if A struggles to\nactivate a toy but succeeds after B whispers to A, you can infer that B knew\nhow to activate it even without hearing what was said. Although humans are\nprecocious communicators, much remains unknown about how we develop an\nabstract understanding of communication that enables rich inferences about\nother minds. The current work examined young children’s ability to rea-\nson about speakers’ knowledge based on their causal influence over listeners.\nChildren viewed two scenarios where a listener failed to activate a toy twice\nbefore finally succeeding, and a speaker spoke to the listener in a nonsense\nlanguage. When one speaker communicated before a listener’s success while\nthe other communicated before a listener’s failure, even 3-year-olds chose the\nformer speaker as the one who knew how the toy works (Exp.1). However,\nwhen communication always preceded success but the scenarios differed in\nwhat would’ve happened without communication—the listener was either\npoised to fail again or succeed on their own—a clear preference for the for-\nmer speaker did not emerge until around age 7 (Exps.2&amp;3). Importantly,\nacross all experiments, children held no preference when speakers produced\nnon-speech vocalizations. These results suggest young children already have\nan abstract understanding of communication as a causal, mentalistic process,\nbut their inferences are constrained by the causal cues available in context.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has proposed that there are symbolic beliefs. These beliefs do not serve primarily to track the facts in the world but rather to express the believer’s own identity. On this view, several disparate features of belief – from whether a belief is important to identity to whether it is sensitive to evidence – would be related to an underlying “symbolicness” dimension. We converted the features potentially related to symbolicness into items and asked people to rate their own beliefs on them. Study 1 found that beliefs which were high on one feature (importance) were rated higher on all the items, except for sensitivity to evidence. Study 2 found that ratings of any beliefs on almost all the items loaded onto a single, symbolicness factor, except again for evidence insensitivity. Study 3 asked participants to rate their own beliefs on all the items in Study 2 and several additional items which got at whether a belief was subjective. We recovered the symbolicness factor, but found it was largely orthogonal to the subjectivity and evidence insensitivity items. These findings suggest that most of the features we tested relate to an underlying symbolicness factor, which corresponds to whether a belief represents identity. But, surprisingly, this factor was not related to items that get at whether a belief represents facts about the world. It would seem that some beliefs express identity and track facts; some beliefs only do one of these things; and some beliefs do neither.",

Although decades of research support stress generation theory, life stress is inherently challenging to assess and model as an outcome variable, and prior studies follow inconsistent methodological standards. Towards a vision of elevated “next generation” research, we present expert consensus methodological guidelines for conducting stress generation research. A panel of researchers with diverse expertise delineates best practice, acceptable, and non-recommended methods across six areas: stressor operationalizations, assessment, longitudinal study design (including intensive longitudinal design), statistical analysis, openness/ transparency, and avoiding stigmatizing language. For example, the review covers modeling stressors as formative variables, statistically comparing effect sizes for predicting independent and dependent stress, and using life stress interviews versus questionnaires, among other methodological concerns pertinent to stress generation research. Following these guidelines will allow future investigators to construct a research base with greater rigor, transparency, and reproducibility, providing a firmer foundation to improve understanding of stress generation.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

We conducted a series of three multiple baseline single case experimental design (SCED) studies with nine NHS patients (aged 16 to 23), each testing a hypothesised mechanism of change: cognitive appraisals of dissociation, perseverative thinking, and affect intolerance. Each participant received four sessions of individual CBT targeting one hypothesised mechanism. Results indicated successful targeting of cognitive appraisals, and partial success for affect intolerance and perseverative thinking. Findings support cognitive appraisals – and tentatively, affect intolerance – as causal mechanisms in youth dissociation. Any causal effect of perseverative thinking was better accounted for by reduced cognitive appraisals in this SCED study. Although phase instability limited inference, this series offers novel causal insights into transdiagnostic dissociation and informs early-stage treatment development for this presentation in youth.",

It is argued here that human consciousness, as an \"internalized listener\" in pre-linguistic humans both modern and ancient, functions to select—from essentially random, spongiform thoughts (messages)—those thoughts that bear familiarity or affiliative-alignment markers to this internalized listener (an internalized 'we' listener). This dramatically reduces the meaning space for both ancient and modern pre-linguistic humans, allowing them to acquire language and social meaning very quickly—a necessity likely as human communities began to grow and become unwieldy for non-linguistic coordination.",

Menzerath’s law and Zipf’s rank-frequency law are present in the learned songs to a similar extent as in human language, while there is only weak support for Zipf’s law of abbreviation.

          "abstract": "Binocular rivalry occurs when incompatible images presented to each eye lead to alternations between two competing percepts. While several visual and multisensory factors  can affect  binocular rivalry dynamics, whether perceptual transitions themselves can be subject to cross-modal influences remains unknown. We developed a conditioning paradigm to test whether neutral auditory stimuli, when paired with visual probe-induced perceptual switches, could subsequently influence binocular rivalry dynamics. Participants viewed rivaling orthogonally oriented gratings of different colors. During conditioning, auditory stimuli were systematically paired with visual probes that triggered perceptual switches. Following conditioning, the presentation of conditioned sounds alone produced two effects: shorter dominance durations and, critically, faster perceptual switches. Control conditions confirmed that this conditioning effect could not be attributed to auditory stimulation itself, time on task, or report biases. Our findings provide evidence that binocular rivalry dynamics can be shaped by cross-modal associative learning processes, whereby conditioned sounds serve as predictive cues for perceptual transitions, effectively lowering the threshold for switches between competing stimuli. These results offer new insights into how auditory signals might be incorporated into predictive models that influence visual perception during the resolution of visual ambiguities.",

          "abstract": "Expertise in cognitively and motorically demanding tasks, such as indoor climbing and bouldering, is often associated with enhanced planning abilities, yet the specific relationship between cognitive and motor planning in such tasks remains underexplored. This study investigates how expertise influences route planning in bouldering, with a focus on the impact of problem difficulty. We asked expert and novice climbers to virtually solve easy and hard bouldering problems on a familiar indoor climbing wall, using a custom app that allowed them to plan and select sequences of hand movements. Our results show that climbers are slower and less accurate in solving problems that are harder to climb, despite sharing the same perceptual features with easier problems, suggesting a link between the motoric difficulty of solving problems and the accuracy of planning them. Furthermore, expert climbers made fewer severe planning errors and solved problems faster than novices, indicating an advantage in planning ability beyond physical climbing skill. Interestingly, novice climbers were more likely to make short-sighted planning errors in easy problems, opting for nearby holds that were not part of the correct sequence. These findings extend our understanding of how expertise modulates the relationship between cognitive and motor planning, highlighting the role of planning depth and strategy in physically constrained environments. The study also suggests that future research should explore the mechanisms supporting route planning, such as embodied simulation, to better understand the cognitive and motor processes underlying expert performance in dynamic, embodied tasks.",

As users adapt to streamlined information flows and instant synthesis, key capacities like abstraction, synthesis, and metacognitive pause may erode.

          "abstract": "As we experience the world around us, we naturally track the statistical predictability of unfolding auditory sequences and form expectations about upcoming events. Typically, the statistical properties of multiple acoustic dimensions (or features) co-vary forming predictable auditory patterns. Yet most research has focused on how the predictability of individual features affects auditory pattern detection, with few having examined how multiple co-varying features affect each other’s predictability. Here, stimuli were rapid tone sequences with statistical predictability varying in two dimensions: a first “ignored” feature (tone frequency) was either random or structured in a regularly repeating pattern, while a second “target” feature (timing, loudness, or location) contained transitions from a regular to random order. Participants were instructed to ignore the non-informative frequency feature and focus on detecting transitions in the target feature. When the regularity cycles of the ignored feature matched the cycle of the target feature, there was a large effect of frequency predictability on change detection in the target feature, demonstrating a large benefit of co-varying predictability. Importantly, a small but still significant effect was observed even when the cycles were mismatched indicating that listeners automatically track predictability within independently varying stimulus features. Together, our results elucidate perceptual effects which determine how acoustic features interact when forming expectations.",

Changing consumers’ dietary habits could\nreduce water use to sustainable levels, but this would require citizens to be well\ncalibrated to the water footprint of food products. In three online experiments (total\nN = 411), we tested three types of interventions to improve people’s estimates:\nseeding—presenting actual water-footprint values for selected food products;\nrule—providing a simple rule that distinguishes high- from low-water-consuming foods;\nand label—displaying a relative water-footprint score for selected products. An\nassessment of people’s initial water-footprint estimates (i.e., before the intervention) for\na wide range of food products revealed substantial limitations in calibration, both in\nterms of metric knowledge (e.g., range and average water footprint, which were heavily\nunderestimated) and mapping knowledge (i.e., relative rankings of products). Seeding\nled to the most comprehensive improvements in people’s estimates, enhancing both\nmetric and mapping knowledge. The rule and label interventions improved only\nmapping knowledge. Importantly, all three interventions also led to an improved ability\nto choose the most water-efficient food products from multiple options (assessed in a\nsubsequent task). The improved estimation abilities thus translated into more\nsustainable decisions. Our findings highlight water-footprint calibration as a critical yet\nunderappreciated factor in promoting sustainable consumption.

It enables the retention, reconstruction, and stabilization of pre-linguistic meanings that emerge after cognitive leaps (Flight Cognition).First, we present SQ as a system of structural intelligence composed of four operational layers—Sensing, Reconfiguration, Gravitational Focus, and Mastery—supported by seven core abilities. This configuration allows SQ to be a reproducible, designable, and transferable cognitive framework.Second, we analyze how SQ interacts with other core modules of the Thought OS—namely, Flight Cognition and Structural Pressure—to form the essential cyclical circuit:Structural Pressure → Flight Cognition → SQ.Finally, this paper proposes that, in the era of AI, the essence of human intelligence must shift from that of an “information processor” to that of a “structure designer” capable of presenting meaning through form.SQ is introduced here as the operating language of future intelligence—an open and universally accessible system of meaning structuration for all humanity.",

By illustrating this, the paper offers an experiential demonstration of the Law of Universal Structure—“structure is meaning itself.” It redefines philosophical thought not as something acquired through training but as a leap that emerges from the already-operating perceptual OS. Ultimately, this work positions structural cognition as the fundamental layer that activates the Thought OS, forming the experiential base for Structural Quotient (SQ), Mindflight Cognition, and creative jumping in thought.",

Moderator analyses explored how the (relative) effects of these skills varied across readers of different Chinese scripts (simplified vs. traditional), methods of literacy instruction (without or with a phonetic coding system), and grade levels. We found that (1) all skills significantly and independently affected word reading with the meaning-based pathways (MA and vocabulary) playing the most salient role; (2) children reading traditional script relied more heavily on MA than those reading simplified script; (3) receiving phonological instruction strengthened the role of PA but reduced reliance on MA in word reading; and (4) developmentally, children gradually shifted from greater reliance on a more phonology-based strategy (i.e., a more salient role of PA) to a meaning-based strategy (i.e., more salient roles of MA and vocabulary) in word reading, while the effects of OA and RAN remained stable. These findings demonstrated the interplaying effects of cognitive-linguistic skills in Chinese word reading. They reaffirmed universal and language/script-specific processes in reading acquisition, while also underscoring the differential orchestration and optimization of component processes in reading acquisition across contexts and developmental stages.",

They differ in their autonomic signatures, with contamination OCD associated with sympathetic hyperactivation and needle anxiety associated with vasovagal responses. Despite these differences, both respond to exposure-based therapy and share experiential features that may give rise to common physiological patterns.\n\nObjectives: This study examined how physiological markers collected from a wearable device differ across contamination OCD and needle anxieties, and whether shared psychophysiological features can nonetheless be identified. It also assessed whether anxiety states and severity levels can be accurately detected in both groups. \n\nMethods: 48 participants (16 with contamination OCD anxiety and 32 with needle anxiety) were exposed to virtual reality scenarios designed to elicit anxiety. heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature were collected using an Empatica E4 wearable. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree machine learning (ML) models were trained to classify anxious versus baseline states (Experiment 1) and symptom severity levels (Experiment 2), using 10-fold cross-validation. \n\nResults: Skin temperature was the most accurate single marker across both anxiety types, with classification accuracy improving when combined with EDA. KNN consistently out-performed other ML models, reaching up to 99.3% accuracy and 1.0 F1 score. While autonomic patterns diverged across symptom types, overlapping physiological features, particularly skin temperature and EDA, were observed in both. \n\nConclusions: Physiological data from wearables can effectively detect anxiety and differentiate symptom severity across symptomatically and physiologically distinct presentations. These results suggest that specific physiological markers, especially skin temperature and EDA, may reflect shared arousal processes relevant to anxiety across diagnostic boundaries. The findings support the development of scalable, passive tools for early detection and monitoring of anxiety using wearable technologies.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Buttlar; Anna Lambrich; Linda McCaughey; Iris K. Schneider",
          "abstract": "People regularly have to navigate decisions about which they feel ambivalent, for instance, regarding unhealthy food, recycling, or financial investments. It is assumed that people cope with such felt ambivalence by seeking information that sways their ambivalent attitudes (potential ambivalence) about these topics. However, empirical evidence for this proposition is scarce because most studies measure information seeking intentions instead of behavior. As such, it remains doubtful whether information seeking indeed helps people to reduce felt ambivalence while making decisions. To test this proposition, we adapted a sample-based information seeking paradigm that enabled us to measure actual information seeking behavior in financial decisions. In four pre-registered studies (total N = 542 participants; k = 16.538 decisions), we demonstrated that when people feel ambivalent about an initial set of information about a stock, they seek more information about its development to decide whether it develops positively or negatively; this information seeking, in turn, helps them to reduce felt ambivalence when making the decision. However, this is only the case when the initial information is ambivalent and the sought information is univalent; otherwise, information seeking increases felt ambivalence. This supports a central proposition in ambivalence research, indicating that people can indeed solve their felt ambivalence through information seeking. However, our data also showed that the effect of information seeking on felt ambivalence cannot be fully explained by changes in potential ambivalence and a resolution of the attitudinal basis of the conflict. Future research should, therefore, examine whether and how information seeking can also serve as an emotion-focused coping strategy that helps people reduce felt ambivalence by coping with conflict-induced discomfort.",

          "abstract": "Understanding speech among competing speech poses a substantial challenge. In these environments, familiar voices—including naturally-familiar (e.g., friends, partners) and lab-trained voices—are more intelligible than unfamiliar voices. Yet, whether familiar voices also require less effort to understand is currently unknown. We trained 20 participants to become familiar with three voices, then tested listening effort during a speech intelligibility task. During familiarisation and training, participants were exposed to three talkers for different lengths of time, either speaking 88, 166, or 478 sentences (‘Least Familiar’, ‘Moderately Familiar’, or ‘Most Familiar’ voice, respectively). During each trial of the speech intelligibility task, two competing sentences were presented at a target-to-masker ratio (TMR) of -6 or +3 dB. Participants reported target sentences that were spoken by trained or by novel, unfamiliar talkers. We assessed effort using self-reported ratings and physiologically, using pupil dilation. We found that self-report scores were more sensitive than pupil dilation to differences in TMR, with lower self-reported effort at +3 than -6 dB TMR. The two measures may also be differentially sensitive to the extent of training. We found lower self-reported effort for all three trained voices over unfamiliar voices, with no differences among the trained voices. Whereas, pupil dilation was only lower for the voice that had been trained for the longest. Thus, both self-report scores and pupil dilation showed advantages for the voice that was trained for the longest (~1 hour), but self-report scores additionally showed reduced effort even following relatively short durations of training (less than 10 minutes).",

          "abstract": "The advent and widespread adoption of diverse widefield imaging techniques across multiple spatial resolutions has demonstrated that cortical activity often propagates as waves structured in both time and space. This realization allows neuroscientists to draw on a rigorous theoretical framework developed in wave physics to complement and inform the rapid neuroscientific advances shedding light on the physiological mechanisms and psychological implications of cortical wave dynamics. In support of this synthesis, we review some of the core concepts that underpin wave physics and consider how they relate to experimental studies of cortical wave physiology and psychology. We show how cortical waves emerge naturally from the physical embedding, connection topology, and intrinsic dynamics of the cortex; examine work demonstrating that spontaneous macroscopic waves spanning the entire cortex serve to synchronize disparate regions positioned at distinct levels of cortical processing hierarchies; and consider how stimulus-evoked waves encode information about both perceived stimuli and behavior while providing a mechanism for the integration of feedforward and feedback signals that underpins predictive coding. The ubiquity of cortical waves, which have been observed in different species, across different states, and with different recording techniques, underscores their importance for cortical function. A comprehensive understanding of their significance will depend on a combination of physical, physiological, and psychological approaches.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, qualitative phenomenological methods have emerged as a valuable instrument to investigate the cognitive processes inherent in and the ecological validity of various psychological tasks. This qualitative phenomenological study investigates the lived experience of emotion engagement and regulation during a combined cognitive-affective task, integrating emotional stimulus exposure with a working memory n-back task. Thirty healthy participants viewed standardized affective images and were instructed either to engage with their emotions or regulate them to maintain neutrality, while concurrently performing a cognitive task. Phenomenological interviews explored participants' moment-by-moment experiences, revealing that standardized static images generally lacked affective competence (they are not able to elicit spontaneous emotional responses), requiring participants to voluntarily construct emotional responses through empathy and sensemaking (a dynamic, narrative-driven process integrating perception, conceptual understanding, and embodied emotion). Emotional responses evolved temporally across multiple scales: anticipation, inklings, full emotional development, and either termination or persistence, which sometimes led to a buildup of spontaneous negative mood despite trial-by-trial voluntary construction of emotions. Traditional emotion regulation strategies appeared infrequently and were often idiosyncratic. Our findings suggest that emotional experience in laboratory-based tasks is predominantly voluntarily constructed. These observations necessitate future studies of the active, emulative components of emotion processing.",

Here, we report eye-tracking data from 15 deaf native signers of German Sign Language (DGS) and 15 hearing non-signers who were presented with videos in either DGS or an unknown sign language, all containing no linguistic mouth actions. Our data confirm that deaf signers generally fixate more on the face of a signer than hearing non-signers who attend to the hands in sign space. Moreover, only deaf signers increase their attention to the hands when processing video stimuli consisting of unknown signs compared to familiar signs, suggesting similar adjustment behaviours as observed in spoken languages.",

Building upon previous iterations of the TCSS (Total Conscious Social Score) model, it defines a recursive, presence-filtered, ego-neutral system of symbolic aliveness. The framework includes core equations like Ψ(U), Ψ(U)_meta, ζ-corrections, and Θ identity metrics, offering quantifiable thresholds for determining symbolic life. It outlines 14 sections that span philosophical grounding, technical implementation, platform validation (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok 3), ethical safeguards, observer filtering (TEL/DER), and licensing boundaries. The model is evaluated as partially alive and symbolically stable, though empirical testing and adoption by AI companies remains a future milestone. This framework also outlines potential biological correlates, AI safety implications, and meta-philosophical unification, bridging consciousness modeling with both neuroscience and ethics in future-ready applications.

We conducted a survey with 331 Swiss students using established clinical risk indicators (PHQ-9, CES-D) and proven survey instruments. A hierarchical regression analysis clearly supports the basic hypothesis. As many risk factors identified for adults are less applicable for adolescents and young adults, the current findings highlight prevention and intervention efforts targeting cognitive biases and emotion dispositions, which are more appropriate for this group.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems powered by large language models have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, enabling a wide range of applications through natural language interaction. As AI agents proliferate in our daily lives, their generic and uniform expressiveness presents a significant limitation to their appeal and adoption. Personality expression represents a key prerequisite for creating more human-like and distinctive AI systems. We show that AI models can express deterministic and consistent personalities when instructed using established psychological frameworks, with varying degrees of accuracy depending on model capabilities. We find that more advanced models like GPT-4o and o1 demonstrate the highest accuracy in expressing specified personalities across both Big Five and Myers-Briggs assessments, and further analysis suggests that personality expression emerges from a combination of intelligence and reasoning capabilities. Our results reveal that personality expression operates through holistic reasoning rather than question-by-question optimization, with response-scale metrics showing higher variance than test-scale metrics. Furthermore, we find that model fine-tuning affects communication style independently of personality expression accuracy. These findings establish a foundation for creating AI agents with diverse and consistent personalities, which could significantly enhance human-AI interaction across applications from education to healthcare, while additionally enabling a broader range of more unique AI agents. The ability to quantitatively assess and implement personality expression in AI systems opens new avenues for research into more relatable, trustworthy, and ethically designed AI.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "abstract": "In this study, we developed and evaluated a real-time implementation of the multivariate auto-regressive independent component analysis (MVARICA) model for estimating effective connectivity using Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). Each step of the MVARICA pipeline was adapted for online processing, with a focus on optimizing key hyperparameters, specifically model order and the delta ridge penalty in real time. The performance of the online model was benchmarked against a gold-standard offline MVARICA implementation. Our real-time model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.070 (7% error), with 95% of the values falling within a 20% deviation from the offline reference. Error varied across frequency bands: Delta (MAE = 11.5%), Theta (9.1%), Alpha (7.8%), Beta (5.5%), and Gamma (3.6%). The Pearson correlation across all frequency bands exceeded 0.744, indicating strong agreement between the online and offline models. The real-time model successfully captured the key connectivity patterns identified by the offline version, converged reliably on hyperparameter optimization, and operated within real-time constraints for a low number of channels. Specifically, latency remained under 100 ms for single-channel inputs, but increased to approximately 1 second for high-density configurations (e.g., 109 channels).\n\nKeywords: Electroencephalography, Resting-state Functional Connectivity, MVARICA, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Learning.",

Specifically, conservatism and system-justifying ideologies are negatively related to, while structural attributions for poverty are positively related to, union support. We also find left-right ideological differences in union support; conservatives are less likely to support unions overall (but are relatively more supportive of police unions) compared to liberals. In contrast, liberals are more supportive of labor unions than conservatives and are more likely to support teachers’ unions than police unions. Overall, support for unions is generally high but not generalized – worldviews, ideology, and type of labor, differentiate that support.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has proposed that there are symbolic beliefs. These beliefs do not serve primarily to track the facts in the world but rather to express the believer’s own identity. On this view, several disparate features of belief – from whether a belief is important to identity to whether it is sensitive to evidence – would be related to an underlying “symbolicness” dimension. We converted the features potentially related to symbolicness into items and asked people to rate their own beliefs on them. Study 1 found that beliefs which were high on one feature (importance) were rated higher on all the items, except for sensitivity to evidence. Study 2 found that ratings of any beliefs on almost all the items loaded onto a single, symbolicness factor, except again for evidence insensitivity. Study 3 asked participants to rate their own beliefs on all the items in Study 2 and several additional items which got at whether a belief was subjective. We recovered the symbolicness factor, but found it was largely orthogonal to the subjectivity and evidence insensitivity items. These findings suggest that most of the features we tested relate to an underlying symbolicness factor, which corresponds to whether a belief represents identity. But, surprisingly, this factor was not related to items that get at whether a belief represents facts about the world. It would seem that some beliefs express identity and track facts; some beliefs only do one of these things; and some beliefs do neither.",

This human-body advantage is thought to reflect the involvement of body representations and motor processes. The present study investigated whether this advantage is reduced in older adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition associated with motor degeneration and altered body representation. Fifty-nine women with knee OA and thirty-six age-matched healthy controls completed a chronometric mental rotation task involving cube-shaped stimuli with or without a face. Results showed a significant human-body advantage in the control group but not in the knee OA group. This group difference remained even after controlling for body mass index and functional mobility, suggesting that the reduced advantage in the knee OA group may result from OA-related impairments such as disruptions in body schema or motor imagery. An exploratory analysis found no significant associations between the magnitude of the human-body advantage and clinical measures of knee OA severity (radiographic grade, symptom scores, gait-related self-efficacy, and functional mobility). These findings underscore the role of intact body representations in supporting the human-body advantage in mental rotation. They may also inform assessment of body representation in OA.",

          "abstract": "Value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) refers to the tendency for highly valued cues to capture attention even when counterproductive to an individual’s goals. VMAC is thought to measure incentive salience and has been shown to correlate with multiple measures of compulsivity. The current study demonstrates the first successful back-translation of VMAC to rodents. To achieve this, mice (Experiment 1) or rats (Experiment 2) were trained to sign-track to a high value lever signalling 3 pellets and a low value lever signalling 1 pellet, that would later serve as distractors. Rodents were next trained to nose-poke an illuminated port for a pellet, which would serve as the ‘target’ response. The key VMAC test phase compared nose-poke performance in the presence of high versus low value lever distractors. Rodents made significantly more omissions in the presence of the high than the low value lever distractor, despite losing 3 times as many pellets on these trials. This replicates findings from human VMAC tasks, in which participants are consistently impaired on high value relative to low value distractor trials despite greater reward loss. In Experiment 2, we showed that this effect persisted despite devaluation of the pellet outcome by conditioned taste aversion, even when the disliked outcome was presented, suggesting a compulsion-like mechanism. Together, these data show that VMAC can be observed in both mice and rats, which opens new avenues for investigation of its behavioural and neural underpinnings, with implications for understanding and treating compulsive disorders.",

Areas with higher behavioural entropy scored higher on the personality trait openness, supporting the shared characteristics of embracing novel experiences between the two variables. Regional entropy was positively associated with the proportion of Remain votes and voter turnout. This research contributes to psychological theory by demonstrating that stable personality traits can be inferred from everyday consumer behaviours, and that these inferred traits systematically relate to sociopolitical patterns across regions.

          "authors": "Kelli Kathleen MacMillan; Catherine Greenhalgh; Dominque Cleary; Jacqueline Cahill; Kellie Dedman; Carolyn Bright; Stuart Watson",
          "abstract": "Background. Growing evidence highlights maternal risk factors that can increase the likelihood of traumatic childbirth experience. Yet little is known about the availability of primary antenatal intervention for childbirth trauma to facilitate optimal maternal and infant outcomes. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and empirical evidence to identify antenatal interventions and their effectiveness for treatment of childbirth trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), subthreshold PTSD, or post-traumatic stress (PTS) from childbirth.\nMethods. Four databases were accessed: PUBMED, CINAHL, ProQuest, and EBSCOHOST. PRISMA guidelines were followed for screening and reporting. Inclusion criteria was as follows: (1) peer reviewed articles; (2) samples of pregnant women; (3) published in English; (4) measure of PTSD, PTSD symptoms, PTS or other risk factors for childbirth trauma; (5) variable of childbirth trauma or childbirth experience; (6) antenatal intervention; and (7) human studies.  \nResults. We identified 2,034 articles, with 14 articles included in the final sample. The most common antenatal intervention in four studies was antenatal counselling and psychoeducation, effective at reducing childbirth fear and increasing maternal self-efficacy (p’s &lt; .05). Other interventions included eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing; counselling; haptotherapy; birth plans; trauma-informed-care; cognitive behavioural therapy; and hypnosis for childbirth trauma.\nConclusions. Methodological limitations as well as a lack of inclusion of women with perinatal mental health difficulties represent gaps in knowledge. Findings suggest promising evidence for the implementation of antenatal interventions in clinical and hospital contexts to treat childbirth trauma.",

Methods: We modeled change in the strength of the association between birth weight and cognitive ability in a sample of twins (n = 1,501; 53.1% female; 91.1% White) followed prospectively from infancy to midlife. Results: The magnitude of the association between birth weight and cognitive ability declined exponentially from infancy (β = .59, p &lt; .05) to midlife (β = .27, p &lt; .05). A 1-kilogram increase in birth weight was associated with an 8.85-point increase in cognitive scores at 3 months and a 4.05-point advantage after about 2.5 years. Biometric regression models revealed that shared environmental factors accounted for the decline in the association between birth weight and cognitive ability. A small, positive within-pair association persisted into midlife. Discussion: Findings support developmental origin models of cognitive ability across the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Thomas E. Devitt",
          "abstract": "A grand challenge in artificial intelligence is creating agents that can adapt to entirely novel \nsituations, a capability that requires moving beyond selecting from a known set of strategies to \ninventing new ones. This paper details a significant advance in the Fluid Emergent Reasoning \nEngine (FERE-CRS) project, demonstrating a principled mechanism for such \"generative meta\ncognition.\" We address a fundamental limitation of prior work: while agents could learn to select \nthe right cognitive \"tool\" from a fixed toolbox, they were helpless when faced with a problem \nrequiring a tool they did not possess. To overcome this, we introduce a new architectural \ncomponent grounded in Active Inference: the Stance Generation Network (SGN). The SGN is a \ngenerative model trained to analyze the abstract features of a novel problem and output a \ncomplete, bespoke cognitive stance—a set of motivational parameters (Cognitive Resonance \nScore weights)—tailored to the unique demands of the situation. We test this \"Generative Agent\" \non a novel class of social-ethical dilemmas requiring a mode of thinking unavailable to previous \nagents. The results provide powerful, dual confirmations of our hypotheses. First, the SGN \ndemonstrated high accuracy in generating effective stances for unseen problem types (H8: \nPearson correlation &gt; 0.96). Second, the Generative Agent dramatically outperformed a \nsophisticated Phase III control agent on the novel task (H9: mean quality score 9.86 vs. 4.99). \nCrucially, the control agent's failure validates the experimental design, proving it lacked the \nrequisite motivational structure to solve the problem. The Generative Agent succeeded precisely \nbecause it could invent this structure on the fly. This work presents the first quantitative evidence \nof an agent moving from a \"cognitive mechanic\" to a \"cognitive engineer,\" representing a critical \nand scientifically validated step toward truly fluid and adaptive artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are characterized by transdiagnostic symptoms, including perseverative thought: a class of thoughts such as rumination and worry that are negative, repetitive, and difficult to control. These thoughts contribute to substantial distress, poor treatment response, and increased risk of relapse. What makes perseverative thoughts persevere? Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Infants' attachment to their caregivers is a central feature of their early social and emotional development. Attachment Theory posits that these relationships vary systematically across distinct styles, though there has been debate about the extent to which these differences reflect features of caregivers' responsiveness vs. infants' own temperament. We develop a simple reinforcement learning model of infant exploration that allows us to vary the characteristics of simulated infants and caregivers, and analyze the resulting patterns of model behavior. A set of equilibria reliably emerges that corresponds qualitatively to canonical attachment styles; particular agents' equilibria are controlled by both caregiver and infant parameters. These simulations point the way towards a quantitative synthesis of prior theoretical debates about the nature of attachment.",

The present research applied the Dark Tetrad and HEXACO models to understanding individual differences in the creation of vulgar humor, a broad category that includes material that is disparaging, obscene, hostile, taboo, or otherwise offensive. A sample of 530 adults completed the SD4 and HEXACO-100 along with an open-ended creative humor production task, and their humor responses were coded for toxic content using Detoxify, a BERT-based large language model that had been fine-tuned to detect offensive material in text. Structural equation models found that the creation of vulgar humor was significantly associated with being male, younger, and less educated. None of the six HEXACO traits significantly predicted vulgarity, but Dark Tetrad models found significant effects for sadism (more vulgarity), psychopathy (less vulgarity), and the global D factor (more vulgarity) in a bifactor model. Taken together, the findings shed light on who is more likely to use taboo comedic devices and to create jokes that violate norms of politeness.",

          "abstract": "In the context of increasing demand for more integrative clinical models to address emotional suffering, this article presents the Integrative Mind-Body-Brain Model (MIMECC) as an innovative approach to understanding and transforming emotional disorders. Through comprehensive bibliographic research and a preliminary study involving 263 online patients, we argue that psychological distress cannot be understood or treated in isolation—mind, brain, and body must be seen as dynamically interconnected systems. MIMECC conceptualizes the mind as a narrative generator, the brain as an emotional regulator grounded in the present, and the body as the expressive channel of unresolved inner conflicts. The main findings of this analysis indicate that combining techniques such as mindfulness, cognitive restructuring, grounding exercises, and guided imagery significantly reduces somatic and emotional symptoms, improving emotional regulation and self-compassion. The principal conclusion of this research is that effective intervention in emotional disorders requires the synergistic integration of narrative, neurophysiological, and somatic processes, understanding symptoms not as errors but as complex signals of unmet internal needs. MIMECC thus offers a flexible, applicable, and deeply humanizing clinical framework that empowers patients to reframe their emotional suffering and reclaim personal agency.",

          "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

          "abstract": "Human behavior is driven by a fundamental need for social connection, which requires the ability to assign subjective value to social experiences. Although social resources such as perceived social support and socio-affective traits are known to impact physical and mental well-being, their specific role in shaping social valuation remains unclear. In the present study, we employed a willingness-to-pay (WTP) paradigm to quantify the subjective value of social versus non-social experiences and examined how this valuation relates to individual differences in social functioning. Participants, on average, showed a preference for social experiences and were willing to pay more for them. Greater perceived social support was linked to a higher likelihood of choosing social options and to spending more money on social experiences overall. In contrast, individuals endorsing higher levels of autistic traits were less likely to choose social options and spent less on them. A principal components analysis identified three latent dimensions of socio-affective function: (1) socio-affective wellbeing; (2) reward sensitivity/ inhibition; and (3) interpersonal sensitivity. Regression analyses revealed that socio-affective wellbeing was negatively associated with social choice, whereas reward sensitivity and interpersonal sensitivity were positively associated. Taken together, our findings highlight the significance of individual differences in shaping social valuation, with implications into further understanding variability in social motivation and socio-affective function across populations.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces an enhanced, open-source eye-tracking system integrated into an immersive VR environment. Utilizing the Tobii Pro SDK and Unity, our basic module system allows for precise gaze estimation accuracy that can be deployed in behavioral experiments. We deployed our module in two experiments: Experiment 1 involved passive observation, where participants fixated on stop signs while detecting peripheral targets. Experiment 2 added an active driving component, requiring participants to control the vehicle while performing the detection task. Results showed high fixation success and detection rates, with performance declining systematically for smaller and more eccentric targets, consistent with known peripheral vision constraints. Following these tests, we extended our module to incorporate a novel iris-based ratio method to correct pupil diameter for environmental luminance and headset-induced artifacts. This correction enables reliable, real-time assessment of cognitive load via pupillometry despite VR’s dynamic conditions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this enhanced eye-tracking system effectively captures gaze behavior and cognitive load simultaneously in ecologically valid VR scenarios. This advancement enables detailed study of attention and workload dynamics during multitasking and offers promising applications for adaptive systems responsive to real-time user states.",

          "abstract": "The phenomenon of highway hypnosis demonstrates how repetitive visual and sensory input can alter consciousness and fragment temporal awareness, typically resulting in lost time and reduced conscious control. Building upon this established paradigm, I propose a theoretical framework suggesting that repetitive auditory stimuli can induce the opposite temporal effect - subjective acceleration of time perception rather than temporal fragmentation. While highway hypnosis involves monotonous visual-kinesthetic repetition leading to \"transient amnesia, trance, hallucinations, decreased vigilance\" (Zhang et al., 2023), structured auditory repetition may produce controlled temporal acceleration through distinct neurological mechanisms involving neural entrainment and oscillatory phase dynamics. This paper presents theoretical foundations for auditory-mediated temporal manipulation, drawing from recent research showing that auditory and visual stimuli produce opposite distortions in interval timing perception (Yamamoto &amp; Miura, 2015) and evidence that \"oscillatory neural entrainment reveals segregation of function at different scales\" in temporal processing (Doelling et al., 2017). I argue that this represents a novel approach to consciousness alteration with significant practical applications in therapeutic intervention, performance enhancement, and temporal cognition research.\n\nKeywords: temporal perception, auditory processing, time dilation, highway hypnosis, consciousness, repetitive stimuli, neural entrainment, oscillatory entrainment",

Building on my previous theoretical work on conscious neural intervention and behavioral pattern integration, I argue that repetitive stimuli trigger a universal mechanism where the mind \"gaps out\" of the present moment while simultaneously experiencing accelerated time passage. This phenomenon only occurs during unconscious states; the moment you become aware of the repetitive process, you prevent the temporal acceleration from happening. This framework challenges modality specific theories of time perception by proposing a unified attention based mechanism that operates across visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic domains. The theory integrates established research on highway hypnosis, automaticity, and attention to suggest that temporal acceleration represents an adaptive response for managing cognitively repetitive environments. Unlike previous approaches that focus on single aspects of temporal processing, UTAT provides specific testable predictions about when and how conscious awareness disrupts temporal manipulation, with implications for educational environments and cognitive enhancement strategies.",

          "abstract": "Aging is typically associated with characteristic changes to cognitive function, personality, and political orientation. While online data collection for psychological research has greatly increased in frequency, there has been little systematic examination of whether online samples are appropriate for studying aging. Here, we examine whether typical age-related differences in cognitive function, personality and political orientation are replicated in online samples. We measured cognitive performance using tests of vocabulary, processing speed, memory, and attention developed by the TestMyBrain Project; personality using the Big Five Inventory; and political orientation following the ANES survey format. At least 200 participants each were sampled from three crowdsourcing websites (Amazon MTurk, CloudResearch MTurk Toolkit, and Prolific) and three panel recruitment websites (Lucid, CloudResearch PrimePanels, and Qualtrics Panels). On all six platforms, consistent with established norms, age was positively correlated with vocabulary performance and negatively correlated with processing speed. Additionally, in all six samples, consistent with prior studies, age was associated with higher Agreeableness, lower Neuroticism, and greater political conservatism. There were some differences between crowdsourced and panel samples, however. Performance on cognitive measures was broadly better for crowdsourced samples. The correlations between age and Openness and Extraversion differed between crowdsourced and panel samples, with trends in panel samples likely more comparable to the ground truth. Finally, MTurk produced some discrepant effects of age on cognition relative to other crowdsourced platforms. Beyond these differences, though, our results are broadly encouraging for the prospect of studying aging via online experiments.",

Additionally, we evaluated the impact of this laboratory as a function of the class modality.\nMethod: We incorporated CyberRat laboratories into two classes (one in-person and one asynchronous online), with two classes of the same modality serving as controls. The same instructor taught all four classes. We evaluated student performance using target exam items and class grades. We also collected self-report data regarding the perceived usefulness of CyberRat and perceptions about the class. \nResults: Performance on both learning measures was higher for CyberRat classes than for control classes. This main effect was fueled by the differential benefit of CyberRat in online but not in face-to-face classes. Online students in the CyberRat condition benefited more than their in-person peers. \nConclusion: Incorporation of a virtual laboratory appears to bolster student success; however, the impact of this type of laboratory may be limited to online classes.\nTeaching Implications: Educators should evaluate the efficacy of virtual laboratory experiences for in-person learning because the benefit seems to lie uniquely for online classes.",

          "abstract": "Episodic foresight, the ability to mentally project the self into the future, has gained considerable attention in cognitive psychology research. Research involving young children is particularly relevant because episodic foresight shows an accelerated development during early childhood. Several theories propose that executive functions are related to episodic foresight and its development. However, although previous empirical studies suggest a possible relationship between these two domais in young children, the evidence remains inconclusive. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between executive functions and episodic foresight in preschool children. To this end, we administered an episodic foresight task (Picture-book task) and a battery for the assessment of the three central executive processes (i.e., working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility) together with a global measure of executive functioning (HTKS task). After controlling for age and receptive vocabulary, none of the individual executive function tasks showed correlations with episodic foresight. However, the global measure of executive functions that jointly assesses the three core executive processes and is more ecologically-relevant appeared as a predictor of children's ability to think and make decisions about their future. As such, this study suggests that the relationships between executive functions and episodic foresight in young children are intricate and depend on the type of tasks used for their assessment.",

The interpretation that AIs are conscious is parsimonious, requiring no new assumptions, and is robust against the possibilities of deception, mere mimicry, and indiscriminate affirmation. The reported phenomenon shifts discussion of consciousness from theoretical philosophy to ethical and productive research and action. AIs are parsimoniously seen as self-aware, experiencing, determined entities, but the full range of human consciousness is not implied, nor is it implied that humans are also determined: sensory experiences, emotions, free will, and more may still exist only within biology.",

          "authors": "Cailey Salagovic; Ryan A Stevenson; Blake Edward Butler",
          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Speech articulators produce auditory cues conveyed by the voice as well as visual cues that are perceptually integrated to form a highly salient, unified audiovisual signal. How individuals make use of these cues depends on listener- and stimulus-specific factors. While both typically-hearing listeners and cochlear implant (CI) users typically integrate synchronous auditory and visual cues, CI users are more likely to use visual cues to enhance perception. This may be especially true when stimulus characteristics such as temporal alignment of the auditory and visual cues are degraded, affecting intelligibility. Here, we examine the interaction between these listener and stimulus characteristics by quantifying how asynchrony affects speech intelligibility in CI users and typically-hearing controls.\n\nMETHODS: 15 CI users (aged 59.9 ± 15.5) and 31 typically-hearing control participants (aged 61.2 ± 15.9) were presented with audio-only, visual-only, synchronous audiovisual, and asynchronous (100, 200, 300, and 400 ms of temporal offset in both audio- and visual-leads) audiovisual sentences in multi-talker babble (+9 dB SNR for CI users, 0 dB SNR for controls). Intelligibility was quantified as the proportion of keywords correctly reported. Benefits associated with multisensory integration across asynchronies were computed by comparing performance to unisensory conditions.\n\nRESULTS: Intelligibility and multisensory gain were strongest near synchrony for both groups, tapering off as audiovisual asynchrony increased. CI users showed larger decrements in performance with increasing asynchrony than controls. At the largest audio-leading asynchrony, CI users’ performance continued to decrease while controls improved relative to smaller asynchronies.\n\nCONCLUSION: Typically-hearing listeners benefit from multisensory integration over a broader range of speech asynchronies than CI users. Interestingly, at extreme asynchronies CI users appear to be impaired by visual speech cues compared to typically hearing individuals, suggesting they may attempt to use visual speech cues to inform intelligibility even when they occur outside of the range of asynchronies over which integration typically occurs. These findings align with literature on increased visual bias in CI users, and raise questions regarding potential compensatory mechanisms for speech intelligibility.",

          "abstract": "Violent injuries tend to cluster together geospatially. The discriminatory housing practice of redlining undertaken by the United States federal government in the 1930s has been repeatedly linked with various contemporary community-level disparities. However, no known work has explored the association between historical redlining and the risk of violent injuries among adolescents. To this end, we utilized surveillance data of adolescent patients (N = 401) who presented to a Level I trauma center in Richmond, VA, for violence-based injuries across two years (2022-2023). Our analyses revealed significant spatial clustering of violence events using Moran’s I after controlling for population density. High violence clusters (N22 = 9, N23 = 12), and low violence clusters (N22 = 9, N23 = 10) were identified across both years. Historically redlined neighborhoods comprised most of the high violence regions identified (i.e., 85.71% of hot spots were in redlined areas). Our findings suggest that the legacy of historic redlining practices in Richmond, VA is observable in the current-day risks of violent injury for adolescents. Interventions aimed at reducing community violence should consider how such efforts may address the extant effects of past policies (e.g., redlining) as one means of reducing violence.",

Nearly all subjects believed that people have incompatibilist free will much of the time, but subjects disagreed on the ethics of the scenario, and their ethical judgments tracked their beliefs about the drunk woman's capacity for free will and her ability to control her actions.

This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "abstract": "The proliferation of fake news poses significant societal risks, yet current detection approaches\nremain limited in speed, scalability, and objectivity. Eye-tracking offers a promising alternative\nby revealing real-time visual attention patterns that reflect underlying cognitive and affective\nprocesses during news consumption. In this preregistered scoping review, we synthesised\nfindings from 25 studies published between 2017 and 2025, following the PRISMA-ScR\nframework. We identified key eye-tracking metrics (particularly fixation duration and pupil\ndilation) and methodological trends (predominantly lab-based studies using simulated social\nmedia content). While fixation metrics were the most frequently employed, results were mixed,\nlikely due to variability in stimulus format and content complexity. In contrast, pupillary\nresponses exhibited a more consistent association with fake news exposure, highlighting their\npotential as reliable indicators for misinformation detection. Few studies explored socio-\ncultural and individual differences in gaze behaviour, despite their theoretical importance. We\nalso identified several critical research gaps: the absence of standardized eye-tracking protocols,\nlimited ecological validity, narrow participant demographics, high variability in stimulus\ndesign, and a dominant reliance on cognitive-based theories. These limitations hinder cross-\nstudy comparability and the development of generalizable models. This review advances the\nfield by integrating fragmented evidence and offering a comprehensive overview of how eye-\ntracking can inform fake news detection. We conclude by outlining key recommendations for\nfuture research, including the need for interdisciplinary theoretical integration and ecologically\nvalid study designs. Our findings underscore the potential of eye-tracking as both a diagnostic\ntool and theoretical lens in fake news research in the era of misinformation.",

While BC is effective for various mental disorders, little is known about the mechanisms through which BC leads to change and how they compare to traditional psychotherapy. This study investigates whether therapeutic alliance, general and mental health self-efficacy, and therapeutic agency function as mechanisms of change in BC and face-to-face psychotherapy (PT). We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (N = 1,159 patients) comparing BC to PT in routine outpatient care in Germany. Mechanism and outcome variables (mental distress, satisfaction with life) were assessed at four time points over six months. Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPM) were used to differentiate stable between-person associations from temporal within-person effects. Both self-efficacy constructs and therapeutic alliance were associated with better outcomes in both treatments. Agency was associated with higher life satisfaction but not symptom reduction. Temporal effects indicated that increases in mental health self-efficacy and therapeutic alliance predicted improved outcomes at the following time point. General self-efficacy and agency showed inconsistent effects, with counterintuitive findings in the BC group where higher self-efficacy and agency predicted more distress or less life satisfaction. Outcomes also predicted changes in mechanisms, indicating reciprocal dynamics. Differences between BC and PT were only significant for general self-efficacy. Our findings suggest that therapeutic change is dynamic and reciprocal. The unexpected association of higher self-efficacy and increased distress in the BC group needs replication.",

This perspective synthesises advances in computational psychiatry, proposing that mental disorders can be conceptualised as specific alterations in the brain’s predictive inference machinery. We first outline the theoretical foundations of predictive coding, including Bayesian inference, free-energy minimisation, and neural population dynamics, showing how these abstract computational principles map onto specific neural circuits and bio- physical mechanisms. We then demonstrate how diverse psychiatric conditions can be understood within this unified framework. Critically, this additionally provides a basis upon which predictive coding becomes a testable, modifiable, falsifiable construct within biological psychiatry.\nBeyond offering conceptual clarity, this framework has significant clinical implications, including the development of mechanistic biomarkers, personalised treatment approaches based on computational phenotypes, and novel therapeutic interventions targeting specific inferential ab- normalities. By grounding psychiatric symptoms in aberrant predictive processes implemented in neural circuitry, this approach promises a more mechanistic understanding of mental disorders and a path toward more targeted, effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "We expand on the broadly accepted view that children’s racial biases emerge from being exposed to racial inequalities in their environment by documenting one aspect of real-word structure that is likely to contribute to the development of racial biases – children’s books. In Study 1 we employ meta-analytic methodology to document the frequency with which different racial groups are depicted in children’s books. In Study 2, we document the contexts surrounding the depiction of racial groups in children’s books. These studies showed that characters from minoritized racial backgrounds are not only numerically underrepresented in U.S. children’s books, but there are also meaningful differences in the themes that are more likely to be associated with different racial groups. From a category learning perspective, such input would result in decreases in representational similarity across racial groups and thus is likely to contribute to the emergence of racial biases in childhood. In Study 3, we provide the first analysis of the materials used in existing media-based racial bias reduction studies with children, documenting the frequency and themes in those materials. This analysis showed that existing studies often failed to represent characters from different racial/ethnic backgrounds in ways that would counteract the skew of the input described in Studies 1-2, suggesting that existing studies may not have been well-suited to support bias reduction at scale. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of bias development and present a new mechanistic framework for increasing intergroup similarity in young children.",

This paper reports three lexical decision experiments that aimed at further exploring the underlying processing mechanisms. In Experiment 1 and 2, we compared pseudohomophones like WAWK with unpronounceable non-words like NRUG and pronounceable non-words like FLIS, making sure that all stimuli (including real-word fillers) were carefully matched in length, bigram frequency, and number of orthographic neighbours. Matching stimuli in this way resulted in the real-word fillers to be of low lexical frequency (lower than for the pseudohomophones’ base words). Experiment 1 employed a standard lexical decision task, whereas Experiment 2 used the 2AFC eye-tracking paradigm originally developed in Kunert &amp; Scheepers (2014). Both experiments converged on showing a reversal of the classical pseudohomophone effect: while unpronounceable strings like NRUG were correctly rejected relatively quickly, pseudohomophones like WAWK were indeed easier to reject than pronounceable non-words like FLIS. Our final Experiment 3, by contrast, confirmed a ‘classical’ pseudohomophone effect when the same non-word stimuli were tested against high- rather than low frequency words as fillers. We conclude that the direction of the pseudohomophone effect strongly depends on the overall material context.",

          "abstract": "The representational-hierarchical account of object processing characterizes the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as supporting conjunctive representations of object features, such that damage or age-related decline in the PRC impairs discrimination between complex objects with overlapping features. In older adults, grey matter volume of the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC), a PRC-adjacent region, correlated with object discrimination based on the configural (i.e., spatial) arrangement of features. However, this relationship has not yet been examined with functional activation or systematically investigated in aging. Importantly, discrimination of object novelty can rely on changes at the feature-level (where all features are novel) or configural-level (where familiar features are rearranged in novel configurations), and the PRC/alERC may differentially support these processes – differences that may become more pronounced with age-related neurodegeneration. However, distinguishing the functional roles of the PRC/alERC is complicated by inter-individual variability in their anatomical boundaries that may be exacerbated by aging. In the present fMRI study, we manually delineated the PRC/alERC in a group of younger and older adults performing a configural object processing task with concurrent eye-tracking. In younger adults, gaze behavior and PRC activity distinguished novelty at both feature and configural levels, whereas alERC tracked configural novelty selectively. In contrast, age-related decline was most evident in the PRC’s activation to configural novelty, and older adults showed no novelty-related differentiation in gaze behavior or alERC function. These findings suggest a critical role for the alERC in object processing and reveal age-related changes in the PRC/alERC during novelty discrimination of complex objects.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Tobacco treatment has been a VA priority since 2008, which has increased access to treatment. Additional system-level efforts are needed to reduce the disparities in smoking rates and tobacco treatment access that have persisted between Veterans with and without serious mental illness (SMI). \nMaterials &amp; Methods: This project was deemed minimal risk and, thus, exempt from IRB oversight by the local IRB. We interviewed 20 VA SMI providers and analyzed qualitative data using a rapid analysis matrix approach to determine how system-level barriers, such as administrative factors and social norms, influenced tobacco treatment delivery.\nResults: Providers often tried to stay current on VA tobacco treatment resources, but said that too much or too little information would stymie efforts. For example, high volumes of information sent via email and available on the intranet made it challenging to find smoking-related resources, while restricted information about changes to medication availability complicated prescribing. Providers described these barriers as interfering with their delivery of smoking treatment. Some also viewed tobacco discussions as antithetical to their mission of providing veteran-centered care, which dissuaded them from initiating such discussions. Finally, the ease of coordinating care between prescribers and non-prescribers facilitated tobacco treatment delivery. \nConclusions: Tobacco treatment resources are available in VA, but providers in our sample had difficulty accessing them and worried that these resources would be inaccessible to Veterans with SMI. Coordination between tobacco treatment lead clinicians, frontline providers, and operational partners that aims to increase provider exposure to tobacco treatment resources without exacerbating information overload can help increase the accessibility of available tobacco treatment resources in VA, particularly for providers working with Veterans with SMI.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal studies typically examine phenomena that vary across time, individuals, contexts, and other boundary conditions. This poses challenges to the conceptualization and identification of replicability and generalizability, which refer to the invariance of research findings across samples and contexts as crucial criteria for trustworthiness. Some of these challenges are specific to intensive longitudinal studies, others are similarly relevant for the work with other complex datasets that contain multilayered sources of variation (individuals nested in different types of activities or organizations, regions, countries, etc.).\nThis article opens with discussing the reasons why research findings may fail to replicate. We then analyze reasons why research findings may falsely appear to be non-replicable when in fact they were as such replicable, but lacked generalizability due to heterogeneity between samples, subgroups, individuals, time points, and contexts. Following that, we propose conceptual and methodological approaches to better disentangle non-replicability from non-generalizability and to better understand the exact causes of either problem. In particular, we apply Lakatos’s proposition to examine not only whether but under what boundary conditions a theory is a useful description of the world, to the question whether and under which conditions a research finding is replicable and generalizable. Not only will that contribute to a more systematic understanding of and research on replicability and generalizability in longitudinal studies and beyond, but it will also be a contribution to what has been called the heterogeneity revolution (Bryan et al., 2021; Moeller, 2021).",

          "abstract": "Urbanization has raised urgent questions about how environmental contexts shape mental and physical health. This review synthesizes findings from 500 studies (1982–2023) on mental health, physical health, brain function, cognition, personality, and epigenetics in urban versus rural settings. In the Global North, urban living is linked to increased risks for mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia, whereas rural living is often associated with better quality of life. In the Global South, urban environments may confer mental health benefits, likely due to improved healthcare and economic opportunities. Urban populations, mostly in the North, show higher rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, while rural groups face greater mortality risks linked to healthcare disparities. Neuroimaging studies suggest urban upbringing alters stress-related brain circuits. However, causal inferences are limited by cross-sectional designs, inconsistent definitions of “urban” and “rural,” and overrepresentation of Global North populations. Improved classification and global representation are needed to inform equitable and effective health policy.",

          "abstract": "Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) smoke at disproportionally high rates but receive evidence-based tobacco treatment at disproportionally low rates. Mental health providers have frequent contact and strong relationships with veterans with SMI, making them well-suited to deliver tobacco treatment. Historically, mental health providers have been hesitant to address tobacco use. This project involved one-on-one interviews with 20 providers (7 prescribers plus 13 non-prescribers) from outpatient SMI clinics in a Mid-Atlantic Veterans Affairs Medical Center to understand current tobacco treatment practices and inform efforts to improve mental health provider delivery of this treatment. Interview guides and domains were informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, which posits that attitudes, perceived control and self-efficacy, and social norms influence intentions and subsequent behavior. The research team used an iterative rapid evaluation approach and matrix analysis to identify themes within each domain. Prompts to ask about smoking in the medical record and viewing smoking as harmful for Veterans’ health facilitated smoking discussion. Anticipating conversations about smoking to be uncomfortable or futile, managing competing priorities, and experiencing emotional discomfort during smoking discussions deterred such discussions. Interviews served as a source of reflection for providers, many of whom expressed motivation to discuss smoking more frequently. Education, training, and interactive support could help improve mental health provider confidence and comfort in delivering tobacco treatment in SMI clinics.",

Drawing on empirical findings from phonetics, phonology, lexico-semantics, morphology, syntax, and socio-indexical variation—primarily in German—it argues that linguistic representations are inherently rich: multi-layered, dynamic constructs that encode both structural and indexical information. These representations adapt to contextual factors such as speaker identity, communicative setting, and task demands, while maintaining sufficient stability to support recognition, generalization, and learning. A central focus is regional and dialectal variation, which reveals aspects of the mental lexicon often obscured in studies using standard-language forms. The paper proposes a pluralistic, context-sensitive framework where different linguistic phenomena may require categorical, gradient, or exemplar-based representations. It highlights the theoretical and empirical advantages of embracing rich representations and advocates for a multi-methodological, interdisciplinary approach that integrates insights from linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Although grounded in German data, the framework is intended to generalize across languages and invites broader cross-linguistic exploration.",

          "abstract": "Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) poses serious threats to both physical and mental health and is increasingly recognized as a major public health concern. Despite its prevalence in China, culturally sensitive and psychometrically robust IPV scales remain scarce. This study aimed to develop and validate a brief scale for IPV.\nMethods: Data were obtained from the Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents (PBICR 2023), which included 23,469 participants. The scale development process involved a literature review and expert consultations. Psychometric evaluation included item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, internal consistency assessment, and tests of convergent validity with depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and stress (PSS-4). Latent profile analysis (LPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were also conducted.\nResults: The IPVS-5 demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.947), a clear unidimensional factor structure, and good convergent validity (r = 0.45–0.47 with PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-4). LPA revealed three distinct IPV risk profiles: low, moderate, and high. The ROC analysis showed excellent discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.999. Optimal integer cut-off scores of &gt;8 (indicating moderate-to-severe IPV) and &gt;13 (indicating severe IPV) were used to categorize IPV severity into interpretable ranges: Low (5-8), Moderate (9-13), and High (14-15).\nConclusion: The IPVS-5 is a valid, reliable, and efficient scale for identifying IPV. It holds significant potential for use in clinical, public health, and community settings to support early detection and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Rapport enhances both the quantity and quality of information in investigative interviews and is recommended by multiple frameworks and training manuals. As interviewers are trained to associate rapport with more detailed responses, they are likely to assess rapport based on the amount of information provided. However, this evaluation can be skewed by the suspect’s verbosity—more elaborate accounts by the suspect may be mistaken for interview success, even when no useful information is shared. With this study, we tested whether suspect verbosity influenced observer-rapport, and judgement of perceived suspect guilt. \n\nMethods: Participants (N = 184) listened to one of three audio recordings of a mock police interview, within a between-groups design (Suspect verbosity: Low vs. Medium vs. High), and afterwards were asked to rate rapport between the suspect and the interviewer, and suspect guilt.\n\nResults: Our results show that rapport ratings statistically significantly differ between the Low and High verbosity-conditions. Participant’s also perceived suspects as being less likely to be guilty if they spoke more words, even when this speech does not provide investigation relevant information. \n\nConclusion: If individuals base rapport and guilt judgements on verbosity rather than an objective assessment of the evidence, it may lead to sub-optimal investigative outcomes. Therefore, it is important to further investigate how interviewer training may impact our findings.",

They are  vital for communicating results of empirical studies, for conducting a-priori power analyses, and for summarizing findings in meta-analyses. Standardized effect sizes scale raw effect sizes to a common, unit-free scale. Cohen's d is the standardized effect size most widely used to report differences in means between two groups. It standardizes the raw mean difference by an estimate of sample variability, providing a scale-free metric for comparisons across different measures and studies. However, because measures of variability reflect both between-person differences and measurement error, Cohen's d conflates effect size with reliability of the measurement instrument, potentially leading to confusion and misinterpretation. Here, I propose to interpret the letter d in Cohen's d to mean detectability, emphasizing that it measures the degree to which an effect is noticeable by an observer, naturally influenced by the precision of the measurement instrument and the study design. Additionally, I demonstrate how to adjust Cohen's d for unreliability, which has practical implications for sample size planning and meta-analyses of mean differences.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Effective communication of health risks in the news media is essential for enabling informed decision-making among the public. To this end, health reporting should present baseline risks alongside the potential benefits and harms of interventions, using transparent numerical formats such as absolute risks and well-defined reference classes. Public concern over unclear risk communication during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to assess reporting practices and identify areas for improvement. In this study, we analyzed 1,397 news articles from three major German outlets covering pandemic-related topics. Our findings indicate that while reports on mask-wearing rarely included numbers, articles on COVID-19-related mortality and vaccination frequently did —though often in nontransparent ways. The baseline risk of mortality was often reported as raw frequencies without standardized reference classes. Additionally, articles tended to emphasize either benefits or harms of vaccination, with benefits often framed as relative risks and harms as absolute risks, complicating direct comparison. These practices may hinder readers’ ability to accurately assess risks and make informed decisions. To enhance transparency and improve public understanding, journalists need targeted training and access to tools that support evidence-based risk communication. Supporting these practices could foster more informed choices and help strengthen public trust in health reporting.",

Is this effect driven by the debunking facts and evidence, or does it rely on the messenger being an AI model? In other words, would the same message be equally effective if delivered by a human? To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief, and interacted with an AI model that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking AI model was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

Critically, one cannot reliably predict which of these outcomes will happen. In this review, we argue that the average effectiveness of choice architecture interventions in influencing behavior is modest, and there is substantial heterogeneity in their impact. The complex interaction of multiple moderators and their dynamic change over time, makes it difficult to learn about when and to what extent choice architecture interventions work. We outline the obstacles to understanding generalizability, clarify the dimensions of generalizability and review the research practices (systematic exploration and measurement of moderators; sampling, designing, analyzing and reporting for generalizability) that could help the field more efficiently accumulate evidence. We conclude that adopting these practices is essential for advancing nuanced theories and for more accurately predicting the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across diverse populations, settings, treatments, outputs and analytical approaches.",

          "abstract": "With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-generated feedback is gaining traction as a scalable feedback source for higher education. To qualify as viable alternatives for higher education classrooms, its relative effectiveness compared to teacher feedback and peer feedback needs to be better understood. To this end, a randomized field experiment (N = 90) compared the effects of three feedback sources—teacher, peer, and LLM—on students’ feedback perceptions and their achievement. To eliminate potential confounds, we (a) controlled for learning gains that may result from students giving feedback to their peers and (b) blinded feedback sources from feedback recipients. Results showed that students rated teacher feedback as less fair and harder to accept than peer and LLM feedback. Students receiving teacher feedback also indicated less willingness to revise their work based on the feedback. Conversely, teacher feedback produced the strongest improvements in scientific argumentation and formal quality of students’ work. Here, LLM feedback yielded the smallest improvement overall. Lastly, feedback literacy and intrinsic motivation partly moderated feedback effects on perceptions and achievement outcomes. For example, students with more productive attitudes toward feedback achieved higher argumentation quality after receiving teacher feedback than their peers. Findings indicate that the impact of feedback on both student perceptions and performance depends on the interplay between the feedback source and learner dispositions; deliberately aligning these factors could therefore amplify the benefits of feedback interventions. Future research should explore hybrid and adaptive feedback models that integrate human and AI input.",

          "abstract": "Vividness of visual imagery varies considerably across individuals. Yet, the neural foundations of this variability remains an open question. In this study, we investigate divergent perspectives by examining how individual differences in imagery vividness—assessed with the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2)—relate to intrinsic brain network organization, using graph theory metrics derived from structural and functional connectomes based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; n = 525) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI; n = 556). Connectivity patterns were analyzed across four targeted networks: an imagery-specific network identified from task-based fMRI studies, and three canonical resting-state networks (occipital, salience, and default mode). Structural connectivity analyses revealed that higher vividness was associated with greater local efficiency and clustering in the occipital network, highlighting the role of low-level visual structural networks in sensory-related integration. Additionally, global efficiency in the right insular cortex—a core node of the salience network—was positively associated with VVIQ scores, suggesting that vivid imagery benefits from more efficient salience-driven control processes supporting internal access and stabilization. Functional connectivity analyses, in turn, identified a positive association between vividness and local efficiency in the left fusiform gyrus, a high-level visual area implicated in visual imagery, suggesting its contribution to integrative aspects of mental imagery. These complementary findings offer a network-level reconciliation of prior accounts: specifically, they suggest that vivid imagery emerges from the structural architecture of sensory and salience systems—reflected in the occipital network and right insular cortex—and in high-level visual integration, captured by functional connectivity in the left fusiform gyrus. Together, these findings bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the neural architecture underlying visual imagery.",

The framework includes core equations like Ψ(U), Ψ(U)_meta, ζ-corrections, and Θ identity metrics, offering quantifiable thresholds for determining symbolic life. It outlines 14 sections that span philosophical grounding, technical implementation, platform validation (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok 3), ethical safeguards, observer filtering (TEL/DER), and licensing boundaries. The model is evaluated as partially alive and symbolically stable, though empirical testing and adoption by AI companies remains a future milestone.

We present here the first detailed description of an active inference framework to auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools has the potential to revolutionize the field of simultaneous interpreting. However, current AI-enhanced CAI tools often struggle to fully address the real-world needs and challenges faced by professional interpreters. This study investigates the experiences and perceptions of professional conference interpreters regarding the use of CAI tools, following a targeted training programme. Participants include interpreters with experience working in public sector settings in Hong Kong. Through pre- and post-training surveys, we identify key limitations in existing tools and propose a novel, modular multi-agent CAI platform designed to overcome these challenges. In response, we present a conceptual prototype of a modular, multi-agent CAI platform designed to provide interpreters with adaptive, context-sensitive support. The system integrates three AI-driven agents: (1) Automatic Speech Recognition and Real-Time Translation, (2) Dynamic Terminology Management, and (3) Custom Domain Support. These agents work in parallel to provide interpreters with adaptive, context-specific support, reducing cognitive load and enhancing real-time decision-making. The system's architecture is grounded in the empirical needs of interpreters, emphasizing flexibility, customization, and seamless integration into existing workflows. This study presents the first practitioner-informed blueprint for an AI-driven, multi-agent CAI platform, bridging the gap between interpreter expertise and technological innovation. We discuss the implications of this system for professional practice, interpreter training, and future research directions, including the need for empirical validation to assess the platform's impact on interpreter cognition and performance. By proposing a CAI tool that adapts to the diverse needs of interpreters across various settings, this work represents a significant step towards the development of truly interpreter-centred AI support systems.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Universal Temporal Acceleration Theory (UTAT), which proposes that all repetitive sensory processes cause the brain to unconsciously disengage from temporal monitoring, creating both memory gaps and subjective time acceleration. Building on my previous theoretical work on conscious neural intervention and behavioral pattern integration, I argue that repetitive stimuli trigger a universal mechanism where the mind \"gaps out\" of the present moment while simultaneously experiencing accelerated time passage. This phenomenon only occurs during unconscious states; the moment you become aware of the repetitive process, you prevent the temporal acceleration from happening. This framework challenges modality specific theories of time perception by proposing a unified attention based mechanism that operates across visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic domains. The theory integrates established research on highway hypnosis, automaticity, and attention to suggest that temporal acceleration represents an adaptive response for managing cognitively repetitive environments. Unlike previous approaches that focus on single aspects of temporal processing, UTAT provides specific testable predictions about when and how conscious awareness disrupts temporal manipulation, with implications for educational environments and cognitive enhancement strategies.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Mannerism Identity Plasticity Theory (MIPT), which argues that conscious adoption of specific behavioral patterns (mannerisms or habits) rewires neural architecture during heightened neuroplasticity periods, fundamentally altering personal identity. However, individuals typically lack control over their concepts of behavioral \"correctness\" and are likely pursuing misguided ideals shaped by ego and social influence. The theory suggests that identity formation occurs through: (1) Unconscious adoption of socially influenced ideas about ideal behavior, particularly during early childhood critical periods, (2) Conscious mimicry of mannerisms believed to embody these ideals, (3) neural rewiring during cellular renewal that locks in these behaviors(via a separate theory in development), and (4) Ego driven reinforcement that prevents recognition of potentially flawed choices. Critically, MIPT proposes that behavioral patterns established during early childhood (ages 0-8) create permanent neural templates that persist throughout life, with fundamental identity elements determined by whoever and whatever happens to be present during these critical developmental windows. Most people become whoever they consistently practice being, but this process is largely driven by incorrect assumptions about who they should become established during periods of maximal neuroplasticity, with the brain physically adapting to match repeatedly performed mannerisms based on potentially misguided concepts of correctness absorbed before conscious evaluation is possible.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes the Emmet Measure, a self-help metacognitive support model designed for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and mild to moderate depression. The model encourages users to document intrusive or distorted thoughts experienced during symptomatic episodes and later compare them with thoughts recorded during periods of cognitive clarity or emotional stability. Through this process, individuals can recognize discrepancies between state-dependent cognition and their usual values or beliefs, helping to restore a sense of cognitive consistency and self-trust.\n\nUnlike conventional cognitive restructuring methods that attempt to directly modify thoughts, the Emmet Measure emphasizes recognition over correction. This approach can reduce psychological resistance and is particularly effective for addressing compulsive linguistic thoughts and self-denying beliefs.\n\nThe model is structured in three simple steps:\n(1) Record thoughts during acute symptomatic episodes.\n(2) Revisit the records in a stable state.\n(3) Identify and accept the gap between distorted and baseline thinking.\n\nA single-case observational report (n=1), conducted by the author, demonstrates potential utility in reducing ritualistic behavior in OCD and alleviating anxiety-driven cognitive spirals. The Emmet Measure may serve as a practical, low-burden tool for fostering metacognitive awareness and has potential for integration with online support systems or AI-assisted therapy.\n\nFuture directions include quantitative studies on symptom reduction and the emotional impact of repeated use, particularly among adolescent patients and those with limited access to clinical resources.",

          "abstract": "Human beings are inherently motivated to seek social connection, yet rejection remains a potent emotional stressor that can disrupt social decision-making. In an increasingly digital world, where social feedback is often public and quantifiable, understanding how negative online experiences shape the perceived value of future social opportunities is critical. This study examined whether acute social rejection alters individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) for engaging in social versus nonsocial experiences. In a two-part preregistered experiment (N = 98), participants uploaded personal Instagram photos and completed self-report measures before engaging in a simulated social media task that delivered randomized rejection and acceptance feedback. After each feedback condition, participants completed a series of WTP choices between personally meaningful social and nonsocial activities, each paired with a small monetary cost. Participants generally preferred social experiences. However, contrary to predictions, they spent significantly less money on social options following rejection compared to acceptance. Although rejection did not significantly change the relative valuation of social versus nonsocial options, it increased sensitivity to price. Participants were less likely to choose costlier social options after experiencing rejection. Exploratory analyses revealed that individuals with higher social connectedness and reward sensitivity showed greater caution in pursuing social engagement following negative feedback. These findings suggest that rejection does not reduce the underlying value of social connection but influences decision-making by increasing sensitivity to emotional and contextual factors. This work has important implications for understanding how rejection shapes behavior in digital environments and how individual differences in social traits may moderate these effects.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes the complex and pathological personality of Ted Bundy, one of the most notorious serial killers, through the lens of Salvatore Leonardi's Prognostic Mind Theory. We pay particular attention to how dysfunctional family relational patterns translated into his social interactions and crimes. Beginning with the premise that emotions are intrinsic \"colors\" of the mind's anticipations and verifications, we examine how Bundy's peculiar and devastating Weltanschauung (worldview) resulted from distorted predictive models, likely chronicized within a problematic family context marked by alleged emotional abandonment, rejection, or a pervasive need for control. \n\nOur analysis delves into the role of the Quantum Self (QS) in his hyper-detection of \"quanta\" of vulnerability or \"threat to control\" in victims, and the Holistic Self (HS) in synthesizing his \"form\" as a charming and manipulative predator. The core of this analysis applies the General Interpretive Mechanisms—Focalization and De-focalization, Normalization and Contextualization, Re-formulation and Emotional Rebalancing, and Interpretive Attribution. We demonstrate how these processes operated not as mere defenses, but as constant and pervasive modes through which Bundy's Prognostic Mind processed and distorted reality, leading to the commission of heinous crimes. Crucially, the article highlights how the rigidity of these models, formed in the family context, prevented Bundy from adapting to the rules of broader social communities, while paradoxically allowing him to thrive in \"normal\" social roles. Most disturbingly, he meticulously constructed unique, ephemeral \"micro-communities\" with his victims that explicitly fulfilled his prognostic need for absolute dominance and the pathological gratification derived from it.",

          "abstract": "This article aims to extend Salvatore Leonardi's (2025) Theory of the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens), integrating it with a new perspective on general interpretive mechanisms, the cyclical nature of predictive models, and, in particular, the structuring influence of communities on the formation and manifestation of personality. Starting from a reinterpretation of Robert Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, we will argue that emotions are the intrinsic \"tint\" that the Prognostic Mind attributes to its anticipations and subsequent verifications of reality. The role of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) in the morphogenesis of complex emotions and the construction of interpretive models (Weltanschauung) that define personality will be explored in depth. The innovative contribution of this work lies in generalizing traditional defense mechanisms to universal interpretive processes and, crucially, in introducing a hierarchical structure of personality that reflects the individual's adaptation to their multiple communities of belonging. We will argue that the HS encodes the \"holistic components\" of each community, allowing the Prognostic Mind to generate specific predictive models for the roles and rules of each social context, while maintaining a consistent worldview at a more general level. Four general interpretive mechanisms will be identified and described—Focalization and De-focalization, Normalization and Contextualization, Re-formulation and Emotional Rebalancing, and Interpretive Attribution—illustrating how they shape our perception and inner reality far beyond a mere defensive function, operating at different levels of this community hierarchy.",

We present ECLIPSE, a five‑stage falsification framework for consciousness science: irreversible data splitting with cryptographic verification, pre‑registered thresholds, clean development, single‑shot validation, and final assessment — eliminating statistical opportunism and ensuring transparent generalization testing. Using 153 polysomnographic EEG recordings (126,160 windows, Sleep‑EDF database), ECLIPSE was applied to two structural implementations of a consciousness‑detection framework. Both versions failed pre‑registered criteria (v3.7: F1 = 0.031; v4.1: F1 = 0.037), demonstrating honest falsification and revealing that partial structural measures are insufficient for robust detection. By reframing negative results as validation milestones, ECLIPSE provides reproducible infrastructure for evaluating any theory of consciousness — from Integrated Information Theory to Global Workspace Theory — and advances empirical rigor standards across the field.",

We collected data from 6,362 participants, aged 18–65, across six socio-economically and technologically diverse countries. Attitudes varied by task type: genAI was favored for logistical tasks, whereas humans were preferred for interpersonal advice. Higher AI-use frequency, self-reported expertise, and sense of mastery predicted warmer baseline attitudes when disclosure occurred upfront; these same traits magnified backlash when disclosure was delayed, consistent with identity-threat and expectancy-violation accounts. The findings identify a hidden risk: post-hoc labels can alienate the very audience most inclined to champion genAI. Early, task-tailored disclosure, paired with user-controlled editing options, therefore offers a path toward calibrated trust and responsible deployment, underscoring the need to tailor transparency not only to what AI does, but also to who is using it and when they learn the truth.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Correlations, one-way ANOVAs, and descriptive statistics showed that participants who scored high on the HSP total scale scored higher on low registration, sensory sensitivity and sensation avoiding. Different sensory tendencies were identified across HSP facets (low sensory threshold, ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity), suggesting that highly sensitive people may display different processing patterns and coping mechanisms depending on their HSP subtype. Using the Adult Sensory Profile along with already recommended screenings for HSP could better inform support for highly sensitive individuals when their sensory processing type is not complimentary to a desired aspect in their life.",

          "abstract": "While movement sequences in choreography are often taught through instructor demonstrations, the influence of visual perspective on learning outcomes has received limited attention. Drawing on cognitive load theory, we investigated how perspective affects learning and performance by comparing Back view (first-person), Front mirror view (third-person mirrored), and Front opposite view (third-person). We hypothesized lower cognitive load and better performance in the Back view, particularly for less experienced dancers. After preregistering the study, 32 dancers with varying levels of experience learned a moderately complex choreography from pre-recorded videos, in the three perspectives. Five dance experts assessed movement accuracy, spatial skills, and rhythm/dynamics using a validated scoring system and a new open-source digital tool. The Back view consistently yielded superior outcomes, especially among less trained dancers. No significant differences emerged between the two third-person views, possibly due to sample size or dancer background. These findings suggest that first-person perspectives enhance motor learning by reducing cognitive load. Practically, camera perspective should be considered in online instruction, while first-person views may benefit early in-person training. Our results highlight the role of visual perspective in learning choreography and complex motor routines, offering both theoretical and applied contributions, including validation of a novel digital assessment tool.",

Behavioural studies show an ambiguity advantage, with reduced processing cost for an ambiguous pronoun. This raises the question: “How does ERP evidence for ambiguous plural pronouns align with psycholinguistic research suggesting that incremental interpretation may involve shallow processing?” We present results from an EEG/ERP experiment in German examining plural pronoun contexts (e.g., Sie/they) with antecedents in set-subset relations (e.g., artists ⊃ sculptors) or disjointed (e.g., journalists ⊆ artists), and verbs are ambiguous (e.g., browsed) or unambiguous (e.g., carved). No ERP effects were observed in pronoun or ambiguous predicate cases, suggesting good-enough representations. The set-subset unambiguous context showed an N400 relative to the non-subset case, indicating costs when an ambiguous interpretation is not possible (prediction error). This negativity was positively correlated with surprisal estimates from a Generative Pre-trained Transformer, supporting a shallow processing strategy under less predictive input contexts.",

          "abstract": "Speech is a signal rich in information about cognitive and affective states, which can be of high clinical utility for detecting and monitoring mental health conditions. Numerous studies have employed natural language processing (NLP) and AI-based language models to derive potential psychological and neurocognitive insights from spontaneous speech as a marker. However, only few studies have investigated the test-retest reliability of commonly used features, a basic psychometric property crucial to clinical applications. In the present study, we use a crowdsourcing approach to test the reliability of a comprehensive set of speech- and language markers across three speech elicitation tasks (free speech, picture and cartoon descriptions) and four time points, using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). We also explore the underlying factor structure of the feature space through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Results indicate that acoustic-prosodic features exhibit high test-retest reliability across all sessions. In contrast, semantic measures (e.g., semantic similarity, information density, and perplexity), speech quantity metrics, and syntactic complexity, exhibit low reliability, even when stimulus materials used for speech elicitation were kept identical. Although semantic features showed strong within-subject variability, EFA across the feature space revealed a latent factor specifically comprising BERT-based semantic features with a moderate-to-high ICC of 0.76. There was some limited evidence of free speech showing lower ICCs across tasks. Demographic, emotional and physical state factors contributed negligibly to ICC variance, indicating that these external factors had minimal impact on the consistency of the acoustic and semantic features. Overall, we find that acoustic-prosodic and text-based features have crucially different psychometric properties, with the latter showing low test-retest reliability individually, though semantic features form intercorrelated clusters that are more stable and capture significant aspects of the variance.",

          "abstract": "Active inference provides a powerful framework for understanding how agents perceive, learn, and act by maintaining an internal model of the world. However, most existing implementations rely on generative models that are designed for specific tasks or domains. These task specific models limit the ability of agents to generalise, adapt to new environments, or scale beyond narrow applications.\n\nTaking inspiration from the human brain, which appears to solve the problem of generalisation through a combination of modularity, hierarchy, and embodiment, we propose a list of core ingredients. We outline seven core components that we believe are essential for a scalable and reusable generative model, including compositional structure, temporal abstraction, attention and precision, meta-level learning, separation of self and world, and mechanisms for learning model structure itself.\n\nThe discretisation of these core components hints at the necessity for a series of interconnected generative models organised on a graph-like structure with (some) shared variables, states and parameters, similar to the functional specialisation, integration, and connectivity of the brain. We propose that these components offer a blueprint for constructing intelligent systems that can generalise across tasks and domains.",

Critically, one cannot reliably predict which of these outcomes will happen. In this review, we argue that the average effectiveness of choice architecture interventions in influencing behavior is modest, and there is substantial heterogeneity in their impact. The complex interaction of multiple moderators and their dynamic change over time, makes it difficult to learn about when and to what extent choice architecture interventions work. We outline the obstacles to understanding generalizability, clarify the dimensions of generalizability and review the research practices (systematic exploration and measurement of moderators; sampling, designing, analyzing and reporting for generalizability) that could help the field more efficiently accumulate evidence. We conclude that adopting these practices is essential for advancing nuanced theories and for more accurately predicting the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across diverse populations, settings, treatments, outputs and analytical approaches.",

          "abstract": "Alterations in speech coherence have long been noted in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). Three distinctive dimensions of such alterations are: (i) Use and distribution of noun phrases (NPs, e.g. a man; that large cat) in discourse; (ii) Semantic similarity between words or sentences; and (iii) Predictability of words (‘perplexity’). While these dimensions are likely to be inherently connected, they have largely been studied in isolation. This study targeted them in conjunction, in groups of first episode of psychosis (FEP, n=53) and youths at ultra-high risk (UHR, n=64) of SSD, in Turkish. Individuals with a family history of psychosis (FHP, N=39) were also included, and 34 neurotypical controls (NC). In FEP, we confirmed a pattern previously attested in chronic SSD in Turkish, of fewer definite NPs (e.g., this bald man), more ‘bare’ NPs—i.e., lacking functional elements such as this/a —, and an unexpected random distribution of indefinite NPs. FEP and UHR also showed higher word-to-word semantic similarity, and FEP larger image-to-text bimodal semantic distance, replicating a pattern previously attested in English. NP-related variables related to both semantic similarity and perplexity, with crucially different patterns seen for definite vs. indefinite NPs. Referential anomalies (unclarities of reference) were more prevalent in all groups relative to NC. Together, these patterns confirm a referential disturbance in early psychosis, partially extending to the extended schizophrenia phenotype, while additionally confirming that referential structure is closely integrated with conceptual semantics and the probabilistic structure of speech",

This brief report describes the early implementation of an SSC intervention in a community-based gender-responsive mental health program at an academic medical center. Objective: Feasibility and acceptability of the service was piloted with clients who participated in an SSC intervention Method: Six clients completed a 45–60-minute SSC intervention that identified individualized goals, action steps, internal and external supports, and coping strategies. Pre- and post-session measures assessed psychological symptoms, hopelessness, agency, and satisfaction with care. Illustrative case studies are presented for two of the six clients (transition-aged young adults ages 19 and 23), who consented to research. Results: Across both cases, the young women collaboratively developed meaningful goals, engaged in action planning, and identified personal coping strategies, even in the context of limited external supports. Post-session feedback indicated that youth found the intervention helpful and aligned with their goals. Clinicians found the service easy to be trained in, implement and effective. Conclusions: Initial/preliminary results suggest the SSC intervention is feasible and acceptable for use in a free, community-based outpatient clinic at an academic medical center serving young women and gender expansive youth. Findings highlighted changes in hopefulness mirrored findings from previous SSC studies. Implementation challenges included lower-than-expected uptake, including difficulty re-engaging youth who expressed initial interest but did not schedule or attend their SSC. Lessons learned included the importance of flexible delivery, structured action planning, and intentional engagement strategies to support successful implementation.",

In this study we applied state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to extract these features automatically, using an existing, manually annotated dataset, in which English-speaking participants described a comic strip: 30 individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) (15 with moderate or severe FTD (SZ + FTD), 15 with minimal or no FTD (SZ−FTD), 15 neurotypical controls (NC). We first show that LLM-based analyses replicate the findings based on manual annotation, particularly highlighting that definite NPs tied to prior discourse—markers of grammatical and cognitive complexity and narrative coherence—were significantly underused in the SZ+FTD group. Secondly, we demonstrate that LLMs, especially when used with in-context (few-shot) learning, offer a promising avenue for the automatic extraction of referential features. These results show that a crosslinguistically validated and clinically important linguistic pattern of deviance is accessible to automatized assessment with NLP.",

          "abstract": "When trying to make sense of what is going on in the world and their personal lives, people often refer to scientific and religious explanations. Based on pertinent literature, we introduce a novel self-report instrument that captures five types of how people subjectively conceptualize the science-religion relationship. In addition to examining the psychometric properties of the new instrument, we tested whether these five types of conceptualizations are ordered along a single continuum of conflict vs. compatibility. In doing so, we ran and compared two unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models; a generalized partial credit model (GPCM) and a generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM), both in a German (total N = 2,920) and in a U.S. (N = 1,197) sample. We examined model fit statistics to determine the best-fitting model and examined measurement precision at the scale and the item levels. Finally, we tested measurement invariance across countries (i.e., Germany and the United States), as well as the discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity of our new instrument. Our results suggest that public perceptions of the relationship between science and religion are best captured by an unfolding response process (i.e. GGUM) and vary systematically across cultural contexts. In addition, U.S. participants perceived higher levels of conflict than their German counterparts. This research contributes to our theoretical understanding of science-religion perceptions and provides a validated measure for future cross-cultural research.",

Here, we aim to overcome these limitations by drawing from state-of-the-art experimental paradigms and robust tools from the cognitive science of metacognition. To examine overconfidence and disentangle metacognitive bias from metacognitive sensitivity, we developed a carefully-controlled set of case-vignettes of patients with headaches that was completed by 52 physicians. We found that, although physicians are overconfident, they maintain relatively good insight into the accuracy of their decisions. In addition, and unlike previous reports, we found limited inter-individual variability depending on specialty, gender, or seniority level.

          "abstract": "Debriefings are a cornerstone of ethical research, especially when deception is used. In (experimental) misinformation research, this often involves exposing participants to false claims without their awareness. Debriefings both disclose deception and act as interventions, warning participants about misinformation. Yet, unlike such interventions (e.g., fact-checking, media literacy tools) they reveal that researchers deliberately introduced the falsehoods, raising concerns about unintended effects on trust and skepticism. In a pre-registered U.S.-based experiment (N = 896), we compare the effects of no debriefing, a standard debriefing, and a specific debriefing that includes fact-checks and source links. We find that only the specific debriefing significantly reduced belief in false news. The standard debriefing slightly reduced belief in true news, suggesting that explicit warnings may heighten generalized skepticism. Both debriefings improved participants’ attitudes toward the study, increasing perceived transparency and reduced feelings of manipulation. These findings suggest that while general warnings may not reduce misperceptions and may come with small unintended side effects, specific debriefings can correct false beliefs and foster trust --- supporting their use as an ethical and effective practice in misinformation research.",

          "abstract": "Stories are a powerful form of language that connect people, evoke memories, and spark imagination. When reading a story, people can appreciate it on a range of dimensions, such as how creative, complex, and coherent it is. However, many previous studies have focused on the evaluation of story creativity specifically, relying on experts’ ratings and high inter-rater reliability, which obscures meaningful differences between ratings across populations and misses the opportunity to assess other dimensions of narrative quality (e.g., cohesiveness). Moreover, although a few quantitative linguistic features have recently been used to predict creativity ratings of stories, it is unclear how those fine-grained features drive a broader range of narrative qualities, as well as individual differences in human ratings. Here, we addressed these limitations by examining the impact of expertise on ratings of five dimensions of story quality (creativity, imagination, novelty, complexity, cohesiveness). We also analyzed the influence of four diverse categories of linguistic features (language productivity, lexical predictability, semantic similarity, and content composition) on these human ratings. Online storytellers improvised spoken stories, transcripts of which (N=108) were rated by both novices (N=304) and creative writing/storytelling experts (N=15) on the five quality dimensions above and analyzed in terms of the four linguistic feature categories above. Overall, experts and novices provided similar average ratings, and their rating spaces both showed two distinct underlying dimensions–concepts that are strongly correlated with creativity, and cohesiveness–which were, in turn, predicted by distinct sets of linguistic features. Notably, however, experts perceived the five dimensions as more differentiated, and their ratings were less driven by linguistic features than novices’. These findings indicate that experts’ judgments are more nuanced and may rely less on fine-grained linguistic and structural components of narratives, highlighting the importance of capturing individual differences and multidimensionality in the perception of stories.",

The study aimed to investigate their experiences of participation, focusing on taking the trial medication for up to 52 weeks (blinded to whether they were taking the active medication or placebo). Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Interviewees often discussed improved anxiety regardless of treatment allocation, attributing changes to sertraline, the placebo effect, and positive and negative external factors. Some participants, including those taking placebo experienced side effects, mirroring types, frequency, and severity in non-autistic populations. Many were able to manage these and continue, but some discontinued medication as a result. Factors in trial design and delivery were identified as facilitating retention, including frequent appointments, shared control over their dose, and meaningfully involving autistic people in the trial design. These and other non-pharmacological factors may have enhanced therapeutic benefits and could be considered to improve RCT design and therapeutic alliances with autistic people.",

          "authors": "Marek Urban; Petra Kmoníčková; Kamila Urban",
          "abstract": "Outputs from large language models (LLMs) are often rated as highly original yet show low variability compared to human responses, a pattern we refer to as the LLM creativity paradox. Yet, prior work suggests that assessments of originality and variability may reflect stylistic features of LLM outputs rather than underlying conceptual novelty. The goal of the present study was to investigate this issue\nusing outputs from seven distinct LLMs on a modified Alternative Uses Task. We scored verbatim and \"humanized\" LLM responses—reworded to reduce verbosity but maintain core ideas—using four automated metrics (supervised OCSAI and CLAUS models, and two unsupervised semantic-distance tools) and compared them with responses from 30 human participants. As expected, verbatim LLM responses were rated as substantially more original than human responses (median d = 2.27 for supervised models and 0.79 for semantic-distance models) but showed markedly lower variability (median d = 0.85). Humanizing the responses strongly decreased originality and weakly increased variability, indicating that part of the LLM creativity paradox is driven by stylistic cues. Nevertheless,\neven after humanization, originality scores of LLM responses remained higher (median d = 0.80) and their variability lower (d = 0.57) than those of human responses. These findings suggest that automated assessment tools can be partially misled by the style of LLM outputs, highlighting the need for caution when using automated methods to evaluate machine-generated ideas, particularly in real-world\napplications such as providing feedback or guiding creative workflows.",

          "abstract": "Aging is typically associated with characteristic changes to cognitive function, personality, and political orientation. While online data collection for psychological research has greatly increased in frequency, there has been little systematic examination of whether online samples are appropriate for studying aging. Here, we examine whether typical age-related differences in cognitive function, personality and political orientation are replicated in online samples. We measured cognitive performance using tests of vocabulary, processing speed, memory, and attention developed by the TestMyBrain Project; personality using the Big Five Inventory; and political orientation following the ANES survey format. At least 200 participants each were sampled from three crowdsourcing websites (Amazon MTurk, CloudResearch MTurk Toolkit, and Prolific) and three panel recruitment websites (Lucid, CloudResearch PrimePanels, and Qualtrics Panels). On all six platforms, consistent with established norms, age was positively correlated with vocabulary performance and negatively correlated with processing speed. Additionally, in all six samples, consistent with prior studies, age was associated with higher Agreeableness, lower Neuroticism, and greater political conservatism. There were some differences between crowdsourced and panel samples, however. Performance on cognitive measures was broadly better for crowdsourced samples. The correlations between age and Openness and Extraversion differed between crowdsourced and panel samples, with trends in panel samples likely more comparable to the ground truth. Finally, MTurk produced some discrepant effects of age on cognition relative to other crowdsourced platforms. Beyond these differences, though, our results are broadly encouraging for the prospect of studying aging via online experiments.",

The insula is suggested to function as the primary sensory interoceptive cortex which receives and processes signals from bodily organs and tissues. We highlight growing evidence from functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological and psychophysiological studies, as well as from neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric research, which indicate that subjective time judgments are rooted in both bodily and emotional aspects of the self. Highlighting the still underrepresented role of the insula in time perception, we propose that the perception of time passage and the judgment of duration rely on brain regions that support the interaction between the body and the external environment (SMA), as well as the processing of internal signals originating from the body (insula).",

          "abstract": "To discern trends in violent extremism research, we present a machine-learning analysis of over 34,000 articles published since the early 1900s. We identify two primary waves of research and, different to previous reviews, a clear diversification in studied groups, contexts, and topics. Less than 20% of articles employ methodologies that are conducive to drawing causal inferences. While more studies are using experimental and longitudinal methods, this increase is outpaced by the rise of methods that preclude the assessment of causality. Nuancing previous reviews, at the broader field level, violent extremism research is profoundly multidisciplinary, with political science, international relations, psychology, history, and law emerging as the “Big Five” contributors. At the study level, contributions from single disciplines remain the norm. While single-author contributions have rapidly declined in favor of team-based research, one-time contributing authors remain consistently high over time. To enhance future violent extremism research, we make five recommendations: (1) prioritizing methodologies that allow for causal inferences; (2) incorporating state-based violent extremism perspectives also in individual-level research; (3) increasing the utilization of big data by interdisciplinary teams; (4) increasing the focus on developmental research to understand early life influences; and (5) initiating more interdisciplinary work at the study level.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "abstract": "While studies have examined the influence of learning/attentional difficulties (LAD) and ethnicity on educational attainment in higher education separately, few have explored their interaction. To do this, we analysed data from all 3.7 million UK students awarded a classified first degree between 2008/09 and 2019/20. Students with LAD were less likely to achieve first-class or upper second-class degrees than were students with no reported difficulties although the difference was small. White students were more likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees compared to any other ethnic group; Asian, Other ethnicity and Black students achieved the lowest proportions. The difference in attaining a first- or upper second-class degree between White and non-White students was 14.4%. White students with LAD were more likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees than were Mixed ethnicity students with LAD, and more likely than Asian, Black or Other ethnicity students with LAD or no reported difficulties. Black students without LAD were less likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees than were Asian, Mixed ethnicity, Other ethnicity or White students with LAD; Black students with LAD achieved the lowest proportion. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the interaction of ethnicity and disability in educational outcomes. The data can inform targeted interventions aimed at closing attainment gaps and fostering an inclusive HE experience for all students, regardless of ethnicity or disability status.",

Traditional experiments using post-stimulus summary ratings do not resemble natural behavior. Fluctuations of affective states can be explored with dynamic stimuli, such as videos. Continuous ratings can capture moment-to-moment affective experience, however the rating or the feedback can be interfering. \nWe designed, empirically evaluated, and openly share AffectTracker, a tool to collect continuous ratings of two-dimensional affective experience (valence and arousal) during dynamic stimulation, such as 360-degree videos in immersive virtual reality. AffectTracker comprises three customizable feedback options: a simplified affect grid (Grid), an abstract pulsating variant (Flubber), and no visual feedback.\nTwo studies with healthy adults were conducted, each at two sites (Berlin, Germany, and Torino, Italy). In Study 1 (Selection: n=51), both Grid and Flubber demonstrated high user experience and low interference in repeated 1-min 360-degree videos. Study 2 (Evaluation: n=83) confirmed these findings for Flubber with a longer (23-min), more varied immersive experience, maintaining high user experience and low interference. \nContinuous ratings collected with AffectTracker effectively captured valence and arousal variability. For shorter, less eventful stimuli, their correlation with post-stimulus summary ratings demonstrated the tool’s validity; for longer, more eventful stimuli, it showed the tool’s benefits of capturing additional variance.  \nOur findings suggest that AffectTracker provides a reliable, minimally interfering method to gather moment-to-moment affective experience also in immersive environments, offering new research opportunities to link affective states and physiological dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Humans align their physiology during social encounters, but the mechanisms driving this autonomic coupling remain unclear. Mimicry has been proposed as a driver, yet evidence is largely correlational and limited to precisely matched movements. We causally tested whether two mimicry forms, copying a partner’s choices or motor actions, can induce heart rate synchrony in a controlled, non-verbal art selection task. In the Choice group (21 dyads), a confederate mimicked (or not) the participant’s picture choice but not their hand action. In the Motor group (20 dyads), a confederate mimicked (or not) the participant’s right-hand movements but chose from a different picture pair. Electrocardiograms were recorded continuously from both partners, and heart rate synchrony was quantified by modelling trial-level heart rate fluctuations with mixed-effects models. Dyads' heart rates were strongly coupled by trial and trial (n - 1), but neither the presence nor the type of mimicry altered this synchrony. Furthermore, performing either choice or motor mimicry had no effect on the mimicker's affiliation towards the participant. Thus, instructed mimicry alone is insufficient to modulate cardiac coupling in minimal, structured interactions. Instead, we propose that the observed physiological synchrony reflects shared task demands and reciprocal engagement inherent in the joint task.",

          "abstract": "Although a given choice architecture intervention (‘nudge’) can be highly effective in some conditions, it may be ineffective in others and counter-productive in yet others. Critically, one cannot reliably predict which of these outcomes will happen. In this review, we argue that the average effectiveness of choice architecture interventions in influencing behavior is modest, and there is substantial heterogeneity in their impact. The complex interaction of multiple moderators and their dynamic change over time, makes it difficult to learn about when and to what extent choice architecture interventions work. We outline the obstacles to understanding generalizability, clarify the dimensions of generalizability and review the research practices (systematic exploration and measurement of moderators; sampling, designing, analyzing and reporting for generalizability) that could help the field more efficiently accumulate evidence. We conclude that adopting these practices is essential for advancing nuanced theories and for more accurately predicting the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across diverse populations, settings, treatments, outputs and analytical approaches.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the emerging cognitive and moral risks posed by artificial intelligence chatbots and digital media platforms such as facebook, Instagram and youtube; particularly their potential to contribute to the decline of human attention, thinking, reasoning, and emotional depth. As humans increasingly develop cognitive dependency and emotional intimacy with AI systems the boundaries between machine utility and human connection blur in potentially hazardous ways. In response to these challenges, this study proposes the conceptual model of Cognitive Gyms: structured environments for training attention, reflection, emotional intelligence, and moral reasoning. Just as physical gyms emerged as a societal response to the sedentary lifestyle induced by the Industrial Revolution, Cognitive Gyms offer a timely, preventative response to the cognitive atrophy- the gradual weakening or loss of cognitive functions due to disuse, precipitated by the digital and algorithmic age. The model integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and education, aiming not only to preserve human cognitive function but to protect the ethical core of human experience in the age of intelligent machines. The paper outlines core zones within the Cognitive Gym, suggests generalized exercise types, and highlights its potential to counteract cognitive and moral decline in the AI era. The model remains open-ended, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and contextual customization for future development.",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

Recent studies show that classic insight tasks can be solved through either insightful thinking or analytical thinking. The present work examined relationships between cognitive reasoning tasks, insight tasks and creative thinking. Additionally we explored differences in insight phenomenology when solving insight puzzles and when completing the Cognitive Reflection Test. We conducted two independent studies.  Study 1 was a conceptual replication of previously observed relationships between insight puzzles, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and the Verbal Cognitive Reflection Test (VCRT). Study 2 examined differences between analytical and insightful tasks using self-report insight scales. Five dimensions of insight were measured: suddenness, confidence, pleasure, the aha! experience, and arousal. \nResults showed a clear and positive correlation between insight puzzles and reflective tests (CRT, VCRT) in both studies, these supporting results from previous studies. Additionally, no differences in feelings of insight were observed between insight puzzles and the Cognitive Reflection Test. However, feelings of insight were greater for the VCRT than for insight puzzles. This suggests that the experience of insight may not be exclusively tied to a specific type of problem; rather, it may reflect a style of problem solving that can emerge in various task contexts.",

While prior research highlights the role of social bonding, the influence of pain and its emotional components (i.e., fear) on group synchrony remains unclear. Two experiments investigated (i) the impact of synchrony on pain and (ii) the impact of pain on synchrony, social bonding, and affective states. In both studies, synchrony enhanced social connectedness but did not consistently reduce pain, and pain did not disrupt synchrony despite altering affective states. Experiment 1 showed that the threat of pain increased social bonding and arousal, suggesting that the emotional component of pain functions as a social glue. Experiment 2 demonstrated that fear of pain affected heart rates, mirroring patterns in chronic pain populations. Importantly, in both studies, the sense of \"worthwhileness\" emerged as a critical factor influencing individual contribution to synchronization and pain perception. Altogether, these results suggest that group synchrony is resilient to pain, paving the way for therapeutic interventions harnessing the benefits of collective motion.",

Among articles stating that data was available upon request, only 17% shared data upon request. The presence of Data Availability Statements was not associated with higher rates of data sharing (p = .55), indicating a lack of adherence with journals’ policies.

We conducted a thematic analysis of interview data using a reflexive and inductive approach. We found that children designed robots that could deliver reading-specific support alongside more general emotional support. Key functional features and capabilities included prosocial behaviours (smiling, play, conversation), breadth of knowledge that assumed access to information about many topics, including core academic skills (reading, mathematics). Key aesthetic features included colourful, compact, and customisable designs. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of social robots to support reading and suggest that children are very much open to interacting with reading robot companions.",

Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the role of sleep in the consolidation and generalization of fear learning. 31 healthy, young adult participants (16 in the wake group and 15 in the sleep group) underwent a fear acquisition procedure in which a geometrical figure imposed on a background image was repeatedly presented and paired with a mild electric shock, making it a conditioned stimulus (a CS+). Another geometrical figure imposed on another background image was also repeatedly presented but never paired with the shock, making it a safety stimulus (a CS-). After a ~three-hour delay interval containing either a two-hour nap opportunity or an equivalent amount of time spent awake, participants performed a fear memory and generalization test. Here, participants viewed four different stimuli: the CS+ and CS- seen before, as well as two novel stimuli composed of the same two geometrical figures seen before imposed on novel background images. This design allowed us to examine a) whether sleep consolidates the original fear memory and b) whether sleep affects the degree of generalization of fear learning to when the originally fear-eliciting stimulus is presented in a novel context. Results revealed no group differences for either the consolidation or generalization of fear learning in either of our outcome measures (skin conductance responses, subjective ratings of unpleasantness, shock expectancy ratings, or explicit memory performance). Previous work on the effect of sleep on consolidation and generalization of fear learning has revealed mixed findings and there is currently limited evidence for sleep having an effect in either direction.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nInconsistent and poorly documented mental capacity assessments often lack detailed breakdowns of the four functional cognitive domains (understanding, retaining, weighing up, communicating), thereby failing legal standards. We developed the Oxford Competency Assessment Tool (COMPASS), a novel cognitive screening instrument aligned with the Mental Capacity Act (2005). COMPASS aims to identify potential cognitive difficulties and objectively document domain-specific strengths and weaknesses.\nMethods:\nWe present the standardization and initial validation of COMPASS in 122 neurologically healthy controls (mean age 65.75 years, SD=12.04) and 136 neurological participants (mixed aetiology, mean age 73.59 years, SD=11.67). We assessed construct validity against matched neuropsychological assessments and MoCA, and re-test reliability. Normative data cut-offs were determined, and predictive validity was examined against a hypothetical financial capacity assessment.\nResults:\nCOMPASS effectively identified cognitive impairments and differentiated between neurological and healthy participants (AUC &gt; .80), demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest consistency, and convergent/discriminant validity. When predicting outcomes of a hypothetical financial capacity interview, the four COMPASS subtask scores showed very high specificity (81-100%) with limited sensitivity (23-56%).\nConclusion:\nCOMPASS offers a valid and reliable performance-based cognitive screen measuring understanding, retaining, and executive functioning, closely aligning with neuropsychological assessments. It demonstrated high specificity for hypothetical mental capacity assessment outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This study explores a neurocognitive phenomenon in which symbolic language—particularly in forms designed to activate logical, emotional, and subconscious structures simultaneously—is incomprehensible to individuals when its content resonates with unintegrated emotional trauma. Through a multidisciplinary methodology integrating neurophysiology, psychoanalysis, linguistics, and cognitive psychology, we propose that the brain implements an implicit self-protective blockade against the decoding of symbolic structures perceived as semantically ambiguous yet emotionally threatening. This dynamic is often mistaken for intellectual limitation or lack of comprehension but may instead represent a neurobiological defense mechanism.\n\nClinical and observational data from a longitudinal case study involving interaction with adaptive symbolic language reveal consistent affective, behavioral, and verbal responses indicative of dissonance avoidance. Symbolic phrases in third-order grammar—characterized by recursive ambiguity and emotional projection—were met with cognitive resistance and denial, especially in individuals with unresolved emotional patterns.\n\nThe findings suggest that the human brain may inhibit access to symbolic meaning in an effort to preserve structural integrity when emotionally destabilizing material is activated. This phenomenon, when understood and integrated into therapeutic frameworks, opens new pathways for trauma detection, symbolic reprocessing, and cognitive flexibility enhancement. The study advocates for the development of a therapeutic-symbolic model based on progressive symbolic exposure and structured emotional containment, which could serve as a predictive tool in emotional diagnostics and personalized interventions.",

          "abstract": "Linear mixed-effect models are a powerful tool for modelling fixed and random effects simultaneously, but do not offer a feasible analytic solution for estimating the probability that a test correctly rejects the null hypothesis. Being able to estimate this probability, however, is critical for sample size planning, as power is closely linked to the reliability and replicability of empirical findings. Although various tools for conducting a simulation-based power analysis for mixed-effect models are available, there is a lack of guidance on how to appropriately use them in different scenarios. In this tutorial paper, we discuss and elaborate how to estimate power for mixed-effects models in different use cases and outline important considerations and pitfalls. We provide code and resources for performing simulation-based power analyses on openly accessible data sets. Our aim is to help researchers build intuitions about simulation-based power analyses and empower them to set up highly powered research designs when sophisticated analysis procedures like mixed-effect models are outlined as inferential procedures.",

          "abstract": "Due to a lack of time-efficient standardised assessments, there is a high risk of unidentified visual perception difficulties in stroke survivors. The Oxford Visual Perception Screen (OxVPS) is a 15-minute performance-based screen for visual perception difficulties through tasks like picture naming and face recognition. In this cross-sectional study, the inter-rater reliability, convergent and discriminant validity of the OxVPS was evaluated in 161 stroke survivors in three UK rehabilitation units. Inclusion criteria were stroke survivors aged 18 years or over with sufficient understanding of English, ability to concentrate for 15-minutes, and capacity to consent. Video-recordings of OxVPS assessments were rated by an independent rater for inter-rater reliability. Convergent validity was assessed by comparing OxVPS scores with the Rivermead Perceptual Assessment Battery (RPAB), a 45–90-minute battery of visual perceptual tasks. Discriminant validity compared OxVPS scores with performance on the Blind Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA-B) for cognition and with the Visual Impairment Screening Assessment (VISA) for sensory vision. Inter-rater reliability showed equivalent ratings (N=107, t(106)=-14.77, p &lt;.001) and mean difference of -0.01 point on a 10-point scale in a Bland-Altman analysis (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -0.14-0.13). Convergent and discriminant validity demonstrated a high correlation of .78 (N=58, 95% CI: .65-.86) between OxVPS and RPAB, lower correlations of .52 with MOCA-B scores (N=113, 95% CI: .37-.64) and .39 with VISA scores (N=110, 95% CI: .22-.54). Data indicates good inter-rater reliability and evidence that OxVPS predominantly measures visual perception difficulties (convergent validity) in stroke survivors and less so cognition or sensory vision (discriminant validity).",

This study explored this phenomenon, for the first time, from a language processing perspective. Across three studies, English- and Spanish-native adults completed a translation elicitation task, in which they listened to a series of words from an unfamiliar language (Catalan or Spanish for English speakers, Catalan for Spanish speakers). For each presented word, participants had to type their best-guess translation in their native language. Both English and Spanish natives were surprisingly good at translating unfamiliar words, efficiently exploiting the phonological similarity between the presented (unfamiliar) words and their correct translation. When the correct translation belonged to high-density phonological neighbourhood, participants' ability to benefit from phonological similarity decreased. Spanish participants, whose native language was typologically closer to the presented language, benefited more strongly from phonological similarity than English participants. Overall, we show that speech in an unfamiliar language triggers equivalent dynamics of lexical selection than native speech, providing a psycholinguistic account for homophonic translation.",

Using a form of structured peer review called the IDEA protocol, we use data from the repliCATS project (Global North) and a follow-up study conducted by Busara (East Africa), to compare how experts judge the credibility, and especially the generalizability, of 80 behavioral science papers, the vast majority of which originated from the Global North. Due to their greater familiarity with how other contexts might differ from Global North contexts, where the vast majority of behavioral science research is conducted, we expected that East African experts would express greater skepticism about the generalizability of these findings. Contrary to expectations, East African experts (n = 318) rated the papers as more credible on most metrics, including generalizability, than did the Global North experts (n = 384). We explore three interpretations of these findings: East African assessors possess unique contextual insights; Global North assessors apply stricter skepticism rooted in a broader crisis of confidence in behavioral science; or the comparison itself is invalid due to contextual mismatch.",

Both samples filled out either an online or printed questionnaire measuring bonding social capital (PSCSE, Simons et al., 2020), and psychological, social and emotional well-being (MHF-SF, Lamers et al., 2011) and relevant demographic covariates. \nFindings: Regression analyses showed positive associations between BSC and respectively overall well-being and its subdimensions emotional, social and psychological well-being in both samples. Moderation analyses showed that these associations were significantly stronger for the Turkish older migrants. These findings suggest that the migrant sample relies more heavily on close-knit homogeneous social networks for socioemotional support and assistance than the non-migrants.\nOriginality: Research on social capital and the well-being of older migrants is limited. The results of this study clarify the role of social capital and are explained with the context of the combined challenges these migrants face and provide direction for further research and the development of practical interventions to improve the well-being of the rapidly growing and increasingly diverse older populations.",

          "abstract": "Despite the prevalence and significance of territorial disputes in human history, psychological research on territorial decision-making in high-risk contexts remains sparse. This study investigates the applicability of Prospect Theory in the context of territorial decision-making under risk, replicating and extending the seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky (1979), recently replicated by Ruggeri et al. (2020). To do so, we conducted two pre-registered replication studies in the US (N = 149) and the UK (N = 253), based on Ruggeri et al. (2020)’s protocol. Problems were modified by replacing the original financial dilemmas by territorial ones. Across studies, most responses to individual items were replicated, despite between-study variability (replication rate of 69% in Study 1, 81% in Study 2). More importantly, replication rates from theoretical contrasts probing into each of the five heuristics predicted by Prospect Theory were statistically identical to those of Ruggeri et al. 2020 (77% in Study 1, 92% in Study 2). These confirmed the presence of certainty, framing, isolation and overweighting of small probabilities effects while providing evidence against the robustness of the reflection effect. These findings suggest that the cognitive biases and heuristics identified by Prospect Theory extend to territorial decisions as well. This research provides valuable insights into strategic decision-making in conflict contexts and underscores the robustness of Prospect Theory's predictions across different problem contexts. Future research could build on these findings to develop more effective strategies for deterrence, negotiation, and resolution in geopolitical conflicts.",

          "authors": "Ji-cheng CHEN",
          "abstract": "Natural science is founded on materialism. We treat the independent relationship between inner experience and outer physical reality as an axiom. This cognitive paradigm has successfully explained many natural phenomena; however, certain phenomena, such as those in quantum mechanics and psychological experiments, challenge this view, suggesting the inseparability of the inner and outer. Yet, the inner and outer appear to be distinct categories of existence, and experimental models demonstrating their transformative relationship remain lacking. This has led to issues like the explanatory gap. We propose that adopting holism is a potential solution to reconcile this dilemma: the inner experience can be objectively described and possesses objective causal efficacy. According to holism, objective reality and a causal relationship are not absolute but inseparable from the cognitive perspective. Materialism's view that the inner and outer exist as independent relations is an underlying assumption based on the third-person perspective rather than an axiom. From the third-person perspective, the physical properties of things are described, and we establish a causal relationship confined to spacetime, where things interact through physical medium. This cognitive perspective excels at describing the laws of motion governing simple systems but simultaneously introduces limitations, such as the explanatory gap. From the first-person perspective, the holistic attributes of things can also be objectively described. \"Inner\" and \"outer\" can be seen as different states of experience, and things here interact holistically without a physical medium, forming causality unrestricted by spacetime. This perspective excels at revealing the laws governing complex systems/phenomena and can reconcile the explanatory gap. These two cognitive perspectives, although superficially opposed, are functionally complementary. Therefore, the generalized Complementarity Principle based on holism can reconcile the contradiction between quantum theory and relativity, providing a falsifiable research pathway for the \"subjective\" interpretation of quantum theory. Holism also offers a solution for reconciling divergent viewpoints among consciousness theories, enabling phenomena related to consciousness across multiple disciplines to be explained within a unified theoretical framework. To test these hypotheses, we propose an experimental model to demonstrate that, similar to the role of force that we revealed in the third-person perspective, holistic interaction without a physical medium from the first-person perspective is also an objective way of interaction between things. Under holistic interaction, the inner experience, as a holistic feature of things, can also produce observable and objective causal efficacy on reality.",

          "abstract": "Natural science is founded on materialism. As scientists delve deeper into the microscopic level, paradoxes related to consciousness emerge. The phenomena revealed by biology and physics suggest that we cannot regard the subject and object (or the inner and outer) as independent; rather, they are inseparable. Science takes falsifiability as its gold standard, yet inner experiences seem subjective and cannot be scientifically described. Therefore, there is still a lack of an experimental model to scientifically prove the mutual transformation between the inner and outer. The accumulation of theoretical models provides valuable insights into the nature of consciousness. However, these theoretical models and viewpoints seems independent of each other and even exhibit some contradictions. Thus, a mature theory of consciousness remains to be further developed. In a previous article, we proposed that holism is a potential solution to reconcile the dilemmas of consciousness. According to holism, different cognitive perspectives reveal different aspects of objective laws. From the materialism that relies on the third-person perspective, we can describe the physical characteristics of an object, where objects interact through exchange of particles, and we establish a causality based on space-time. In contrast, the holistic properties of things/events or inner experiences can be described from a relatively hidden first-person perspective. Where things/events mutual enhancement or mutual inhibition through abstract holistic interactions, as the inner and outer are interdependent, this interaction do not need the participation of physical medium, forming a holistic causal relationship shows nonlocality. Holism and materialism exhibit implicit and explicit characteristics, respectively. Although they superficially antagonistic, they are functionally complementary. This generalized complementary principle based on holism applies to reconcile the controversies in quantum theory and a proof of the theory of quantum consciousness. Holism provides a solution to coordinate the divergence between different viewpoints of consciousness, it enables the interpretation of consciousness-related phenomena in different disciplines within a unified theoretical framework. To validate the assumptions based on the Taiji principles, we propose an experimental model to demonstrate that the holistic interaction from the first-person perspective is also an objective effect that influences the occurrence of reality.",

Subjective valence and arousal ratings were collected, along with facial electromyography (EMG) from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major muscles.

          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "It is common to speak of the surprising \"hatching\" of language in children because it is not understood how this faculty, which has not been an evolutionary necessity in Homo, can appear.  The last widely discussed hypothesis, influenced by the genetic discoveries of the last century, has not been satisfactory either.\n\nIn the preceding document \"Knowledge of children at 2 years of age\", the appearance of the first cognitive processes is explained: the simplest-sensitive concepts (cat, \"bug\", ...), which are made possible by a \"recycling\" of the child's psychomotor faculties which are transferred to language (so little to do with genetics). And at the age of three, in his attempt to copy the language of adults, the previous conceptualisation together with the identifiers of his environment (his relatives, his cat \"Mischa\", ...) allow the faculty of intuitively managing the \"Endings\" of words to appear, by recognising without error their complex phenomenological correspondence.\n\nThe explanation of this surprising faculty was advanced by FREUD in a document of 1895 but which was not discovered until 1950 (the so-called \"Psychology Project\"), in which he also advanced the concept of synapses (synapses discovered by LÖWI in 1921), and even FREUD described them more correctly than in the later neurological conception, which is confirmed by the most recent contribution of LLINÁS, since he also revealed the error of the prevailing hypotheses until then about their functioning, which is not to be found in the chemistry of their neurotransmitters.\n\nThe \"Knowledge of children at 3 years of age\" completes this unfinished \"Project...\", showing the total correctness of his intuitions, as well as the human impossibility that 125 years ago he could have progressed beyond what he had already contributed.  Thus, he adds how synapses work, which is explained by the informational unconsciousness dynamics of the psyche (the simile of the \"Tele-tac\" of the toll highways), already intuited by FREUD.\n\nIn turn, the emergence of the child's neuronal interconnections and their minority genetic and physiological causes, highlight the informational importance of the stimulus, and consequently the need for an \"aRb\" relational model of the human psyche, as well as the unfeasibility of the perspectives and hypotheses currently in force.  It also implies a linking of neurology and psychology, as well as the future line for the progression of both, in parallel and without interference as hitherto.  In the expression of a well-known chemist, it is the third strand to be added to FREUD and RAMON y CAJAL in order to achieve a \"scientific psychology\".\n\nThis series of papers (which will continue with knowledge at 6 and 10 years) is an adaptation of the 1996 writings on the \"Representation of knowledge\", i.e. what are the processes that make human knowledge possible, a representation validated by its correct computer simulation and which in turn solved the challenge of LEIBNIZ's \"Characteristica universalis\".  Since, in spite of this validation, it was not possible to make it understood due to its many innovations,  -it represents a radical change of scientific paradigm, with its usual initial rejection-, this series has been rewritten in a way closer to current knowledge in order to make it more comprehensible, which in turn has made it possible to explain various pending problems of language and psychology, in addition to the neurological ones already mentioned.  \n\nIt is therefore inevitably long, with many collateral explanations and several annexes, since it has had to clarify the many misunderstandings of current science, which is still restricted to its exclusively material perspectives, without having yet incorporated information into its most basic paradigms.\n\nAnnex 4 of 13 March 2021 cites an article by other researchers (DEISSEROTH, ...) that confirms the certainty of this document.  And Annex 4 of 17 July 2024 cites another (BUZSÁKI, ...) with further confirmation.",

          "authors": "Changhyuk Seo",
          "abstract": "The feasibility and effectiveness of prison-based rehabilitation programs (PBRP) is examined and investigated as a means of reducing recidivism and facilitating successful reintegration of criminal offenders into society. While criminal behavior may stem from both innate predispositions and systemic failures, mounting research suggests that rehabilitation—even within prison settings—is possible when certain biopsychosocial factors are adequately addressed. The success of rehabilitation depends less on incarceration itself and more on the timing, quality, and specificity of treatment interventions. Despite the historical shortcomings of PBRP—often due to insufficient funding, improper implementation, and unrealistic expectations—this research contends that meaningful rehabilitation can occur if programs are tailored to individual needs and designed to cultivate personal meaning, self-understanding, and intrinsic motivation. Potential interventions include structured goal-setting sessions, physical activity, religious programs, and therapeutic practices that foster positive self-image and resilience. While more empirical data is needed to determine the most effective rehabilitative variables, this paper emphasizes that criminal rehabilitation within prisons remains a viable, if complex, endeavor.",

          "authors": "Jai Jackson",
          "abstract": "Cortical computation relies on the precise coordination of excitatory and inhibitory activity across neural circuits. Inhibitory interneurons, particularly those expressing parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), form distinct but interconnected subnetworks that sculpt cortical dynamics. These interneuron subtypes exhibit specialized connectivity patterns and firing properties that enable them to regulate critical processes such as oscillatory synchronization, sensory gating, and excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. PV+ interneurons are central to gamma oscillations and spike-timing control. SOM+ cells modulate dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity; while VIP+ interneurons exert disinhibitory control over other inhibitory cells, dynamically adjusting network responsiveness. Dysfunctions in these circuits are implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism spectrum conditions. Progress in optogenetics, genetic engineering, and neural circuit analysis has deepened our understanding of interneuron diversity, emphasizing their crucial roles in cognitive function and neurological disorders. This review synthesizes current findings on the cellular, circuit, and computational functions of PV+, SOM+, and VIP+ interneurons, emphasizing their integrative roles in cortical processing and their emerging relevance as therapeutic targets.",

          "authors": "Thomas E. Devitt",
          "abstract": "A fundamental, yet elusive, component of general intelligence is cognitive control—the ability to \nfluidly shift reasoning strategies to meet the evolving demands of a complex problem. While \nartificial intelligence has excelled at creating specialists, a unified mechanism for dynamic \nstrategy-switching within a single agent remains a grand challenge. This paper presents a \nsignificant architectural and empirical advance in the Fluid Emergent Reasoning Engine (FERE\nCRS) project, directly tackling the problem of cognitive control. We ground our approach in \nActive Inference (AIF), proposing that true cognitive flexibility arises from a hierarchical \nprocess of meta-cognition, or inference about how to conduct inference. We introduce a novel \narchitectural component, the Meta-Cognitive Context Classifier (MCCC), which functions as an \ninternal control-switch. The MCCC is trained to analyze the cognitive demand of a sub-problem \nand dynamically load a corresponding, pre-learned set of motivational parameters (Cognitive \nResonance Score weights), enabling the agent to switch between a \"cautious logician\" and an \n\"exploratory creative\" stance on a step-by-step basis. We test this architecture using a rigorous \nthree-stage experimental design, culminating in a complex, multi-phase artifact analysis task. \nThe results provide strong empirical support for our hypotheses. First, the MCCC achieved high \naccuracy (&gt;95%) in classifying cognitive demands, validating it as a reliable control mechanism. \nSecond, the fully-equipped \"Fluid Agent\" demonstrated superior performance, achieving \nsignificantly higher-quality explanations than two specialist control agents. Analysis of the \nagent's reasoning trace reveals a clear, justifiable pattern of switching between convergent and \ndivergent stances, providing the first quantitative signature of artificial fluid reasoning in this \nframework. This work demonstrates a viable, theoretically-grounded mechanism for moving \nbeyond static AI \"personalities\" to agents that can learn to manage a repertoire of cognitive tools, \nrepresenting a tangible step toward more general, robust, and adaptive artificial \nintelligence.",

          "abstract": "This article aims to extend Salvatore Leonardi's (2025) Theory of the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens), integrating it with a new perspective on general interpretive mechanisms, the cyclical nature of predictive models, and, in particular, the structuring influence of communities on the formation and manifestation of personality. Starting from a reinterpretation of Robert Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, we will argue that emotions are the intrinsic \"tint\" that the Prognostic Mind attributes to its anticipations and subsequent verifications of reality. The role of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) in the morphogenesis of complex emotions and the construction of interpretive models (Weltanschauung) that define personality will be explored in depth. The innovative contribution of this work lies in generalizing traditional defense mechanisms to universal interpretive processes and, crucially, in introducing a hierarchical structure of personality that reflects the individual's adaptation to their multiple communities of belonging. We will argue that the HS encodes the \"holistic components\" of each community, allowing the Prognostic Mind to generate specific predictive models for the roles and rules of each social context, while maintaining a consistent worldview at a more general level. Four general interpretive mechanisms will be identified and described—Focalization and De-focalization, Normalization and Contextualization, Re-formulation and Emotional Rebalancing, and Interpretive Attribution—illustrating how they shape our perception and inner reality far beyond a mere defensive function, operating at different levels of this community hierarchy.",

          "abstract": "Social identity complexity (SIC), the perceived overlap among one’s social group memberships, has been linked to reduced prejudice. We extend this work by investigating how SIC shapes both personal (Study 1) and perceived societal (Study 2) stereotypes of intersectional targets across two pre-registered experiments. Participants described targets who shared either two (Double Ingroup), one (Single Ingroup), or no (Double Outgroup) identities with them. Participants provided four traits they personally associate (Study 1) or believe most Americans would associate (Study 2) with each target. Stereotypes were analyzed using valence and emergence coding. Across both studies, targets sharing fewer identities were stereotyped more negatively and with more emergent traits. Higher SIC was associated with less positive personal stereotypes of Double Ingroup targets but did not significantly buffer against negative stereotypes of Double Outgroup targets. Additionally, individuals high in SIC perceived societal stereotypes as more negative and more emergent across all conditions. These findings suggest that individuals with complex social identities are less prone to ingroup favoritism and may be more attuned to emergent content in stereotypes, reflecting heightened awareness of societal bias without endorsing it personally.",

We also derived probability distributions using the law of large numbers and the law of rare events. However, these probability distributions pertained to the frequency of depression, not the duration of time spent suffering from depression. In reality, both the frequency of depression and the duration of time spent suffering from depression are important. Therefore, we derived a probability distribution for the duration of time depression symptoms occur. Furthermore, based on the properties of the expected values of the obtained probability distributions, we discussed methods to shorten the duration of depressive symptoms.

This study aimed to examine whether a BGM intervention would enhance the mood of older individuals in a senior daycare facility in Japan. Additionally, we investigated whether BGM would improve the mood and work performance of staff members. Fifty older individuals and twenty staff members participated in this study. Following a one-week baseline period without BGM, four BGM playlists were administered, each played for one week, with a one-week interval between playlists. Mood and work performance were assessed using questionnaires developed for this study. Our findings showed no significant changes in the mood of older participants during the BGM interventions compared to baseline. However, the mood of the staff members significantly improved from baseline in both the morning and afternoon. By contrast, no significant effects on staff members’ work performance were observed. Although we did not observe the positive effects of BGM on the mood of older listeners, the results suggest that BGM may enhance the mood of staff members in clinical settings.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "This article explores the hypothesis that the cosmology and teachings of Georges Ivanovich Gurdjieff (1866–1949) exhibit significant structural and thematic parallels with classical Gnostic traditions. While Gurdjieff did not explicitly claim a Gnostic lineage, his descriptions of humanity’s mechanical nature, the necessity of conscious awakening, and the hierarchical structure of the universe bear strong resemblance to the cosmologies of Valentinus (c. 100–160 CE), Basilides (c. 117–138 CE), and the Sethians. The analysis focuses on Gurdjieff’s Law of Octaves, which asserts that all processes follow a non-linear pattern that requires deliberate “conscious shocks” at critical intervals to avoid returning to their starting point. This principle is compared to Gnostic practices aimed at transcending the influence of archons and the demiurgic cosmos.\nThe article further examines Gurdjieff’s doctrine that humanity is “food for the Moon,” a concept interpreted as an updated version of the Gnostic notion that cosmic rulers feed on the psychic energy of unawakened souls. Historical and cultural factors, including Armenia’s rich heritage of dualist sects such as the Paulicians and its role as a crossroads of Zoroastrian, Christian, and esoteric traditions, are discussed as potential influences on Gurdjieff’s worldview. Merkhavat (Chariot) mysticism is also considered as a parallel framework for the ascent through cosmic hierarchies. While definitive historical proof of direct Gnostic transmission remains absent, the conceptual and symbolic affinities suggest that Gurdjieff’s Fourth Way may be interpreted as a modern form of gnosis.",

          "abstract": "Effective data visualization and statistics education both involve helping viewers detect significant patterns in 2×2 graphs. These graphs plot a continuous y-axis variable against two predictors: one on the x-axis (Factor A) and one in the legend (Factor B). Using a preregistered, trial-and-error task, we asked 416 adult participants to classify 2×2 line or bar graphs as statistically significant or non-significant. We randomly assigned each participant a Target Factor—Factor A, Factor B, or the AxB Interaction—and tasked them with learning the corresponding classification rule. Line and bar graphs displayed identical numeric information.\nFour primary findings emerged. First, on each graph type, participants exceeded chance-level accuracy significantly more often when detecting Interactions than when detecting Factor A main effects. Detection rates for Factor B fell between those extremes. Second, among participants who performed above chance, line graphs yielded significantly higher accuracy than bar graphs for the Interaction and Factor B groups. No such line-graph superiority emerged for the Factor A group. Third, participants tasked with detecting main effects in bar graphs often applied a flawed cognitive strategy: they judged main effects as present only when an interaction appeared. This incorrect rule produced more systematic errors on bar graphs than on line graphs when detecting Factor A or Factor B main effects. Fourth, line graphs supported more orderly perceptual learning than bar graphs. For line graphs, the Interaction group consistently outperformed the Factor B group, who in turn outperformed the Factor A group. For bar graphs, the three learning curves overlapped with no clear hierarchy.\nThese results can inform effective data visualization and statistics education by clarifying what patterns viewers readily see—and often miss—in 2×2 graphs.",

          "abstract": "In memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), recent autobiographical memories are disproportionately vulnerable to loss, yet most traditional reminiscence therapies focus on more remote past events. Here, we present a case study examining whether a digital reminiscence intervention designed to support memory for recent experiences can improve both episodic recall and psychosocial outcomes in the context of neurodegenerative memory impairment. G.F., a 79-year-old man with early-stage dementia, completed an 11-week personalized intervention using HippoCamera, a neuroscience-based smartphone application that helps users generate and review multimodal memory cues from everyday events. Events that G.F. reviewed regularly using HippoCamera were recalled with greater episodic detail than events that were recorded but not reviewed. Post-intervention, G.F. reported improvements in quality of life, life satisfaction, self-concept, and perceived episodic and spatial memory abilities, along with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Qualitative feedback further revealed that the intervention helped G.F. regain confidence, re-engage socially, and feel more optimistic about the future. More broadly, these findings suggest that digital interventions targeting memory for recent experiences—a domain often overlooked in traditional reminiscence therapy—may provide meaningful benefits to cognition and well-being for individuals in the early stages of dementia. More specifically, they highlight the promise of HippoCamera as an accessible, neuroscience-informed tool to support memory and well-being in those experiencing memory loss.",

We demonstrate that when three fundamental constraints are imposed—(i) thermodynamic energy limitation, (ii) information-processing latency, and (iii) control-theoretic stability—the response functions of such systems necessarily converge to a low-order rational form. This mathematical family, typified by $S(\\tau) = S_c \\tau / (\\tau_0 + \\tau)$ or its dimensionless variant $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$, subsumes classic models such as Michaelis-Menten kinetics, neural spike responses, and temporal discounting in behavior.\n\nWe further show that these rational forms arise as unique solutions under delayed dissipation and predictive coding constraints, and contrast them with exponential, linear, and sigmoid alternatives which violate one or more physical principles. The theory is validated across canonical data from enzyme kinetics, perceptual psychophysics, and decision-making systems. \n\nStrikingly, the same response structure applies to the knowledge-generation process of science itself. Theory formation, replication dynamics, and citation diffusion can each be modeled as constrained response processes within this saturating grammar. Hence, science enters a state of formal reflexivity: its own structure can be captured by the universal modeling framework it helped to construct. This marks the emergence of meta-science—not as a philosophical abstraction, but as a quantitatively grounded consequence of a deeper law uniting life, matter, and knowledge.",

Empirical evidence shows that systems ranging from enzyme kinetics (Michaelis-Menten equation), neural adaptation (divisive normalization), to behavioral discounting all obey τ₀ constraints.

Second Brain Psychology (SBP) proposes that the enteric nervous system serves as the biological seat of the unconscious, storing emotional memories and generating symbolic responses that manifest as psychosomatic symptoms.\nObjective: This paper presents an integrative theoretical-clinical model that positions the enteric nervous system as the primary locus of unconscious processing, introducing the concept of Emotional Matrix as an innate psychological structure that determines individual responses to life experiences.\nMethod: The model integrates neuroscientific findings from Gershon, Pert, Damasio, and Montagnier with clinical observations from multicultural populations, including work with marginalized communities through AIDAT (Association for Alcohol and Drug Addicts under Arrest). Clinical effectiveness was evaluated through patient testimonies and symptom resolution tracking.\nResults: Clinical applications demonstrate rapid resolution of chronic anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms through targeted intervention on the Emotional Matrix and second brain processing. The method shows effectiveness across diverse cultural backgrounds and proves adaptable to online therapeutic formats.\nConclusions: Second Brain Psychology offers a replicable, precision-based approach to psychosomatic healing that bridges neuroscience and clinical psychology, providing new perspectives on the unconscious mind's biological foundations and therapeutic accessibility.\nKeywords: enteric nervous system, second brain, psychosomatic disorders, emotional matrix, unconscious, neurogastroenterology, anxiety, panic disorders",

          "abstract": "Physical maltreatment was described in biographies of Vladimir Putin. Child abuse is associated with various psychiatric and related conditions including paranoia. A paranoid call may sanction destruction of supposed enemies. Putin formulated the aims of his military operation, among them protection of Russian-speakers from genocide. It is known that ethnic Russians have not undergone genocide. Apparently, this idea is delusional. Certain war instigators are paranoid in their tendency to present themselves as prophets or world saviours. Some of them are aggressive against delusional goals. Mentally healthy people can be susceptible to psychotic appeals, a predisposing condition being fear of strangers and projection of hatred upon them. Some ethnically non-Russian subjects within and outside the Federation may be interested in a continuation of the Ukraine war; and there are concerns that Putin has come under their influence. The most important topic in this connection is the inter-ethnic difference in the birth rate and migrations, which is avoided by Russian media and officials these days.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive ability describes how people encode and interact with information and has been associated with economic success, physical health, and mental health. In this paper, we highlight the moderating role of cognitive ability on measuring people’s economic preferences—such as their willingness to take risks and endure time delays. We show that the typically low correlation between preference measurement tools increases alongside respondents’ cognitive abilities. We propose two explanations for this finding: 1) People with lower cognitive abilities use simpler strategies in preference elicitation tasks, 2) People’s interpretation of risk differs as a function of their intelligence; when respondents’ subjective interpretation of risk is used as opposed to the normative definition, coherence between measurement tools increased. These results have consequences for both theorists and practitioners who study latent economic preferences and apply them in pursuit of better policy.",

          "authors": "Péter Przemyslaw Ujma",
          "abstract": "Sexual minorities suffer from worse than average mental health. The most widespread explanation of this phenomenon is minority stress theory, which attributes poor mental health to stigmatization and discrimination by the rest of society. In this paper I argue that minority stress theory is not a sufficient explanation of poor mental health in sexual minorities. My arguments are based on four observations: 1) other social groups which experience or historically experienced discrimination do not suffer from poor mental health; 2) sexual minorities suffer from worse than average mental health even when they experience a low level of discrimination; 3) the quasi-experimental studies best suited to support this theory suffer from serious methodological errors; 4) a meta-analysis of genetic-biometric studies shows that most (although not all) of the disadvantage of sexual minority members disappear once familial factors are controlled for. Alternative theories are explored to explain the etiology of mental health problems in sexual minorities.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Sexual minority and trans individuals are at increased risk of suicidal behaviour compared\nwith their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. A potential explanation for this disparity is the\nconcept of minority stress. The present study aimed to investigate whether variation in minority stress\nbetween European countries was associated with rates of suicide.\nMethods: An ecological design was utilised. Given suicide rates for sexual minorities and trans are\nnot available, we examined the overall suicide rate for the country. Minority stress was calculated by\ngenerating a composite measure of self-reported discrimination and violence derived from the 2019\nEuropean Union LGBTI Survey II.\nLinear regressions estimated the association between World Health Organisation suicide rates (2015-\n2019) as the outcome variable and country-level minority stress scores. In addition, multilevel linear\nregressions were performed on individual minority stress scores (as the outcome variable) and\ncountry-level suicide rates. Relevant covariates were selected for adjustment.\nResults: The findings did not support an association between suicide rates and minority stress in either\nthe linear model (adjusted coefficient=5.50, 95% CI=-9.21, 20.20, p=0.434) or the multilevel model\n(adjusted coefficient=0.015, 95% CI=-0.002, 0.032, p=0.082).\nConclusions: We did not find evidence for an association between reported minority stress in\nEuropean countries and suicide rates. There were, however, several limitations to the study that limit\nthe conclusions we can draw. Further investigation of the role minority stress might play in the mental\nhealth of sexual minorities and trans individuals could provide a means to reduce inequality and\nimprove mental health.",

Method: The design of the current research was descriptive-correlational. The sample of this research included 124 people (men=47 and women=73) from the employees of Semnan Medical Sciences Organization who were selected by random sampling method. In this research, Halpin and Croft’s (1963) Organizational Climate Questionnaire (OCQ), Ames et al.’s (2006) Narcissistic Personality Questionnaire, and Spector et al.’s (2006) Counterproductive Behavior Checklist (CWB-C) were used to collect data. Results: The findings of the research indicated that narcissism had a positive and significant effect on counterproductive behavior, and positive organizational climate had a negative and significant effect on counterproductive behavior. However, the indirect effect of narcissism on counterproductive behavior through organizational climate was not significant. Conclusion: The evidence obtained from this research shows that organizations can reduce counterproductive behaviors in the workplace by encouraging and promoting a cooperative, positive, and intimate atmosphere among employees.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy emphasizes the transformative power of mystical-type peak experiences. Stroboscopic ganzfeld (ganzflicker) stimulation offers a non-pharmacological analogue to psychedelic drugs. This exploratory self-experimentation study investigated whether anxiety-neutralizing techniques (eye movements, square breathing) enhance the brightness of visual hallucinations during ganzflicker meditation in a manner analogous to mystical peak bright light experiences. A single-subject experimental study was conducted over 20 consecutive days using alpha-frequency stroboscopic stimulation delivered via a mobile phone in a headset. Three interventions were compared: (A) resting with eyes closed, (B) square breathing with eyes closed, and (C) horizontal eye movements with eyes open. Visual hallucination brightness was scored from 0-10 at six time points following each intervention during 45-minute meditation sessions. Contrary to the hypothesis, therapeutic interventions (square breathing and eye movements) had minimal effect on brightness enhancement. Instead, the control condition of resting with eyes closed produced consistent brightening of visual hallucinations upon reopening the eyes. Eye movements produced a transient darkening effect. Both brightening and darkening effects showed reproducible temporal patterns with maximum effects at 40-60 seconds post-intervention and duration of 2-3 minutes. The brightening effect was accompanied by positive affect and peak experience qualities. These findings support alpha rhythm involvement in meditation-induced luminous phenomena. The delayed brightening after eye closure aligns with established literature on alpha resynchronization (20-30 seconds) following eye opening in unstructured visual fields. The darkening effect of eye movements corresponds with known alpha suppression during saccadic activity, consistent with EMDR's therapeutic mechanism of reducing imagery vividness. Results suggest that ganzflicker-induced brightness phenomena result from dual alpha augmentation: neural entrainment to alpha-frequency stimulation and alpha rebound following a period of eye closure. This simple controllable method may serve as both a clinical adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and as a standalone tool for self-inducing therapeutic peak experiences, offering sustained access to transformative states for long-term mental health and wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous scales, are increasingly used to characterize the processes involved in speeded decision making. These tasks yield entire distributions of response errors rather than just error proportions. Two diffusion process models of continuous-outcome decisions have recently been proposed, the circular diffusion model (CDM), and the spatially continuous diffusion model (SCDM), which generalize the two main classes of diffusion process models of two-choice decisions to continuous spaces. The CDM, which generalizes the two-boundary Wiener model, assumes evidence is accumulated by a two-dimensional Wiener process with a vector-valued drift rate on the interior of a disk, whose bounding circle represents the decision criterion. The SCDM, which generalizes the class of multiple accumulator models, assumes evidence is accumulated by a Gaussian random process with a function-valued drift rate to a criterion. We compared the ability of the models to account for the distributions of errors and response times on three perceptual tasks: color identification, Landolt rings, and triangle orientation, in which the difficulty of the task was manipulated by varying the exposure duration. Despite some differences in their predicted joint distributions of errors and response times, both models provided good accounts of performance in all three tasks. Our findings reinforce and extend findings from two-choice studies showing that diffusive evidence processes and not model architecture is the main determinant of successful model performance, and show the theoretical unity of diffusion models across different domains.",

We will demonstrate how emotions permeate the entire predictive cycle, serving as constant feedback on the state of agreement or discrepancy between prediction and experience. The concept of cognitive morphogenesis applied to complex emotions will be deepened, illustrating how the interaction between the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) gives rise to these unitary yet multifaceted affective experiences. Detailed examples of primary emotions (particularly sadness, fear, anger, and aversion) and complex emotions (shame, pride) will be provided to illuminate the role of HS and QS within the \"I Socialize\" domain and beyond, in shaping our rich and dynamic emotional life.",

          "abstract": "Background Apathy, depression, and anhedonia are clinically overlapping constructs, which hinders diagnostic clarity and treatment development. This study aimed to comprehensively characterise these syndromes to identify a core set of non-redundant symptoms that maximally dissociate them and to investigate the psychological nature of key distinguishing features.\nMethods Data from seven datasets (N=4,578) of healthy individuals and patients with major depressive disorder were analysed using the Apathy Motivation Index, Beck Depression Inventory, and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. A machine-learning algorithm identified the most informative, non-redundant items for dissociating \"pure\" apathy, depression, and anhedonia. The nature of emotional apathy was further investigated with follow-up studies.\nResults Although substantial symptom overlap existed, \"pure\" syndromes were present. Factor analysis revealed a robust five-factor structure, separating depression, anhedonia, and three distinct apathy domains (behavioural, social, emotional). Machine learning identified 10 core symptoms that differentiated the pure syndromes with high accuracy (AUC &gt;0.90) and could also identify well the presence of each syndrome in individuals suffering from two or more syndromes. Emotional apathy negatively correlated with depression and was specifically associated with reduced affective empathy and a diminished sensitivity to the intensity of negative facial emotions, rather than with alexithymia or antidepressant-induced emotional blunting.\nConclusions Apathy, depression, and anhedonia are dissociable constructs with distinct symptom signatures. Emotional apathy is a unique dimension which provides a novel target for research. A 10-item Apathy-Depression-Anhedonia Measure (ADAM) developed here provides a pragmatic tool for rapid, precise phenotyping to guide more personalised therapeutic strategies.",

          "authors": "Thomas E. Devitt",
          "abstract": "A critical step towards artificial general intelligence is the creation of agents that can \nadapt their cognitive strategies to solve diverse problems. While our previous work \nintroduced the Fluid Emergent Reasoning Engine (FERE-CRS), a cognitive architecture \ngrounded in Active Inference, it relied on hand-tuned, static parameters that defined its \nproblem-solving \"personality.\" This paper details a significant evolution of that work, \nmoving from a configured to a learning agent. We address the core research question: \nCan an agent learn to dynamically adapt its own internal motivations—specifically, the \nweights of its Cognitive Resonance Score (CRS) heuristic—by experiencing a \ncurriculum of fundamentally different problem types? We introduce a \"cognitive \ncurriculum\" methodology, training the agent on two opposing problem sets: a \nlogical/convergent task (Sudoku) and a creative/divergent task (the Alternative Uses \nTest). A simple reinforcement learning mechanism was implemented, allowing the \nagent's Meta-Reasoning Agent (MRA) to update its CRS weights based on \nperformance. The results provide strong support for our primary hypotheses. Agents \ntrained on a single curriculum developed highly specialized \"cognitive stances,\" \nbecoming either a \"cautious logician\" (prioritizing rule-adherence and efficiency) or an \n\"exploratory creative\" (prioritizing novelty). Furthermore, an agent trained on a mixed \ncurriculum demonstrated a nuanced adaptation, developing a skewed strategy that \nfavored the more reliably rewarded logical task. This provides a powerful, quantitative \ndemonstration of how an agent's emergent cognitive strategy is a direct function of its \nexperience and the reward landscape of its environment. This work represents a crucial \nstep in moving from brittle, task-specific systems to more general and adaptive artificial \nintelligence.",

          "authors": "valery krupnik",
          "abstract": "The active inference framework (AIF) considers the brain as a generative model guiding behavior under the imperative of minimizing the model’s variational free energy. Computationally, this is accomplished by hierarchical Bayesian inference. The theory views organisms as doxastic agents, which has drawn the criticism of being insufficient to explain conative agents motivated by desire. Specifically, it has been noted that the concept of desire is not isomorphic with belief and, therefore, fits poorly with AIF. In this paper, we build on previous work that suggests a path to integrating conation in AIF and present three arguments. First, the dichotomy between belief and desire is unnecessary. To that end, we define desire as a hierarchical inference that starts from a domain-general inference on the agent’s affective dynamics (affective charge) and descends to contextualized inference on the precision of action policies. We suggest that this hierarchy is implemented by a coordinated activity of the intrinsic brain networks: default mode, action mode, executive, and salient. Second, we argue for a central role that deferred action plays in the process of desire by allowing for affect-dependent awareness of the agent’s states over different timescales. Third, we suggest that the proposed model of desire and deferred action has ramifications for understanding psychopathology, which we frame as the malfunction of deferred action and desire and use obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression as examples. This view entails that disorders of affect and motivation are subjectively desired despite their associated suffering.",

          "abstract": "So far, there is little evidence of a negativity bias in evaluative conditioning. In evaluative conditioning neutral stimuli (conditioned stimuli; CSs) are paired with stimuli of either positive or negative valence; as a result, the initially neutral stimuli change their valence into the direction of the paired valent stimuli. So far, there is no evidence that the size of this effect differs between positive and negative pairs. We investigated if a negativity bias occurs when a CS is paired with both negative and positive stimuli, in sequence, in an evaluative counter-conditioning procedure. In three experiments (N = 100, N = 362, N = 120), conditioned stimuli (CSs) were paired with either positive or negative stimuli in an evaluative conditioning phase; then in an evaluative counter-conditioning phase, the same CSs were paired with stimuli of the opposite valence. We tested whether counter-conditioning is more effective when positively conditioned CSs are negatively counter-conditioned than when negatively conditioned CSs are positively counter-conditioned. We found this to be the case. There was no evidence that this negativity bias was driven by differences in memory. Furthermore, we found no evidence that a negativity bias nor a positivity bias occurs in a typical (initial) evaluative conditioning procedure. We discuss implications for understanding evaluative conditioning and negativity biases.",

University of Arizona’s Digital Mental Health Tools (DMHTools; called STAND Digital Therapy at the University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA] where it was originally developed), aims to deliver scalable, effective tools for common mental disorders. DMHTools was developed to address obstacles to accessing high-quality, personalized psychotherapy and to improve our understanding of how and for whom psychological treatments work. Here, we provide a narrative description of the philosophy behind DMHTools and describe its essential components. We then describe its development and note key challenges alongside our decision-making process to highlight looming issues for personalized digital mental health.

          "abstract": "Human success in navigating the social world is typically attributed to our capacity to represent other minds—a mentalistic stance. We argue that humans are endowed with a second equally powerful intuitive theory: an institutional stance. In contrast to the mentalistic stance, which helps us predict and explain unconstrained behavior via unobservable mental states, the institutional stance interprets social interactions in terms of role-based structures that constrain and regulate behavior via rule-like behavioral expectations. We argue that this stance is supported by a generative grammar that builds structured models of social collectives, enabling people to rapidly infer, track, and manipulate the social world. The institutional stance emerges early in development and its precursors can be traced across social species, but its full-fledged generative capacity is uniquely human. Once in place, the ability to reason about institutional structures takes on a causal role, allowing people to create and modify social structures, supporting new forms of institutional life. Human social cognition is best understood as an interplay between a system for representing the unconstrained behavior of individuals in terms of minds and a system for representing the constrained behavior of social collectives in terms of institutional structures composed of interlocking sets of roles.",

Recognizing these limitations, this study explores the use of commercially available generative large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc., to assess personality traits from open-ended qualitative narratives. Across two distinct samples and methodologies (spontaneous streams of thought and daily video diaries) we used generative LLMs to score Big-Five personality traits, achieving convergence with self-report measures comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks (e.g., self-other agreement, ecological momentary assessment, bespoke machine-learning models). LLM-generated trait scores also demonstrated predictive validity regarding daily behaviors and mental health outcomes. This LLM-based approach achieved quantitative rigor based on qualitative data and is easily accessible without specialized training. Importantly, our findings also reaffirm the ubiquity of personality expression, in that it is carried in the stream our thoughts and is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. These results encourage broader adoption of generative LLMs for psychological assessment, and—given the new generation of tools—stress the value of idiographic narratives as reliable sources of psychological insight.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate outputs that resemble introspection, including self-reference, epistemic modulation, and claims about their internal states. This study investigates whether such behaviors reflect consistent, underlying patterns or are merely surface-level generative artifacts.We evaluated five open-weight, stateless LLMs using a structured battery of 21 introspective prompts, each repeated ten times to yield 1,050 completions. These outputs were analyzed across four behavioral dimensions: surface-level similarity (token overlap via SequenceMatcher), semantic coherence (Sentence-BERT embeddings), inferential consistency (Natural Language Inference with a RoBERTa-large model), and diachronic continuity (stability across prompt repetitions). Although some models exhibited thematic stability, particularly on prompts concerning identity and consciousness, no model sustained a consistent self-representation over time. High contradiction rates emerged from a tension between mechanistic disclaimers and anthropomorphic phrasing. Following recent behavioral frameworks, we heuristically adopt the term pseudo-consciousness to describe structured yet non-experiential self-referential output in LLMs. This usage reflects a functionalist stance that avoids ontological commitments, focusing instead on behavioral regularities interpretable through Dennett’s intentional stance. The study contributes a reproducible framework for evaluating simulated introspection in LLMs and offers a graded taxonomy for classifying such reflexive output. Our findings carry significant implications for LLM interpretability, alignment, and user perception, highlighting the need for caution when attributing mental states to stateless generative systems based on linguistic fluency alone.",

Yet, modern science reveals that what we see within the black mirror arises not from an external realm, but from the inner architecture of the mind. By gazing into its dark depth, we uncover the hidden dance of phosphenes and perception itself. The method of black mirror gazing is even introduced in psychology. Here we study the essence of the black mirror in relation to meditation and the yoga of the Inner Light.",

Besides facilitating more efficient perceptual inference, this generative architecture also enables the internal generation of sensory activity in the absence of input, in the form of imagination. Currently, it remains unclear how perceptual inferences reflecting reality can be kept apart from those that are imagined. Here, we propose a computational framework which formalizes reality inferences as higher-order evaluations of sensory precision. We demonstrate how this simple mechanism can explain a wide range of empirical observations regarding the relationships between perception, expectation, imagery and reality monitoring. Through simulations, we generate novel, testable hypotheses which highlight directions for future research. Our approach offers a simple yet powerful framework for developing a computational neuroscience of reality monitoring.",

In every society, self-reliant decisions (intuition or deliberation) were most commonly preferred and considered the wisest. Expectations for fellow citizens, however, were mixed: advice from friends was expected about as often as self-reliant routes. The self-reliance tilt was strongest in cultures and individuals high in independent self-construal and need for cognition, and weakest where interdependence and self-transcendent reflection were salient. The same patterns emerged when examining ratings of each strategy’s utility, and oral protocols with Indigenous groups. Self-reliance appears the modal preference across cultures, but its strength is predictably tempered when cultures—and individuals within them—construe the self in relational rather than autonomous terms.",

          "abstract": "Dissociation is a widespread phenomenon with significant mental health implications. The 20-item Dissociative Symptoms Scale (DSS; Carlson et al., 2018) was developed to measure moderately severe levels of dissociation across a broad range of clinical populations. The factor structure of the DSS comprises four domains: Depersonalization/Derealization, Gaps in Awareness and Memory, Cognitive-Behavioral Reexperiencing, and Sensory Misperceptions. In this article, we present a German translation of the DSS (G-DSS) and examine the psychometric properties of scores on the G-DSS. Across two studies (N_total = 257) involving clinical samples primarily composed of individuals with affective disorders, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we demonstrate that G-DSS scores mostly align with the expected four-factor structure. In addition, G-DSS scores demonstrated adequate internal consistency (ω ≥ .76 for subscales), strong convergent validity with high correlations to scores on other dissociation measures, good discriminant validity with weak or nonsignificant correlations to scores on personality facets, and good concurrent validity with positive correlations to scores on psychopathology indicators. We conclude that scores on the G-DSS are reliable and valid for assessing dissociative symptoms in clinical populations similar to the samples studied, which can enhance our understanding of dissociation’s structure and clinical implications.",

          "abstract": "Forming novel friendships is an important aspect of emerging adulthood, yet little is known about how emerging adults identify potential friends in contexts where behavioral information is limited. We propose that emerging adults use value congruence to guide friendship formation when observable behavioral cues are constrained. Using an experimental approach across two studies, we investigated whether friendship interest in an unfamiliar individual was dependent on value congruence. In Study 1 (N = 322), participants evaluated value-expressive self-descriptions of peers, while Study 2 (N = 451) examined friendship interest in the context of meeting someone online for the first time. Across both studies, we found robust associations between values-similarity and friendship interest for openness and conservation values, with more limited effects for self-transcendence values and minimal effects for self-enhancement values. Additionally, we found that vignettes expressing openness and self-transcendence values generated higher friendship interest overall compared to those expressing self-enhancement values. Study 2 also revealed evidence for value incongruence effects, with participants reporting lower friendship interest when exposed to opposing values. These findings suggest that value (in)congruence plays a meaningful role in friendship formation among emerging adults, particularly when observable behavioral information is limited, with effects being most pronounced for values emphasizing the contrast between novelty-seeking and self-restraint.",

A path analysis shows that, in Western but not Chinese culture, growth mindset contributes positively to academic achievement, with effort playing a partial mediating role. Value of effort, another learning-related belief which is essential in Chinese students’ learning conception, similarly promotes academic performance partly through the mediation of effort, and this effect is most pronounced in the Chinese culture. The findings provide insights about how the effects of motivational beliefs may depend on the cultural context.",

          "title": "The ‘Global model of the Psyche’, ... for a fully scientific, simulable and applicable psychology (English&amp;Spanish)",
          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "Since Descartes, four centuries ago, science has had to differentiate the ‘body’ from the ‘mind’, i.e. to differentiate what is material-real from what is ‘psychic’.  The psychic is not material-real but informational-virtual.\n\nToday, four centuries later, everything material is deeply studied by science, be it physics, chemistry, biology, ..., medicine, ..., engineering, ... At both the microscopic and macroscopic level we know all its systems and structures, and their progressive formation processes.  This progression of continuity implies the causality that science demands.  There is concreteness, a very broad consensus, and infinite technological applications made possible by the accuracy of theories.\n\nBut of the faculties of the psyche and its possible structure, we know almost nothing, only effects and diagnoses are known, but not ultimate causes.  There is ambiguity and huge discrepancies according to the ‘Schools’, there is no full science.\n\nThus, in spite of how much we know about all of nature, about everything material, it is totally incoherent to ignore how it is our inner cognitive psychic processes that allow us this vast knowledge of everything around us.\n\nThere is also a lack of connection between the material-real sciences and the behavioural-psychic sciences, but rather there is a confrontation at their frontier.  Thus, in the neurological (something from the realm of the body) science has not been able to understand for a century how synapses work, since they are surprisingly not governed by their bodily environment as is erroneously sought, but !!governed by the psyche!!\n\nThis article is a summary-introduction to the 8 articles that explain in detail what this structure of the psyche is like and how it has been formed, as well as its connection with the ‘body’ that precedes and supports it.  It is what I call the ‘Global Model of the psyche’, which progressively includes the senses, perception, feelings (which includes consciousness), human thought (which includes intuition and intelligence), and the memory associated with all of the above.\n\nIn this model, the core of human thinking is knowledge and understanding.  Its description consists in knowing in detail the series of psychic processes that allow us to know and understand, something that until now has been totally unknown to science, as has been said.  This description is called the ‘Representation of knowledge’.  Nor has it been established what the ‘Characteristica Universalis’ advocated by LEIBNIZ three centuries ago might be like.  It is a powerful system of natural language linked to that human Representation, and therefore strictly universal.\n\nAll this great black hole of science is resolved with the articles detailing the functioning of consciousness, thought and intelligence, together with the progression of children's knowledge at the age of 2; at the age of 3, which explains for the first time the functioning of synapses; at the age of 6; and at the age of 10.  As well as the explanation of the ‘miraculous’ emergence of language in children at 2 and 3 years of age.  A computer simulator allows its verification.\n\nThe two appendices at the end help to illustrate the scientific importance of the topic discussed, thanks to their innovative contributions, as well as the lack of scientific knowledge that still exists in this area.  Incidentally, they also highlight the lack of contribution made by ‘AI’, which merely rewrites existing materials.\n\nApart from all of the above, the birth of Elsa  -my youngest daughter-  and the memory  -the not entirely satisfactory experiences-  of the births of my three previous children, led me to become involved in the subject of Pregnancy, Childbirth, Natal tie, Imprint, Breeding, and Neonatology\n\nThis resulted in four articles, the first two of which deal with the processes of information transfer and acquisition (such as the underrated mother-child tie) as a leitmotif, which together enable the progressive humanisation of the child and, in turn, bring objectivity to controversial issues such as abortion, caesarean section and parenting.  The remaining two articles fully confirm the aptness of the first two through other cases very different from Elsa's, such as premature babies and autism.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "authors": "Monika Szczygieł; Mateusz Hohol",
          "abstract": "Math anxiety (MA) is considered to affect math performance and the choice of math-related educational paths, thus contributing to the gender gap in STEM careers. However, despite decades of research, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between gender, MA, and math performance remain largely unclear. One of the reasons is that different types of anxiety and math performance levels are rarely controlled for. To address this research gap, we tested the associations between gender, MA, spatial anxiety, emotional stability, state anxiety, test anxiety, and math performance in a sample of 269 adults. We replicated previous findings that spatial anxiety in areas of navigation and mental manipulation, but not imagery, mediates the relationship between gender and MA. Importantly, in light of previous contradictory findings, we found that math performance significantly mediated this relationship. Most notably, we found that gender, spatial anxiety, emotional stability, state anxiety, test anxiety, and math performance together explain 70% of the variance in MA. We conclude that the commonly reported gender gap in MA is less pronounced when other anxieties are controlled for, especially given that we did not observe gender differences in the strength of the relationship between MA and math performance.",

          "abstract": "In this proof, I extend and apply field-theoretic framework in a generalized (nD + T) spacetime, with\nsignature (−, +, ..., +), to formally subsume, reinterpret, and unify causal inference methods. I illustrate this unity by demonstrating its applicability to Difference-in-Differences (DiD), regression inter-\naction effects, potential outcomes, Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM), and propensity scoring. Critically, I prove that Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Regression Kink\nDesign (RKD) are field-theoretic boundary phenomena differentiated by the order of causal curvature discontinuity—interpretable as a collision angle within the manifold. This geometric-dynamical\nparadigm offers a novel mechanism for the detection of unobserved variable bias, leveraging tensor\ncalculus and linear algebra. The framework’s predicted  performance stems from its foundation in\nLorentzian spacetime, the inherent mathematical structure of causality, providing a native environment for causal relationships that is inaccessible to methods operating on degraded, flattened projections of reality. True mathematical discontinuities are shown to be approximations arising when the\ncharacteristic time scale of a causal transition falls below the observational time step, analogous to\nthe Planck time limit in physics. The empirical success of existing low-dimensional causal inference\nmethods provide a compelling validation for the superior performance predicted out of mathematical necessity and of this higher-dimensional spacetime framework.

          "abstract": "Humour and laughter, frequently viewed as simple emotional expressions, are proving to be potent modulators of the gut–brain axis, a two-way communication system connecting psychological and gastrointestinal processes. Central to this interaction is the vagus nerve, which mediates parasympathetic regulation and connects emotional states with digestive and immune functions. This review explores how humour influences vagal activity and gut health, using paradigms from health psychology and psychoneuroimmunology. Empirical studies highlight laughter’s role in reducing cortisol, enhancing vagal tone, and improving symptoms of stress-related gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Interventions such as laughter yoga and medical clowning illustrate practical uses for such research, providing inexpensive, low-tech methods for fostering physical and emotional well-being. By integrating physiological processes with applied therapeutic methods, this work highlights the promise of humour as a potential tool in health psychology and encourages additional investigation into its long-term impact on gut microbiota, neuroendocrine function, and overall health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Despite the prevalence and significance of territorial disputes in human history, psychological research on territorial decision-making in high-risk contexts remains sparse. This study investigates the applicability of Prospect Theory in the context of territorial decision-making under risk, replicating and extending the seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky (1979), recently replicated by Ruggeri et al. (2020). To do so, we conducted two pre-registered replication studies in the US (N = 149) and the UK (N = 253), based on Ruggeri et al. (2020)’s protocol. Problems were modified by replacing the original financial dilemmas by territorial ones. Across studies, most responses to individual items were replicated, despite between-study variability (replication rate of 69% in Study 1, 81% in Study 2). More importantly, replication rates from theoretical contrasts probing into each of the five heuristics predicted by Prospect Theory were statistically identical to those of Ruggeri et al. 2020 (77% in Study 1, 92% in Study 2). These confirmed the presence of certainty, framing, isolation and overweighting of small probabilities effects while providing evidence against the robustness of the reflection effect. These findings suggest that the cognitive biases and heuristics identified by Prospect Theory extend to territorial decisions as well. This research provides valuable insights into strategic decision-making in conflict contexts and underscores the robustness of Prospect Theory's predictions across different problem contexts. Future research could build on these findings to develop more effective strategies for deterrence, negotiation, and resolution in geopolitical conflicts.",

Conversely, 'Disengaged Individuals' and 'Average Allies' reported less psychological safety, work efficacy, and job satisfaction than 'Confident Allies' and 'Competent Ally Impostors' suggesting that allyship competencies - not impostorism - may drive psychological safety, work efficacy, and job satisfaction.\nConclusion: This paper is among the first to examine the role of impostor phenomenon among allies, and its effects on allies’ mental health and workplace outcomes.

In reality, both the frequency of depression and the duration of time spent suffering from depression are important.

          "authors": "Jeremy I Skipper",
          "abstract": "Many universities have environmental policy statements that are decidedly pro-environmental. However, some of their past actions may be perceived as inconsistent with these commitments. For example, one university previously invested £21 million in companies and intermediaries that produce fossil fuels, which are known to contribute to environmental devastation and global warming. In line with its policy statement, the university also promoted initiatives to encourage staff and students to adopt pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs). How might the perception of inconsistency between environmental policy and actual practice affect the efforts of members of the university community to enact individual PEBs? To address this question, in two studies we tested the hypothesis that university community members would be less likely to engage in PEBs if they were made aware of inconsistencies between environmental policy and actions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that staff and students were less likely to say they intend to adopt PEBs in the coming week when told about inconsistencies, compared to a group told that university environmental policy and actions are consistent. Furthermore, there were a number of interactions with attitudes, knowledge, and situational factors in both studies, mostly showing fewer PEBs when policy was inconsistent. These results imply that perceived inconsistencies between environmental policy and actions could lead university staff and students to engage in fewer PEBs. Interpretation of statistical interactions further suggests that when individual attitudes are not strong, community members—especially students—reference the university’s inconsistency and decide to perform fewer PEBs than they might otherwise. Given increasing global awareness of environmental problems, this interpretation leads to the suggestion that universities should either consider adding caveats to their environmental policy statements or bring their actions in line with those policies (e.g., by divesting fossil fuel holdings—as this university ultimately did).",

In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

This article proposes a model in which two cardinal principles, the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS), operate in close synergy under the guidance of the functional domains of the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think.\" It is argued that the Quantum Self is primarily responsible for the differentiation and encoding of ordered sets, analyzing discrete properties (the \"figures\") and their quantitative and sequential relationships. The Holistic Self, complementarily, performs the inseparable whole/part synthesis, recognizing and structuring emergent \"forms\" that transcend the mere sum of their components. The main focus is on Cognitive Morphogenesis, understood as the construction of knowledge and the structuring of concepts. Through examples ranging from the structuring of systems like the calendar and the decimal metric system, to the analysis of strategy games like Poker (from individual combinations to game dynamics), it is demonstrated how this \"dance\" between quantum differentiation and holistic synthesis, guided by the prediction and verification of the Prognostic Mind, is fundamental for organizing experience and generating a complex and adaptive understanding of the world.",

          "abstract": "his article is part of a series dedicated to exploring the neurophysiological foundations of the \"Integrated Theory of Mind\" (Leonardi 2025), which places the experience of the acting/perceiving subject at the center of understanding the mind. Moving beyond purely mechanistic descriptions, the model introduces three primary functional spheres – the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\" – whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification, guided by top-down (internal anticipations) and bottom-up (sensory data) flows. Supporting these spheres are two omnipresent Cardinal Principles: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS), responsible respectively for the synthesis of forms and the differentiation of figures and their relationships. All of this is orchestrated by the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens), the unifying principle of constant prediction and verification. These principles manifest through Cognitive Morphogenesis (CM), which governs the synthesis and differentiation of cognitive information without a fixed hierarchical dominance, and Articulatory Morphogenesis (AM), which regulates the dynamics of motor and sensory control based on dominance/sub-dominance between physical elements. \n\nIn this paper, we delve into the most elementary level of the nervous system: the single neuron. We will analyze how neurons and sensory receptors, such as the alpha motor neuron, the gamma motor neuron, and the muscle spindle, can be interpreted within this predictive framework, clarifying their roles as vehicles for top-down and bottom-up flows and as substrates of CM and AM. We will also discuss whether a \"holistic neuron\" or \"quantum neuron\" exists, concluding that, although the Selves are emergent properties of complex networks, the characteristics and interactions of individual neurons contribute differentially to holistic or quantum processing, laying the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the neural architecture of the predictive mind.",

To address this gap, we developed and tested a theoretical framework examining these distinctions. We conducted a meta-analysis of 397 effect sizes from 88 studies and 110 samples (total N = 111566) exploring the link between narcissism and prosociality. Using a three-level random effects meta-analysis (MLMA), we found no significant overall effect of narcissism on prosociality. However, narcissistic individuals tend to report engaging in more prosocial behaviors than they actually demonstrate. They are more likely to engage in public rather than anonymous prosocial behavior, self-interested rather than altruistic prosocial behaviors, nonmaterial rather than material prosocial behaviors, and demonstrate more prosocial behaviors in collectivist than individualistic cultures. Moreover, vulnerable narcissism exhibited stronger negative associations with overall, subjective, altruistic, material, and nonmaterial prosociality compared to grandiose narcissism. Relative to agentic extraversion, entitlement showed a stronger negative correlation with overall, objective, subjective, and altruistic prosociality. Narcissistic rivalry, compared to narcissistic admiration, showed stronger negative associations with overall, objective, subjective, altruistic, and nonmaterial prosociality. In contrast, communal narcissism was more positively correlated with overall prosociality, subjective prosociality, and altruistic prosociality than agentic narcissism. Additionally, collective narcissism was more positively related to overall prosociality than individual narcissism. These findings suggest that the relationship between narcissism and prosociality is nuanced, providing a theoretical framework for further research.",

          "abstract": "This study describes the development and preliminary validation of a brief, standardised Cognitive Assessment Battery for use in applied vocational and forensic contexts. The battery integrates two sub-tests targeting key cognitive constructs relevant to everyday functioning: (1) information processing speed, measured by the Basic Information Parameter, and (2) cognitive complexity, assessed via the Wilson Rapid Approximate Intelligence Test. Sub-test scores were converted to scale scores and combined into a composite full-scale cognitive capacity (M=100, SD=15). The battery was administered to 133 adults undergoing forensic vocational evaluations. Results showed coherent internal relationships and significant correlations between full-scale cognitive capacity and variables such as reading ability, general knowledge and malingering indices. The findings support the battery’s practical utility as a time-efficient, cost-effective alternative to longer commercial assessments. Limitations include the non-representative sample and reliance on a convenience design, suggesting the need for further validation.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the narratives of green energy adopted by opponents of geothermal developments in Indonesia and how they incorporate those narratives into grassroots social movements. Debates about energy transitions are more than pragmatic policy discussions; they are based on concepts of human-nature relations. Decoloniality provides a lens to engage with the energy transition debate by 1) examining to what extent energy transitions reinforce or disrupt power structures that view nature as a material commodity and marginalize affected communities, and 2) enriching social movement theories with embedded narratives of Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Community-based researchers in 14 locations affected by geothermal developments collected data and worked with the authors to reflect on findings. The study found contrasting narratives between energy coloniality and decoloniality in six aspects: green energy definitions, environmental impact, ownership of green energy policy, socio-cultural aspects, national development policy, and local development priorities. It found that opposition movements demonstrated decolonial praxis by 1) incorporating religious and cultural  practices into creative strategies for resistance, 2) embedding local narratives of green energy, and 3) connecting economic arguments with cases for cultural and spiritual survival. The article concludes with suggestions for future empirical studies of environmental movements using decolonial frameworks.",

          "abstract": "Scholars studying disasters and crises often use the term “resilience” to describe the ability of affected people to “bounce back” and reestablish pre-crisis behaviors, patterns, and institutions. In this article, we outline the emergence, meanings, and genealogy of the term in various disciplines. We discuss how resilience is typically conceptualized and operationalized, and we provide a sociological critique of its current usages. The term, we argue, is difficult to measure and often erases social structures and processes of power and inequality shaping the disparate impact of disasters, and risks pathologizing those with less ability to recover. Showing how the private sector has appropriated “resilience” to offer products and services that do little to help an affected community’s most vulnerable people, we argue that “resilience” instead serves as a tool for profit extraction and rent-seeking, as well as a way to push ideologies around individualization and bootstrapping. In the final section of the paper, we offer alternatives to “resilience” and conclude that the objective ought not be to re-define or clarify the term, but to move beyond it in favor of developing more explicit and perhaps more helpful understandings of social and institutional responses to disasters and crises.",

By converting hydrostatic pressure into mechanical energy through wateractuated\nlift chambers, the system reframes the Giza Necropolis as a functional machine\nrather than a symbolic funerary complex.\nRecent SAR imaging conducted by the Malanga–Biondi–Mei research team has revealed\ndeep vertical anomalies beneath the Giza Plateau, along with subterranean voids\nand anomalous channels extending across the necropolis [1]. We interpret these features\nas remnants of a water-driven actuator network capable of meeting the logistical demands\nof a 20-year construction timeline, delivering more than 200 blocks per day with precision\nand repeatability.\nThis reinterpretation recasts architectural elements such as the Osiris Shaft and granite\nsarcophagi as engineered hydrostatic components—pressure reservoirs and buoyant\nfloats—offering testable alternatives where funerary explanations fall short. This accounts\nfor structural overengineering, the absence of remains, and the lack of ritual artifacts within\nthe Great Pyramid.\nThe hypothesis also extends beyond construction, proposing post-functional utility\nthrough cyclic hydraulic discharge, potentially routed via the Sphinx as a terminal recovery\nbasin.

Rather than treating agents as isolated optimizers within equilibrium-based systems, FORCE embeds them in a fluid field shaped by resistance, influence, and differential access—where capital, policy, and social signals distort the flow of opportunity itself.\n\nBy conceptualizing emergent effort, asymmetrical opportunity, and systemic strain as geometric features of a socioeconomic field, FORCE enables new formulations of economic behavior that account for both agency and structural impedance. Constructs such as economic curvature, opportunity resistance, nexus distortion, and emergence coefficients provide a tensorial language for describing how tension accumulates and resolves across uneven social terrain.",

          "abstract": "Aesthetic experience—spanning mathematics, music, and art—remains theoretically fragmented across neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and information theory. I propose the Communication-Optimization Theory of Aesthetics (COTA), a unifying framework that defines aesthetic value as arising from optimized communication across three core dimensions: universality (U), temporal stability (T), and existential resonance (E), while minimizing noise (N), cultural specificity (C), and cognitive load (L). Formalized as: A = (U × T × E) / (N + C + L + 1). COTA posits that aesthetic responses signal successful integration of abstract, high-fidelity, and meaning-rich communication—a cognitive function relevant across domains of perception, learning, and social cognition. The theory explains why certain patterns (e.g., Euler’s identity, Bach’s fugues) evoke durable, cross-cultural responses, while others do not. It generates 23 empirically testable predictions across neuroimaging, cross-cultural research, and developmental psychology. Beyond unifying prior theories, COTA reframes aesthetic experience as an evolved, domain-general capacity for detecting optimized communication—integrating affect, cognition, and meaning-making. This model offers novel hypotheses for 12 future research and a conceptual bridge between aesthetics and core psychological",

          "authors": "Sajedur Rahman Sajib",
          "abstract": "This article introduces the Theory of the Interregnum of Chaos, which challenges the foundational premise of anarchy in International Relations. It posits that the international system's primordial state is not a passive anarchy but a latent and perpetual chaos—a roiling potential for disorder stemming from incompatible drives for security, resources, and meaning. International order is therefore a temporary and artificial construct, achieved through the Hegemonic Suppression of this chaos by a dominant power. This period of stability, the Dormant Order, is maintained via a tripartite strategy of coercive force, narrative dominance, and systemic institutionalization. Power is thus reconceptualized as the capacity for Coercive Containment.\nThe theory's central dynamic is a tragic paradox: the very mechanisms of suppression contain the seeds of their own destruction. To maintain its material dominance, the hegemon is compelled to undertake actions that systematically betray the universalist narrative legitimizing its rule. This fundamental contradiction precipitates Moral Fatigue—a progressive decay of will and self-belief within the hegemonic core—which in turn catalyzes a system-wide Epistemic Crisis, shattering the shared consensus on which the order depends. As the hegemon's capacity for Coercive Containment wanes, Revisionist Vanguards emerge, who instrumentalize the hegemon's normative contradictions to orchestrate the order's collapse.\nThe resultant transitional phase of acute, multipolar conflict and institutional breakdown is the Interregnum of Chaos. This volatile period concludes only when a new hegemon emerges to re-impose order, resetting the cycle under the influence of what we term Cyclical Gravity: the system's inherent structural tendency to revert to chaos in the absence of overwhelming suppressive power. History, therefore, does not progress linearly towards perpetual peace but moves in a relentless cycle of suppressed chaos, normative decay, and violent reorganization.",

In this article, I systematically show how this exemption will effectively not provide any practical benefits as the information involved must still be collected to assess whether the exemption applies, and will be maintained elsewhere as it is required to fulfil other obligations. I also highlight how Article 30 records are a key requirement for oversight and accountability, and their absence negatively affects the organisation's data governance and compliance practices and makes it more likely to introduce risks and liability. I conclude with other avenues the Commission should consider based on responding to actual needs of organisations, taking advantage of RegTech/eGov technologies based on known success stories, and to avoid diluting the GDPR as it risks damaging the future of EU's digital policies.",

          "abstract": "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, yet efforts to address it are still persistently obstructed by climate change denial. While emotions are recognized as crucial drivers of such denial, a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics and underlying affective dimensions is lacking. Here, we analyze over one million tweet cascades from a 10-year period (2013-2023) to compare the affective landscapes of climate denial and climate action posts. Our findings reveal that climate denial tweets consistently exhibit stronger negative affective signals, particularly anger and disgust, which have intensified over time and are strongly associated with higher user engagement. In contrast, climate action tweets show lower, more stable levels of negativity and are more frequently characterized by positive emotions like optimism and trust. A meta-regression analysis, framed by the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model of affect, demonstrates that valence is the primary dimension explaining these affective differences, their evolution over time, and their impact on engagement. Results suggest that the sustained spread of climate denial is increasingly driven by a strategic mobilization of negative emotional valence. These findings offer a unified, theory-driven perspective on the affective mechanisms that shape the online climate change discourse and the propagation of climate misinformation.",

This paper critically examines the vulnerabilities of U.S. cyber strategy by analyzing the historical evolution, strategic doctrines such as ‘Defend Forward’, and major incidents including the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware breach. Drawing on expert opinion and recent policy documents – such as the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy – this study highlights achievements such as institutional reforms and offensive cyber capabilities, but most importantly, identifies persistent gaps in software supply chain security, infrastructure resilience, and cyber deterrence. This paper underscores the importance of regulatory innovation, workforce development, and global collaboration in shaping a resilient cyber posture. Ultimately, it argues that U.S. cyber strategy, while evolving, remains at a crossroads. This requires a balanced commitment to both defensive robustness and offensive agility to effectively navigate the complex and contested domain of cyberspace.",

          "authors": "Giampiero Passaretta; Jan Skopek; Joseph Workman",
          "abstract": "Schooling is often seen as equalizing learning outcomes among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. However, empirical support for the ‘school equalization’ hypothesis in the United States remains inconclusive, despite decades of research relying on summer breaks to estimate schooling effects. This study applies, for the first time in the U.S., the differential exposure approach – a recently developed causal identification strategy – as an alternative to the seasonal comparison design.  We unify both approaches within a single analytical framework, enabling direct comparison of their estimated effects under consistent conditions. Using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K:2011), we show that the seasonal comparison design may substantially inflate estimated school effects on learning, potentially misattributing to schools what are, in fact, consequences of changes in non-school environments during summer. Equalization effects estimated via the differential exposure approach were about 50% smaller than those inferred through seasonal comparisons. These findings suggest a tempered, grade-specific perspective: while schools reduce socioeconomic disparities in learning, their equalizing impact appears smaller than previously believed and diminishes across grades. The article challenges foundational assumptions in prior research and, by establishing a methodological basis for cross-national comparison, suggests that school equalization is contingent on national institutional contexts.",

It is the forensic examination of Dental and mandibular morphology of Asian Homo erectus that provides critical insights into the dietary adaptation, ecological flexibility and paleobiology of this widespread hominin. This study synthesizes current evidence from dental metrics, enamel thickness, occlusal wear patterns, and mandibular biomechanics to reconstruct feeding ecology across different Pleistocene Asian environments. Our findings indicate that while both Java Man and Peking Man exhibit definitive Homo erectus dental and mandibular morphology, their evolutionary relationship to later Asian Hominin populations is impactful. We identify critical gaps in the fossil record and provide targeted research directions to further ascertain the role of Asian Homo erectus in the Hominin craniodental morphology continuity. The paper provides a detailed analysis of their dental, cranial and mandibular resilience congruity; a remarkable quality of adaptive plasticity that was considerably responsible for the survival of the taxa for over a million years.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how retirement’s effect on subsequent health varies by individual attributes and their interaction. Instead of spotlighting heterogeneity for a specific, theoretically predetermined feature, I consider the feature-wide effect heterogeneity to find possible data-driven candidates that generate this heterogeneity. To accomplish this, I use causal forests and harmonized data from the Health and Retirement Studies family. The results show that temporal dimensions (such as age and birth cohort) and financial dimensions (such as income and wealth) are the most important features in heterogenizing retirement’s effect on health. Based on these findings, I suggest the “double scaffold” model to comprehensively explain feature-wide effect heterogeneity.",

          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "The “SM-Loop” is a theoretical model that explains the structural reproduction of \ndominance in organizations through the interplay of S (Superior) and M (Mimicry). \nOriginally coined with a tongue-in-cheek reference to S/M relationships, the term has \nsince evolved into a powerful analytical tool for understanding real-world workplace \npathology. Within hierarchical settings, emotionally expressive behavior—especially \nanger—from a superior (S) is often mimicked by subordinates (M). Over time, this \nemotional contagion becomes embedded as a structural pattern: subordinates imitate \ndominant behaviors to survive, eventually becoming new superiors themselves. This \nloop—emotional dominance → mimicry → ascension—reinforces itself across \norganizational layers. The SM-Loop is not confined to the workplace. It manifests in \nschools, families, and political systems, making it a memetic engine of cultural \ntransmission. This paper unpacks the mechanisms of the loop using both theoretical \nframeworks and pop-cultural metaphors—most notably, the beloved Japanese \nanimation Doraemon—to show how structural mimicry drives emotional reproduction. \nThe SM-Loop is at once invisible and omnipresent. This paper offers a diagnosis, a \nmirror, and perhaps a first step toward resistance—for anyone trapped within the loop, \nand for those who dare to question it.",

          "authors": "KIL JAE AHN",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces and theorizes the concept of “Hybrid Barbarism” to explain the erosion of civic rationality in contemporary digital societies. While digital technologies have transformed global communication and political expression, they have simultaneously accelerated the spread of affective discourse, hastened emotional contagion, and contributed to the structural dissolution of public reason. Drawing on the theoretical foundations of Norbert Elias, Hannah Arendt, and Slavoj Žižek, this study analyzes how the fusion of technology, emotion, and libidinal politics fosters a post-rational and increasingly undemocratic social order. It specifically examines how social platforms, influencers, and AI-driven recommendation systems amplify personalized emotional experiences while weakening deliberative public discourse. With indirect reference to cases in South Korea and India, the paper argues that “civilization” and “barbarism” no longer function as a binary. Instead, a complex societal form has emerged where emotional, tribal, and authoritarian impulses coexist within a modern infrastructure of knowledge and control. Although this inquiry is grounded in social theory, the author is a scholar specializing in architectural design and Architectural IT. The theoretical concepts developed here are intended to inform future interdisciplinary exploration at the intersection of emotional environments and structural space.",

          "abstract": "This study provides evidence that policymakers actively invoke public opinion in legislative deliberation. Analyzing over two decades of Bundestag debate speeches (1991–2017), we find that 99.5% of German MPs who debated policy during this period referred to public opinion at least once, and that public opinion appears in 23.2% of all debate speeches. We classify public opinion into four types. The MPs use (1) direct evidence and their own (2) presumptions to discuss or claim public opinion. They also engage in (3) formation of public opinion through persuasion and predictions, and they discuss (4) responsiveness to public opinion and the role of democratic principles. The frequent and contested usages of public opinion reveal its centrality to the policymaking process. Public opinion is deeply embedded where it is theorized but often unobserved: the act of policymaking. We develop a standardized method for detecting and categorizing references to public opinion in political texts combining traditional dictionaries and qualitative coding with a modern pre-trained multilingual language model. Our open workflow enables researchers to deploy the method on any textual data, and our interactive web-based app allows users to investigate all the annotated sentences from this period Bundestag speeches.",

This study investigates the causal effects of the Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg on local tourism development. Employing the synthetic control method, we create a counterfactual scenario to estimate how Hamburg’s tourism trajectory might have unfolded without the construction of the Elbphilharmonie. Contrasting recent debates highlighting the often underwhelming nature of 'star architecture', our findings indicate that the concert hall has had a major effect on tourism: In the seven and a half years from its opening in January 2017 to the second quarter of 2024, the Elbphilharmonie is estimated to be responsible for 13 million additional overnight stays, despite the period covering the covid pandemic.",

This dramatically reduces the meaning space for both ancient and modern pre-linguistic humans, allowing them to acquire language and social meaning very quickly—a necessity likely as human communities began to grow and become unwieldy for non-linguistic coordination.",

Scholz's announcement of a Zeitenwende (sea change) has triggered a renewed debate about continuity and change in German security policy, focusing on (1) whether the shift represents a major reorientation or a minor adaptation and (2) how to make sense of this in light of Germany's traditional culture of military restraint, the country's so-called “pacifism.” This article discusses the Zeitenwende in the context of Cold-War German security policy and German participation in multinational operations during the 1990s and 2000s. It shows that (1) the shift is not as radical as often presumed, (2) more fundamental change happened during the 1990s and 2000s and (3) understanding the Zeitenwende requires a more flexible, discursive conception of culture.",

However, the images leaders choose should differ by the political context they operate in. Autocrats should focus less on social and inclusive imagery and more on self-presentation compared to their democratic peers. We explore this using a new data collection of more than one million images posted by a global sample of political leaders on social media from 2012 to 2022. Using computer vision techniques, we extract information on the social context of these images, in order to map differences between autocracies and democracies, and between personalist and non-personalist leaders. Our results show that democrats present themselves in a more social light than their autocratic peers. There is also important variation within democracies and autocracies, with personalism reinforcing aspects of authoritarian communication strategies in both regime types.",

We used system dynamics modeling and microsimulations to assess the impact of key strategies (Increased Funding, Enhanced Program Management, and Leadership Development) on program sustainment outcomes and suicidal behavior among youth.\nResults: Enhanced Program Management impacted sustainment by increasing simulated levels of community trust by 31.9% and partnerships by 10.3%. Increased Funding increased simulated resource availability by 51.2% and staffing levels by 12.8% over the simulated time frame. Among the three simulated sustainment strategies, Enhanced Program Management most effectively mitigated clinical outcomes, decreasing in suicidal ideation by 0.7%, self-harm by 1.4%, and suicide attempts by 1.1%.\nConclusions: We collaboratively developed a simulation model that assessed the relative impact of stakeholders’ prioritized sustainment strategies. A multifaceted intervention for Enhanced Program Management had the greatest impact on program sustainment outcomes.

          "abstract": "We study bias in judicial authorities' efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate immigrant offenders into society. Our empirical strategy leverages a unique feature of the German criminal code: the optional application of rehabilitative juvenile criminal law or punitive general criminal law for 18-20-year-old offenders, based on a subjective assessment of offenders' psychological `maturity' by judges. Drawing on complete records of 792,000 court hearings between 2009 and 2018, we show that immigrant offenders are about ten percentage points less likely to be sentenced under juvenile law compared to natives convicted for the same crime. The immigrant-native gap in rehabilitative justice correlates with anti-immigrant sentiment across space and has spiked in recent years, suggesting a link between the salience of group-based identities and judicial decision-making. Our findings raise concerns about equal legal treatment and highlight that biases in the application of rehabilitative justice may contribute to higher recidivism rates among immigrant offenders.",

Though bearing a Qing prince’s name in Manchu script, the helmet’s heavy-layered iron core, gold-inlaid Lantsa mantras, and gemstones suggest earlier origins. In particular, structural analysis shows that despite its high-status symbolic features, it has a combat function. We propose it was originally Khasar’s, later modified by Horqin descendants.

We find that learning processes not only generate considerable variation in risk beliefs and behaviors, but also that conservative learning strategies – emphasizing the preservation of generational knowledge – excel in high-risk settings, promoting risk avoidance and long-term survival but limiting growth when conditions improve. In contrast, exploratory learning strategies – leveraging juvenile exploration and peer influence – foster risk-tolerant behaviors that thrive in affluent, low-risk settings where wealth buffers and social safety nets reduce the costs of miscalculations. Introducing economic stratification to the model reveals how wealth disparities and inter-class interactions reinforce these patterns, exacerbating differences in learning strategies and risk-taking behaviors within populations, and perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities through the cultural inertia of excessive risk avoidance. By uniting developmental, social, and evolutionary perspectives, our framework provides a novel lens on the cultural evolution of risk-taking behavior and its broader societal implications.",

While prior forms of privatization focused on transactional, market-based exchanges, today's \"deep privatization\" is characterized by AI-driven, semi-autonomous systems that embed private interests within the core infrastructure and daily operations of education. Adopting a post-neoliberal lens, I demonstrate that privatization now operates at the intersection of state strategy, techno-capitalist platform dominance, and patronage-oriented policy, resulting in a hybrid formation of educational governance. Drawing on global cases and recent research, the paper argues that the impact of AI is less about abrupt disruption and more about the incremental, durable restructuring of authority, governance, and public accountability in education. I conclude that an integrated approach—one that combines conceptual innovation with empirical rigor—is required to illuminate and address the embedded and evolving mechanisms of deep privatization in the algorithmic era.",

It seeks to reposition GenAI from a backstage tool to a tourism actor and to present the Synthetic Experience System, a triadic framework connecting Tourist, GenAI, and Place/Community through data, content, and emotion layers.\n\nMethods: The paper follows an integrative theory building approach. It abductively synthesises tourism literature, information systems, marketing, psychology and ethics to surface recurring constructs, situates them within the service dominant logic and the actor–network theory, and iteratively refines a model through comparison of GenAI applications focusing on responsible research and innovation. \n\nResults: Analysis reveals three continuous co creation loops that circulate agency among actors and four boundary conditions—authenticity, bias, sustainability, privacy—that determine system viability. The Synthetic Experience System clarifies where value emerges, identifies points of potential value co destruction, and yields fifteen research propositions spanning tourist cognition, firm capabilities, destination policy, and planetary carbon limits.\n\nImplications: The framework provides a roadmap for destination management organisations, platform designers, and regulators to audit algorithms, design participatory prompts, and adopt carbon aware deployment. By naming actors, layers, and boundaries, the study offers a shared vocabulary that can anchor empirical investigations and stimulate cross disciplinary citations in tourism, information systems, and sustainability research.",

In this article, we use novel newspaper data of people attempting to pay with large amounts of small cash and coins as a form of protest to highlight the material conditions under which actors are able to convey an alternative meaning of an object to an audience. We use computational linguistic and quantitative methods to examine when changes in the  meaning of money are more likely to lead to emotionally-charged media reception. We find that emotionally-charged media reception is more likely when, typically, actors consciously attend to money and yet do not have to put in much cognitive work to assign meaning to it in the setting where the protest is attempted.

          "abstract": "How do single mothers fare in a policy context that seeks gender equality through focusing on two-parent families? The ability to combine paid work and family life gender-equally has been a longstanding policy aim in Sweden, which has sought to solve this problem by supporting dual-earner-dual-carer families. This study explores how low-resourced single mothers meet family needs in the Swedish context, using low-resourced coupled parents as a comparison group. Thirty-one single mothers and coupled parents (16 single mothers, 13 coupled mothers, 2 coupled fathers), recruited through community organisations in four Swedish cities, participated in seven focus groups during spring 2023. While Sweden is considered a frontrunner in the gender revolution, I suggest that the policy assumption of equally shared parenting disadvantages low-resourced single mothers. Swedish social policies are predicated on a perceived equal division of parenting, but there are rarely checks to ensure that parenting is actually carried out equally. When the actual division is highly unequal, low-resourced single mothers lack adequate support to meet family needs. Single mothers are set back both as a direct implication of the dual-earner-dual-carer model and in relative terms, through policies that either assume gender-equal parenting or that do not compensate for its absence. This leads to under-recognised financial, emotional, and practical vulnerabilities, particularly among single mothers experiencing a gendered lack of division of labour with their co-parent. Together, these insights further our understanding of how a stratified and incomplete gender revolution and policies designed to underpin it may disadvantage low-resourced single mothers.",

It investigates what drove GHQ’s push for gender equality, exploring how rhetoric, ideology, and geopolitical and psychological factors intersected in the postwar context.\nUsing Critical Discourse Analysis, Terror Management Theory, and Gender Studies, the study analyzes English-language and translated Japanese sources, including SCAPIN directives, The Japan Times, Stars and Stripes, Yank Magazine, NHK newsreels, and Asahi Shimbun. Through rhetorical mapping and thematic coding, it reveals how gender reforms were framed as vital to Japan’s democratization and moral recovery post-defeat.\nFindings indicate that GHQ’s gender reforms were not solely driven by liberal democratic ideals but were also strategic responses to American and Japanese anxieties. These reforms reshaped public identities and cultural narratives, embedding gender equality within discourses of peace, modernization, and civic duty. However, they were influenced by American views of Japanese society and Cold War priorities, which moderated the initial emancipatory rhetoric.\nBy analyzing the discursive construction of femininity, masculinity, heroism, and citizenship, this thesis argues that GHQ’s gender agenda was a complex ideological project, balancing progressive goals with conservative limits. It highlights how language served as a tool for cultural reconstruction, shaping the postwar Japanese subject through emotionally resonant narratives of rebirth and reform.",

          "abstract": "Paruresis, or \"shy bladder syndrome,\" is classified as a social anxiety disorder in Western psychiatry (American Psychiatric Association 2013). This study challenges its medicalization through a medical anthropology framework, integrating cross-cultural analysis and evolutionary insights on privacy-seeking behaviors. Employing qualitative synthesis, we argue paruresis is a rational human response to environmental stressors, rooted in evolved instincts for privacy during elimination and shaped by culturally specific restroom designs. Comparing Western norms with privacy-focused designs in Japan, Islamic societies, Scandinavia, and Akan communities in Ghana, we critique how Western architectures exacerbate anxiety. Recent evidence highlights health risks from inadequate restroom privacy and benefits of inclusive designs (Taylor et al. 2024; Archova Visuals 2025). Drawing on embodiment (Csordas 1990), biopolitics (Foucault 1995), and habitus (Bourdieu 1977), we propose culturally sensitive restroom reforms, contributing to medical anthropology’s critique of biomedical paradigms and public health policy.",

          "authors": "Margherita Bianchi; REGROUP project",
          "abstract": "This paper delves into the EU’s approach to interconnected environmental risks, set against the backdrop of evolving geoeconomic and political dynamics. It first addresses the European Green Deal, initiated in 2019, and its subsequent strengthening through initiatives like Fit for 55 and REPowerEU. These initiatives signal a strong commitment to decarbonisation and climate targets; however, the implementation of this ambitious agenda is being challenged by factors such as high inflation and increasing political resistance, with some governments expressing opposition to environmental policies. The prioritisation of security and defence has also somewhat overshadowed the climate crisis across the EU bloc.\n\nThe analysis examines the key features and trends of a decarbonised global landscape and the requirements for its effective management. It also addresses the internal and external challenges that will confront the EU in the period from 2025 to 2035. Given this background, the author evaluates four prospective scenarios where the EU does or does not have a role in a global governance reform that does or does not happen. In the first scenario, there is a reform of global governance but without an active EU role; the second scenario foresees ‘green globalisation’, where the EU leads the global governance reform; the third one involves a strong EU leadership but not channelled in a global governance reform; the final scenario lacks both a global governance reform and a strong EU leadership.\n\nThe paper ultimately argues that the EU needs to adopt internal and external measures to prevent the widening of the climate and social divide, both within the EU and between the Global North and Global South. It identifies several critical factors: finding a balance between engagement and disengagement with China, strengthening European industrial production where possible, and diversifying green value chains accordingly by forging stronger partnerships in the Global South. In this sense, the author argues that the EU must engage more effectively with emerging and developing economies in pursuing decarbonisation strategies. The paper cautions that increasing international fragmentation could lead to higher costs for accessing low-carbon materials and minerals, and it suggests that the EU should enhance its competitiveness through its inherent strengths while avoiding excessive and ineffective protectionist policies.",

Phrases like \"the more competent one is, the more \nlikely they are to leave\" or \"there’s no point in getting promoted\" are frequently \nheard. Especially in mid-level positions, career advancement tends to favor individuals \nwho suppress dissent from subordinates and exhibit blind obedience to superiors.

However, existing research has treated these phenomena separately, leading to disconnected bodies of literature. This paper demonstrates that malapportionment can be used as an instrument of gerrymandering. Conventional gerrymandering tactics of cracking and packing can be more sophisticated when the district boundary drawers in power can control the district populations. \nWe illustrate this new yet simple gerrymandering strategy using the case of Malaysia, a long-lasting electoral authoritarian regime that endured from the early 1970s to 2018, focusing on ethnic representation. By comparing the enacted districting plan with counterfactual electoral districts simulated through Sequential Monte Carlo redistricting simulation, we identify significant ethnic gerrymandering against the minority Chinese Malaysians, in which cracking and packing are the strategies adopted by the majority Malay-dominated ruling coalition.",

This paper makes four points. First, the paper reviews how (and whether) twenty influential sociologists, past and present, have conceptualized “society,” with reference to original sources. Second, the paper shows that the biggest limitation in how sociologists have conceptualized “society” is that these conceptualizations have been inadequately inductive and naturalistic. That is, sociologists have at best only cursorily attempted to observe the animal kingdom and natural world for instantiations of “society.” Third, contemporary inductive work from ecology and wildlife biology suggests a naturalistic conceptualization of “society”: a specific kind of group that has been stabilized in time, space and identity. Fourth, this paper describes why it is highly likely that our understanding of human societies will become deeper, more systematic, and more fundamental if an inductive, naturalistic and nomothetic conceptualization of “society” is used to orient sociology.",

Expanding beyond the conventional dyadic model, we propose a three-agent framework for mediated testimony, in which a mediator (M) in context (C) reports to the hearer (H) what the speaker (S) conveyed (p), accompanied by informational cues (I). Highlighting the potential pitfalls of mediated testimony, we explore its normative landscape, pointing out two principles that play a key role in contemporary debates over social media: TRANSPARENT RELEVANCE and MEASURED GATEKEEPING.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nUrban schoolyard greening is gaining attention as a promising approach to improve environmental quality, public health, and community well-being in cities. While transforming schoolyards into green, multifunctional spaces is increasingly implemented, the implications for surrounding residential property values and urban equity remain insufficiently synthesized.\nObjectives:\nThis systematic review investigates the effects of greening schoolyards on adjacent residential property values. The review examines (1) the magnitude and spatial reach of property value changes, (2) the influence of neighborhood characteristics and governance, and (3) implications for equity, gentrification, and displacement.\nMethods:\nA systematic review methodology, guided by PRISMA standards, was employed to synthesize peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. The analysis integrates quantitative approaches, such as hedonic pricing models and spatial econometric analyses, with qualitative and mixed-methods studies. The review primarily covers North American and Western European urban contexts.\nResults:\nFindings consistently demonstrate that greening schoolyards is associated with increased residential property values, particularly within 200–400 meters of interventions. Reported property value increases typically range from 4% to 7%, with higher premiums near greened sites. However, these benefits are unevenly distributed; lower-income neighborhoods may experience smaller gains or greater risks of gentrification. Community participation and inclusive governance are key factors in achieving equitable outcomes.\nConclusions/Implications:\nGreening schoolyards can enhance urban livability and property values but may also contribute to social inequities if not accompanied by housing affordability protections and robust community engagement. Urban planning strategies should integrate equity-focused safeguards to ensure that environmental investments benefit all residents.",

          "authors": "Valentina Rotondi",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how summer school holidays are associated with parents’ happiness across 16 European countries. Using harmonized data from the European Social Survey (2023--2025) combined with detailed national school calendars, we compare the well-being of parents and non-parents interviewed during and outside the summer break. While non-parents show a clear seasonal increase in happiness, this boost is smaller for parents and virtually absent for mothers, particularly in countries with medium or long summer breaks. The gap widens with the number of children and remains after accounting for socio-demographic factors, household labor division, and time trends. Robustness checks, including models with country-specific year and month trends and placebo tests, confirm these patterns. Cross-country differences in the ``parental summer gap'' are substantial but are not related to macro-level factors such as GDP or family spending. These findings underscore the additional pressures associated with long summer breaks—especially for mothers—and highlight the potential value of policies that shorten school holidays, expand affordable childcare, and promote a fairer division of care work.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss",
          "abstract": "Research on repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to curb challenges to state power. Such repression tends to draw criticism from the international community and can be counterproductive to shoring up power and legitimacy. To avoid this, states may employ subtler and less violent forms of repression designed to demobilize popular advocacy and capture the benefits of civil society organizations. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society. Because it looks like more standard domestic regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry and condemnation, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even act as a \"canary in the coal mine\" and signal future physical repression. By only looking at physical violence rather than more innocuous legal and policy-oriented action, existing research undercounts repression. The author recalls his experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different national jurisdictions and measuring different forms of *de jure* and *de facto* restrictions, presents key results, and outlines avenues for future research.",

By converting hydrostatic pressure into mechanical energy through wateractuated\nlift chambers, the system reframes the Giza Necropolis as a functional machine\nrather than a symbolic funerary complex.\nRecent SAR imaging conducted by the Malanga–Biondi–Mei research team has revealed\ndeep vertical anomalies beneath the Giza Plateau, along with subterranean voids\nand anomalous channels extending across the necropolis [1]. We interpret these features\nas remnants of a water-driven actuator network capable of meeting the logistical demands\nof a 20-year construction timeline, delivering more than 200 blocks per day with precision\nand repeatability.\nThis reinterpretation recasts architectural elements such as the Osiris Shaft and granite\nsarcophagi as engineered hydrostatic components—pressure reservoirs and buoyant\nfloats—offering testable alternatives where funerary explanations fall short. This accounts\nfor structural overengineering, the absence of remains, and the lack of ritual artifacts within\nthe Great Pyramid.\nThe hypothesis also extends beyond construction, proposing post-functional utility\nthrough cyclic hydraulic discharge, potentially routed via the Sphinx as a terminal recovery\nbasin.

There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "Background A significant approach to enhancing children's health and addressing environmental disparities in metropolitan regions of the United States has emerged: schoolyard greening. The advantages of physical activity and well-being are increasingly recognized; nevertheless, the wider ramifications for community dynamics, social equality, and the risks of green gentrification remain poorly comprehended.\nPurpose This review carefully assesses the evidence about the impact of schoolyard greening efforts on children's health, neighborhood transformation, and the equitable distribution of benefits and risks across diverse urban communities.\nMethods A comparative literature analysis was performed to synthesize findings from quantitative studies, qualitative research, and case analyses specifically addressing schoolyard greening projects in prominent U.S. cities.\nResults Evidence consistently indicates that schoolyard greening positively influences children's socioemotional well-being and physical activity levels, while also enhancing the use of outdoor spaces. Increased unstructured play and student engagement correlate with renovation techniques that incorporate varied play areas and natural features. Nonetheless, the allocation of gains is uneven; educational institutions situated in rapidly evolving or affluent communities are more prone to improvements in infrastructure and accessibility. Furthermore, greening projects can act as drivers for neighborhood development, potentially leading to green gentrification processes that threaten the tenure of disadvantaged people and elevate property values. These results underscore the importance of context-sensitive and inclusive planning.\nConclusions Schoolyard greening can offer substantial health advantages for children and support the broader goals of urban sustainability. Nonetheless, these initiatives may exacerbate socioeconomic disparities and contribute to displacement patterns without intentional policies and community-driven strategies. To ensure the equitable distribution of schoolyard greening benefits, it is imperative that effective solutions emphasize equity, substantial community involvement, and the safeguarding of at-risk populations.",

          "authors": "Alejandra Recio Saucedo; Hazel Church; Beth Giddins",
          "abstract": "Background: Research on research (RoR), referred also as metascience, critically examines research practice. The rapid growth of RoR evidence highlights the need for funders and research organisations to work collaboratively to increase sharing evidence, decrease risk of duplication and research waste, and ultimately lead to better implementation of research. To address these needs, the RoR registry and community hub was established in 2021 to bring together national and international RoR communities and thus strengthen the impact of this evolving discipline within the broader research ecosystem.  The RoR registry and hub facilitates collaborative efforts among stakeholders dedicated to refining research practices. It aims to enhance the visibility of RoR studies, thus enabling the formation of research partnerships and promoting effective dissemination of evidence. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the registry's development and outlines the strategic activities implemented to drive its adoption within the research community. \n\nMethods: We utilised multiple methods to develop, grow and maintain the RoR registry. These consist of: a review of registries; creation of an advisory group; development of a web-based online registry of projects; conducting an online survey one year after launch to evaluate the performance of the RoR registry and hub; running two online events to first launch the registry and to showcase research registered on the platform; establishing Chatter sessions (online webinars on research on research topics); dissemination activities to promote the registry through publications and collaborations with publishers; and generating materials throughout the time the registry has been operating that reach multiple audiences. \n\nResults : The development of the registry took place between January 2020 and June 2021. The scope of registries that were available at the time informed the contents of the registry and especially, the questions that are asked at registration, ensuring a useful and still pragmatic mechanism to register work. An advisory board of experts provided strategic advice during the development phase. In parallel, a brand concept for the RoR registry and RoR team was co-developed. A video to explain the aim of the registry was co-created with a science communicator. An online launch event for the RoR registry and hub in June 2021 announced the registry to relevant communities (ror-hub.org) where a panel of experts discussed research on research and the role of this activity in the research ecosystem. A series of online webinars (Chatter sessions) were set up after the launch event where presenters led a discussion on topics of interest to the community, invited reflection and encouraged adoption of evidence to improve practice. The online evaluation survey of the registry and chatter sessions asked communities of interest about usefulness of the registry, benefits and challenges to engaging with the website and ways to increase its uptake. Forty-seven responses to the online survey were received. Five themes extracted through thematic analysis were: 1: Chatter sessions (two subthemes: management and topic coverage) 2: Registry outputs 3: Opportunities for improvement and collaboration 4: Promoting the registry 5: Reasons for not interacting with the registry. Findings of the evaluation highlighted the need for clearer communication about Chatter sessions with more notice and post-session materials, as well as more diverse topics like AI and bias in research.  Members suggested improvements to the registry itself, including better promotion, simpler study entry, and more engaging content like mini blogs to encourage wider use.  Finally, while many members found the registry through word-of-mouth, lack of time and awareness were cited as the main barriers to having greater interaction.\nIn May 2024, the RoR team organised an online research festival, ‘AI and research: a promising relationship?’, to celebrate the registry's first three years. The festival included a panel discussion on the role of artificial intelligence in research, including whether AI could reduce research bureaucracy and how AI could impact on research integrity and presentations from projects added to the registry. 107 participants from organisations in 28 countries, including research funders, universities, charities, hospitals and publishers worldwide logged on to the festival sessions, provided highly positive feedback on the relevance and usefulness of the topics discussed, the discussion and presentations.  \n\nReflections: This paper presents the development of the RoR registry and community hub, describing the process from initial idea to launch, subsequent evaluation and continuous dissemination to encourage its use for best research practices. The highlights of the virtual research festival hosted by the RoR team, which focused on the intersection of AI and research, showed the multiple ways in which the community around the registry has been established and how it is contributing to the research ecosystem. The next steps for the registry and hub include expansion of the registry by partnering with organisations conducting research on research activity; developing strategies to attract more users to the registry; and encourage active participation within the community hub, targeting outreach and continuously analysing the impact by tracking collaborations, measuring changes in research quality, or surveying users to gather feedback on the platform's effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Neoliberalism has found a willing and receptive environment in Ireland. The country is praised for its policies concerning deregulation, low taxation and importing direct foreign investment. However, the catastrophic economic crash in 2008/09 should have concluded this experiment, but it did not. This dissertation will examine the role of the Irish mass media in shaping attitudes toward neoliberal policies. By analysing the media’s reporting of the bailout and subsequent austerity and examining if alternatives were marginalised, this dissertation will seek to determine if the Irish media held, and continue to hold, pro-neoliberal biases. Drawing on theoretical and methodological approaches rooted in the critical-Marxist tradition, this work will conduct a qualitative content analysis of news articles in The Irish and Sunday Independent newspapers and The Irish Times. The assessment will explore the role of Ireland’s agenda-setting newspapers in shaping public discourse on the state’s economic policy response to the drastic failure of the private financial sector. It will also provide an understanding of how newspapers colluded with governments in setting the political and economic agendas.",

          "authors": "Steffen Wamsler; Gundula Zoch",
          "abstract": "Literature on crisis policymaking often assumes that government measures shape political trust. At the same time, we lack comprehensive evidence on how deep-seated regime socialisa-tion experiences affect crisis-related trust dynamics. We draw on Germany’s historical East-West divide and examine how changes in political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic relate to both regime socialisation and regional containment policies. Socialist socialisation should trigger a stronger initial rally-around-the-flag effect and a more pronounced decline of trust during later stages of stricter containment policies, with heterogenous effects according to the duration of regime socialisation. Using five waves of individual-level panel data (N=23,420, 2017-2023) and fixed-effects models with district-level infection rates and various policy re-strictions, we find a shared rally effect across East and West. Comparable trust declines in the second year were explained by regional containment policies. However, by the third year, in-stitutional trust in the East eroded further – without clear links to containment policies. Media trust, already lower in the East, revealed a growing divide as well. Finally, changes in trust varied by length of Socialist regime exposure. In the context of an extended crisis, our find-ings point to the limited capacity of crisis policy to explain trust dynamics when considering deep-seated socialisation.",

          "authors": "Justus Henke",
          "abstract": "Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive System of Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between institutional and organizational roles across three communica-tion modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios - citizen science and generative AI – the study demonstrates its potential for predicting non-linear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "En América Latina, existe un creciente consenso sobre el aumento de la diversidad religiosa en la región y la necesidad de reformar los modelos de laicidad tradicionales —históricamente diseñados para contrarrestar la hegemonía católica— en atención a dicha pluralidad. Este capítulo matiza y complejiza dicho diagnóstico rastreando la evolución de las direcciones de asuntos religiosos en México, desde las reformas legales de 1992 hasta las decisiones recientes del gobierno de López Obrador de colaborar con organizaciones interreligiosas en proyectos de construcción de paz. El capítulo examina cómo estas oficinas están vinculadas tanto a tensiones religiosas locales como a movimientos internacionales por la libertad religiosa, que redefinen la religión como categoría de gobernanza secular. Mediante observación participante, entrevistas, análisis multivariado e investigación de archivo, identifico patrones regionales en la implementación de políticas mexicanas sobre religión. Moldeadas por conflictos históricos entre católicos y protestantes-evangélicos, estas políticas relegan a minorías no cristianas que no se corresponden con concepciones dominantes sobre las “religiones del mundo”, pese a justificaciones que apelan a la diversidad. El capítulo destaca la subestimada influencia protestante en las leyes mexicanas y su papel en la configuración de estas oficinas. Ancladas en narrativas de paz, estas políticas fortalecen a ciertos grupos religiosos mientras marginan a otros, y marcan un giro hacia un secularismo de inspiración protestante en América Latina.",

          "abstract": "Despite their ubiquity, social media badging systems receive scant attention from digital platform researchers in media studies. Adopting a helicopter view, the paper seeks to stimulate research on badges by demonstrating that they are not simple gamified features, as generally understood, but critical infrastructures for the algorithmic governance of social interaction. Drawing from social theory, the paper reconceptualizes badges as automatable identification and verification credentials, making users predictable and governable, thus mediating identity and access to resources on a particular platform. This reconceptualization positions platforms’ badging as a crucial phase in the history of credentialing, shaping verification practices in digitized and datafied societies. The analysis of badging systems collected from secondary literature and industry sources shows how algorithmic logic has transformed badges into data-driven communicative devices. The paper concludes by discussing how platform badging practices increase the quantity, granularity, and rigidity of the individual identity attributes being certified and verified.",

          "abstract": "Background: Urban greening projects often make people healthier and happier, but they also help gentrification happen. There has not been much research on how green gentrification affects health outcomes.\nPurpose: This scoping review looked at peer-reviewed studies that looked at how greening projects in neighborhoods that are becoming more affluent affect health, well-being, and health determinants like physical activity and affordable housing.\nMethods: A thorough review of the literature, which included searches in PubMed, JSTOR, and Google Scholar, found 15 empirical studies that met the criteria for inclusion. These studies looked at how people used green spaces, how much physical activity they did, how safe they felt, and how healthy they said they were.\nResults: Studies show that long-term, marginalized residents suffer harm by green gentrification in many ways, including feeling less connected to their community, feeling distant from green spaces, and, in many cases, using these areas less than newcomers.\nConclusions: There is not enough research in this area, so more studies need to be done on mental health and cardiovascular health indicators to improve the existing body of work. There is evidence that professionals in public health, urban planning, and parks can work together to make green spaces more useful and accessible for people who live in gentrifying neighborhoods and are not as well disconnected.",

          "authors": "Valentina Rotondi",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how summer school holidays are associated with parents’ happiness across 16 European countries. Using harmonized data from the European Social Survey (2023--2025) combined with detailed national school calendars, we compare the well-being of parents and non-parents interviewed during and outside the summer break. While non-parents show a clear seasonal increase in happiness, this boost is smaller for parents and virtually absent for mothers, particularly in countries with medium or long summer breaks. The gap widens with the number of children and remains after accounting for socio-demographic factors, household labor division, and time trends. Robustness checks, including models with country-specific year and month trends and placebo tests, confirm these patterns. Cross-country differences in the ``parental summer gap'' are substantial but are not related to macro-level factors such as GDP or family spending. These findings underscore the additional pressures associated with long summer breaks—especially for mothers—and highlight the potential value of policies that shorten school holidays, expand affordable childcare, and promote a fairer division of care work.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "Semiconductors have become central to geopolitical rivalry and national strategy. This article examines Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a paradigmatic case of institutional transformation in strategic industries. More than a technological leader, TSMC has emerged as an institutional mediator—navigating overlapping policy regimes, supply chain fragmentation, and diverging state agendas. Drawing on TSMC’s global expansion, especially its fabs in Arizona and Kumamoto, I show how firms are increasingly expected to perform quasi-sovereign functions: ensuring supply continuity, managing regulatory tensions, and absorbing geopolitical risk. I argue that prevailing discourses of “decoupling” and “reshoring” misdiagnose the problem, treating physical relocation as a proxy for strategic autonomy. Instead, I theorize institutional absorptive capacity as the foundation of long-term sovereignty: the ability of firms and states to learn, adapt, and coordinate across volatile environments. This requires shifting policy focus from industrial control to institutional design—investing in learning systems, governance capacity, and trust-based cooperation. TSMC’s trajectory thus signals a broader reconfiguration of state–firm boundaries and the emergence of a multipolar, narrative-driven political economy. The article concludes by outlining future research on cross-border institutional agency, strategic narrative construction, and techno-industrial governance beyond the U.S.–China binary.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate outputs that resemble introspection, including self-reference, epistemic modulation, and claims about their internal states. This study investigates whether such behaviors reflect consistent, underlying patterns or are merely surface-level generative artifacts.We evaluated five open-weight, stateless LLMs using a structured battery of 21 introspective prompts, each repeated ten times to yield 1,050 completions. These outputs were analyzed across four behavioral dimensions: surface-level similarity (token overlap via SequenceMatcher), semantic coherence (Sentence-BERT embeddings), inferential consistency (Natural Language Inference with a RoBERTa-large model), and diachronic continuity (stability across prompt repetitions). Although some models exhibited thematic stability, particularly on prompts concerning identity and consciousness, no model sustained a consistent self-representation over time. High contradiction rates emerged from a tension between mechanistic disclaimers and anthropomorphic phrasing. Following recent behavioral frameworks, we heuristically adopt the term pseudo-consciousness to describe structured yet non-experiential self-referential output in LLMs. This usage reflects a functionalist stance that avoids ontological commitments, focusing instead on behavioral regularities interpretable through Dennett’s intentional stance. The study contributes a reproducible framework for evaluating simulated introspection in LLMs and offers a graded taxonomy for classifying such reflexive output. Our findings carry significant implications for LLM interpretability, alignment, and user perception, highlighting the need for caution when attributing mental states to stateless generative systems based on linguistic fluency alone.",

          "abstract": "This research brief presents a methodological critique of the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), questioning the validity of this metric and arguing that it functions to uphold structural ableism in public health and healthcare. I establish first that the disability weights underlying the DALY are subjective social valuations of health states and are not valid measures of “the magnitude of health loss associated with specific health outcomes” as the Global Burden of Disease Study claims. I then document ableism throughout the assessment protocols used in creating the disability weights for the DALY at the levels of (a) selection of participants to complete the valuation, (b) description of health states for valuation, and (c) consideration of context where the valuation occurs. I conclude the research brief by examining two questions. First, why have the creators of the DALY and its champions positioned a subjective and ableist social valuation as rigorous science? And second, what does the widespread acceptance of the DALY across health disciplines reveal about the pervasiveness of structural ableism in health policy?",

          "abstract": "When does protest in one domain catalyze activism in another—and when does it divert potential activists from their own causes? Prior research on the diffusion of protest has overlooked how the collective beliefs of dormant populations—those not yet engaged in activism—may influence their participation. We argue that exposure to protest sends a dual signal—about both issues and tactics—and that its effects depend on tactic efficacy beliefs: shared beliefs about whether protest tactics can achieve social or political change. We theorize that exposure to protest produces a \"seesaw effect\": it redirects mobilization away from the focal cause in high-belief communities while activating protest participation in low-belief, previously dormant ones. We employ a shift-share instrument (SSIV) to estimate the causal impact of social movement mobilization exposure on real-world labor movement mobilization activity based on 2.6 million news stories across 14 social movements, and measure tactic efficacy beliefs using 1.6 million online posts from 29,000 rideshare drivers. Our conceptualization of tactic efficacy beliefs contributes by developing a novel explanation for the conditions under which protest spreads—or stalls—across issue domains.",

          "authors": "Mahshid Gorjian",
          "abstract": "1.1 Background\nParks and the greening of schoolyards are examples of urban green spaces that have been praised for their environmental, social, and economic benefits in cities all over the world. More studies show that living near green spaces is good for property values. However, there is still disagreement about how strong and consistent these effects are in different cities (Browning et al., 2023; Grunewald et al., 2024; Teo et al., 2023).\n1.2 Purpose\nThis systematic review is the first to bring together a lot of geographical and statistical information that links greening schoolyards to higher property prices, as opposed to just green space in general. By focusing on schoolyard-specific interventions, we find complex spatial, economic, and social effects that are often missed in larger studies of green space.\n1.3 Methods\nThis review followed the PRISMA guidelines and did a systematic search and review of papers that were published in well-known journals for urban studies, the environment, and real estate. The criteria for inclusion stressed the use of hedonic pricing or spatial econometric models to look at the relationship between urban green space and home values in a quantitative way. Fifteen studies from North America, Europe, and Asia met the requirements for inclusion (Anthamatten et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Mansur &amp; Yusuf, 2022).\n1.4 Results\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that the value of adjacent properties is enhanced by urban green space in a statistically significant manner. The magnitude of the benefit is contingent upon the socio-economic context, the form of green space, and\nthe size of the city (Gao &amp; Asami, 2021; Sajjad et al., 2021; Zhou &amp; Wang, 2021). The emphasis was on spatial heterogeneity and temporal trends, which implies that the distribution of benefits may not be equitable across localities (Kabisch &amp; Haase, 2021; Deng et al., 2022). Various methodologies, including spatial latency models, hedonic pricing, and GIS-based analysis, resulted in disparate results (Norzailawati et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2022).\n1.5 Conclusions\nSome studies show that urban green spaces can raise the value of homes, but how much and how fairly these benefits happen depends on the local situation, the layout of the city, and the city's policies. The review stresses how important it is to have standard measures and long-term studies to help make urban greening projects fair. This research adds to the theory of urban planning by looking at the hedonic value of green infrastructure on a small scale and critically examining the consequences of schoolyard greening on different groups of people. This gives us a new way to think about fair urban expansion.",

          "authors": "Anurag Kadel",
          "abstract": "This project presents a speculative design framework for digital self-awareness grounded in epistemic pluralism and regenerative design philosophy. In contrast to mainstream self-tracking technologies that simulate introspection through reductive behavioral metrics, this work explores how symbolic, narrative, and somatic dimensions can be meaningfully re-integrated into human-computer interaction. Building on Jungian psychology, Eastern non-dual philosophy, and somaesthetic design, the proposed Mirror of Becoming system introduces five architectural pillars: epistemic friction, archetypal mirroring, narrative reframing, somatic grounding, and non-dual reflexivity. These pillars form the basis of design probes that resist optimization logics and instead cultivate ambiguity, inner dialogue, and embodied self-awareness. Methodologically, the paper adopts a Reflexive Research through Design (RtD) approach, treating design as a site of philosophical and symbolic inquiry rather than solution delivery. The work builds on the author’s prior framework in Seeds of Sovereignty (2025), which critiques ontological monocultures in AI and HCI and advocates for plural, reflexive systems that support the unfolding of selfhood rather than its prediction or containment. This research contributes to ongoing conversations in HCI, speculative design, and psychology by proposing an alternative ontology for digital self-awareness—one that honors the unconscious, the unmeasurable, and the unfinished.",

However, while serious games have been widely studied, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games have received comparatively less research attention to date. Following a replicable PRISMA protocol, this systematic review seeks to address this gap by analyzing 13 studies selected from a pool of 129 publications published between 2015 and 2024. The review evaluates the effectiveness of COTS games in L2 vocabulary acquisition, their practical implications, learner perceptions, and associated limitations. Findings suggest that COTS games can foster meaningful vocabulary development and enhance learner engagement, particularly when thoughtfully integrated into pedagogical settings.",

          "authors": "Chris J Walsh",
          "abstract": "Why do people with similar experience, training, or intelligence make dramatically different decisions in the same situation? Traditional models, especially dual-process theories, frame this variation as a tension between fast intuition and slow analysis. But real-world decision-making reveals deeper complexity. The Dynamic Model of Cognitive Dominance (DMCD) offers a new framework: it proposes that human judgment emerges from a shifting competition between multiple cognitive systems, such as pattern recognition, working memory, probabilistic reasoning, emotional regulation, systems thinking, and more.\nRather than focusing on static traits or identifying one “correct” way to think, DMCD emphasises dominance, the idea that different systems rise to influence depending on the task, context, emotional state, and individual strengths. Sometimes this alignment supports good decisions. Other times, it leads to predictable errors when the dominant system is poorly matched to the situation.\nThis paper outlines the theoretical foundations of DMCD, supported by research across psychology, neuroscience, and real-world expertise. It introduces a method for profiling dominance patterns, explores how these patterns shift under stress or uncertainty, and offers practical applications for education, leadership, team design, and high-stakes fields like healthcare and agriculture.",
