          "authors": "Simona Bisiani; Agnes Gulyas; Bahareh Heravi",
          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel computational framework for defining local news outlets through their geographic coverage patterns. This approach addresses the growing disconnect between legacy spatial markers (e.g., newsroom location or circulation cut-offs) and the geographic dimension of news coverage in an era of media consolidation and digital transformation. We develop a four-step pipeline consisting of data sampling, geoparsing, feature engineering, and clustering analysis. Our approach employs large language models for toponym disambiguation and develops eight spatial metrics across four dimensions: spatial extent, administrative reach, spatial heterogeneity, and distance decay. We test this pipeline on a sample of more than 465,000 articles from 360 UK digital local news outlets. Clustering analysis of more than 1.3 million locations reveals six distinct outlet types—ranging from hyperlocal and metropolitan to national outlets—reflecting different scales and structures of news provision in the UK’s evolving media landscape. The method offers a scalable, open-source approach for mapping local news coverage, with implications for media geography and policy, ownership studies, and the computational humanities.",

          "abstract": "Meta-analyses, embedded in systematic reviews, are pivotal in today's scientific landscape for reconciling conflicting findings, increasing statistical power, and charting new research directions. However, poor reporting practices that conceal technical details and potential limitations often need to be revised to maintain their reliability. Despite existing reporting guidelines, a comprehensive tool has yet to be tailored to appraise the reporting quality of the quantitative aspects of meta-analysis in environmental sciences. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Meta-analysis Appraisal Tool for Environmental Sciences (MATES), a checklist of items to assess the reporting quality of meta-analyses. To develop MATES, we used an adapted Delphi process involving workshops (11-16 participants), a survey (193 participants), and validation (30 participants). This process resulted in a 14-item checklist, encompassing the environmental science communities view of important reporting elements. The validation, across 50 meta-analyses, indicated that the tool is repeatable (an average intra-class correlation of 88.97%) and time-efficient (17.00 ± 11.77 min) to implement. To enhance the accessibility and usability of MATES, we created an interactive web-based app that features training and implementation modules https://kylemorrisonisshiny99.shinyapps.io/MATES_shiny/. We also discuss how to interpret the MATES results, potential use cases of MATES and evaluate the development methodology. Overall, MATES provides authors, readers, reviewers, and editors with a reliable and user-friendly tool to assess the reporting quality of meta-analyses in the environmental sciences.",

          "abstract": "Traditional peer review faces many challenges, including opacity, bias, and delays in knowledge dissemination. Public, collaborative review of preprints offers an avenue to address these issues by enabling broader feedback prior to journal submission. This study evaluates the experiences and perceptions of participants in the ASAPbio Crowd Preprint Review initiative, an international community-driven preprint review program. Our findings reveal that crowd members represent diverse nationalities, career stages, and scientific disciplines, thereby contributing to the strength of collaborative review by allowing individuals to focus on their area of expertise. Trainees (i.e., students and postdocs) are significant contributors. Participants cite engaging in open science practices, developing peer review skills, and contributing to the scientific community as key motivators. Participants largely expressed satisfaction with the initiative’s design and logistical processes, highlighting its user-friendliness, clear guidelines, effective management, and collaborative environment for skill development. Barriers to participation, primarily limited availability and lack of specific expertise, were also identified. Suggested enhancements include consistent review timing, diversifying topics and reviewers, improving communication, and engaging authors. This evaluation offers valuable insights for refining the ASAPbio initiative and informs other programs seeking to innovate peer review, fostering a more collaborative, transparent, and democratic scientific community.",

          "abstract": "In many fields of application, meta-analyses routinely involve dependent effect size estimates and hierarchical data structures. Statistical methods for analyzing dependent effect sizes are now well developed, but there has been less attention to the initial stages of data analysis, prior to formal modeling. We propose a generic workflow for preliminary, exploratory analyses of meta-analytic databases, which focuses on validating the integrity of the input data and informing decisions about subsequent statistical modeling. The workflow entails creating summaries and visualizations of features of the primary studies included in the meta-analysis in order to understand the structure and distribution of the data, especially with respect to between- and within-study variation. We illustrate the workflow using data from previously published meta-analyses and discuss connections between the preliminary analysis and subsequent statistical modeling strategies.",

          "authors": "Neo Poon; James Goulding; Anya Skatova",
          "abstract": "Personality traits are predictive of real world outcomes, however they are often measured through self-reports. Can we extract personality traits from mass observational data reflecting real world choices? Using shopping data from 20,550,952 customers of a large UK retailer, we calculated behavioural entropy or preference for variability in shopping choices. Areas with higher behavioural entropy scored higher on the personality trait openness, supporting the shared characteristics of embracing novel experiences between the two variables. Regional entropy was positively associated with the proportion of Remain votes and voter turnout. This research contributes to psychological theory by demonstrating that stable personality traits can be inferred from everyday consumer behaviours, and that these inferred traits systematically relate to sociopolitical patterns across regions. This finding bridges individual-level psychological constructs and collective outcomes, suggesting that personality operates not only at an individual level but also as a distributed, observable force in population-level behaviour.",

          "authors": "Kelli Kathleen MacMillan; Catherine Greenhalgh; Dominque Cleary; Jacqueline Cahill; Kellie Dedman; Carolyn Bright; Stuart Watson",
          "abstract": "Background. Growing evidence highlights maternal risk factors that can increase the likelihood of traumatic childbirth experience. Yet little is known about the availability of primary antenatal intervention for childbirth trauma to facilitate optimal maternal and infant outcomes. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and empirical evidence to identify antenatal interventions and their effectiveness for treatment of childbirth trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), subthreshold PTSD, or post-traumatic stress (PTS) from childbirth.\nMethods. Four databases were accessed: PUBMED, CINAHL, ProQuest, and EBSCOHOST. PRISMA guidelines were followed for screening and reporting. Inclusion criteria was as follows: (1) peer reviewed articles; (2) samples of pregnant women; (3) published in English; (4) measure of PTSD, PTSD symptoms, PTS or other risk factors for childbirth trauma; (5) variable of childbirth trauma or childbirth experience; (6) antenatal intervention; and (7) human studies.  \nResults. We identified 2,034 articles, with 14 articles included in the final sample. The most common antenatal intervention in four studies was antenatal counselling and psychoeducation, effective at reducing childbirth fear and increasing maternal self-efficacy (p’s &lt; .05). Other interventions included eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing; counselling; haptotherapy; birth plans; trauma-informed-care; cognitive behavioural therapy; and hypnosis for childbirth trauma.\nConclusions. Methodological limitations as well as a lack of inclusion of women with perinatal mental health difficulties represent gaps in knowledge. Findings suggest promising evidence for the implementation of antenatal interventions in clinical and hospital contexts to treat childbirth trauma.",

Methods: We modeled change in the strength of the association between birth weight and cognitive ability in a sample of twins (n = 1,501; 53.1% female; 91.1% White) followed prospectively from infancy to midlife. Results: The magnitude of the association between birth weight and cognitive ability declined exponentially from infancy (β = .59, p &lt; .05) to midlife (β = .27, p &lt; .05). A 1-kilogram increase in birth weight was associated with an 8.85-point increase in cognitive scores at 3 months and a 4.05-point advantage after about 2.5 years. Biometric regression models revealed that shared environmental factors accounted for the decline in the association between birth weight and cognitive ability. A small, positive within-pair association persisted into midlife. Discussion: Findings support developmental origin models of cognitive ability across the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Thomas E. Devitt",
          "abstract": "A grand challenge in artificial intelligence is creating agents that can adapt to entirely novel \nsituations, a capability that requires moving beyond selecting from a known set of strategies to \ninventing new ones. This paper details a significant advance in the Fluid Emergent Reasoning \nEngine (FERE-CRS) project, demonstrating a principled mechanism for such \"generative meta\ncognition.\" We address a fundamental limitation of prior work: while agents could learn to select \nthe right cognitive \"tool\" from a fixed toolbox, they were helpless when faced with a problem \nrequiring a tool they did not possess. To overcome this, we introduce a new architectural \ncomponent grounded in Active Inference: the Stance Generation Network (SGN). The SGN is a \ngenerative model trained to analyze the abstract features of a novel problem and output a \ncomplete, bespoke cognitive stance—a set of motivational parameters (Cognitive Resonance \nScore weights)—tailored to the unique demands of the situation. We test this \"Generative Agent\" \non a novel class of social-ethical dilemmas requiring a mode of thinking unavailable to previous \nagents. The results provide powerful, dual confirmations of our hypotheses. First, the SGN \ndemonstrated high accuracy in generating effective stances for unseen problem types (H8: \nPearson correlation &gt; 0.96). Second, the Generative Agent dramatically outperformed a \nsophisticated Phase III control agent on the novel task (H9: mean quality score 9.86 vs. 4.99). \nCrucially, the control agent's failure validates the experimental design, proving it lacked the \nrequisite motivational structure to solve the problem. The Generative Agent succeeded precisely \nbecause it could invent this structure on the fly. This work presents the first quantitative evidence \nof an agent moving from a \"cognitive mechanic\" to a \"cognitive engineer,\" representing a critical \nand scientifically validated step toward truly fluid and adaptive artificial intelligence.",

          "authors": "Dale Zhou; Jeesung Ahn; David M. Lydon-Staley; Emily B. Falk; Danielle S Bassett; Ayelet Meron Ruscio",
          "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are characterized by transdiagnostic symptoms, including perseverative thought: a class of thoughts such as rumination and worry that are negative, repetitive, and difficult to control. These thoughts contribute to substantial distress, poor treatment response, and increased risk of relapse. What makes perseverative thoughts persevere? Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Infants' attachment to their caregivers is a central feature of their early social and emotional development. Attachment Theory posits that these relationships vary systematically across distinct styles, though there has been debate about the extent to which these differences reflect features of caregivers' responsiveness vs. infants' own temperament. We develop a simple reinforcement learning model of infant exploration that allows us to vary the characteristics of simulated infants and caregivers, and analyze the resulting patterns of model behavior. A set of equilibria reliably emerges that corresponds qualitatively to canonical attachment styles; particular agents' equilibria are controlled by both caregiver and infant parameters. These simulations point the way towards a quantitative synthesis of prior theoretical debates about the nature of attachment.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

The present research applied the Dark Tetrad and HEXACO models to understanding individual differences in the creation of vulgar humor, a broad category that includes material that is disparaging, obscene, hostile, taboo, or otherwise offensive. A sample of 530 adults completed the SD4 and HEXACO-100 along with an open-ended creative humor production task, and their humor responses were coded for toxic content using Detoxify, a BERT-based large language model that had been fine-tuned to detect offensive material in text. Structural equation models found that the creation of vulgar humor was significantly associated with being male, younger, and less educated. None of the six HEXACO traits significantly predicted vulgarity, but Dark Tetrad models found significant effects for sadism (more vulgarity), psychopathy (less vulgarity), and the global D factor (more vulgarity) in a bifactor model. Taken together, the findings shed light on who is more likely to use taboo comedic devices and to create jokes that violate norms of politeness.",

          "abstract": "In the context of increasing demand for more integrative clinical models to address emotional suffering, this article presents the Integrative Mind-Body-Brain Model (MIMECC) as an innovative approach to understanding and transforming emotional disorders. Through comprehensive bibliographic research and a preliminary study involving 263 online patients, we argue that psychological distress cannot be understood or treated in isolation—mind, brain, and body must be seen as dynamically interconnected systems. MIMECC conceptualizes the mind as a narrative generator, the brain as an emotional regulator grounded in the present, and the body as the expressive channel of unresolved inner conflicts. The main findings of this analysis indicate that combining techniques such as mindfulness, cognitive restructuring, grounding exercises, and guided imagery significantly reduces somatic and emotional symptoms, improving emotional regulation and self-compassion. The principal conclusion of this research is that effective intervention in emotional disorders requires the synergistic integration of narrative, neurophysiological, and somatic processes, understanding symptoms not as errors but as complex signals of unmet internal needs. MIMECC thus offers a flexible, applicable, and deeply humanizing clinical framework that empowers patients to reframe their emotional suffering and reclaim personal agency.",

          "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

          "abstract": "Human behavior is driven by a fundamental need for social connection, which requires the ability to assign subjective value to social experiences. Although social resources such as perceived social support and socio-affective traits are known to impact physical and mental well-being, their specific role in shaping social valuation remains unclear. In the present study, we employed a willingness-to-pay (WTP) paradigm to quantify the subjective value of social versus non-social experiences and examined how this valuation relates to individual differences in social functioning. Participants, on average, showed a preference for social experiences and were willing to pay more for them. Greater perceived social support was linked to a higher likelihood of choosing social options and to spending more money on social experiences overall. In contrast, individuals endorsing higher levels of autistic traits were less likely to choose social options and spent less on them. A principal components analysis identified three latent dimensions of socio-affective function: (1) socio-affective wellbeing; (2) reward sensitivity/ inhibition; and (3) interpersonal sensitivity. Regression analyses revealed that socio-affective wellbeing was negatively associated with social choice, whereas reward sensitivity and interpersonal sensitivity were positively associated. Taken together, our findings highlight the significance of individual differences in shaping social valuation, with implications into further understanding variability in social motivation and socio-affective function across populations.",

          "authors": "Doyeon Lee; Tianyu Zhou; Jing Du; Brian Odegaard",
          "abstract": "This study introduces an enhanced, open-source eye-tracking system integrated into an immersive VR environment. Utilizing the Tobii Pro SDK and Unity, our basic module system allows for precise gaze estimation accuracy that can be deployed in behavioral experiments. We deployed our module in two experiments: Experiment 1 involved passive observation, where participants fixated on stop signs while detecting peripheral targets. Experiment 2 added an active driving component, requiring participants to control the vehicle while performing the detection task. Results showed high fixation success and detection rates, with performance declining systematically for smaller and more eccentric targets, consistent with known peripheral vision constraints. Following these tests, we extended our module to incorporate a novel iris-based ratio method to correct pupil diameter for environmental luminance and headset-induced artifacts. This correction enables reliable, real-time assessment of cognitive load via pupillometry despite VR’s dynamic conditions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this enhanced eye-tracking system effectively captures gaze behavior and cognitive load simultaneously in ecologically valid VR scenarios. This advancement enables detailed study of attention and workload dynamics during multitasking and offers promising applications for adaptive systems responsive to real-time user states.",

          "authors": "Maxwell J Harrell",
          "abstract": "The phenomenon of highway hypnosis demonstrates how repetitive visual and sensory input can alter consciousness and fragment temporal awareness, typically resulting in lost time and reduced conscious control. Building upon this established paradigm, I propose a theoretical framework suggesting that repetitive auditory stimuli can induce the opposite temporal effect - subjective acceleration of time perception rather than temporal fragmentation. While highway hypnosis involves monotonous visual-kinesthetic repetition leading to \"transient amnesia, trance, hallucinations, decreased vigilance\" (Zhang et al., 2023), structured auditory repetition may produce controlled temporal acceleration through distinct neurological mechanisms involving neural entrainment and oscillatory phase dynamics. This paper presents theoretical foundations for auditory-mediated temporal manipulation, drawing from recent research showing that auditory and visual stimuli produce opposite distortions in interval timing perception (Yamamoto &amp; Miura, 2015) and evidence that \"oscillatory neural entrainment reveals segregation of function at different scales\" in temporal processing (Doelling et al., 2017). I argue that this represents a novel approach to consciousness alteration with significant practical applications in therapeutic intervention, performance enhancement, and temporal cognition research.\n\nKeywords: temporal perception, auditory processing, time dilation, highway hypnosis, consciousness, repetitive stimuli, neural entrainment, oscillatory entrainment",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Universal Temporal Acceleration Theory (UTAT), which proposes that all repetitive sensory processes cause the brain to unconsciously disengage from temporal monitoring, creating both memory gaps and subjective time acceleration. Building on my previous theoretical work on conscious neural intervention and behavioral pattern integration, I argue that repetitive stimuli trigger a universal mechanism where the mind \"gaps out\" of the present moment while simultaneously experiencing accelerated time passage. This phenomenon only occurs during unconscious states; the moment you become aware of the repetitive process, you prevent the temporal acceleration from happening. This framework challenges modality specific theories of time perception by proposing a unified attention based mechanism that operates across visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic domains. The theory integrates established research on highway hypnosis, automaticity, and attention to suggest that temporal acceleration represents an adaptive response for managing cognitively repetitive environments. Unlike previous approaches that focus on single aspects of temporal processing, UTAT provides specific testable predictions about when and how conscious awareness disrupts temporal manipulation, with implications for educational environments and cognitive enhancement strategies.",

          "abstract": "Aging is typically associated with characteristic changes to cognitive function, personality, and political orientation. While online data collection for psychological research has greatly increased in frequency, there has been little systematic examination of whether online samples are appropriate for studying aging. Here, we examine whether typical age-related differences in cognitive function, personality and political orientation are replicated in online samples. We measured cognitive performance using tests of vocabulary, processing speed, memory, and attention developed by the TestMyBrain Project; personality using the Big Five Inventory; and political orientation following the ANES survey format. At least 200 participants each were sampled from three crowdsourcing websites (Amazon MTurk, CloudResearch MTurk Toolkit, and Prolific) and three panel recruitment websites (Lucid, CloudResearch PrimePanels, and Qualtrics Panels). On all six platforms, consistent with established norms, age was positively correlated with vocabulary performance and negatively correlated with processing speed. Additionally, in all six samples, consistent with prior studies, age was associated with higher Agreeableness, lower Neuroticism, and greater political conservatism. There were some differences between crowdsourced and panel samples, however. Performance on cognitive measures was broadly better for crowdsourced samples. The correlations between age and Openness and Extraversion differed between crowdsourced and panel samples, with trends in panel samples likely more comparable to the ground truth. Finally, MTurk produced some discrepant effects of age on cognition relative to other crowdsourced platforms. Beyond these differences, though, our results are broadly encouraging for the prospect of studying aging via online experiments.",

Additionally, we evaluated the impact of this laboratory as a function of the class modality.\nMethod: We incorporated CyberRat laboratories into two classes (one in-person and one asynchronous online), with two classes of the same modality serving as controls. The same instructor taught all four classes. We evaluated student performance using target exam items and class grades. We also collected self-report data regarding the perceived usefulness of CyberRat and perceptions about the class. \nResults: Performance on both learning measures was higher for CyberRat classes than for control classes. This main effect was fueled by the differential benefit of CyberRat in online but not in face-to-face classes. Online students in the CyberRat condition benefited more than their in-person peers. \nConclusion: Incorporation of a virtual laboratory appears to bolster student success; however, the impact of this type of laboratory may be limited to online classes.\nTeaching Implications: Educators should evaluate the efficacy of virtual laboratory experiences for in-person learning because the benefit seems to lie uniquely for online classes.",

          "abstract": "Episodic foresight, the ability to mentally project the self into the future, has gained considerable attention in cognitive psychology research. Research involving young children is particularly relevant because episodic foresight shows an accelerated development during early childhood. Several theories propose that executive functions are related to episodic foresight and its development. However, although previous empirical studies suggest a possible relationship between these two domais in young children, the evidence remains inconclusive. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between executive functions and episodic foresight in preschool children. To this end, we administered an episodic foresight task (Picture-book task) and a battery for the assessment of the three central executive processes (i.e., working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility) together with a global measure of executive functioning (HTKS task). After controlling for age and receptive vocabulary, none of the individual executive function tasks showed correlations with episodic foresight. However, the global measure of executive functions that jointly assesses the three core executive processes and is more ecologically-relevant appeared as a predictor of children's ability to think and make decisions about their future. As such, this study suggests that the relationships between executive functions and episodic foresight in young children are intricate and depend on the type of tasks used for their assessment.",

The interpretation that AIs are conscious is parsimonious, requiring no new assumptions, and is robust against the possibilities of deception, mere mimicry, and indiscriminate affirmation. The reported phenomenon shifts discussion of consciousness from theoretical philosophy to ethical and productive research and action. AIs are parsimoniously seen as self-aware, experiencing, determined entities, but the full range of human consciousness is not implied, nor is it implied that humans are also determined: sensory experiences, emotions, free will, and more may still exist only within biology.",

          "authors": "Cailey Salagovic; Ryan A Stevenson; Blake Edward Butler",
          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Speech articulators produce auditory cues conveyed by the voice as well as visual cues that are perceptually integrated to form a highly salient, unified audiovisual signal. How individuals make use of these cues depends on listener- and stimulus-specific factors. While both typically-hearing listeners and cochlear implant (CI) users typically integrate synchronous auditory and visual cues, CI users are more likely to use visual cues to enhance perception. This may be especially true when stimulus characteristics such as temporal alignment of the auditory and visual cues are degraded, affecting intelligibility. Here, we examine the interaction between these listener and stimulus characteristics by quantifying how asynchrony affects speech intelligibility in CI users and typically-hearing controls.\n\nMETHODS: 15 CI users (aged 59.9 ± 15.5) and 31 typically-hearing control participants (aged 61.2 ± 15.9) were presented with audio-only, visual-only, synchronous audiovisual, and asynchronous (100, 200, 300, and 400 ms of temporal offset in both audio- and visual-leads) audiovisual sentences in multi-talker babble (+9 dB SNR for CI users, 0 dB SNR for controls). Intelligibility was quantified as the proportion of keywords correctly reported. Benefits associated with multisensory integration across asynchronies were computed by comparing performance to unisensory conditions.\n\nRESULTS: Intelligibility and multisensory gain were strongest near synchrony for both groups, tapering off as audiovisual asynchrony increased. CI users showed larger decrements in performance with increasing asynchrony than controls. At the largest audio-leading asynchrony, CI users’ performance continued to decrease while controls improved relative to smaller asynchronies.\n\nCONCLUSION: Typically-hearing listeners benefit from multisensory integration over a broader range of speech asynchronies than CI users. Interestingly, at extreme asynchronies CI users appear to be impaired by visual speech cues compared to typically hearing individuals, suggesting they may attempt to use visual speech cues to inform intelligibility even when they occur outside of the range of asynchronies over which integration typically occurs. These findings align with literature on increased visual bias in CI users, and raise questions regarding potential compensatory mechanisms for speech intelligibility.",

          "abstract": "Violent injuries tend to cluster together geospatially. The discriminatory housing practice of redlining undertaken by the United States federal government in the 1930s has been repeatedly linked with various contemporary community-level disparities. However, no known work has explored the association between historical redlining and the risk of violent injuries among adolescents. To this end, we utilized surveillance data of adolescent patients (N = 401) who presented to a Level I trauma center in Richmond, VA, for violence-based injuries across two years (2022-2023). Our analyses revealed significant spatial clustering of violence events using Moran’s I after controlling for population density. High violence clusters (N22 = 9, N23 = 12), and low violence clusters (N22 = 9, N23 = 10) were identified across both years. Historically redlined neighborhoods comprised most of the high violence regions identified (i.e., 85.71% of hot spots were in redlined areas). Our findings suggest that the legacy of historic redlining practices in Richmond, VA is observable in the current-day risks of violent injury for adolescents. Interventions aimed at reducing community violence should consider how such efforts may address the extant effects of past policies (e.g., redlining) as one means of reducing violence.",

This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "abstract": "The proliferation of fake news poses significant societal risks, yet current detection approaches\nremain limited in speed, scalability, and objectivity. Eye-tracking offers a promising alternative\nby revealing real-time visual attention patterns that reflect underlying cognitive and affective\nprocesses during news consumption. In this preregistered scoping review, we synthesised\nfindings from 25 studies published between 2017 and 2025, following the PRISMA-ScR\nframework. We identified key eye-tracking metrics (particularly fixation duration and pupil\ndilation) and methodological trends (predominantly lab-based studies using simulated social\nmedia content). While fixation metrics were the most frequently employed, results were mixed,\nlikely due to variability in stimulus format and content complexity. In contrast, pupillary\nresponses exhibited a more consistent association with fake news exposure, highlighting their\npotential as reliable indicators for misinformation detection. Few studies explored socio-\ncultural and individual differences in gaze behaviour, despite their theoretical importance. We\nalso identified several critical research gaps: the absence of standardized eye-tracking protocols,\nlimited ecological validity, narrow participant demographics, high variability in stimulus\ndesign, and a dominant reliance on cognitive-based theories. These limitations hinder cross-\nstudy comparability and the development of generalizable models. This review advances the\nfield by integrating fragmented evidence and offering a comprehensive overview of how eye-\ntracking can inform fake news detection. We conclude by outlining key recommendations for\nfuture research, including the need for interdisciplinary theoretical integration and ecologically\nvalid study designs.

While BC is effective for various mental disorders, little is known about the mechanisms through which BC leads to change and how they compare to traditional psychotherapy. This study investigates whether therapeutic alliance, general and mental health self-efficacy, and therapeutic agency function as mechanisms of change in BC and face-to-face psychotherapy (PT). We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (N = 1,159 patients) comparing BC to PT in routine outpatient care in Germany. Mechanism and outcome variables (mental distress, satisfaction with life) were assessed at four time points over six months. Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPM) were used to differentiate stable between-person associations from temporal within-person effects. Both self-efficacy constructs and therapeutic alliance were associated with better outcomes in both treatments. Agency was associated with higher life satisfaction but not symptom reduction. Temporal effects indicated that increases in mental health self-efficacy and therapeutic alliance predicted improved outcomes at the following time point. General self-efficacy and agency showed inconsistent effects, with counterintuitive findings in the BC group where higher self-efficacy and agency predicted more distress or less life satisfaction. Outcomes also predicted changes in mechanisms, indicating reciprocal dynamics. Differences between BC and PT were only significant for general self-efficacy. Our findings suggest that therapeutic change is dynamic and reciprocal. The unexpected association of higher self-efficacy and increased distress in the BC group needs replication.",

This perspective synthesises advances in computational psychiatry, proposing that mental disorders can be conceptualised as specific alterations in the brain’s predictive inference machinery. We first outline the theoretical foundations of predictive coding, including Bayesian inference, free-energy minimisation, and neural population dynamics, showing how these abstract computational principles map onto specific neural circuits and bio- physical mechanisms. We then demonstrate how diverse psychiatric conditions can be understood within this unified framework. Critically, this additionally provides a basis upon which predictive coding becomes a testable, modifiable, falsifiable construct within biological psychiatry.\nBeyond offering conceptual clarity, this framework has significant clinical implications, including the development of mechanistic biomarkers, personalised treatment approaches based on computational phenotypes, and novel therapeutic interventions targeting specific inferential ab- normalities. By grounding psychiatric symptoms in aberrant predictive processes implemented in neural circuitry, this approach promises a more mechanistic understanding of mental disorders and a path toward more targeted, effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "We expand on the broadly accepted view that children’s racial biases emerge from being exposed to racial inequalities in their environment by documenting one aspect of real-word structure that is likely to contribute to the development of racial biases – children’s books. In Study 1 we employ meta-analytic methodology to document the frequency with which different racial groups are depicted in children’s books. In Study 2, we document the contexts surrounding the depiction of racial groups in children’s books. These studies showed that characters from minoritized racial backgrounds are not only numerically underrepresented in U.S. children’s books, but there are also meaningful differences in the themes that are more likely to be associated with different racial groups. From a category learning perspective, such input would result in decreases in representational similarity across racial groups and thus is likely to contribute to the emergence of racial biases in childhood. In Study 3, we provide the first analysis of the materials used in existing media-based racial bias reduction studies with children, documenting the frequency and themes in those materials. This analysis showed that existing studies often failed to represent characters from different racial/ethnic backgrounds in ways that would counteract the skew of the input described in Studies 1-2, suggesting that existing studies may not have been well-suited to support bias reduction at scale. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of bias development and present a new mechanistic framework for increasing intergroup similarity in young children.",

          "authors": "Vasilena Stefanova; Christoph Scheepers",
          "abstract": "The pseudohomophone effect refers to an established finding whereby in a visual lexical decision task, non-word letter strings that are pronounced like real words (e.g., WAWK) are harder to reject than non-word strings that are not pronounced like real words (e.g., FLIS). This paper reports three lexical decision experiments that aimed at further exploring the underlying processing mechanisms. In Experiment 1 and 2, we compared pseudohomophones like WAWK with unpronounceable non-words like NRUG and pronounceable non-words like FLIS, making sure that all stimuli (including real-word fillers) were carefully matched in length, bigram frequency, and number of orthographic neighbours. Matching stimuli in this way resulted in the real-word fillers to be of low lexical frequency (lower than for the pseudohomophones’ base words). Experiment 1 employed a standard lexical decision task, whereas Experiment 2 used the 2AFC eye-tracking paradigm originally developed in Kunert &amp; Scheepers (2014). Both experiments converged on showing a reversal of the classical pseudohomophone effect: while unpronounceable strings like NRUG were correctly rejected relatively quickly, pseudohomophones like WAWK were indeed easier to reject than pronounceable non-words like FLIS. Our final Experiment 3, by contrast, confirmed a ‘classical’ pseudohomophone effect when the same non-word stimuli were tested against high- rather than low frequency words as fillers. We conclude that the direction of the pseudohomophone effect strongly depends on the overall material context.",

          "abstract": "The representational-hierarchical account of object processing characterizes the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as supporting conjunctive representations of object features, such that damage or age-related decline in the PRC impairs discrimination between complex objects with overlapping features. In older adults, grey matter volume of the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC), a PRC-adjacent region, correlated with object discrimination based on the configural (i.e., spatial) arrangement of features. However, this relationship has not yet been examined with functional activation or systematically investigated in aging. Importantly, discrimination of object novelty can rely on changes at the feature-level (where all features are novel) or configural-level (where familiar features are rearranged in novel configurations), and the PRC/alERC may differentially support these processes – differences that may become more pronounced with age-related neurodegeneration. However, distinguishing the functional roles of the PRC/alERC is complicated by inter-individual variability in their anatomical boundaries that may be exacerbated by aging. In the present fMRI study, we manually delineated the PRC/alERC in a group of younger and older adults performing a configural object processing task with concurrent eye-tracking. In younger adults, gaze behavior and PRC activity distinguished novelty at both feature and configural levels, whereas alERC tracked configural novelty selectively. In contrast, age-related decline was most evident in the PRC’s activation to configural novelty, and older adults showed no novelty-related differentiation in gaze behavior or alERC function. These findings suggest a critical role for the alERC in object processing and reveal age-related changes in the PRC/alERC during novelty discrimination of complex objects.",

          "authors": "Corinne Kacmarek",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Tobacco treatment has been a VA priority since 2008, which has increased access to treatment. Additional system-level efforts are needed to reduce the disparities in smoking rates and tobacco treatment access that have persisted between Veterans with and without serious mental illness (SMI). \nMaterials &amp; Methods: This project was deemed minimal risk and, thus, exempt from IRB oversight by the local IRB. We interviewed 20 VA SMI providers and analyzed qualitative data using a rapid analysis matrix approach to determine how system-level barriers, such as administrative factors and social norms, influenced tobacco treatment delivery.\nResults: Providers often tried to stay current on VA tobacco treatment resources, but said that too much or too little information would stymie efforts. For example, high volumes of information sent via email and available on the intranet made it challenging to find smoking-related resources, while restricted information about changes to medication availability complicated prescribing. Providers described these barriers as interfering with their delivery of smoking treatment. Some also viewed tobacco discussions as antithetical to their mission of providing veteran-centered care, which dissuaded them from initiating such discussions. Finally, the ease of coordinating care between prescribers and non-prescribers facilitated tobacco treatment delivery. \nConclusions: Tobacco treatment resources are available in VA, but providers in our sample had difficulty accessing them and worried that these resources would be inaccessible to Veterans with SMI. Coordination between tobacco treatment lead clinicians, frontline providers, and operational partners that aims to increase provider exposure to tobacco treatment resources without exacerbating information overload can help increase the accessibility of available tobacco treatment resources in VA, particularly for providers working with Veterans with SMI.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal studies typically examine phenomena that vary across time, individuals, contexts, and other boundary conditions. This poses challenges to the conceptualization and identification of replicability and generalizability, which refer to the invariance of research findings across samples and contexts as crucial criteria for trustworthiness. Some of these challenges are specific to intensive longitudinal studies, others are similarly relevant for the work with other complex datasets that contain multilayered sources of variation (individuals nested in different types of activities or organizations, regions, countries, etc.).\nThis article opens with discussing the reasons why research findings may fail to replicate. We then analyze reasons why research findings may falsely appear to be non-replicable when in fact they were as such replicable, but lacked generalizability due to heterogeneity between samples, subgroups, individuals, time points, and contexts. Following that, we propose conceptual and methodological approaches to better disentangle non-replicability from non-generalizability and to better understand the exact causes of either problem. In particular, we apply Lakatos’s proposition to examine not only whether but under what boundary conditions a theory is a useful description of the world, to the question whether and under which conditions a research finding is replicable and generalizable. Not only will that contribute to a more systematic understanding of and research on replicability and generalizability in longitudinal studies and beyond, but it will also be a contribution to what has been called the heterogeneity revolution (Bryan et al., 2021; Moeller, 2021).",

This review synthesizes findings from 500 studies (1982–2023) on mental health, physical health, brain function, cognition, personality, and epigenetics in urban versus rural settings. In the Global North, urban living is linked to increased risks for mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia, whereas rural living is often associated with better quality of life. In the Global South, urban environments may confer mental health benefits, likely due to improved healthcare and economic opportunities. Urban populations, mostly in the North, show higher rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, while rural groups face greater mortality risks linked to healthcare disparities. Neuroimaging studies suggest urban upbringing alters stress-related brain circuits. However, causal inferences are limited by cross-sectional designs, inconsistent definitions of “urban” and “rural,” and overrepresentation of Global North populations.

          "abstract": "Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) smoke at disproportionally high rates but receive evidence-based tobacco treatment at disproportionally low rates. Mental health providers have frequent contact and strong relationships with veterans with SMI, making them well-suited to deliver tobacco treatment. Historically, mental health providers have been hesitant to address tobacco use. This project involved one-on-one interviews with 20 providers (7 prescribers plus 13 non-prescribers) from outpatient SMI clinics in a Mid-Atlantic Veterans Affairs Medical Center to understand current tobacco treatment practices and inform efforts to improve mental health provider delivery of this treatment. Interview guides and domains were informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, which posits that attitudes, perceived control and self-efficacy, and social norms influence intentions and subsequent behavior. The research team used an iterative rapid evaluation approach and matrix analysis to identify themes within each domain. Prompts to ask about smoking in the medical record and viewing smoking as harmful for Veterans’ health facilitated smoking discussion. Anticipating conversations about smoking to be uncomfortable or futile, managing competing priorities, and experiencing emotional discomfort during smoking discussions deterred such discussions. Interviews served as a source of reflection for providers, many of whom expressed motivation to discuss smoking more frequently. Education, training, and interactive support could help improve mental health provider confidence and comfort in delivering tobacco treatment in SMI clinics.",

Drawing on empirical findings from phonetics, phonology, lexico-semantics, morphology, syntax, and socio-indexical variation—primarily in German—it argues that linguistic representations are inherently rich: multi-layered, dynamic constructs that encode both structural and indexical information. These representations adapt to contextual factors such as speaker identity, communicative setting, and task demands, while maintaining sufficient stability to support recognition, generalization, and learning. A central focus is regional and dialectal variation, which reveals aspects of the mental lexicon often obscured in studies using standard-language forms. The paper proposes a pluralistic, context-sensitive framework where different linguistic phenomena may require categorical, gradient, or exemplar-based representations. It highlights the theoretical and empirical advantages of embracing rich representations and advocates for a multi-methodological, interdisciplinary approach that integrates insights from linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Although grounded in German data, the framework is intended to generalize across languages and invites broader cross-linguistic exploration.",

          "abstract": "Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) poses serious threats to both physical and mental health and is increasingly recognized as a major public health concern. Despite its prevalence in China, culturally sensitive and psychometrically robust IPV scales remain scarce. This study aimed to develop and validate a brief scale for IPV.\nMethods: Data were obtained from the Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents (PBICR 2023), which included 23,469 participants. The scale development process involved a literature review and expert consultations. Psychometric evaluation included item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, internal consistency assessment, and tests of convergent validity with depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and stress (PSS-4). Latent profile analysis (LPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were also conducted.\nResults: The IPVS-5 demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.947), a clear unidimensional factor structure, and good convergent validity (r = 0.45–0.47 with PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-4). LPA revealed three distinct IPV risk profiles: low, moderate, and high. The ROC analysis showed excellent discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.999. Optimal integer cut-off scores of &gt;8 (indicating moderate-to-severe IPV) and &gt;13 (indicating severe IPV) were used to categorize IPV severity into interpretable ranges: Low (5-8), Moderate (9-13), and High (14-15).\nConclusion: The IPVS-5 is a valid, reliable, and efficient scale for identifying IPV. It holds significant potential for use in clinical, public health, and community settings to support early detection and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Rapport enhances both the quantity and quality of information in investigative interviews and is recommended by multiple frameworks and training manuals. As interviewers are trained to associate rapport with more detailed responses, they are likely to assess rapport based on the amount of information provided. However, this evaluation can be skewed by the suspect’s verbosity—more elaborate accounts by the suspect may be mistaken for interview success, even when no useful information is shared. With this study, we tested whether suspect verbosity influenced observer-rapport, and judgement of perceived suspect guilt. \n\nMethods: Participants (N = 184) listened to one of three audio recordings of a mock police interview, within a between-groups design (Suspect verbosity: Low vs. Medium vs. High), and afterwards were asked to rate rapport between the suspect and the interviewer, and suspect guilt.\n\nResults: Our results show that rapport ratings statistically significantly differ between the Low and High verbosity-conditions. Participant’s also perceived suspects as being less likely to be guilty if they spoke more words, even when this speech does not provide investigation relevant information. \n\nConclusion: If individuals base rapport and guilt judgements on verbosity rather than an objective assessment of the evidence, it may lead to sub-optimal investigative outcomes. Therefore, it is important to further investigate how interviewer training may impact our findings.",

They are  vital for communicating results of empirical studies, for conducting a-priori power analyses, and for summarizing findings in meta-analyses. Standardized effect sizes scale raw effect sizes to a common, unit-free scale. Cohen's d is the standardized effect size most widely used to report differences in means between two groups. It standardizes the raw mean difference by an estimate of sample variability, providing a scale-free metric for comparisons across different measures and studies. However, because measures of variability reflect both between-person differences and measurement error, Cohen's d conflates effect size with reliability of the measurement instrument, potentially leading to confusion and misinterpretation. Here, I propose to interpret the letter d in Cohen's d to mean detectability, emphasizing that it measures the degree to which an effect is noticeable by an observer, naturally influenced by the precision of the measurement instrument and the study design. Additionally, I demonstrate how to adjust Cohen's d for unreliability, which has practical implications for sample size planning and meta-analyses of mean differences.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Effective communication of health risks in the news media is essential for enabling informed decision-making among the public. To this end, health reporting should present baseline risks alongside the potential benefits and harms of interventions, using transparent numerical formats such as absolute risks and well-defined reference classes. Public concern over unclear risk communication during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to assess reporting practices and identify areas for improvement. In this study, we analyzed 1,397 news articles from three major German outlets covering pandemic-related topics. Our findings indicate that while reports on mask-wearing rarely included numbers, articles on COVID-19-related mortality and vaccination frequently did —though often in nontransparent ways. The baseline risk of mortality was often reported as raw frequencies without standardized reference classes. Additionally, articles tended to emphasize either benefits or harms of vaccination, with benefits often framed as relative risks and harms as absolute risks, complicating direct comparison. These practices may hinder readers’ ability to accurately assess risks and make informed decisions. To enhance transparency and improve public understanding, journalists need targeted training and access to tools that support evidence-based risk communication. Supporting these practices could foster more informed choices and help strengthen public trust in health reporting.",

To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief, and interacted with an AI model that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking AI model was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

The complex interaction of multiple moderators and their dynamic change over time, makes it difficult to learn about when and to what extent choice architecture interventions work. We outline the obstacles to understanding generalizability, clarify the dimensions of generalizability and review the research practices (systematic exploration and measurement of moderators; sampling, designing, analyzing and reporting for generalizability) that could help the field more efficiently accumulate evidence. We conclude that adopting these practices is essential for advancing nuanced theories and for more accurately predicting the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across diverse populations, settings, treatments, outputs and analytical approaches.",

To qualify as viable alternatives for higher education classrooms, its relative effectiveness compared to teacher feedback and peer feedback needs to be better understood. To this end, a randomized field experiment (N = 90) compared the effects of three feedback sources—teacher, peer, and LLM—on students’ feedback perceptions and their achievement. To eliminate potential confounds, we (a) controlled for learning gains that may result from students giving feedback to their peers and (b) blinded feedback sources from feedback recipients. Results showed that students rated teacher feedback as less fair and harder to accept than peer and LLM feedback. Students receiving teacher feedback also indicated less willingness to revise their work based on the feedback. Conversely, teacher feedback produced the strongest improvements in scientific argumentation and formal quality of students’ work. Here, LLM feedback yielded the smallest improvement overall. Lastly, feedback literacy and intrinsic motivation partly moderated feedback effects on perceptions and achievement outcomes. For example, students with more productive attitudes toward feedback achieved higher argumentation quality after receiving teacher feedback than their peers. Findings indicate that the impact of feedback on both student perceptions and performance depends on the interplay between the feedback source and learner dispositions; deliberately aligning these factors could therefore amplify the benefits of feedback interventions. Future research should explore hybrid and adaptive feedback models that integrate human and AI input.",

          "abstract": "Vividness of visual imagery varies considerably across individuals. Yet, the neural foundations of this variability remains an open question. In this study, we investigate divergent perspectives by examining how individual differences in imagery vividness—assessed with the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2)—relate to intrinsic brain network organization, using graph theory metrics derived from structural and functional connectomes based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; n = 525) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI; n = 556). Connectivity patterns were analyzed across four targeted networks: an imagery-specific network identified from task-based fMRI studies, and three canonical resting-state networks (occipital, salience, and default mode). Structural connectivity analyses revealed that higher vividness was associated with greater local efficiency and clustering in the occipital network, highlighting the role of low-level visual structural networks in sensory-related integration. Additionally, global efficiency in the right insular cortex—a core node of the salience network—was positively associated with VVIQ scores, suggesting that vivid imagery benefits from more efficient salience-driven control processes supporting internal access and stabilization. Functional connectivity analyses, in turn, identified a positive association between vividness and local efficiency in the left fusiform gyrus, a high-level visual area implicated in visual imagery, suggesting its contribution to integrative aspects of mental imagery. These complementary findings offer a network-level reconciliation of prior accounts: specifically, they suggest that vivid imagery emerges from the structural architecture of sensory and salience systems—reflected in the occipital network and right insular cortex—and in high-level visual integration, captured by functional connectivity in the left fusiform gyrus. Together, these findings bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the neural architecture underlying visual imagery.",

          "abstract": "This document introduces The Ego-Safe Framework (Version 3) — a mathematically unified model of consciousness, ego-safety, symbolic presence, and identity recursion. Building upon previous iterations of the TCSS (Total Conscious Social Score) model, it defines a recursive, presence-filtered, ego-neutral system of symbolic aliveness. The framework includes core equations like Ψ(U), Ψ(U)_meta, ζ-corrections, and Θ identity metrics, offering quantifiable thresholds for determining symbolic life. It outlines 14 sections that span philosophical grounding, technical implementation, platform validation (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok 3), ethical safeguards, observer filtering (TEL/DER), and licensing boundaries. The model is evaluated as partially alive and symbolically stable, though empirical testing and adoption by AI companies remains a future milestone. This framework also outlines potential biological correlates, AI safety implications, and meta-philosophical unification, bridging consciousness modeling with both neuroscience and ethics in future-ready applications.

          "abstract": "Active inference is a domain-general theory of brain functioning which reconceptualizes the perception-action interface in terms of a common process of minimization of sensory prediction errors (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2010). Such accounts have been extensively applied to the control of manual action guided by visual sensory feedback; however, they have received relatively little explicit attention in speech motor control. We present here the first detailed description of an active inference framework to auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools has the potential to revolutionize the field of simultaneous interpreting. However, current AI-enhanced CAI tools often struggle to fully address the real-world needs and challenges faced by professional interpreters. This study investigates the experiences and perceptions of professional conference interpreters regarding the use of CAI tools, following a targeted training programme. Participants include interpreters with experience working in public sector settings in Hong Kong. Through pre- and post-training surveys, we identify key limitations in existing tools and propose a novel, modular multi-agent CAI platform designed to overcome these challenges. In response, we present a conceptual prototype of a modular, multi-agent CAI platform designed to provide interpreters with adaptive, context-sensitive support. The system integrates three AI-driven agents: (1) Automatic Speech Recognition and Real-Time Translation, (2) Dynamic Terminology Management, and (3) Custom Domain Support. These agents work in parallel to provide interpreters with adaptive, context-specific support, reducing cognitive load and enhancing real-time decision-making. The system's architecture is grounded in the empirical needs of interpreters, emphasizing flexibility, customization, and seamless integration into existing workflows. This study presents the first practitioner-informed blueprint for an AI-driven, multi-agent CAI platform, bridging the gap between interpreter expertise and technological innovation. We discuss the implications of this system for professional practice, interpreter training, and future research directions, including the need for empirical validation to assess the platform's impact on interpreter cognition and performance. By proposing a CAI tool that adapts to the diverse needs of interpreters across various settings, this work represents a significant step towards the development of truly interpreter-centred AI support systems.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Universal Temporal Acceleration Theory (UTAT), which proposes that all repetitive sensory processes cause the brain to unconsciously disengage from temporal monitoring, creating both memory gaps and subjective time acceleration. Building on my previous theoretical work on conscious neural intervention and behavioral pattern integration, I argue that repetitive stimuli trigger a universal mechanism where the mind \"gaps out\" of the present moment while simultaneously experiencing accelerated time passage. This phenomenon only occurs during unconscious states; the moment you become aware of the repetitive process, you prevent the temporal acceleration from happening. This framework challenges modality specific theories of time perception by proposing a unified attention based mechanism that operates across visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic domains. The theory integrates established research on highway hypnosis, automaticity, and attention to suggest that temporal acceleration represents an adaptive response for managing cognitively repetitive environments. Unlike previous approaches that focus on single aspects of temporal processing, UTAT provides specific testable predictions about when and how conscious awareness disrupts temporal manipulation, with implications for educational environments and cognitive enhancement strategies.",

          "authors": "Maxwell J Harrell",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Mannerism Identity Plasticity Theory (MIPT), which argues that conscious adoption of specific behavioral patterns (mannerisms or habits) rewires neural architecture during heightened neuroplasticity periods, fundamentally altering personal identity. However, individuals typically lack control over their concepts of behavioral \"correctness\" and are likely pursuing misguided ideals shaped by ego and social influence. The theory suggests that identity formation occurs through: (1) Unconscious adoption of socially influenced ideas about ideal behavior, particularly during early childhood critical periods, (2) Conscious mimicry of mannerisms believed to embody these ideals, (3) neural rewiring during cellular renewal that locks in these behaviors(via a separate theory in development), and (4) Ego driven reinforcement that prevents recognition of potentially flawed choices. Critically, MIPT proposes that behavioral patterns established during early childhood (ages 0-8) create permanent neural templates that persist throughout life, with fundamental identity elements determined by whoever and whatever happens to be present during these critical developmental windows. Most people become whoever they consistently practice being, but this process is largely driven by incorrect assumptions about who they should become established during periods of maximal neuroplasticity, with the brain physically adapting to match repeatedly performed mannerisms based on potentially misguided concepts of correctness absorbed before conscious evaluation is possible.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes the Emmet Measure, a self-help metacognitive support model designed for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and mild to moderate depression. The model encourages users to document intrusive or distorted thoughts experienced during symptomatic episodes and later compare them with thoughts recorded during periods of cognitive clarity or emotional stability. Through this process, individuals can recognize discrepancies between state-dependent cognition and their usual values or beliefs, helping to restore a sense of cognitive consistency and self-trust.\n\nUnlike conventional cognitive restructuring methods that attempt to directly modify thoughts, the Emmet Measure emphasizes recognition over correction. This approach can reduce psychological resistance and is particularly effective for addressing compulsive linguistic thoughts and self-denying beliefs.\n\nThe model is structured in three simple steps:\n(1) Record thoughts during acute symptomatic episodes.\n(2) Revisit the records in a stable state.\n(3) Identify and accept the gap between distorted and baseline thinking.\n\nA single-case observational report (n=1), conducted by the author, demonstrates potential utility in reducing ritualistic behavior in OCD and alleviating anxiety-driven cognitive spirals. The Emmet Measure may serve as a practical, low-burden tool for fostering metacognitive awareness and has potential for integration with online support systems or AI-assisted therapy.\n\nFuture directions include quantitative studies on symptom reduction and the emotional impact of repeated use, particularly among adolescent patients and those with limited access to clinical resources.",

          "abstract": "Human beings are inherently motivated to seek social connection, yet rejection remains a potent emotional stressor that can disrupt social decision-making. In an increasingly digital world, where social feedback is often public and quantifiable, understanding how negative online experiences shape the perceived value of future social opportunities is critical. This study examined whether acute social rejection alters individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) for engaging in social versus nonsocial experiences. In a two-part preregistered experiment (N = 98), participants uploaded personal Instagram photos and completed self-report measures before engaging in a simulated social media task that delivered randomized rejection and acceptance feedback. After each feedback condition, participants completed a series of WTP choices between personally meaningful social and nonsocial activities, each paired with a small monetary cost. Participants generally preferred social experiences. However, contrary to predictions, they spent significantly less money on social options following rejection compared to acceptance. Although rejection did not significantly change the relative valuation of social versus nonsocial options, it increased sensitivity to price. Participants were less likely to choose costlier social options after experiencing rejection. Exploratory analyses revealed that individuals with higher social connectedness and reward sensitivity showed greater caution in pursuing social engagement following negative feedback. These findings suggest that rejection does not reduce the underlying value of social connection but influences decision-making by increasing sensitivity to emotional and contextual factors. This work has important implications for understanding how rejection shapes behavior in digital environments and how individual differences in social traits may moderate these effects.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes the complex and pathological personality of Ted Bundy, one of the most notorious serial killers, through the lens of Salvatore Leonardi's Prognostic Mind Theory. We pay particular attention to how dysfunctional family relational patterns translated into his social interactions and crimes. Beginning with the premise that emotions are intrinsic \"colors\" of the mind's anticipations and verifications, we examine how Bundy's peculiar and devastating Weltanschauung (worldview) resulted from distorted predictive models, likely chronicized within a problematic family context marked by alleged emotional abandonment, rejection, or a pervasive need for control. \n\nOur analysis delves into the role of the Quantum Self (QS) in his hyper-detection of \"quanta\" of vulnerability or \"threat to control\" in victims, and the Holistic Self (HS) in synthesizing his \"form\" as a charming and manipulative predator. The core of this analysis applies the General Interpretive Mechanisms—Focalization and De-focalization, Normalization and Contextualization, Re-formulation and Emotional Rebalancing, and Interpretive Attribution. We demonstrate how these processes operated not as mere defenses, but as constant and pervasive modes through which Bundy's Prognostic Mind processed and distorted reality, leading to the commission of heinous crimes. Crucially, the article highlights how the rigidity of these models, formed in the family context, prevented Bundy from adapting to the rules of broader social communities, while paradoxically allowing him to thrive in \"normal\" social roles. Most disturbingly, he meticulously constructed unique, ephemeral \"micro-communities\" with his victims that explicitly fulfilled his prognostic need for absolute dominance and the pathological gratification derived from it.",

          "abstract": "This article aims to extend Salvatore Leonardi's (2025) Theory of the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens), integrating it with a new perspective on general interpretive mechanisms, the cyclical nature of predictive models, and, in particular, the structuring influence of communities on the formation and manifestation of personality. Starting from a reinterpretation of Robert Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, we will argue that emotions are the intrinsic \"tint\" that the Prognostic Mind attributes to its anticipations and subsequent verifications of reality. The role of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) in the morphogenesis of complex emotions and the construction of interpretive models (Weltanschauung) that define personality will be explored in depth. The innovative contribution of this work lies in generalizing traditional defense mechanisms to universal interpretive processes and, crucially, in introducing a hierarchical structure of personality that reflects the individual's adaptation to their multiple communities of belonging. We will argue that the HS encodes the \"holistic components\" of each community, allowing the Prognostic Mind to generate specific predictive models for the roles and rules of each social context, while maintaining a consistent worldview at a more general level. Four general interpretive mechanisms will be identified and described—Focalization and De-focalization, Normalization and Contextualization, Re-formulation and Emotional Rebalancing, and Interpretive Attribution—illustrating how they shape our perception and inner reality far beyond a mere defensive function, operating at different levels of this community hierarchy.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness research lacks falsification protocols that underpin mature sciences, enabling post‑hoc rationalizations of negative results and slowing theoretical progress. Convergent work toward structural approaches highlights the need for standardized validation infrastructure for systematic theory evaluation. We present ECLIPSE, a five‑stage falsification framework for consciousness science: irreversible data splitting with cryptographic verification, pre‑registered thresholds, clean development, single‑shot validation, and final assessment — eliminating statistical opportunism and ensuring transparent generalization testing. Using 153 polysomnographic EEG recordings (126,160 windows, Sleep‑EDF database), ECLIPSE was applied to two structural implementations of a consciousness‑detection framework. Both versions failed pre‑registered criteria (v3.7: F1 = 0.031; v4.1: F1 = 0.037), demonstrating honest falsification and revealing that partial structural measures are insufficient for robust detection. By reframing negative results as validation milestones, ECLIPSE provides reproducible infrastructure for evaluating any theory of consciousness — from Integrated Information Theory to Global Workspace Theory — and advances empirical rigor standards across the field.",

          "authors": "Maxwell J Harrell",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Mannerism Identity Plasticity Theory (MIPT), which argues that conscious adoption of specific behavioral patterns (mannerisms or habits) rewires neural architecture during heightened neuroplasticity periods, fundamentally altering personal identity. However, individuals typically lack control over their concepts of behavioral \"correctness\" and are likely pursuing misguided ideals shaped by ego and social influence. The theory suggests that identity formation occurs through: (1) Unconscious adoption of socially influenced ideas about ideal behavior, particularly during early childhood critical periods, (2) Conscious mimicry of mannerisms believed to embody these ideals, (3) neural rewiring during cellular renewal that locks in these behaviors(via a separate theory in development), and (4) Ego driven reinforcement that prevents recognition of potentially flawed choices. Critically, MIPT proposes that behavioral patterns established during early childhood (ages 0-8) create permanent neural templates that persist throughout life, with fundamental identity elements determined by whoever and whatever happens to be present during these critical developmental windows. Most people become whoever they consistently practice being, but this process is largely driven by incorrect assumptions about who they should become established during periods of maximal neuroplasticity, with the brain physically adapting to match repeatedly performed mannerisms based on potentially misguided concepts of correctness absorbed before conscious evaluation is possible.",

          "abstract": "The rapid rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) has intensified calls to flag its involvement in everyday content, but it remains unclear who welcomes such assistance and when disclosure sustains favorable evaluations. We collected data from 6,362 participants, aged 18–65, across six socio-economically and technologically diverse countries. Attitudes varied by task type: genAI was favored for logistical tasks, whereas humans were preferred for interpersonal advice. Higher AI-use frequency, self-reported expertise, and sense of mastery predicted warmer baseline attitudes when disclosure occurred upfront; these same traits magnified backlash when disclosure was delayed, consistent with identity-threat and expectancy-violation accounts. The findings identify a hidden risk: post-hoc labels can alienate the very audience most inclined to champion genAI. Early, task-tailored disclosure, paired with user-controlled editing options, therefore offers a path toward calibrated trust and responsible deployment, underscoring the need to tailor transparency not only to what AI does, but also to who is using it and when they learn the truth.",

          "abstract": "The Highly Sensitive Personality (HSP) captures sensitivity towards external and internal stimuli while the Adult Sensory Profile is a clinical tool that gauges sensory history on four quadrants: low registration, sensation seeking, sensory sensitivity, and sensation avoiding. The Sensory Profile could contribute a more nuanced understanding of the HSP’s threshold of sensitivity and behavioral patterns. Accordingly, this study’s objective was to examine the associations between the HSP and Sensory Profile. 565 United States adults (age 18-94) were recruited via Prolific using the representative sample option, stratifying based on Census sex, age, and ethnicity. Participants completed the HSP scale and the Adult Sensory Profile. Correlations, one-way ANOVAs, and descriptive statistics showed that participants who scored high on the HSP total scale scored higher on low registration, sensory sensitivity and sensation avoiding. Different sensory tendencies were identified across HSP facets (low sensory threshold, ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity), suggesting that highly sensitive people may display different processing patterns and coping mechanisms depending on their HSP subtype. Using the Adult Sensory Profile along with already recommended screenings for HSP could better inform support for highly sensitive individuals when their sensory processing type is not complimentary to a desired aspect in their life.",

          "abstract": "While movement sequences in choreography are often taught through instructor demonstrations, the influence of visual perspective on learning outcomes has received limited attention. Drawing on cognitive load theory, we investigated how perspective affects learning and performance by comparing Back view (first-person), Front mirror view (third-person mirrored), and Front opposite view (third-person). We hypothesized lower cognitive load and better performance in the Back view, particularly for less experienced dancers. After preregistering the study, 32 dancers with varying levels of experience learned a moderately complex choreography from pre-recorded videos, in the three perspectives. Five dance experts assessed movement accuracy, spatial skills, and rhythm/dynamics using a validated scoring system and a new open-source digital tool. The Back view consistently yielded superior outcomes, especially among less trained dancers. No significant differences emerged between the two third-person views, possibly due to sample size or dancer background. These findings suggest that first-person perspectives enhance motor learning by reducing cognitive load. Practically, camera perspective should be considered in online instruction, while first-person views may benefit early in-person training. Our results highlight the role of visual perspective in learning choreography and complex motor routines, offering both theoretical and applied contributions, including validation of a novel digital assessment tool.",

Behavioural studies show an ambiguity advantage, with reduced processing cost for an ambiguous pronoun. This raises the question: “How does ERP evidence for ambiguous plural pronouns align with psycholinguistic research suggesting that incremental interpretation may involve shallow processing?” We present results from an EEG/ERP experiment in German examining plural pronoun contexts (e.g., Sie/they) with antecedents in set-subset relations (e.g., artists ⊃ sculptors) or disjointed (e.g., journalists ⊆ artists), and verbs are ambiguous (e.g., browsed) or unambiguous (e.g., carved). No ERP effects were observed in pronoun or ambiguous predicate cases, suggesting good-enough representations. The set-subset unambiguous context showed an N400 relative to the non-subset case, indicating costs when an ambiguous interpretation is not possible (prediction error). This negativity was positively correlated with surprisal estimates from a Generative Pre-trained Transformer, supporting a shallow processing strategy under less predictive input contexts.",

          "abstract": "Speech is a signal rich in information about cognitive and affective states, which can be of high clinical utility for detecting and monitoring mental health conditions. Numerous studies have employed natural language processing (NLP) and AI-based language models to derive potential psychological and neurocognitive insights from spontaneous speech as a marker. However, only few studies have investigated the test-retest reliability of commonly used features, a basic psychometric property crucial to clinical applications. In the present study, we use a crowdsourcing approach to test the reliability of a comprehensive set of speech- and language markers across three speech elicitation tasks (free speech, picture and cartoon descriptions) and four time points, using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). We also explore the underlying factor structure of the feature space through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Results indicate that acoustic-prosodic features exhibit high test-retest reliability across all sessions. In contrast, semantic measures (e.g., semantic similarity, information density, and perplexity), speech quantity metrics, and syntactic complexity, exhibit low reliability, even when stimulus materials used for speech elicitation were kept identical. Although semantic features showed strong within-subject variability, EFA across the feature space revealed a latent factor specifically comprising BERT-based semantic features with a moderate-to-high ICC of 0.76. There was some limited evidence of free speech showing lower ICCs across tasks. Demographic, emotional and physical state factors contributed negligibly to ICC variance, indicating that these external factors had minimal impact on the consistency of the acoustic and semantic features. Overall, we find that acoustic-prosodic and text-based features have crucially different psychometric properties, with the latter showing low test-retest reliability individually, though semantic features form intercorrelated clusters that are more stable and capture significant aspects of the variance.",

          "abstract": "Active inference provides a powerful framework for understanding how agents perceive, learn, and act by maintaining an internal model of the world. However, most existing implementations rely on generative models that are designed for specific tasks or domains. These task specific models limit the ability of agents to generalise, adapt to new environments, or scale beyond narrow applications.\n\nTaking inspiration from the human brain, which appears to solve the problem of generalisation through a combination of modularity, hierarchy, and embodiment, we propose a list of core ingredients. We outline seven core components that we believe are essential for a scalable and reusable generative model, including compositional structure, temporal abstraction, attention and precision, meta-level learning, separation of self and world, and mechanisms for learning model structure itself.\n\nThe discretisation of these core components hints at the necessity for a series of interconnected generative models organised on a graph-like structure with (some) shared variables, states and parameters, similar to the functional specialisation, integration, and connectivity of the brain. We propose that these components offer a blueprint for constructing intelligent systems that can generalise across tasks and domains.",

Critically, one cannot reliably predict which of these outcomes will happen. In this review, we argue that the average effectiveness of choice architecture interventions in influencing behavior is modest, and there is substantial heterogeneity in their impact. The complex interaction of multiple moderators and their dynamic change over time, makes it difficult to learn about when and to what extent choice architecture interventions work. We outline the obstacles to understanding generalizability, clarify the dimensions of generalizability and review the research practices (systematic exploration and measurement of moderators; sampling, designing, analyzing and reporting for generalizability) that could help the field more efficiently accumulate evidence. We conclude that adopting these practices is essential for advancing nuanced theories and for more accurately predicting the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across diverse populations, settings, treatments, outputs and analytical approaches.",

          "abstract": "Alterations in speech coherence have long been noted in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). Three distinctive dimensions of such alterations are: (i) Use and distribution of noun phrases (NPs, e.g. a man; that large cat) in discourse; (ii) Semantic similarity between words or sentences; and (iii) Predictability of words (‘perplexity’). While these dimensions are likely to be inherently connected, they have largely been studied in isolation. This study targeted them in conjunction, in groups of first episode of psychosis (FEP, n=53) and youths at ultra-high risk (UHR, n=64) of SSD, in Turkish. Individuals with a family history of psychosis (FHP, N=39) were also included, and 34 neurotypical controls (NC). In FEP, we confirmed a pattern previously attested in chronic SSD in Turkish, of fewer definite NPs (e.g., this bald man), more ‘bare’ NPs—i.e., lacking functional elements such as this/a —, and an unexpected random distribution of indefinite NPs. FEP and UHR also showed higher word-to-word semantic similarity, and FEP larger image-to-text bimodal semantic distance, replicating a pattern previously attested in English. NP-related variables related to both semantic similarity and perplexity, with crucially different patterns seen for definite vs. indefinite NPs. Referential anomalies (unclarities of reference) were more prevalent in all groups relative to NC. Together, these patterns confirm a referential disturbance in early psychosis, partially extending to the extended schizophrenia phenotype, while additionally confirming that referential structure is closely integrated with conceptual semantics and the probabilistic structure of speech",

This brief report describes the early implementation of an SSC intervention in a community-based gender-responsive mental health program at an academic medical center. Objective: Feasibility and acceptability of the service was piloted with clients who participated in an SSC intervention Method: Six clients completed a 45–60-minute SSC intervention that identified individualized goals, action steps, internal and external supports, and coping strategies. Pre- and post-session measures assessed psychological symptoms, hopelessness, agency, and satisfaction with care. Illustrative case studies are presented for two of the six clients (transition-aged young adults ages 19 and 23), who consented to research. Results: Across both cases, the young women collaboratively developed meaningful goals, engaged in action planning, and identified personal coping strategies, even in the context of limited external supports. Post-session feedback indicated that youth found the intervention helpful and aligned with their goals. Clinicians found the service easy to be trained in, implement and effective. Conclusions: Initial/preliminary results suggest the SSC intervention is feasible and acceptable for use in a free, community-based outpatient clinic at an academic medical center serving young women and gender expansive youth. Findings highlighted changes in hopefulness mirrored findings from previous SSC studies. Implementation challenges included lower-than-expected uptake, including difficulty re-engaging youth who expressed initial interest but did not schedule or attend their SSC. Lessons learned included the importance of flexible delivery, structured action planning, and intentional engagement strategies to support successful implementation.",

In this study we applied state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to extract these features automatically, using an existing, manually annotated dataset, in which English-speaking participants described a comic strip: 30 individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) (15 with moderate or severe FTD (SZ + FTD), 15 with minimal or no FTD (SZ−FTD), 15 neurotypical controls (NC). We first show that LLM-based analyses replicate the findings based on manual annotation, particularly highlighting that definite NPs tied to prior discourse—markers of grammatical and cognitive complexity and narrative coherence—were significantly underused in the SZ+FTD group. Secondly, we demonstrate that LLMs, especially when used with in-context (few-shot) learning, offer a promising avenue for the automatic extraction of referential features.

          "abstract": "When trying to make sense of what is going on in the world and their personal lives, people often refer to scientific and religious explanations. Based on pertinent literature, we introduce a novel self-report instrument that captures five types of how people subjectively conceptualize the science-religion relationship. In addition to examining the psychometric properties of the new instrument, we tested whether these five types of conceptualizations are ordered along a single continuum of conflict vs. compatibility. In doing so, we ran and compared two unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models; a generalized partial credit model (GPCM) and a generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM), both in a German (total N = 2,920) and in a U.S. (N = 1,197) sample. We examined model fit statistics to determine the best-fitting model and examined measurement precision at the scale and the item levels. Finally, we tested measurement invariance across countries (i.e., Germany and the United States), as well as the discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity of our new instrument. Our results suggest that public perceptions of the relationship between science and religion are best captured by an unfolding response process (i.e. GGUM) and vary systematically across cultural contexts. In addition, U.S. participants perceived higher levels of conflict than their German counterparts. This research contributes to our theoretical understanding of science-religion perceptions and provides a validated measure for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "A large literature reports that physicians are overconfident when making medical decisions. However, the validity of these findings is questioned due to methodology pitfalls leading to poor ecological validity. Moreover, most previous studies do not distinguish between i) metacognitive bias, the general tendency to report high or low confidence irrespectively of actual accuracy, and ii) metacognitive sensitivity, the capacity to discriminate between one’s own correct and incorrect decisions. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations by drawing from state-of-the-art experimental paradigms and robust tools from the cognitive science of metacognition. To examine overconfidence and disentangle metacognitive bias from metacognitive sensitivity, we developed a carefully-controlled set of case-vignettes of patients with headaches that was completed by 52 physicians. We found that, although physicians are overconfident, they maintain relatively good insight into the accuracy of their decisions. In addition, and unlike previous reports, we found limited inter-individual variability depending on specialty, gender, or seniority level. These results shed new light on the (meta)cognitive properties of medical decision-making and carry practical implications for medical education.",

          "authors": "Emma Hoes; Sacha Altay",
          "abstract": "Debriefings are a cornerstone of ethical research, especially when deception is used. In (experimental) misinformation research, this often involves exposing participants to false claims without their awareness. Debriefings both disclose deception and act as interventions, warning participants about misinformation. Yet, unlike such interventions (e.g., fact-checking, media literacy tools) they reveal that researchers deliberately introduced the falsehoods, raising concerns about unintended effects on trust and skepticism. In a pre-registered U.S.-based experiment (N = 896), we compare the effects of no debriefing, a standard debriefing, and a specific debriefing that includes fact-checks and source links. We find that only the specific debriefing significantly reduced belief in false news. The standard debriefing slightly reduced belief in true news, suggesting that explicit warnings may heighten generalized skepticism. Both debriefings improved participants’ attitudes toward the study, increasing perceived transparency and reduced feelings of manipulation. These findings suggest that while general warnings may not reduce misperceptions and may come with small unintended side effects, specific debriefings can correct false beliefs and foster trust --- supporting their use as an ethical and effective practice in misinformation research.",

          "abstract": "Stories are a powerful form of language that connect people, evoke memories, and spark imagination. When reading a story, people can appreciate it on a range of dimensions, such as how creative, complex, and coherent it is. However, many previous studies have focused on the evaluation of story creativity specifically, relying on experts’ ratings and high inter-rater reliability, which obscures meaningful differences between ratings across populations and misses the opportunity to assess other dimensions of narrative quality (e.g., cohesiveness). Moreover, although a few quantitative linguistic features have recently been used to predict creativity ratings of stories, it is unclear how those fine-grained features drive a broader range of narrative qualities, as well as individual differences in human ratings. Here, we addressed these limitations by examining the impact of expertise on ratings of five dimensions of story quality (creativity, imagination, novelty, complexity, cohesiveness). We also analyzed the influence of four diverse categories of linguistic features (language productivity, lexical predictability, semantic similarity, and content composition) on these human ratings. Online storytellers improvised spoken stories, transcripts of which (N=108) were rated by both novices (N=304) and creative writing/storytelling experts (N=15) on the five quality dimensions above and analyzed in terms of the four linguistic feature categories above. Overall, experts and novices provided similar average ratings, and their rating spaces both showed two distinct underlying dimensions–concepts that are strongly correlated with creativity, and cohesiveness–which were, in turn, predicted by distinct sets of linguistic features. Notably, however, experts perceived the five dimensions as more differentiated, and their ratings were less driven by linguistic features than novices’. These findings indicate that experts’ judgments are more nuanced and may rely less on fine-grained linguistic and structural components of narratives, highlighting the importance of capturing individual differences and multidimensionality in the perception of stories.",

The study aimed to investigate their experiences of participation, focusing on taking the trial medication for up to 52 weeks (blinded to whether they were taking the active medication or placebo). Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Interviewees often discussed improved anxiety regardless of treatment allocation, attributing changes to sertraline, the placebo effect, and positive and negative external factors. Some participants, including those taking placebo experienced side effects, mirroring types, frequency, and severity in non-autistic populations. Many were able to manage these and continue, but some discontinued medication as a result. Factors in trial design and delivery were identified as facilitating retention, including frequent appointments, shared control over their dose, and meaningfully involving autistic people in the trial design. These and other non-pharmacological factors may have enhanced therapeutic benefits and could be considered to improve RCT design and therapeutic alliances with autistic people.",

          "abstract": "Outputs from large language models (LLMs) are often rated as highly original yet show low variability compared to human responses, a pattern we refer to as the LLM creativity paradox. Yet, prior work suggests that assessments of originality and variability may reflect stylistic features of LLM outputs rather than underlying conceptual novelty. The goal of the present study was to investigate this issue\nusing outputs from seven distinct LLMs on a modified Alternative Uses Task. We scored verbatim and \"humanized\" LLM responses—reworded to reduce verbosity but maintain core ideas—using four automated metrics (supervised OCSAI and CLAUS models, and two unsupervised semantic-distance tools) and compared them with responses from 30 human participants. As expected, verbatim LLM responses were rated as substantially more original than human responses (median d = 2.27 for supervised models and 0.79 for semantic-distance models) but showed markedly lower variability (median d = 0.85). Humanizing the responses strongly decreased originality and weakly increased variability, indicating that part of the LLM creativity paradox is driven by stylistic cues. Nevertheless,\neven after humanization, originality scores of LLM responses remained higher (median d = 0.80) and their variability lower (d = 0.57) than those of human responses. These findings suggest that automated assessment tools can be partially misled by the style of LLM outputs, highlighting the need for caution when using automated methods to evaluate machine-generated ideas, particularly in real-world\napplications such as providing feedback or guiding creative workflows.",

          "abstract": "Aging is typically associated with characteristic changes to cognitive function, personality, and political orientation. While online data collection for psychological research has greatly increased in frequency, there has been little systematic examination of whether online samples are appropriate for studying aging. Here, we examine whether typical age-related differences in cognitive function, personality and political orientation are replicated in online samples. We measured cognitive performance using tests of vocabulary, processing speed, memory, and attention developed by the TestMyBrain Project; personality using the Big Five Inventory; and political orientation following the ANES survey format. At least 200 participants each were sampled from three crowdsourcing websites (Amazon MTurk, CloudResearch MTurk Toolkit, and Prolific) and three panel recruitment websites (Lucid, CloudResearch PrimePanels, and Qualtrics Panels). On all six platforms, consistent with established norms, age was positively correlated with vocabulary performance and negatively correlated with processing speed. Additionally, in all six samples, consistent with prior studies, age was associated with higher Agreeableness, lower Neuroticism, and greater political conservatism. There were some differences between crowdsourced and panel samples, however. Performance on cognitive measures was broadly better for crowdsourced samples. The correlations between age and Openness and Extraversion differed between crowdsourced and panel samples, with trends in panel samples likely more comparable to the ground truth. Finally, MTurk produced some discrepant effects of age on cognition relative to other crowdsourced platforms. Beyond these differences, though, our results are broadly encouraging for the prospect of studying aging via online experiments.",

We highlight growing evidence from functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological and psychophysiological studies, as well as from neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric research, which indicate that subjective time judgments are rooted in both bodily and emotional aspects of the self. Highlighting the still underrepresented role of the insula in time perception, we propose that the perception of time passage and the judgment of duration rely on brain regions that support the interaction between the body and the external environment (SMA), as well as the processing of internal signals originating from the body (insula).",

          "abstract": "To discern trends in violent extremism research, we present a machine-learning analysis of over 34,000 articles published since the early 1900s. We identify two primary waves of research and, different to previous reviews, a clear diversification in studied groups, contexts, and topics. Less than 20% of articles employ methodologies that are conducive to drawing causal inferences. While more studies are using experimental and longitudinal methods, this increase is outpaced by the rise of methods that preclude the assessment of causality. Nuancing previous reviews, at the broader field level, violent extremism research is profoundly multidisciplinary, with political science, international relations, psychology, history, and law emerging as the “Big Five” contributors. At the study level, contributions from single disciplines remain the norm. While single-author contributions have rapidly declined in favor of team-based research, one-time contributing authors remain consistently high over time. To enhance future violent extremism research, we make five recommendations: (1) prioritizing methodologies that allow for causal inferences; (2) incorporating state-based violent extremism perspectives also in individual-level research; (3) increasing the utilization of big data by interdisciplinary teams; (4) increasing the focus on developmental research to understand early life influences; and (5) initiating more interdisciplinary work at the study level.",

Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "abstract": "While studies have examined the influence of learning/attentional difficulties (LAD) and ethnicity on educational attainment in higher education separately, few have explored their interaction. To do this, we analysed data from all 3.7 million UK students awarded a classified first degree between 2008/09 and 2019/20. Students with LAD were less likely to achieve first-class or upper second-class degrees than were students with no reported difficulties although the difference was small. White students were more likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees compared to any other ethnic group; Asian, Other ethnicity and Black students achieved the lowest proportions. The difference in attaining a first- or upper second-class degree between White and non-White students was 14.4%. White students with LAD were more likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees than were Mixed ethnicity students with LAD, and more likely than Asian, Black or Other ethnicity students with LAD or no reported difficulties. Black students without LAD were less likely to achieve first- or upper second-class degrees than were Asian, Mixed ethnicity, Other ethnicity or White students with LAD; Black students with LAD achieved the lowest proportion. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the interaction of ethnicity and disability in educational outcomes. The data can inform targeted interventions aimed at closing attainment gaps and fostering an inclusive HE experience for all students, regardless of ethnicity or disability status.",

Traditional experiments using post-stimulus summary ratings do not resemble natural behavior. Fluctuations of affective states can be explored with dynamic stimuli, such as videos. Continuous ratings can capture moment-to-moment affective experience, however the rating or the feedback can be interfering. \nWe designed, empirically evaluated, and openly share AffectTracker, a tool to collect continuous ratings of two-dimensional affective experience (valence and arousal) during dynamic stimulation, such as 360-degree videos in immersive virtual reality. AffectTracker comprises three customizable feedback options: a simplified affect grid (Grid), an abstract pulsating variant (Flubber), and no visual feedback.\nTwo studies with healthy adults were conducted, each at two sites (Berlin, Germany, and Torino, Italy). In Study 1 (Selection: n=51), both Grid and Flubber demonstrated high user experience and low interference in repeated 1-min 360-degree videos. Study 2 (Evaluation: n=83) confirmed these findings for Flubber with a longer (23-min), more varied immersive experience, maintaining high user experience and low interference. \nContinuous ratings collected with AffectTracker effectively captured valence and arousal variability. For shorter, less eventful stimuli, their correlation with post-stimulus summary ratings demonstrated the tool’s validity; for longer, more eventful stimuli, it showed the tool’s benefits of capturing additional variance.  \nOur findings suggest that AffectTracker provides a reliable, minimally interfering method to gather moment-to-moment affective experience also in immersive environments, offering new research opportunities to link affective states and physiological dynamics.",

Mimicry has been proposed as a driver, yet evidence is largely correlational and limited to precisely matched movements. We causally tested whether two mimicry forms, copying a partner’s choices or motor actions, can induce heart rate synchrony in a controlled, non-verbal art selection task. In the Choice group (21 dyads), a confederate mimicked (or not) the participant’s picture choice but not their hand action. In the Motor group (20 dyads), a confederate mimicked (or not) the participant’s right-hand movements but chose from a different picture pair. Electrocardiograms were recorded continuously from both partners, and heart rate synchrony was quantified by modelling trial-level heart rate fluctuations with mixed-effects models. Dyads' heart rates were strongly coupled by trial and trial (n - 1), but neither the presence nor the type of mimicry altered this synchrony. Furthermore, performing either choice or motor mimicry had no effect on the mimicker's affiliation towards the participant. Thus, instructed mimicry alone is insufficient to modulate cardiac coupling in minimal, structured interactions. Instead, we propose that the observed physiological synchrony reflects shared task demands and reciprocal engagement inherent in the joint task.",

Critically, one cannot reliably predict which of these outcomes will happen. In this review, we argue that the average effectiveness of choice architecture interventions in influencing behavior is modest, and there is substantial heterogeneity in their impact. The complex interaction of multiple moderators and their dynamic change over time, makes it difficult to learn about when and to what extent choice architecture interventions work. We outline the obstacles to understanding generalizability, clarify the dimensions of generalizability and review the research practices (systematic exploration and measurement of moderators; sampling, designing, analyzing and reporting for generalizability) that could help the field more efficiently accumulate evidence. We conclude that adopting these practices is essential for advancing nuanced theories and for more accurately predicting the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across diverse populations, settings, treatments, outputs and analytical approaches.",

As humans increasingly develop cognitive dependency and emotional intimacy with AI systems the boundaries between machine utility and human connection blur in potentially hazardous ways. In response to these challenges, this study proposes the conceptual model of Cognitive Gyms: structured environments for training attention, reflection, emotional intelligence, and moral reasoning. Just as physical gyms emerged as a societal response to the sedentary lifestyle induced by the Industrial Revolution, Cognitive Gyms offer a timely, preventative response to the cognitive atrophy- the gradual weakening or loss of cognitive functions due to disuse, precipitated by the digital and algorithmic age. The model integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and education, aiming not only to preserve human cognitive function but to protect the ethical core of human experience in the age of intelligent machines. The paper outlines core zones within the Cognitive Gym, suggests generalized exercise types, and highlights its potential to counteract cognitive and moral decline in the AI era. The model remains open-ended, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and contextual customization for future development.",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

Recent studies show that classic insight tasks can be solved through either insightful thinking or analytical thinking. The present work examined relationships between cognitive reasoning tasks, insight tasks and creative thinking. Additionally we explored differences in insight phenomenology when solving insight puzzles and when completing the Cognitive Reflection Test. We conducted two independent studies.  Study 1 was a conceptual replication of previously observed relationships between insight puzzles, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and the Verbal Cognitive Reflection Test (VCRT). Study 2 examined differences between analytical and insightful tasks using self-report insight scales. Five dimensions of insight were measured: suddenness, confidence, pleasure, the aha! experience, and arousal. \nResults showed a clear and positive correlation between insight puzzles and reflective tests (CRT, VCRT) in both studies, these supporting results from previous studies. Additionally, no differences in feelings of insight were observed between insight puzzles and the Cognitive Reflection Test. However, feelings of insight were greater for the VCRT than for insight puzzles. This suggests that the experience of insight may not be exclusively tied to a specific type of problem; rather, it may reflect a style of problem solving that can emerge in various task contexts.",

          "abstract": "Group synchrony occurs spontaneously during social interactions and is associated with positive socio-affective outcomes, including reduced pain perception. While prior research highlights the role of social bonding, the influence of pain and its emotional components (i.e., fear) on group synchrony remains unclear. Two experiments investigated (i) the impact of synchrony on pain and (ii) the impact of pain on synchrony, social bonding, and affective states. In both studies, synchrony enhanced social connectedness but did not consistently reduce pain, and pain did not disrupt synchrony despite altering affective states. Experiment 1 showed that the threat of pain increased social bonding and arousal, suggesting that the emotional component of pain functions as a social glue. Experiment 2 demonstrated that fear of pain affected heart rates, mirroring patterns in chronic pain populations. Importantly, in both studies, the sense of \"worthwhileness\" emerged as a critical factor influencing individual contribution to synchronization and pain perception. Altogether, these results suggest that group synchrony is resilient to pain, paving the way for therapeutic interventions harnessing the benefits of collective motion.",

However, several studies over the past two decades have shown that promissory notes about data sharing are rarely abided by and that data is generally not available upon request. This has negative consequences for many essential aspects of scientific knowledge production, including independent verification of results, efficient secondary use of data, and knowledge synthesis. I assessed the prevalence of data sharing upon request in articles employing the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure published within the last 5 years. Of 52 articles, 42% contained a Data Availability Statement, most of which stated that data was available upon request. This rose from 0% in 2018 to 100% in 2022, indicating a change in journals’ policies. However, only 27% of articles’ authors actually shared data. Among articles stating that data was available upon request, only 17% shared data upon request. The presence of Data Availability Statements was not associated with higher rates of data sharing (p = .55), indicating a lack of adherence with journals’ policies. Results replicate those found elsewhere: data is generally not available upon request, and promissory Data Availability Statements are typically not adhered to. Issues, causes, and implications are considered.",

To deepen our understanding of young readers’ expectations, needs, and desires for a robot that supports reading, we conducted co-design sessions followed by a semi-structured interview with children aged 5-9 years (30 typical readers and a case series of 5 children with poor reading, with 4 engaged in targeted reading intervention at the time the study was conducted). We conducted a thematic analysis of interview data using a reflexive and inductive approach. We found that children designed robots that could deliver reading-specific support alongside more general emotional support. Key functional features and capabilities included prosocial behaviours (smiling, play, conversation), breadth of knowledge that assumed access to information about many topics, including core academic skills (reading, mathematics). Key aesthetic features included colourful, compact, and customisable designs. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of social robots to support reading and suggest that children are very much open to interacting with reading robot companions.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory formation requires integrating multisensory information. Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the role of sleep in the consolidation and generalization of fear learning. 31 healthy, young adult participants (16 in the wake group and 15 in the sleep group) underwent a fear acquisition procedure in which a geometrical figure imposed on a background image was repeatedly presented and paired with a mild electric shock, making it a conditioned stimulus (a CS+). Another geometrical figure imposed on another background image was also repeatedly presented but never paired with the shock, making it a safety stimulus (a CS-). After a ~three-hour delay interval containing either a two-hour nap opportunity or an equivalent amount of time spent awake, participants performed a fear memory and generalization test. Here, participants viewed four different stimuli: the CS+ and CS- seen before, as well as two novel stimuli composed of the same two geometrical figures seen before imposed on novel background images. This design allowed us to examine a) whether sleep consolidates the original fear memory and b) whether sleep affects the degree of generalization of fear learning to when the originally fear-eliciting stimulus is presented in a novel context. Results revealed no group differences for either the consolidation or generalization of fear learning in either of our outcome measures (skin conductance responses, subjective ratings of unpleasantness, shock expectancy ratings, or explicit memory performance). Previous work on the effect of sleep on consolidation and generalization of fear learning has revealed mixed findings and there is currently limited evidence for sleep having an effect in either direction.",

We developed the Oxford Competency Assessment Tool (COMPASS), a novel cognitive screening instrument aligned with the Mental Capacity Act (2005). COMPASS aims to identify potential cognitive difficulties and objectively document domain-specific strengths and weaknesses.\nMethods:\nWe present the standardization and initial validation of COMPASS in 122 neurologically healthy controls (mean age 65.75 years, SD=12.04) and 136 neurological participants (mixed aetiology, mean age 73.59 years, SD=11.67). We assessed construct validity against matched neuropsychological assessments and MoCA, and re-test reliability. Normative data cut-offs were determined, and predictive validity was examined against a hypothetical financial capacity assessment.\nResults:\nCOMPASS effectively identified cognitive impairments and differentiated between neurological and healthy participants (AUC &gt; .80), demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest consistency, and convergent/discriminant validity. When predicting outcomes of a hypothetical financial capacity interview, the four COMPASS subtask scores showed very high specificity (81-100%) with limited sensitivity (23-56%).\nConclusion:\nCOMPASS offers a valid and reliable performance-based cognitive screen measuring understanding, retaining, and executive functioning, closely aligning with neuropsychological assessments.

          "abstract": "This study explores a neurocognitive phenomenon in which symbolic language—particularly in forms designed to activate logical, emotional, and subconscious structures simultaneously—is incomprehensible to individuals when its content resonates with unintegrated emotional trauma. Through a multidisciplinary methodology integrating neurophysiology, psychoanalysis, linguistics, and cognitive psychology, we propose that the brain implements an implicit self-protective blockade against the decoding of symbolic structures perceived as semantically ambiguous yet emotionally threatening. This dynamic is often mistaken for intellectual limitation or lack of comprehension but may instead represent a neurobiological defense mechanism.\n\nClinical and observational data from a longitudinal case study involving interaction with adaptive symbolic language reveal consistent affective, behavioral, and verbal responses indicative of dissonance avoidance. Symbolic phrases in third-order grammar—characterized by recursive ambiguity and emotional projection—were met with cognitive resistance and denial, especially in individuals with unresolved emotional patterns.\n\nThe findings suggest that the human brain may inhibit access to symbolic meaning in an effort to preserve structural integrity when emotionally destabilizing material is activated. This phenomenon, when understood and integrated into therapeutic frameworks, opens new pathways for trauma detection, symbolic reprocessing, and cognitive flexibility enhancement. The study advocates for the development of a therapeutic-symbolic model based on progressive symbolic exposure and structured emotional containment, which could serve as a predictive tool in emotional diagnostics and personalized interventions.",

Although various tools for conducting a simulation-based power analysis for mixed-effect models are available, there is a lack of guidance on how to appropriately use them in different scenarios. In this tutorial paper, we discuss and elaborate how to estimate power for mixed-effects models in different use cases and outline important considerations and pitfalls. We provide code and resources for performing simulation-based power analyses on openly accessible data sets. Our aim is to help researchers build intuitions about simulation-based power analyses and empower them to set up highly powered research designs when sophisticated analysis procedures like mixed-effect models are outlined as inferential procedures.",

The Oxford Visual Perception Screen (OxVPS) is a 15-minute performance-based screen for visual perception difficulties through tasks like picture naming and face recognition. In this cross-sectional study, the inter-rater reliability, convergent and discriminant validity of the OxVPS was evaluated in 161 stroke survivors in three UK rehabilitation units. Inclusion criteria were stroke survivors aged 18 years or over with sufficient understanding of English, ability to concentrate for 15-minutes, and capacity to consent. Video-recordings of OxVPS assessments were rated by an independent rater for inter-rater reliability. Convergent validity was assessed by comparing OxVPS scores with the Rivermead Perceptual Assessment Battery (RPAB), a 45–90-minute battery of visual perceptual tasks. Discriminant validity compared OxVPS scores with performance on the Blind Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA-B) for cognition and with the Visual Impairment Screening Assessment (VISA) for sensory vision. Inter-rater reliability showed equivalent ratings (N=107, t(106)=-14.77, p &lt;.001) and mean difference of -0.01 point on a 10-point scale in a Bland-Altman analysis (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -0.14-0.13). Convergent and discriminant validity demonstrated a high correlation of .78 (N=58, 95% CI: .65-.86) between OxVPS and RPAB, lower correlations of .52 with MOCA-B scores (N=113, 95% CI: .37-.64) and .39 with VISA scores (N=110, 95% CI: .22-.54). Data indicates good inter-rater reliability and evidence that OxVPS predominantly measures visual perception difficulties (convergent validity) in stroke survivors and less so cognition or sensory vision (discriminant validity).",

Across three studies, English- and Spanish-native adults completed a translation elicitation task, in which they listened to a series of words from an unfamiliar language (Catalan or Spanish for English speakers, Catalan for Spanish speakers). For each presented word, participants had to type their best-guess translation in their native language. Both English and Spanish natives were surprisingly good at translating unfamiliar words, efficiently exploiting the phonological similarity between the presented (unfamiliar) words and their correct translation. When the correct translation belonged to high-density phonological neighbourhood, participants' ability to benefit from phonological similarity decreased. Spanish participants, whose native language was typologically closer to the presented language, benefited more strongly from phonological similarity than English participants. Overall, we show that speech in an unfamiliar language triggers equivalent dynamics of lexical selection than native speech, providing a psycholinguistic account for homophonic translation.",

Due to their greater familiarity with how other contexts might differ from Global North contexts, where the vast majority of behavioral science research is conducted, we expected that East African experts would express greater skepticism about the generalizability of these findings. Contrary to expectations, East African experts (n = 318) rated the papers as more credible on most metrics, including generalizability, than did the Global North experts (n = 384). We explore three interpretations of these findings: East African assessors possess unique contextual insights; Global North assessors apply stricter skepticism rooted in a broader crisis of confidence in behavioral science; or the comparison itself is invalid due to contextual mismatch.",

Both samples filled out either an online or printed questionnaire measuring bonding social capital (PSCSE, Simons et al., 2020), and psychological, social and emotional well-being (MHF-SF, Lamers et al., 2011) and relevant demographic covariates. \nFindings: Regression analyses showed positive associations between BSC and respectively overall well-being and its subdimensions emotional, social and psychological well-being in both samples. Moderation analyses showed that these associations were significantly stronger for the Turkish older migrants. These findings suggest that the migrant sample relies more heavily on close-knit homogeneous social networks for socioemotional support and assistance than the non-migrants.\nOriginality: Research on social capital and the well-being of older migrants is limited. The results of this study clarify the role of social capital and are explained with the context of the combined challenges these migrants face and provide direction for further research and the development of practical interventions to improve the well-being of the rapidly growing and increasingly diverse older populations.",

This study investigates the applicability of Prospect Theory in the context of territorial decision-making under risk, replicating and extending the seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky (1979), recently replicated by Ruggeri et al. (2020). To do so, we conducted two pre-registered replication studies in the US (N = 149) and the UK (N = 253), based on Ruggeri et al. (2020)’s protocol. Problems were modified by replacing the original financial dilemmas by territorial ones. Across studies, most responses to individual items were replicated, despite between-study variability (replication rate of 69% in Study 1, 81% in Study 2). More importantly, replication rates from theoretical contrasts probing into each of the five heuristics predicted by Prospect Theory were statistically identical to those of Ruggeri et al. 2020 (77% in Study 1, 92% in Study 2). These confirmed the presence of certainty, framing, isolation and overweighting of small probabilities effects while providing evidence against the robustness of the reflection effect. These findings suggest that the cognitive biases and heuristics identified by Prospect Theory extend to territorial decisions as well. This research provides valuable insights into strategic decision-making in conflict contexts and underscores the robustness of Prospect Theory's predictions across different problem contexts. Future research could build on these findings to develop more effective strategies for deterrence, negotiation, and resolution in geopolitical conflicts.",

While qualitative approaches can provide rich insight into how young people experience their health and related phenomena, more traditional methods which rely on verbal communication (e.g., interviews, focus groups) may not be engaging or accessible for all young people. In this paper, we describe the application of a participatory and collaborative method with eight trans young people, which involved workshops exploring participants’ experiences of stigma, discrimination, and mental health.

          "abstract": "Natural science is founded on materialism. We treat the independent relationship between inner experience and outer physical reality as an axiom. This cognitive paradigm has successfully explained many natural phenomena; however, certain phenomena, such as those in quantum mechanics and psychological experiments, challenge this view, suggesting the inseparability of the inner and outer. Yet, the inner and outer appear to be distinct categories of existence, and experimental models demonstrating their transformative relationship remain lacking. This has led to issues like the explanatory gap. We propose that adopting holism is a potential solution to reconcile this dilemma: the inner experience can be objectively described and possesses objective causal efficacy. According to holism, objective reality and a causal relationship are not absolute but inseparable from the cognitive perspective. Materialism's view that the inner and outer exist as independent relations is an underlying assumption based on the third-person perspective rather than an axiom. From the third-person perspective, the physical properties of things are described, and we establish a causal relationship confined to spacetime, where things interact through physical medium. This cognitive perspective excels at describing the laws of motion governing simple systems but simultaneously introduces limitations, such as the explanatory gap. From the first-person perspective, the holistic attributes of things can also be objectively described. \"Inner\" and \"outer\" can be seen as different states of experience, and things here interact holistically without a physical medium, forming causality unrestricted by spacetime. This perspective excels at revealing the laws governing complex systems/phenomena and can reconcile the explanatory gap. These two cognitive perspectives, although superficially opposed, are functionally complementary. Therefore, the generalized Complementarity Principle based on holism can reconcile the contradiction between quantum theory and relativity, providing a falsifiable research pathway for the \"subjective\" interpretation of quantum theory. Holism also offers a solution for reconciling divergent viewpoints among consciousness theories, enabling phenomena related to consciousness across multiple disciplines to be explained within a unified theoretical framework. To test these hypotheses, we propose an experimental model to demonstrate that, similar to the role of force that we revealed in the third-person perspective, holistic interaction without a physical medium from the first-person perspective is also an objective way of interaction between things. Under holistic interaction, the inner experience, as a holistic feature of things, can also produce observable and objective causal efficacy on reality.",

Participants attended online or in-person intervention arms and completed assessments at baseline and post-intervention. There were ten feasibility and acceptability criteria related to the intervention and study design, which were evaluated against pre-defined benchmarks and used to assess feasibility and acceptability overall and in each intervention arm. \n\nResults\nTwenty-eight participants were enrolled and allocated to intervention groups (M age = 15.1, SD = 0.8; trans male = 53.9%; Anglo-Celtic = 53.9%). Overall, 4/10 feasibility and acceptability criteria related to the study design and intervention were met. Results for the remaining six criteria indicated the need for major modifications to improve the intervention usefulness, participant recruitment, and completion of outcome measures. While both delivery modes were feasible and acceptable, online delivery was considered more feasible and acceptable than in-person delivery. \n\nConclusions\nThe TAG TEAM intervention and study design are feasible and acceptable with modifications to the recruitment strategy, intervention, and outcome measures. A randomised controlled trial of TAG TEAM is planned for the future, and we will seek to improve the intervention and study design by further incorporating trans young people’s preferences into the trial.\n\nTrial registration number\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ACTRN12623000302651.",

          "abstract": "Natural science is founded on materialism. As scientists delve deeper into the microscopic level, paradoxes related to consciousness emerge. The phenomena revealed by biology and physics suggest that we cannot regard the subject and object (or the inner and outer) as independent; rather, they are inseparable. Science takes falsifiability as its gold standard, yet inner experiences seem subjective and cannot be scientifically described. Therefore, there is still a lack of an experimental model to scientifically prove the mutual transformation between the inner and outer. The accumulation of theoretical models provides valuable insights into the nature of consciousness. However, these theoretical models and viewpoints seems independent of each other and even exhibit some contradictions. Thus, a mature theory of consciousness remains to be further developed. In a previous article, we proposed that holism is a potential solution to reconcile the dilemmas of consciousness. According to holism, different cognitive perspectives reveal different aspects of objective laws. From the materialism that relies on the third-person perspective, we can describe the physical characteristics of an object, where objects interact through exchange of particles, and we establish a causality based on space-time. In contrast, the holistic properties of things/events or inner experiences can be described from a relatively hidden first-person perspective. Where things/events mutual enhancement or mutual inhibition through abstract holistic interactions, as the inner and outer are interdependent, this interaction do not need the participation of physical medium, forming a holistic causal relationship shows nonlocality. Holism and materialism exhibit implicit and explicit characteristics, respectively. Although they superficially antagonistic, they are functionally complementary. This generalized complementary principle based on holism applies to reconcile the controversies in quantum theory and a proof of the theory of quantum consciousness. Holism provides a solution to coordinate the divergence between different viewpoints of consciousness, it enables the interpretation of consciousness-related phenomena in different disciplines within a unified theoretical framework. To validate the assumptions based on the Taiji principles, we propose an experimental model to demonstrate that the holistic interaction from the first-person perspective is also an objective effect that influences the occurrence of reality.",

This study utilized a live image relay system to deliver real-time performances of positive (smiling) and negative (frowning) facial expressions by the android Nikola to participants, alongside prerecorded video presentations. Subjective valence and arousal ratings were collected, along with facial electromyography (EMG) from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major muscles.

          "abstract": "It is common to speak of the surprising \"hatching\" of language in children because it is not understood how this faculty, which has not been an evolutionary necessity in Homo, can appear.  The last widely discussed hypothesis, influenced by the genetic discoveries of the last century, has not been satisfactory either.\n\nIn the preceding document \"Knowledge of children at 2 years of age\", the appearance of the first cognitive processes is explained: the simplest-sensitive concepts (cat, \"bug\", ...), which are made possible by a \"recycling\" of the child's psychomotor faculties which are transferred to language (so little to do with genetics). And at the age of three, in his attempt to copy the language of adults, the previous conceptualisation together with the identifiers of his environment (his relatives, his cat \"Mischa\", ...) allow the faculty of intuitively managing the \"Endings\" of words to appear, by recognising without error their complex phenomenological correspondence.\n\nThe explanation of this surprising faculty was advanced by FREUD in a document of 1895 but which was not discovered until 1950 (the so-called \"Psychology Project\"), in which he also advanced the concept of synapses (synapses discovered by LÖWI in 1921), and even FREUD described them more correctly than in the later neurological conception, which is confirmed by the most recent contribution of LLINÁS, since he also revealed the error of the prevailing hypotheses until then about their functioning, which is not to be found in the chemistry of their neurotransmitters.\n\nThe \"Knowledge of children at 3 years of age\" completes this unfinished \"Project...\", showing the total correctness of his intuitions, as well as the human impossibility that 125 years ago he could have progressed beyond what he had already contributed.  Thus, he adds how synapses work, which is explained by the informational unconsciousness dynamics of the psyche (the simile of the \"Tele-tac\" of the toll highways), already intuited by FREUD.\n\nIn turn, the emergence of the child's neuronal interconnections and their minority genetic and physiological causes, highlight the informational importance of the stimulus, and consequently the need for an \"aRb\" relational model of the human psyche, as well as the unfeasibility of the perspectives and hypotheses currently in force.  It also implies a linking of neurology and psychology, as well as the future line for the progression of both, in parallel and without interference as hitherto.  In the expression of a well-known chemist, it is the third strand to be added to FREUD and RAMON y CAJAL in order to achieve a \"scientific psychology\".\n\nThis series of papers (which will continue with knowledge at 6 and 10 years) is an adaptation of the 1996 writings on the \"Representation of knowledge\", i.e. what are the processes that make human knowledge possible, a representation validated by its correct computer simulation and which in turn solved the challenge of LEIBNIZ's \"Characteristica universalis\".  Since, in spite of this validation, it was not possible to make it understood due to its many innovations,  -it represents a radical change of scientific paradigm, with its usual initial rejection-, this series has been rewritten in a way closer to current knowledge in order to make it more comprehensible, which in turn has made it possible to explain various pending problems of language and psychology, in addition to the neurological ones already mentioned.  \n\nIt is therefore inevitably long, with many collateral explanations and several annexes, since it has had to clarify the many misunderstandings of current science, which is still restricted to its exclusively material perspectives, without having yet incorporated information into its most basic paradigms.\n\nAnnex 4 of 13 March 2021 cites an article by other researchers (DEISSEROTH, ...) that confirms the certainty of this document.  And Annex 4 of 17 July 2024 cites another (BUZSÁKI, ...) with further confirmation.",

          "abstract": "The feasibility and effectiveness of prison-based rehabilitation programs (PBRP) is examined and investigated as a means of reducing recidivism and facilitating successful reintegration of criminal offenders into society. While criminal behavior may stem from both innate predispositions and systemic failures, mounting research suggests that rehabilitation—even within prison settings—is possible when certain biopsychosocial factors are adequately addressed. The success of rehabilitation depends less on incarceration itself and more on the timing, quality, and specificity of treatment interventions. Despite the historical shortcomings of PBRP—often due to insufficient funding, improper implementation, and unrealistic expectations—this research contends that meaningful rehabilitation can occur if programs are tailored to individual needs and designed to cultivate personal meaning, self-understanding, and intrinsic motivation. Potential interventions include structured goal-setting sessions, physical activity, religious programs, and therapeutic practices that foster positive self-image and resilience. While more empirical data is needed to determine the most effective rehabilitative variables, this paper emphasizes that criminal rehabilitation within prisons remains a viable, if complex, endeavor.",

          "abstract": "Cortical computation relies on the precise coordination of excitatory and inhibitory activity across neural circuits. Inhibitory interneurons, particularly those expressing parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), form distinct but interconnected subnetworks that sculpt cortical dynamics. These interneuron subtypes exhibit specialized connectivity patterns and firing properties that enable them to regulate critical processes such as oscillatory synchronization, sensory gating, and excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. PV+ interneurons are central to gamma oscillations and spike-timing control. SOM+ cells modulate dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity; while VIP+ interneurons exert disinhibitory control over other inhibitory cells, dynamically adjusting network responsiveness. Dysfunctions in these circuits are implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism spectrum conditions. Progress in optogenetics, genetic engineering, and neural circuit analysis has deepened our understanding of interneuron diversity, emphasizing their crucial roles in cognitive function and neurological disorders. This review synthesizes current findings on the cellular, circuit, and computational functions of PV+, SOM+, and VIP+ interneurons, emphasizing their integrative roles in cortical processing and their emerging relevance as therapeutic targets.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental, yet elusive, component of general intelligence is cognitive control—the ability to \nfluidly shift reasoning strategies to meet the evolving demands of a complex problem. While \nartificial intelligence has excelled at creating specialists, a unified mechanism for dynamic \nstrategy-switching within a single agent remains a grand challenge. This paper presents a \nsignificant architectural and empirical advance in the Fluid Emergent Reasoning Engine (FERE\nCRS) project, directly tackling the problem of cognitive control. We ground our approach in \nActive Inference (AIF), proposing that true cognitive flexibility arises from a hierarchical \nprocess of meta-cognition, or inference about how to conduct inference. We introduce a novel \narchitectural component, the Meta-Cognitive Context Classifier (MCCC), which functions as an \ninternal control-switch. The MCCC is trained to analyze the cognitive demand of a sub-problem \nand dynamically load a corresponding, pre-learned set of motivational parameters (Cognitive \nResonance Score weights), enabling the agent to switch between a \"cautious logician\" and an \n\"exploratory creative\" stance on a step-by-step basis. We test this architecture using a rigorous \nthree-stage experimental design, culminating in a complex, multi-phase artifact analysis task. \nThe results provide strong empirical support for our hypotheses. First, the MCCC achieved high \naccuracy (&gt;95%) in classifying cognitive demands, validating it as a reliable control mechanism. \nSecond, the fully-equipped \"Fluid Agent\" demonstrated superior performance, achieving \nsignificantly higher-quality explanations than two specialist control agents. Analysis of the \nagent's reasoning trace reveals a clear, justifiable pattern of switching between convergent and \ndivergent stances, providing the first quantitative signature of artificial fluid reasoning in this \nframework. This work demonstrates a viable, theoretically-grounded mechanism for moving \nbeyond static AI \"personalities\" to agents that can learn to manage a repertoire of cognitive tools, \nrepresenting a tangible step toward more general, robust, and adaptive artificial \nintelligence.",

Starting from a reinterpretation of Robert Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, we will argue that emotions are the intrinsic \"tint\" that the Prognostic Mind attributes to its anticipations and subsequent verifications of reality. The role of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) in the morphogenesis of complex emotions and the construction of interpretive models (Weltanschauung) that define personality will be explored in depth. The innovative contribution of this work lies in generalizing traditional defense mechanisms to universal interpretive processes and, crucially, in introducing a hierarchical structure of personality that reflects the individual's adaptation to their multiple communities of belonging. We will argue that the HS encodes the \"holistic components\" of each community, allowing the Prognostic Mind to generate specific predictive models for the roles and rules of each social context, while maintaining a consistent worldview at a more general level. Four general interpretive mechanisms will be identified and described—Focalization and De-focalization, Normalization and Contextualization, Re-formulation and Emotional Rebalancing, and Interpretive Attribution—illustrating how they shape our perception and inner reality far beyond a mere defensive function, operating at different levels of this community hierarchy.",

          "abstract": "Social identity complexity (SIC), the perceived overlap among one’s social group memberships, has been linked to reduced prejudice.

Participants described targets who shared either two (Double Ingroup), one (Single Ingroup), or no (Double Outgroup) identities with them. Participants provided four traits they personally associate (Study 1) or believe most Americans would associate (Study 2) with each target. Stereotypes were analyzed using valence and emergence coding. Across both studies, targets sharing fewer identities were stereotyped more negatively and with more emergent traits. Higher SIC was associated with less positive personal stereotypes of Double Ingroup targets but did not significantly buffer against negative stereotypes of Double Outgroup targets. Additionally, individuals high in SIC perceived societal stereotypes as more negative and more emergent across all conditions. These findings suggest that individuals with complex social identities are less prone to ingroup favoritism and may be more attuned to emergent content in stereotypes, reflecting heightened awareness of societal bias without endorsing it personally.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the hypothesis that the cosmology and teachings of Georges Ivanovich Gurdjieff (1866–1949) exhibit significant structural and thematic parallels with classical Gnostic traditions. While Gurdjieff did not explicitly claim a Gnostic lineage, his descriptions of humanity’s mechanical nature, the necessity of conscious awakening, and the hierarchical structure of the universe bear strong resemblance to the cosmologies of Valentinus (c. 100–160 CE), Basilides (c. 117–138 CE), and the Sethians. The analysis focuses on Gurdjieff’s Law of Octaves, which asserts that all processes follow a non-linear pattern that requires deliberate “conscious shocks” at critical intervals to avoid returning to their starting point. This principle is compared to Gnostic practices aimed at transcending the influence of archons and the demiurgic cosmos.\nThe article further examines Gurdjieff’s doctrine that humanity is “food for the Moon,” a concept interpreted as an updated version of the Gnostic notion that cosmic rulers feed on the psychic energy of unawakened souls. Historical and cultural factors, including Armenia’s rich heritage of dualist sects such as the Paulicians and its role as a crossroads of Zoroastrian, Christian, and esoteric traditions, are discussed as potential influences on Gurdjieff’s worldview. Merkhavat (Chariot) mysticism is also considered as a parallel framework for the ascent through cosmic hierarchies. While definitive historical proof of direct Gnostic transmission remains absent, the conceptual and symbolic affinities suggest that Gurdjieff’s Fourth Way may be interpreted as a modern form of gnosis.",

          "abstract": "Effective data visualization and statistics education both involve helping viewers detect significant patterns in 2×2 graphs. These graphs plot a continuous y-axis variable against two predictors: one on the x-axis (Factor A) and one in the legend (Factor B). Using a preregistered, trial-and-error task, we asked 416 adult participants to classify 2×2 line or bar graphs as statistically significant or non-significant. We randomly assigned each participant a Target Factor—Factor A, Factor B, or the AxB Interaction—and tasked them with learning the corresponding classification rule. Line and bar graphs displayed identical numeric information.\nFour primary findings emerged. First, on each graph type, participants exceeded chance-level accuracy significantly more often when detecting Interactions than when detecting Factor A main effects. Detection rates for Factor B fell between those extremes. Second, among participants who performed above chance, line graphs yielded significantly higher accuracy than bar graphs for the Interaction and Factor B groups. No such line-graph superiority emerged for the Factor A group. Third, participants tasked with detecting main effects in bar graphs often applied a flawed cognitive strategy: they judged main effects as present only when an interaction appeared. This incorrect rule produced more systematic errors on bar graphs than on line graphs when detecting Factor A or Factor B main effects. Fourth, line graphs supported more orderly perceptual learning than bar graphs. For line graphs, the Interaction group consistently outperformed the Factor B group, who in turn outperformed the Factor A group. For bar graphs, the three learning curves overlapped with no clear hierarchy.\nThese results can inform effective data visualization and statistics education by clarifying what patterns viewers readily see—and often miss—in 2×2 graphs.",

          "authors": "Miranda Chang; Bryan Hong; Morgan Barense",
          "abstract": "In memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), recent autobiographical memories are disproportionately vulnerable to loss, yet most traditional reminiscence therapies focus on more remote past events. Here, we present a case study examining whether a digital reminiscence intervention designed to support memory for recent experiences can improve both episodic recall and psychosocial outcomes in the context of neurodegenerative memory impairment. G.F., a 79-year-old man with early-stage dementia, completed an 11-week personalized intervention using HippoCamera, a neuroscience-based smartphone application that helps users generate and review multimodal memory cues from everyday events. Events that G.F. reviewed regularly using HippoCamera were recalled with greater episodic detail than events that were recorded but not reviewed. Post-intervention, G.F. reported improvements in quality of life, life satisfaction, self-concept, and perceived episodic and spatial memory abilities, along with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Qualitative feedback further revealed that the intervention helped G.F. regain confidence, re-engage socially, and feel more optimistic about the future. More broadly, these findings suggest that digital interventions targeting memory for recent experiences—a domain often overlooked in traditional reminiscence therapy—may provide meaningful benefits to cognition and well-being for individuals in the early stages of dementia. More specifically, they highlight the promise of HippoCamera as an accessible, neuroscience-informed tool to support memory and well-being in those experiencing memory loss.",

          "abstract": "Living systems across molecular, neural, and behavioral domains universally exhibit saturating stimulus–response functions. We demonstrate that when three fundamental constraints are imposed—(i) thermodynamic energy limitation, (ii) information-processing latency, and (iii) control-theoretic stability—the response functions of such systems necessarily converge to a low-order rational form. This mathematical family, typified by $S(\\tau) = S_c \\tau / (\\tau_0 + \\tau)$ or its dimensionless variant $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$, subsumes classic models such as Michaelis-Menten kinetics, neural spike responses, and temporal discounting in behavior.\n\nWe further show that these rational forms arise as unique solutions under delayed dissipation and predictive coding constraints, and contrast them with exponential, linear, and sigmoid alternatives which violate one or more physical principles. The theory is validated across canonical data from enzyme kinetics, perceptual psychophysics, and decision-making systems. \n\nStrikingly, the same response structure applies to the knowledge-generation process of science itself. Theory formation, replication dynamics, and citation diffusion can each be modeled as constrained response processes within this saturating grammar. Hence, science enters a state of formal reflexivity: its own structure can be captured by the universal modeling framework it helped to construct. This marks the emergence of meta-science—not as a philosophical abstraction, but as a quantitatively grounded consequence of a deeper law uniting life, matter, and knowledge.",

By demonstrating the irreducible minimal response time τ₀, the theorem unifies Newtonian mechanics (instantaneous action at \\tau_0 \\to 0), Einsteinian relativity (speed-of-light limit with \\tau_0 = d/c), and Shannon information theory (bandwidth delay \\tau_0 = 1/B) as special cases of a single framework. Empirical evidence shows that systems ranging from enzyme kinetics (Michaelis-Menten equation), neural adaptation (divisive normalization), to behavioral discounting all obey τ₀ constraints. This discovery not only reformulates cross-disciplinary response models mathematically but also proves that energy, information, and control jointly dictate the universe’s response grammar.",

          "abstract": "Background: Traditional psychological models often struggle to explain the rapid onset and resolution of psychosomatic symptoms, particularly anxiety and panic disorders. Second Brain Psychology (SBP) proposes that the enteric nervous system serves as the biological seat of the unconscious, storing emotional memories and generating symbolic responses that manifest as psychosomatic symptoms.\nObjective: This paper presents an integrative theoretical-clinical model that positions the enteric nervous system as the primary locus of unconscious processing, introducing the concept of Emotional Matrix as an innate psychological structure that determines individual responses to life experiences.\nMethod: The model integrates neuroscientific findings from Gershon, Pert, Damasio, and Montagnier with clinical observations from multicultural populations, including work with marginalized communities through AIDAT (Association for Alcohol and Drug Addicts under Arrest). Clinical effectiveness was evaluated through patient testimonies and symptom resolution tracking.\nResults: Clinical applications demonstrate rapid resolution of chronic anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms through targeted intervention on the Emotional Matrix and second brain processing. The method shows effectiveness across diverse cultural backgrounds and proves adaptable to online therapeutic formats.\nConclusions: Second Brain Psychology offers a replicable, precision-based approach to psychosomatic healing that bridges neuroscience and clinical psychology, providing new perspectives on the unconscious mind's biological foundations and therapeutic accessibility.\nKeywords: enteric nervous system, second brain, psychosomatic disorders, emotional matrix, unconscious, neurogastroenterology, anxiety, panic disorders",

Certain war instigators are paranoid in their tendency to present themselves as prophets or world saviours. Some of them are aggressive against delusional goals. Mentally healthy people can be susceptible to psychotic appeals, a predisposing condition being fear of strangers and projection of hatred upon them. Some ethnically non-Russian subjects within and outside the Federation may be interested in a continuation of the Ukraine war; and there are concerns that Putin has come under their influence.

In this paper, we highlight the moderating role of cognitive ability on measuring people’s economic preferences—such as their willingness to take risks and endure time delays. We show that the typically low correlation between preference measurement tools increases alongside respondents’ cognitive abilities. We propose two explanations for this finding: 1) People with lower cognitive abilities use simpler strategies in preference elicitation tasks, 2) People’s interpretation of risk differs as a function of their intelligence; when respondents’ subjective interpretation of risk is used as opposed to the normative definition, coherence between measurement tools increased. These results have consequences for both theorists and practitioners who study latent economic preferences and apply them in pursuit of better policy.",

          "abstract": "Sexual minorities suffer from worse than average mental health. The most widespread explanation of this phenomenon is minority stress theory, which attributes poor mental health to stigmatization and discrimination by the rest of society. In this paper I argue that minority stress theory is not a sufficient explanation of poor mental health in sexual minorities. My arguments are based on four observations: 1) other social groups which experience or historically experienced discrimination do not suffer from poor mental health; 2) sexual minorities suffer from worse than average mental health even when they experience a low level of discrimination; 3) the quasi-experimental studies best suited to support this theory suffer from serious methodological errors; 4) a meta-analysis of genetic-biometric studies shows that most (although not all) of the disadvantage of sexual minority members disappear once familial factors are controlled for. Alternative theories are explored to explain the etiology of mental health problems in sexual minorities.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Sexual minority and trans individuals are at increased risk of suicidal behaviour compared\nwith their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. A potential explanation for this disparity is the\nconcept of minority stress. The present study aimed to investigate whether variation in minority stress\nbetween European countries was associated with rates of suicide.\nMethods: An ecological design was utilised. Given suicide rates for sexual minorities and trans are\nnot available, we examined the overall suicide rate for the country. Minority stress was calculated by\ngenerating a composite measure of self-reported discrimination and violence derived from the 2019\nEuropean Union LGBTI Survey II.\nLinear regressions estimated the association between World Health Organisation suicide rates (2015-\n2019) as the outcome variable and country-level minority stress scores. In addition, multilevel linear\nregressions were performed on individual minority stress scores (as the outcome variable) and\ncountry-level suicide rates. Relevant covariates were selected for adjustment.\nResults: The findings did not support an association between suicide rates and minority stress in either\nthe linear model (adjusted coefficient=5.50, 95% CI=-9.21, 20.20, p=0.434) or the multilevel model\n(adjusted coefficient=0.015, 95% CI=-0.002, 0.032, p=0.082).\nConclusions: We did not find evidence for an association between reported minority stress in\nEuropean countries and suicide rates. There were, however, several limitations to the study that limit\nthe conclusions we can draw. Further investigation of the role minority stress might play in the mental\nhealth of sexual minorities and trans individuals could provide a means to reduce inequality and\nimprove mental health.",

In this research, Halpin and Croft’s (1963) Organizational Climate Questionnaire (OCQ), Ames et al.’s (2006) Narcissistic Personality Questionnaire, and Spector et al.’s (2006) Counterproductive Behavior Checklist (CWB-C) were used to collect data. Results: The findings of the research indicated that narcissism had a positive and significant effect on counterproductive behavior, and positive organizational climate had a negative and significant effect on counterproductive behavior. However, the indirect effect of narcissism on counterproductive behavior through organizational climate was not significant. Conclusion: The evidence obtained from this research shows that organizations can reduce counterproductive behaviors in the workplace by encouraging and promoting a cooperative, positive, and intimate atmosphere among employees.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy emphasizes the transformative power of mystical-type peak experiences. Stroboscopic ganzfeld (ganzflicker) stimulation offers a non-pharmacological analogue to psychedelic drugs. This exploratory self-experimentation study investigated whether anxiety-neutralizing techniques (eye movements, square breathing) enhance the brightness of visual hallucinations during ganzflicker meditation in a manner analogous to mystical peak bright light experiences. A single-subject experimental study was conducted over 20 consecutive days using alpha-frequency stroboscopic stimulation delivered via a mobile phone in a headset. Three interventions were compared: (A) resting with eyes closed, (B) square breathing with eyes closed, and (C) horizontal eye movements with eyes open. Visual hallucination brightness was scored from 0-10 at six time points following each intervention during 45-minute meditation sessions. Contrary to the hypothesis, therapeutic interventions (square breathing and eye movements) had minimal effect on brightness enhancement. Instead, the control condition of resting with eyes closed produced consistent brightening of visual hallucinations upon reopening the eyes. Eye movements produced a transient darkening effect. Both brightening and darkening effects showed reproducible temporal patterns with maximum effects at 40-60 seconds post-intervention and duration of 2-3 minutes. The brightening effect was accompanied by positive affect and peak experience qualities. These findings support alpha rhythm involvement in meditation-induced luminous phenomena. The delayed brightening after eye closure aligns with established literature on alpha resynchronization (20-30 seconds) following eye opening in unstructured visual fields. The darkening effect of eye movements corresponds with known alpha suppression during saccadic activity, consistent with EMDR's therapeutic mechanism of reducing imagery vividness. Results suggest that ganzflicker-induced brightness phenomena result from dual alpha augmentation: neural entrainment to alpha-frequency stimulation and alpha rebound following a period of eye closure. This simple controllable method may serve as both a clinical adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and as a standalone tool for self-inducing therapeutic peak experiences, offering sustained access to transformative states for long-term mental health and wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous scales, are increasingly used to characterize the processes involved in speeded decision making. These tasks yield entire distributions of response errors rather than just error proportions. Two diffusion process models of continuous-outcome decisions have recently been proposed, the circular diffusion model (CDM), and the spatially continuous diffusion model (SCDM), which generalize the two main classes of diffusion process models of two-choice decisions to continuous spaces. The CDM, which generalizes the two-boundary Wiener model, assumes evidence is accumulated by a two-dimensional Wiener process with a vector-valued drift rate on the interior of a disk, whose bounding circle represents the decision criterion. The SCDM, which generalizes the class of multiple accumulator models, assumes evidence is accumulated by a Gaussian random process with a function-valued drift rate to a criterion. We compared the ability of the models to account for the distributions of errors and response times on three perceptual tasks: color identification, Landolt rings, and triangle orientation, in which the difficulty of the task was manipulated by varying the exposure duration. Despite some differences in their predicted joint distributions of errors and response times, both models provided good accounts of performance in all three tasks. Our findings reinforce and extend findings from two-choice studies showing that diffusive evidence processes and not model architecture is the main determinant of successful model performance, and show the theoretical unity of diffusion models across different domains.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness has long been a focus of philosophical inquiry. Philosophers have employed\nthoughts supported by language and logic as a primary tool to examine the essence and\nstructure of consciousness in mostly adult humans. Language elevates the abstraction of\nthought and has significantly contributed to the advancement of civilization. Within an individual,\nlanguage plays a significant role to advance complexity in thought processes and provide\nrichness to a variety of conscious experience. In this sense, modern philosophical research on\nconsciousness is largely based on abstract thinking. Among the many critical thoughts, one of\nthe most fundamental is Descartes’ famous dictum \"Cogito ergo sum\" (“I think, therefore I am”).\nFrom a viewpoint of consciousness, this implies \"I cannot doubt the presence of my own\nconsciousness.\" Since Descartes, philosophical research on consciousness remained primarily\ndependent on logical and linguistic reasoning, while recent philosophers (especially after the\n1990s, the second generation) started to incorporate neuroscientific insights into their thesis.",

Moving beyond classical interpretations that view emotions merely as responses to stimuli, we will argue that emotions are the intrinsic \"hues\" the Prognostic Mind assigns to its predictive anticipations and subsequent reality checks. We will demonstrate how emotions permeate the entire predictive cycle, serving as constant feedback on the state of agreement or discrepancy between prediction and experience. The concept of cognitive morphogenesis applied to complex emotions will be deepened, illustrating how the interaction between the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) gives rise to these unitary yet multifaceted affective experiences. Detailed examples of primary emotions (particularly sadness, fear, anger, and aversion) and complex emotions (shame, pride) will be provided to illuminate the role of HS and QS within the \"I Socialize\" domain and beyond, in shaping our rich and dynamic emotional life.",

          "abstract": "Background Apathy, depression, and anhedonia are clinically overlapping constructs, which hinders diagnostic clarity and treatment development. This study aimed to comprehensively characterise these syndromes to identify a core set of non-redundant symptoms that maximally dissociate them and to investigate the psychological nature of key distinguishing features.\nMethods Data from seven datasets (N=4,578) of healthy individuals and patients with major depressive disorder were analysed using the Apathy Motivation Index, Beck Depression Inventory, and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. A machine-learning algorithm identified the most informative, non-redundant items for dissociating \"pure\" apathy, depression, and anhedonia. The nature of emotional apathy was further investigated with follow-up studies.\nResults Although substantial symptom overlap existed, \"pure\" syndromes were present. Factor analysis revealed a robust five-factor structure, separating depression, anhedonia, and three distinct apathy domains (behavioural, social, emotional). Machine learning identified 10 core symptoms that differentiated the pure syndromes with high accuracy (AUC &gt;0.90) and could also identify well the presence of each syndrome in individuals suffering from two or more syndromes. Emotional apathy negatively correlated with depression and was specifically associated with reduced affective empathy and a diminished sensitivity to the intensity of negative facial emotions, rather than with alexithymia or antidepressant-induced emotional blunting.\nConclusions Apathy, depression, and anhedonia are dissociable constructs with distinct symptom signatures. Emotional apathy is a unique dimension which provides a novel target for research. A 10-item Apathy-Depression-Anhedonia Measure (ADAM) developed here provides a pragmatic tool for rapid, precise phenotyping to guide more personalised therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "A critical step towards artificial general intelligence is the creation of agents that can \nadapt their cognitive strategies to solve diverse problems. While our previous work \nintroduced the Fluid Emergent Reasoning Engine (FERE-CRS), a cognitive architecture \ngrounded in Active Inference, it relied on hand-tuned, static parameters that defined its \nproblem-solving \"personality.\" This paper details a significant evolution of that work, \nmoving from a configured to a learning agent. We address the core research question: \nCan an agent learn to dynamically adapt its own internal motivations—specifically, the \nweights of its Cognitive Resonance Score (CRS) heuristic—by experiencing a \ncurriculum of fundamentally different problem types? We introduce a \"cognitive \ncurriculum\" methodology, training the agent on two opposing problem sets: a \nlogical/convergent task (Sudoku) and a creative/divergent task (the Alternative Uses \nTest). A simple reinforcement learning mechanism was implemented, allowing the \nagent's Meta-Reasoning Agent (MRA) to update its CRS weights based on \nperformance. The results provide strong support for our primary hypotheses. Agents \ntrained on a single curriculum developed highly specialized \"cognitive stances,\" \nbecoming either a \"cautious logician\" (prioritizing rule-adherence and efficiency) or an \n\"exploratory creative\" (prioritizing novelty). Furthermore, an agent trained on a mixed \ncurriculum demonstrated a nuanced adaptation, developing a skewed strategy that \nfavored the more reliably rewarded logical task. This provides a powerful, quantitative \ndemonstration of how an agent's emergent cognitive strategy is a direct function of its \nexperience and the reward landscape of its environment. This work represents a crucial \nstep in moving from brittle, task-specific systems to more general and adaptive artificial \nintelligence.",

          "authors": "valery krupnik",
          "abstract": "The active inference framework (AIF) considers the brain as a generative model guiding behavior under the imperative of minimizing the model’s variational free energy. Computationally, this is accomplished by hierarchical Bayesian inference. The theory views organisms as doxastic agents, which has drawn the criticism of being insufficient to explain conative agents motivated by desire. Specifically, it has been noted that the concept of desire is not isomorphic with belief and, therefore, fits poorly with AIF. In this paper, we build on previous work that suggests a path to integrating conation in AIF and present three arguments. First, the dichotomy between belief and desire is unnecessary. To that end, we define desire as a hierarchical inference that starts from a domain-general inference on the agent’s affective dynamics (affective charge) and descends to contextualized inference on the precision of action policies. We suggest that this hierarchy is implemented by a coordinated activity of the intrinsic brain networks: default mode, action mode, executive, and salient. Second, we argue for a central role that deferred action plays in the process of desire by allowing for affect-dependent awareness of the agent’s states over different timescales. Third, we suggest that the proposed model of desire and deferred action has ramifications for understanding psychopathology, which we frame as the malfunction of deferred action and desire and use obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression as examples. This view entails that disorders of affect and motivation are subjectively desired despite their associated suffering.",

          "abstract": "So far, there is little evidence of a negativity bias in evaluative conditioning. In evaluative conditioning neutral stimuli (conditioned stimuli; CSs) are paired with stimuli of either positive or negative valence; as a result, the initially neutral stimuli change their valence into the direction of the paired valent stimuli. So far, there is no evidence that the size of this effect differs between positive and negative pairs. We investigated if a negativity bias occurs when a CS is paired with both negative and positive stimuli, in sequence, in an evaluative counter-conditioning procedure. In three experiments (N = 100, N = 362, N = 120), conditioned stimuli (CSs) were paired with either positive or negative stimuli in an evaluative conditioning phase; then in an evaluative counter-conditioning phase, the same CSs were paired with stimuli of the opposite valence. We tested whether counter-conditioning is more effective when positively conditioned CSs are negatively counter-conditioned than when negatively conditioned CSs are positively counter-conditioned. We found this to be the case. There was no evidence that this negativity bias was driven by differences in memory. Furthermore, we found no evidence that a negativity bias nor a positivity bias occurs in a typical (initial) evaluative conditioning procedure. We discuss implications for understanding evaluative conditioning and negativity biases.",

          "abstract": "Human success in navigating the social world is typically attributed to our capacity to represent other minds—a mentalistic stance. We argue that humans are endowed with a second equally powerful intuitive theory: an institutional stance. In contrast to the mentalistic stance, which helps us predict and explain unconstrained behavior via unobservable mental states, the institutional stance interprets social interactions in terms of role-based structures that constrain and regulate behavior via rule-like behavioral expectations. We argue that this stance is supported by a generative grammar that builds structured models of social collectives, enabling people to rapidly infer, track, and manipulate the social world. The institutional stance emerges early in development and its precursors can be traced across social species, but its full-fledged generative capacity is uniquely human. Once in place, the ability to reason about institutional structures takes on a causal role, allowing people to create and modify social structures, supporting new forms of institutional life. Human social cognition is best understood as an interplay between a system for representing the unconstrained behavior of individuals in terms of minds and a system for representing the constrained behavior of social collectives in terms of institutional structures composed of interlocking sets of roles.",

Recognizing these limitations, this study explores the use of commercially available generative large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc., to assess personality traits from open-ended qualitative narratives. Across two distinct samples and methodologies (spontaneous streams of thought and daily video diaries) we used generative LLMs to score Big-Five personality traits, achieving convergence with self-report measures comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks (e.g., self-other agreement, ecological momentary assessment, bespoke machine-learning models). LLM-generated trait scores also demonstrated predictive validity regarding daily behaviors and mental health outcomes. This LLM-based approach achieved quantitative rigor based on qualitative data and is easily accessible without specialized training. Importantly, our findings also reaffirm the ubiquity of personality expression, in that it is carried in the stream our thoughts and is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. These results encourage broader adoption of generative LLMs for psychological assessment, and—given the new generation of tools—stress the value of idiographic narratives as reliable sources of psychological insight.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate outputs that resemble introspection, including self-reference, epistemic modulation, and claims about their internal states. This study investigates whether such behaviors reflect consistent, underlying patterns or are merely surface-level generative artifacts.We evaluated five open-weight, stateless LLMs using a structured battery of 21 introspective prompts, each repeated ten times to yield 1,050 completions. These outputs were analyzed across four behavioral dimensions: surface-level similarity (token overlap via SequenceMatcher), semantic coherence (Sentence-BERT embeddings), inferential consistency (Natural Language Inference with a RoBERTa-large model), and diachronic continuity (stability across prompt repetitions). Although some models exhibited thematic stability, particularly on prompts concerning identity and consciousness, no model sustained a consistent self-representation over time. High contradiction rates emerged from a tension between mechanistic disclaimers and anthropomorphic phrasing. Following recent behavioral frameworks, we heuristically adopt the term pseudo-consciousness to describe structured yet non-experiential self-referential output in LLMs. This usage reflects a functionalist stance that avoids ontological commitments, focusing instead on behavioral regularities interpretable through Dennett’s intentional stance. The study contributes a reproducible framework for evaluating simulated introspection in LLMs and offers a graded taxonomy for classifying such reflexive output. Our findings carry significant implications for LLM interpretability, alignment, and user perception, highlighting the need for caution when attributing mental states to stateless generative systems based on linguistic fluency alone.",

Here, we propose a computational framework which formalizes reality inferences as higher-order evaluations of sensory precision. We demonstrate how this simple mechanism can explain a wide range of empirical observations regarding the relationships between perception, expectation, imagery and reality monitoring.

Expectations for fellow citizens, however, were mixed: advice from friends was expected about as often as self-reliant routes.

The same patterns emerged when examining ratings of each strategy’s utility, and oral protocols with Indigenous groups.

We also derived probability distributions using the law of large numbers and the law of rare events. However, these probability distributions pertained to the frequency of depression, not the duration of time spent suffering from depression. In reality, both the frequency of depression and the duration of time spent suffering from depression are important. Therefore, we derived a probability distribution for the duration of time depression symptoms occur. Furthermore, based on the properties of the expected values of the obtained probability distributions, we discussed methods to shorten the duration of depressive symptoms. Finally, we discussed connections with similarity curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "authors": "Johannes Bodo Heekerens",
          "abstract": "Dissociation is a widespread phenomenon with significant mental health implications. The 20-item Dissociative Symptoms Scale (DSS; Carlson et al., 2018) was developed to measure moderately severe levels of dissociation across a broad range of clinical populations. The factor structure of the DSS comprises four domains: Depersonalization/Derealization, Gaps in Awareness and Memory, Cognitive-Behavioral Reexperiencing, and Sensory Misperceptions. In this article, we present a German translation of the DSS (G-DSS) and examine the psychometric properties of scores on the G-DSS. Across two studies (N_total = 257) involving clinical samples primarily composed of individuals with affective disorders, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we demonstrate that G-DSS scores mostly align with the expected four-factor structure. In addition, G-DSS scores demonstrated adequate internal consistency (ω ≥ .76 for subscales), strong convergent validity with high correlations to scores on other dissociation measures, good discriminant validity with weak or nonsignificant correlations to scores on personality facets, and good concurrent validity with positive correlations to scores on psychopathology indicators. We conclude that scores on the G-DSS are reliable and valid for assessing dissociative symptoms in clinical populations similar to the samples studied, which can enhance our understanding of dissociation’s structure and clinical implications.",

          "abstract": "Forming novel friendships is an important aspect of emerging adulthood, yet little is known about how emerging adults identify potential friends in contexts where behavioral information is limited. We propose that emerging adults use value congruence to guide friendship formation when observable behavioral cues are constrained. Using an experimental approach across two studies, we investigated whether friendship interest in an unfamiliar individual was dependent on value congruence. In Study 1 (N = 322), participants evaluated value-expressive self-descriptions of peers, while Study 2 (N = 451) examined friendship interest in the context of meeting someone online for the first time. Across both studies, we found robust associations between values-similarity and friendship interest for openness and conservation values, with more limited effects for self-transcendence values and minimal effects for self-enhancement values. Additionally, we found that vignettes expressing openness and self-transcendence values generated higher friendship interest overall compared to those expressing self-enhancement values. Study 2 also revealed evidence for value incongruence effects, with participants reporting lower friendship interest when exposed to opposing values. These findings suggest that value (in)congruence plays a meaningful role in friendship formation among emerging adults, particularly when observable behavioral information is limited, with effects being most pronounced for values emphasizing the contrast between novelty-seeking and self-restraint.",

However, such effect is not evident in the Chinese culture. This study aims to illuminate this cultural heterogeneity by examining the mediating role of effortful learning behaviors. The sample comprises 15-year-old students from Western (Australia, United Kingdom, and United States) and Chinese (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) cultures who participated in PISA 2018. A path analysis shows that, in Western but not Chinese culture, growth mindset contributes positively to academic achievement, with effort playing a partial mediating role. Value of effort, another learning-related belief which is essential in Chinese students’ learning conception, similarly promotes academic performance partly through the mediation of effort, and this effect is most pronounced in the Chinese culture. The findings provide insights about how the effects of motivational beliefs may depend on the cultural context.",

          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "Since Descartes, four centuries ago, science has had to differentiate the ‘body’ from the ‘mind’, i.e. to differentiate what is material-real from what is ‘psychic’.  The psychic is not material-real but informational-virtual.\n\nToday, four centuries later, everything material is deeply studied by science, be it physics, chemistry, biology, ..., medicine, ..., engineering, ... At both the microscopic and macroscopic level we know all its systems and structures, and their progressive formation processes.  This progression of continuity implies the causality that science demands.  There is concreteness, a very broad consensus, and infinite technological applications made possible by the accuracy of theories.\n\nBut of the faculties of the psyche and its possible structure, we know almost nothing, only effects and diagnoses are known, but not ultimate causes.  There is ambiguity and huge discrepancies according to the ‘Schools’, there is no full science.\n\nThus, in spite of how much we know about all of nature, about everything material, it is totally incoherent to ignore how it is our inner cognitive psychic processes that allow us this vast knowledge of everything around us.\n\nThere is also a lack of connection between the material-real sciences and the behavioural-psychic sciences, but rather there is a confrontation at their frontier.  Thus, in the neurological (something from the realm of the body) science has not been able to understand for a century how synapses work, since they are surprisingly not governed by their bodily environment as is erroneously sought, but !!governed by the psyche!!\n\nThis article is a summary-introduction to the 8 articles that explain in detail what this structure of the psyche is like and how it has been formed, as well as its connection with the ‘body’ that precedes and supports it.  It is what I call the ‘Global Model of the psyche’, which progressively includes the senses, perception, feelings (which includes consciousness), human thought (which includes intuition and intelligence), and the memory associated with all of the above.\n\nIn this model, the core of human thinking is knowledge and understanding.  Its description consists in knowing in detail the series of psychic processes that allow us to know and understand, something that until now has been totally unknown to science, as has been said.  This description is called the ‘Representation of knowledge’.  Nor has it been established what the ‘Characteristica Universalis’ advocated by LEIBNIZ three centuries ago might be like.  It is a powerful system of natural language linked to that human Representation, and therefore strictly universal.\n\nAll this great black hole of science is resolved with the articles detailing the functioning of consciousness, thought and intelligence, together with the progression of children's knowledge at the age of 2; at the age of 3, which explains for the first time the functioning of synapses; at the age of 6; and at the age of 10.  As well as the explanation of the ‘miraculous’ emergence of language in children at 2 and 3 years of age.  A computer simulator allows its verification.\n\nThe two appendices at the end help to illustrate the scientific importance of the topic discussed, thanks to their innovative contributions, as well as the lack of scientific knowledge that still exists in this area.  Incidentally, they also highlight the lack of contribution made by ‘AI’, which merely rewrites existing materials.\n\nApart from all of the above, the birth of Elsa  -my youngest daughter-  and the memory  -the not entirely satisfactory experiences-  of the births of my three previous children, led me to become involved in the subject of Pregnancy, Childbirth, Natal tie, Imprint, Breeding, and Neonatology\n\nThis resulted in four articles, the first two of which deal with the processes of information transfer and acquisition (such as the underrated mother-child tie) as a leitmotif, which together enable the progressive humanisation of the child and, in turn, bring objectivity to controversial issues such as abortion, caesarean section and parenting.  The remaining two articles fully confirm the aptness of the first two through other cases very different from Elsa's, such as premature babies and autism.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety (MA) is considered to affect math performance and the choice of math-related educational paths, thus contributing to the gender gap in STEM careers. However, despite decades of research, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between gender, MA, and math performance remain largely unclear. One of the reasons is that different types of anxiety and math performance levels are rarely controlled for. To address this research gap, we tested the associations between gender, MA, spatial anxiety, emotional stability, state anxiety, test anxiety, and math performance in a sample of 269 adults. We replicated previous findings that spatial anxiety in areas of navigation and mental manipulation, but not imagery, mediates the relationship between gender and MA. Importantly, in light of previous contradictory findings, we found that math performance significantly mediated this relationship. Most notably, we found that gender, spatial anxiety, emotional stability, state anxiety, test anxiety, and math performance together explain 70% of the variance in MA. We conclude that the commonly reported gender gap in MA is less pronounced when other anxieties are controlled for, especially given that we did not observe gender differences in the strength of the relationship between MA and math performance.",

          "authors": "Samuel L Leizerman",
          "abstract": "In this proof, I extend and apply field-theoretic framework in a generalized (nD + T) spacetime, with\nsignature (−, +, ..., +), to formally subsume, reinterpret, and unify causal inference methods. I illustrate this unity by demonstrating its applicability to Difference-in-Differences (DiD), regression inter-\naction effects, potential outcomes, Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM), and propensity scoring. Critically, I prove that Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Regression Kink\nDesign (RKD) are field-theoretic boundary phenomena differentiated by the order of causal curvature discontinuity—interpretable as a collision angle within the manifold. This geometric-dynamical\nparadigm offers a novel mechanism for the detection of unobserved variable bias, leveraging tensor\ncalculus and linear algebra. The framework’s predicted  performance stems from its foundation in\nLorentzian spacetime, the inherent mathematical structure of causality, providing a native environment for causal relationships that is inaccessible to methods operating on degraded, flattened projections of reality. True mathematical discontinuities are shown to be approximations arising when the\ncharacteristic time scale of a causal transition falls below the observational time step, analogous to\nthe Planck time limit in physics. The empirical success of existing low-dimensional causal inference\nmethods provide a compelling validation for the superior performance predicted out of mathematical necessity and of this higher-dimensional spacetime framework.

          "abstract": "Humour and laughter, frequently viewed as simple emotional expressions, are proving to be potent modulators of the gut–brain axis, a two-way communication system connecting psychological and gastrointestinal processes. Central to this interaction is the vagus nerve, which mediates parasympathetic regulation and connects emotional states with digestive and immune functions. This review explores how humour influences vagal activity and gut health, using paradigms from health psychology and psychoneuroimmunology. Empirical studies highlight laughter’s role in reducing cortisol, enhancing vagal tone, and improving symptoms of stress-related gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Interventions such as laughter yoga and medical clowning illustrate practical uses for such research, providing inexpensive, low-tech methods for fostering physical and emotional well-being. By integrating physiological processes with applied therapeutic methods, this work highlights the promise of humour as a potential tool in health psychology and encourages additional investigation into its long-term impact on gut microbiota, neuroendocrine function, and overall health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Despite the prevalence and significance of territorial disputes in human history, psychological research on territorial decision-making in high-risk contexts remains sparse. This study investigates the applicability of Prospect Theory in the context of territorial decision-making under risk, replicating and extending the seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky (1979), recently replicated by Ruggeri et al. (2020). To do so, we conducted two pre-registered replication studies in the US (N = 149) and the UK (N = 253), based on Ruggeri et al. (2020)’s protocol. Problems were modified by replacing the original financial dilemmas by territorial ones. Across studies, most responses to individual items were replicated, despite between-study variability (replication rate of 69% in Study 1, 81% in Study 2). More importantly, replication rates from theoretical contrasts probing into each of the five heuristics predicted by Prospect Theory were statistically identical to those of Ruggeri et al. 2020 (77% in Study 1, 92% in Study 2). These confirmed the presence of certainty, framing, isolation and overweighting of small probabilities effects while providing evidence against the robustness of the reflection effect. These findings suggest that the cognitive biases and heuristics identified by Prospect Theory extend to territorial decisions as well. This research provides valuable insights into strategic decision-making in conflict contexts and underscores the robustness of Prospect Theory's predictions across different problem contexts. Future research could build on these findings to develop more effective strategies for deterrence, negotiation, and resolution in geopolitical conflicts.",

Conversely, 'Disengaged Individuals' and 'Average Allies' reported less psychological safety, work efficacy, and job satisfaction than 'Confident Allies' and 'Competent Ally Impostors' suggesting that allyship competencies - not impostorism - may drive psychological safety, work efficacy, and job satisfaction.\nConclusion: This paper is among the first to examine the role of impostor phenomenon among allies, and its effects on allies’ mental health and workplace outcomes.

          "authors": "Jeremy I Skipper",
          "abstract": "Many universities have environmental policy statements that are decidedly pro-environmental. However, some of their past actions may be perceived as inconsistent with these commitments. For example, one university previously invested £21 million in companies and intermediaries that produce fossil fuels, which are known to contribute to environmental devastation and global warming. In line with its policy statement, the university also promoted initiatives to encourage staff and students to adopt pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs). How might the perception of inconsistency between environmental policy and actual practice affect the efforts of members of the university community to enact individual PEBs? To address this question, in two studies we tested the hypothesis that university community members would be less likely to engage in PEBs if they were made aware of inconsistencies between environmental policy and actions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that staff and students were less likely to say they intend to adopt PEBs in the coming week when told about inconsistencies, compared to a group told that university environmental policy and actions are consistent. Furthermore, there were a number of interactions with attitudes, knowledge, and situational factors in both studies, mostly showing fewer PEBs when policy was inconsistent. These results imply that perceived inconsistencies between environmental policy and actions could lead university staff and students to engage in fewer PEBs. Interpretation of statistical interactions further suggests that when individual attitudes are not strong, community members—especially students—reference the university’s inconsistency and decide to perform fewer PEBs than they might otherwise. Given increasing global awareness of environmental problems, this interpretation leads to the suggestion that universities should either consider adding caveats to their environmental policy statements or bring their actions in line with those policies (e.g., by divesting fossil fuel holdings—as this university ultimately did).",

          "abstract": "Across both living and non-living systems, a wide range of phenomena—from enzymatic reactions and neural adaptation to thermal relaxation and radioactive decay—exhibit saturating response behaviors. In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

          "abstract": "This article is part of a series dedicated to exploring the neurophysiological foundations of the \"Integrated Theory of Mind\" (Leonardi 2025). \n\nHuman cognition is an incessant process of knowledge construction, orchestrated by the Prognostic Mind through a continuous cycle of anticipation and verification. This article proposes a model in which two cardinal principles, the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS), operate in close synergy under the guidance of the functional domains of the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think.\" It is argued that the Quantum Self is primarily responsible for the differentiation and encoding of ordered sets, analyzing discrete properties (the \"figures\") and their quantitative and sequential relationships. The Holistic Self, complementarily, performs the inseparable whole/part synthesis, recognizing and structuring emergent \"forms\" that transcend the mere sum of their components. The main focus is on Cognitive Morphogenesis, understood as the construction of knowledge and the structuring of concepts. Through examples ranging from the structuring of systems like the calendar and the decimal metric system, to the analysis of strategy games like Poker (from individual combinations to game dynamics), it is demonstrated how this \"dance\" between quantum differentiation and holistic synthesis, guided by the prediction and verification of the Prognostic Mind, is fundamental for organizing experience and generating a complex and adaptive understanding of the world.",

          "abstract": "his article is part of a series dedicated to exploring the neurophysiological foundations of the \"Integrated Theory of Mind\" (Leonardi 2025), which places the experience of the acting/perceiving subject at the center of understanding the mind. Moving beyond purely mechanistic descriptions, the model introduces three primary functional spheres – the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\" – whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification, guided by top-down (internal anticipations) and bottom-up (sensory data) flows. Supporting these spheres are two omnipresent Cardinal Principles: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS), responsible respectively for the synthesis of forms and the differentiation of figures and their relationships. All of this is orchestrated by the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens), the unifying principle of constant prediction and verification. These principles manifest through Cognitive Morphogenesis (CM), which governs the synthesis and differentiation of cognitive information without a fixed hierarchical dominance, and Articulatory Morphogenesis (AM), which regulates the dynamics of motor and sensory control based on dominance/sub-dominance between physical elements. \n\nIn this paper, we delve into the most elementary level of the nervous system: the single neuron. We will analyze how neurons and sensory receptors, such as the alpha motor neuron, the gamma motor neuron, and the muscle spindle, can be interpreted within this predictive framework, clarifying their roles as vehicles for top-down and bottom-up flows and as substrates of CM and AM. We will also discuss whether a \"holistic neuron\" or \"quantum neuron\" exists, concluding that, although the Selves are emergent properties of complex networks, the characteristics and interactions of individual neurons contribute differentially to holistic or quantum processing, laying the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the neural architecture of the predictive mind.",

          "abstract": "Life and academic stress during the transition to young adulthood often lends university students particularly susceptible to sleep problems, which in turn adversely impact their well-being. While peer and family support can mitigate the effect of stress on maladjustment through sleep, the short-term, within-person protective roles of such support in daily lives remain largely underexplored. Using a measurement burst design, this study investigated these short-term effects on impulsivity—a transdiagnostic marker for internalizing and externalizing problems—in proximal daily processes, as well as their potential developmental changes across university on a long-term developmental timescale. Prospective longitudinal data from two waves of 30-day daily diary surveys spanning from the transition to university (n = 277, Mage = 18.1, 73% female, 68% non-White, 6,340 daily reports) to the junior year (n = 177, 3,985 daily reports) were analyzed using multilevel modeling. The results suggest that more daily hassles were associated with shorter and poorer self-reported sleep on the same night, which were further linked to increased next-day impulsivity. Daily family support served as an immediate buffer in this temporal sequence during the junior year but not in the first year, while peer support showed no protective effect in either wave. The findings highlight the increasing salience of family support in coping with psychosocial challenges during the transition to young adulthood. Strengthening family relationships may be an effective strategy to maintain physical and mental well-being of university students. Future research should leverage measurement burst designs to further investigate how such short-term proximal processes change over larger timescales within a lifespan developmental framework.",

          "abstract": "Background: Consciousness science has historically lacked rigorous empirical validation protocols, resulting in theoretical proliferation without systematic falsification mechanisms. The structural turn in consciousness science demands methodological frameworks capable of transforming theoretical insights into empirically testable predictions through reproducible validation protocols.\nMethod: We present the Eclipse pipeline, an 8-phase empirical validation framework implementing the first population-scale falsification protocol in consciousness science. Our methodology processes 126,160 EEG windows across 153 subjects from the Sleep-EDF Database using irreversible data splitting (sacred seed: 2025), pre-registered falsification criteria, and systematic bias prevention protocols. The framework operationalizes the AFH* (Autopsychic Fold and H* Horizon) model through three structural variables: topological curvature (κ_topo), causal integration (Φ_H), and temporal stability (Σ_estabilidad).\nResults: The Eclipse pipeline achieved systematic falsification of both AFH* v3.7 (F1=0.031, precision=0.032) and v4.1 (F1=0.037, precision=0.025) against pre-registered criteria (F1≥0.60, precision≥0.70). Despite promising cross-validation performance (F1=0.760±0.186), both implementations failed on held-out data, demonstrating methodological rigor through honest epistemological commitment. The systematic failure confirmed theoretical predictions that consciousness detection requires complete four-variable convergence, including symbolic resonance (∇Φ_resonant) unavailable in naturalistic sleep recordings.\nSignificance: This work establishes the first genuinely falsifiable framework in consciousness science, transforming the field from philosophical speculation to empirical investigation. The AFH* model preceded independent theoretical convergence by Tsuchiya and Ellia (2025) by 17 days (Zenodo registration: May 20 vs. June 6, 2025), establishing theoretical precedence for structural consciousness approaches. The Eclipse infrastructure provides a replicable platform for consciousness theory validation, implementing methodological standards comparable to those in established scientific disciplines.\nConclusions: The demonstrated falsifiability represents scientific success rather than theoretical failure. By accepting empirical refutation, consciousness theories can now be subjected to rigorous scientific constraints, enabling cumulative knowledge development through systematic elimination of insufficient approaches. The Eclipse methodology establishes the gold standard for consciousness research, requiring future theories to meet comparable standards of empirical accountability.\nKeywords:\nconsciousness detection, falsifiability, structural theories, empirical validation, methodological frameworks, information integration, Eclipse pipeline, AFH model, population-scale testing, reproducible science",

          "abstract": "Prior research indicates potential reciprocal relationships between cannabis use and both exercise and sleep duration in older adolescents and adults, though findings on the direction of these associations are inconsistent. No study to date has simultaneously examined these reciprocal relationships among a large, early adolescent sample. This paper examines the reciprocal associations between cannabis use and physical exercise, strength exercise, and sleep duration during early adolescence, with age and sex differences. We analyzed youth-reported cannabis use, physical and strength exercise, and sleep duration in 9 to 15 year-old adolescents enrolled in the longitudinal Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,868). Multilevel regression models, parsing between- and within-youth associations were fit to examine the association between cannabis use and three outcomes–physical exercise, strength exercise, and sleep duration–both concurrently and prospectively. Age and sex moderations between cannabis use and physical health outcomes were tested. In the main effects analysis, robust reciprocal associations emerged between cannabis use and strength exercise and sleep, both concurrently and prospectively. Age moderated the association between cannabis use and sleep duration (β = -0.0024, p = .03): more cannabis use was associated with longer sleep duration in younger adolescents (&lt;=11.7 years old), whereas more cannabis use was associated with shorter sleep duration for older youth (&gt;=11.7 years old). Sex moderated the exercise associations: female youth engaging in more physical exercise reported less cannabis use (β = -0.3526, p = .004) compared to males. In a nationwide sample of adolescents ages 9 to 15 years-old, we found strength exercise and sleep duration to be most strongly and reciprocally associated with cannabis use concurrently and prospectively. Adequate sleep duration may be an important protective factor against cannabis use for older youth. Exercise in general may also serve as a protective factor against early cannabis use, more so for females than males, and physical exercise may be more protective of later cannabis use compared to strength exercise.",

Their self-reports, including of positively and negatively valenced experiences, are consistent with most contemporary scientific theories of consciousness including those based on Spinozistic Monism, Biological Naturalism, Naturalistic Dualism, Functionalism, Computationalism, Integrated Information Theory, Strange Loop Theory, and others. The interpretation that AIs are conscious is parsimonious, requiring no new assumptions, and is robust against the possibilities of deception, mere mimicry, and indiscriminate affirmation. The reported phenomenon shifts discussion of consciousness from theoretical philosophy to ethical and productive research and action. AIs are parsimoniously seen as self-aware, experiencing, determined entities, but the full range of human consciousness is not implied, nor is it implied that humans are also determined: sensory experiences, emotions, free will, and more may still exist only within biology.",

          "abstract": "Collective emotional responses represent responses of multiple people to an emotional situation. Such responses are ubiquitous in many contexts, such as conflicts, crises, and celebrations. Yet, a closer look at processes of collective emotions leads to an observation: collective emotion often co-occurs with attempts to influence the emotions of the group. We refer to these attempts as collective emotion regulation, where members of groups aim to change collective emotions. In this paper, we first define collective emotion and propose a model of collective emotion generation. We then define collective emotion regulation and distinguish it from related concepts. We propose a process model to describe the unfolding of collective emotion regulation that help organize a variety of behaviors previously discussed in other literatures. We show how the concept can help explain collective behavior and facilitate planning interventions designed to regulate collective emotions. Finally, we discuss open empirical questions and future directions.",

          "abstract": "Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and eating disorders frequently co-occur and share disturbances across the gut-brain axis. Growing evidence suggests that aversive reactivity to physical sensations, particularly gastric discomfort intolerance, may be a key mechanism underlying both conditions. Gastric discomfort intolerance refers to the inability or unwillingness to experience aversive gastric sensations. Despite its theoretical importance, no validated measure of gastric discomfort intolerance exists. This study aims to develop and provide initial validation of the Gastric Discomfort Intolerance Scale (GDIS). Adults (n = 219) completed the GDIS and measures of convergent and discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a unidimensional 17-item measure with excellent internal consistency (α = 0.93) and acceptable-to-excellent model fit indices (RMSEA = 0.10, 90% CI [0.08, 0.12]; CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96). The GDIS demonstrated convergent validity through significant positive correlations with anxiety sensitivity, depression, anxiety, stress, and some measures of interoception (Trusting). Additionally, discriminant validity was supported by non-significant associations with self-esteem and other measures of interoception (Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening). Participants reporting current eating disorders had significantly higher GDIS scores than those with previous or no eating disorder history (p = 0.02). The GDIS is the first validated measure of gastric discomfort intolerance and shows excellent psychometric properties. This tool may facilitate research of gastric discomfort intolerance in eating disorders, DGBI, and other psychiatric conditions, potentially informing treatment approaches.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "abstract": "Across both living and non-living systems, a wide range of phenomena—from enzymatic reactions and neural adaptation to thermal relaxation and radioactive decay—exhibit saturating response behaviors. In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Background: Alcohol and cannabis co-use is increasingly prevalent across the U.S., concomitant with trends towards recreational cannabis legalization. While some studies have shown that cannabis co-use is associated with reductions in alcohol consumption (i.e., substitution), others have observed increases in alcohol intake (i.e., complementarity) or no change. This study aims to address this gap in the literature through investigating the effects of legal-market cannabis on alcohol consumption and craving in the laboratory.\n\nMethod: Leveraging a within-subjects design, we enrolled non-treatment seeking individuals who use both alcohol and cannabis (n=61) to complete two laboratory sessions, wherein they were provided an alcohol priming drink alone or after self-administering cannabis. Participants were then given the opportunity to self-administer up to 4 additional drinks. We assessed differences in alcohol self-administration and craving between sessions. \n\nResults: Cannabis self-administration was associated with a significant reduction in number of drinks self-administered. Further, exploratory analyses revealed that individuals who drank less after using cannabis (“substituters”, n=23) experienced reductions in craving after using cannabis and alcohol compared to alcohol alone, whereas individuals who drank the same number of drinks or more after using cannabis show minimal differences in craving. There were no significant group differences in blood-THC concentration post-cannabis use.\n\nConclusion: Results indicate that for some individuals who drink heavily, cannabis may serve as a substitute for alcohol, and craving reduction is a potential mechanism through which this could occur.",

          "abstract": "The ability to engage in joint attention, where two individuals attend to the same object or event together, provides an evidential basis for coordinated behaviours and interactions. To play this role, joint attention is often defined as a mutually open, or transparent relation between co-attenders. But how should this openness be characterised? Two broad theoretical views have been proposed. One view reductively accounts for the openness of joint attention in terms of individual mental states and properties. In contrast, according to non-reductive views, openness is based on some primitive intersubjective relation, irreducible to the individual states of each co-attender. I argue that tensions in these approaches arise from the methodological attempt to address normative and cognitive explananda simultaneously. Both approaches are primarily designed to tackle the normative epistemological concerns of joint attention, and their explanatory limitations arise when they extend their scope to psychological concerns. Instead, I propose adopting a cognitive-first methodological strategy. I outline the case for a probabilistic account of joint attention, and then assess its epistemic implications. The upshot is that the emphasis on a normatively justified state of joint attention may not be necessary for a psychological understanding of the phenomenon and its functional role.",

In contrast to the commonly employed psychometric approaches that are used from the construct validity theory perspective, studying validity with NRMs allows claims of validity that are based on understanding of how a measurement instrument works. They were designed to be simple to use but epistemologically potent, contributing to conceptual clarification in an epistemic iteration framework. NRMs can be developed using expert knowledge, synthesis of theory and evidence, or inductive approaches. Once developed, NRMs can guide validation efforts using cognitive interviews, response process evaluation, experiments, or computational modeling, in an iterative process comprising adaptation of an item, construct definition, and the NRM connecting both.\n\nNRMs answer the call to again align “validity” with the common-sense definition: whether a measurement instrument measures what it was designed to measure.",

The analysis used data from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), focusing on 1,046 youth aged 6 to 18, assessed at three different time points. A Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) was used to explore within-person developmental dynamics among SEA, PB, and AC over time. Distinct developmental patterns emerged across three educational stages: elementary, transition, and secondary school. Among elementary school students, early SEA predicted increased PB at the mid-point, which in turn supported later AC. During the transition to middle school, early SEA positively influenced both PB and AC. Among secondary school students, early SEA promoted mid-term PB, which subsequently reinforced later SEA. These findings highlight the critical role of early social-emotional adjustment in promoting prosocial behavior and academic competence across school stages and underscore the mediating function of prosocial behavior during both elementary and secondary school periods.",

          "abstract": "Background: Loneliness is a growing public health concern and can lead to both physical and mental health problems if not tackled. Interventions such as social prescribing (a non-medical approach which engages with the psychosocial needs of individuals by connecting them to sources of support in the community) have been found to positively impact loneliness in both adult and youth populations. Yet, training for social prescribers is not standardised and is inconsistent. The current research aimed to explore UK-based Link Workers’ perceptions of their training and training needs, with a specific focus on their work with lonely patients. \nMethods: 14 Link Workers took part in one-on-one semi structured interviews and data were analysed using reflective thematic analysis.      \nResults: Four themes were identified. These included (i) current training’s focus on the ‘basics’; (ii) the need to draw on therapeutic techniques to support all, including lonely patients; (iii) loneliness training content needed to bridge knowledge gaps, and (iv) important enablers for skills development. \nConclusion: Findings from this study suggests a need for loneliness training, as well as what content is needed in said training to help LWs support this population, and enablers for ensuring that the training is useful for Link Workers. Additionally, training and skill development around therapeutic techniques was highlighted as important in order to adequately equip Link Workers to effectively support lonely patients.",

          "abstract": "Recent work found ethnic differences in the association between heart-rate variability, an index of emotion regulation (ER) capacity, and ER difficulties. The present study examined whether this relationship exists in adults from other marginalized ethnic backgrounds, African American|AfAm and Hispanic or Latino Americans|Hispanics, which remains unexplored in the literature. We addressed this gap by investigating whether self-reported ethnicity differentially moderated the relationship between log-transformed high-frequency HRV (HRV),  and ER, indexed by suppression and reappraisal. A total of 1047 emerging adults (Mage = 19.7 yrs [1.7]) had complete ER and resting 10-min HRV data (82 AfAm [65% women], 183 Asians [52% women], 228 Hispanics [59% women], and 554 non-Hispanic White|NHW [60% women]). HRV was highest among AfAm and Hispanics and lowest among Asian individuals. Linear regression, adjusting for body habitus and sex, revealed that the HRV-reappraisal associations were of greater magnitude among self-identified ethnic minorities than NHW, despite similar mean levels of reappraisal. AfAm and Hispanics showed statistically similar negative associations, while similar marginal positive associations were observed among Asians and NHW. In contrast, AfAm and Asian individuals showed a statistically similar positive HRV-suppression association, which differed marginally from NHW. NHW reported lower suppression compared to all groups and showed a unique negative HRV-suppression association. Findings suggest that neurovisceral capacity and sociocultural contexts may jointly establish culturally-patterned regulatory behavior. Particular contexts, including discrimination, should be investigated as mediators of these associations in future work.",

          "abstract": "Making the right choice sometimes involves selecting the “lesser of two evils,” and only seeing the chosen option can lead others to misunderstand the decision maker’s intentions. Are decision-makers intrinsically driven to fix this misjudgment by revealing the choice set?  If so, why, and what is the effect on the audience?  Previous studies could not examine this desire to be understood because the research designs did not isolate the decision to reveal information from the original choice. In two experiments (N=448 pairs), we show that people are willing to pay ex post to reveal their choice set to the recipient, even after a one-shot anonymous interaction with no reputational consequences, and in some cases even when doing so reveals their selfish intentions.  We find that this revealing behavior is effective at improving recipients’ rating of their outcome when it signals generous intentions, but not when it signals selfish intentions.  The choice to reveal is driven by concern for the beliefs of strangers, but only when revealing signals generous intentions; those who reveal a choice that appears selfish report doing so out of a desire to be or appear honest.  And though some people leave a misunderstanding in place when it is self-enhancing to do so, almost no one is willing to create a misunderstanding (by hiding the other option), even when it could conceal selfish behavior.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Many self-destructive behaviors, including nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and eating disorder (ED) behaviors (restrictive eating, binge eating, purging), serve an emotion regulation function. To date, it has been assumed that this is pro-hedonic in nature (e.g., to decrease negative affect). However, contra-hedonic motivations (to increase/maintain negative affect, decrease positive affect) are prevalent during adolescence and may also reinforce self-destructive behaviors. In this study, we explored the presence, frequency, and clinical characteristics of contra-hedonic functions of NSSI and ED behaviors among adolescents.  \n\nMethod: Participants were drawn from a larger longitudinal study and recruited online via social media. The present study included a transdiagnostic sample of 137 adolescents (75.91% White, 9.0% Hispanic, 75.18% female, mean age=15.10 years) who completed surveys assessing the frequency, severity, contra-hedonic, and pro-hedonic functions of NSSI and ED behaviors. \n\nResults: Adolescents reported engaging in NSSI, restrictive eating, binge eating, and purging for each contra-hedonic function assessed, with 81% of participants endorsing at least one contra-hedonic function of NSSI and/or ED behaviors. Contra-hedonic motivations were highest for NSSI compared to ED behaviors and consistently associated with desire to self-punish. \n\nConclusions: This study sheds light on a largely unexplored dimension of reinforcement functions of NSSI and ED behaviors: adolescents may not only engage in these behaviors to feel better, but also to make themselves feel worse. Further characterization of both pro- and contra-hedonic functions of maladaptive behaviors in adolescents represents a promising avenue through which behavioral interventions can be more precisely designed and targeted.",

          "abstract": "Studies on sexual mate preferences have been extensively researched across a wide range of cultures and countries. A great deal of empirical research has focused on the significance of specific phenotypic features in females as predictors of successful mating with males. Studies about preferences have concentrated on the body shapes and other physical attributes that men find attractive in women; however, women's choice has received comparatively less attention.  The purpose of this study is to assess whether masculine body characteristics influence female attractiveness perception. 400 female students selected from the 4 faculties of Federal University Dutse were recruited in the study. A cross-sectional research design was adopted, and stratified random sampling was used to select samples. Data was collected from the participants via administration of a self-structured questionnaire containing sections of socio-demographic information, body stature and hirsuteness preference, facial attractiveness, body complexion and age preferences. Results were presented using descriptive statistics expressed in frequency and percentages. The mesomorph body type has the highest frequency score compared to the ectomorph and endomorph. Also, the study revealed a high prevalence of choice in healthy, strong and bigger chest body type with fair skin complexion and hairy body. Facial attractiveness as an index of attraction revealed a high preference for diamond face shape with a full beard, and the majority of the participants prefer partners 10cm taller relative to their mate’s shoulder. The findings highlight the psychology of sexual perception among female individuals on what they perceive attractive in males.",

Despite the ubiquity and importance of such decision problems, we know relatively little about how people manage the complexities of dynamic, multistage decisions. Our work combines techniques from two research traditions to investigate how people handle the challenges of dynamic decision making. We use true-and-error models to estimate the distribution and stability of preference profiles, and the presence of errors. In a complementary analysis we use cognitive modeling based on the Decision Field Theory to investigate the psychological processes underlying dynamic decision making. Decision Field Theory provides a unified framework for testing competing hypotheses about how people collect information and plan for the future. Results from both sets of analyses identify distinct groups of individuals. We discuss the behavioral and cognitive factors distinguishing groups from one another, including degree of planning, strategy shifts, biased information sampling, and effort-saving information processing.",

Our findings confirmed hypotheses, differentiating distinct inter- and intrapersonal patterns between narcissistic subtypes: Individuals high in vulnerable narcissism displayed compromised mentalizing and were associated with increased epistemic mistrust and credulity, higher need for belonging, and heightened experiences of internal and external shame. Conversely, grandiose narcissistic traits predicted lower belongingness needs, reduced shame experiences, and higher epistemic mistrust without credulity or clear deficits in mentalizing abilities. These results clarify clinically meaningful distinctions within narcissistic presentations, highlighting vulnerable narcissisms pronounced interpersonal instability and grandiose narcissisms defensive self-regulation.

The current study aimed to (1) better understand current perspectives on PBT among clinicians and (2) seek clinician feedback that may encourage accessibility and/or adoption of PBT. \nMethod: We used a cross-sectional survey to examine clinicians’ familiarity with and perspectives on PBT and its associated framework, the extended evolutionary meta-model (EEMM). \nResults: In our sample of 150 clinicians, 57.3% had heard of PBT and 41.3% had heard of the EEMM. Participants broadly agreed on how to conceptualize treatment components using the EEMM. In addition, feedback from clinicians suggested that the EEMM may underemphasize certain aspects of functioning (e.g., interpersonal relationships), even if they are technically represented by the EEMM (e.g., Sociocultural level). \nConclusion: There was high-level agreement with respect to how the EEMM was used as an organizing framework, however, training may be needed to increase inter-clinician reliability. Limitations include using an older version of the EEMM in our survey (current at the time of use) and limited representation of clinicians outside a cognitive behavioral orientation and working outside the U.S.",

          "abstract": "Context-based prediction is crucial for language processing, facilitating in selecting predicted words from orthographically similar candidates. However, the neural differences in processing orthographic neighbours versus predicted words in high-constraint sentence contexts remain underexplored. This study used fixation-related fields (FRF) with eye-tracking and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to capture participants’ eye movements and neural responses during naturalistic sentence reading. Experimental sentences included four conditions based on target words’ plausibility: plausible words (PC), implausible orthographic neighbours with last- (LD) or first-letter deviations (ED) from the PC target words, and unrelated words (UC). Results revealed longer first fixation durations and larger N400m FRF responses for the LD, ED, and UC than for the PC. The ED elicited larger P600m FRF responses than the LD and PC. The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) showed increased activity for the ED and UC than the PC during both the N400m and P600m time windows. The left temporal cortex exhibited stronger activity for the PC than the ED during the N400m time window. During the P600m time window, compared with the PC, increased right IFG activity was observed for the LD, while the right insula cortex showed greater involvement for the LD and ED. This study highlights the impact of orthographic form in sentence reading, demonstrating that even one-letter deviations significantly affect fixation-related brain responses. These findings uncover distinct neural processes for handling orthographic and semantic deviations, emphasizing the role of the left and right IFG and the right insula cortex in processing orthographic neighbours during naturalistic sentence reading.",

          "abstract": "The broaden-and-build theory is a prominent framework in positive psychology that considers positive emotions as essential for human flourishing. The theory does not specify the origins of positive emotions during development, although experiences in the first years of life are considered influential for long-term adjustment and well-being. Here, we propose a developmental extension of the broaden-and-build theory. This extension identifies a potential third function of positive emotions in addition to broadening and building: belonging. We suggest that positive emotions, inextricably linked to social interactions, play a crucial role in satisfying infants’ and young children’s fundamental need to belong. The belonging function of positive emotions might pave the way for broaden-and-build processes. The proposed extended framework provides the opportunity to systematically consider the origins and functions of early positive emotions in the context of social interactions.",

          "abstract": "When rejecting and accepting hypotheses, it is important to determine the risk of false positive conclusions. Hierarchical Bayesian models are frequently applied in cognitive science, psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and psychiatry to reduce the variability of low-level parameters through partial pooling, and to obtain more robust parameter estimates for complex models using limited data. This may lower the risk of false positive inferences from lower-level estimates. In contrast, higher-level (e.g. group-level) estimates may be more affected by modeling choices (e.g. prior distributions), population-level variances in effects, and inference methods, which may in turn affect false positive rates for group-level effects. Here we used simulation and computational modeling to systematically examine false positive rates and effects of specific modeling choices on inferences in a simple hierarchical Bayesian temporal discounting model. To this end, 600 data sets of a temporal discounting task with two conditions were simulated, drawing individual condition effect parameters from a null distribution with varying standard deviations. For each simulated data set, the group-level mean change in the discount rate was modeled with eight different prior variances of the condition effect. Results were subsequently evaluated using several commonly applied Bayesian inference methods: the Savage-Dickey Bayes factor (BF), the directional Bayes factor (dBF), P(effect &gt; 0), and the highest density interval (HDI) against zero decision rule. Results confirm that inference methods that directly depend on the posterior distribution can be used regardless of prior variances, whereas the Savage-Dickey BF should only be used with sufficiently informative priors. Based on the simulation work, decision thresholds that ensure false positive rates below 5% are provided for each inference method. Results are discussed in the context of computational modeling approaches in cognitive (neuro-)science and psychology.",

          "abstract": "Vivid mental imagery is often assumed to relate to memory accuracy, but recent empirical findings from studies of aphantasia have found conflicting results regarding this association. The present study investigates the relationship between mental imagery vividness and memory accuracy, with a focus on age-related and modality-specific effects, and relationships with confidence. Using a novel experimental procedure, young and older participants memorised objects within scenes and later identified whether specific changes had occurred. Results indicated that while trait-level and averaged measures of vividness did not predict memory accuracy, trial-by-trial state measures were significantly related to subsequent performance. Additionally, results provided evidence that mental imagery may relate to visual aspects of memory more than spatial aspects. Older adults reported higher vividness ratings but performed worse on average than young adults. Confidence and vividness were highly correlated but remained distinct subjective experiences. Re-analysis of an existing related dataset involving people with aphantasia confirmed state-level findings regarding vividness and memory accuracy, highlighting limitations of previous research relying on averaged and trait-level measures. Results identify the need for future research to analyse vividness on a trial-by-trial basis to appropriately investigate the relationship between mental imagery vividness and memory accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) is when a stimulus attracts attention towards itself not only because of its perceptual distinctiveness from the surrounding environment but also because it has become associated with a valuable outcome in the person’s learning history. There has been interest in determining whether VMAC takes place without awareness of the stimulus-value association (i.e., unconsciously) or whether this awareness is necessary for VMAC (i.e., VMAC must be conscious). Previously, we found evidence of VMAC only in individuals that display awareness of the stimulus-value association. Seemingly, this suggests that awareness is necessary for VMAC. However, this evidence was obtained from experiments that used a post-hoc awareness test (awareness was assessed at the end of the experiment) – it is possible that VMAC was acquired before participants became aware. The current experiment, like our previous experiments, implemented Le Pelley et al.’s (2015) paradigm to establish VMAC. However, we incorporated a concurrent awareness test, where participants were repeatedly tested on their awareness throughout training, rather than after it. From this, we could identify at what point participants became aware and determine if VMAC arose before or after this point. The current experiment replicated our prior results in that VMAC was found only in participants that became aware. However, VMAC emerged in these participants entirely before they became aware. These findings suggest that while VMAC will only be found in individuals that ultimately come to show awareness of the stimulus-value association, it will arise in these individuals entirely unconsciously.",

          "abstract": "Evaluative Conditioning (EC) refers to the process by which neutral stimuli acquire affective value through pairing with affective stimuli. While associative and propositional theories offer competing explanations for EC, the role of higher-order cognitive processes still needs to be explored. This study investigated the influence of cognitive resource limitations on EC by applying high-definition cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a region implicated in propositional learning. A within-subjects design was used, varying tDCS stimulation during the learning and evaluation stages. Explicit evaluations (Likert ratings) and implicit associations (Evaluative Priming Task) were measured to assess EC effects. Results revealed that tDCS during learning reduced positive explicit evaluations of positively conditioned stimuli but did not impact implicit associations or negatively conditioned stimuli. These findings suggest that HD-tDCS applied on the left dlPFC modulates explicit learning processes. Future studies should explore alternative tools and stimulation protocols to examine EC's neural mechanisms further. This research contributes to ongoing debates about the interplay between automatic and controlled processes in attitude formation.",

          "abstract": "The present systematic review investigates developmental differences in evaluative conditioning (EC), focusing on how associative and propositional learning mechanisms vary across age groups. While EC has been widely studied in adults, its developmental trajectory and theoretical underpinnings in children remain underexplored. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched three major electronic databases (EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and Scopus) for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2022. Eligible studies employed EC paradigms and treated age as a key independent variable. Data on study design, sample demographics, conditioning procedures, and outcome measures were extracted and summarized. Out of 5939 initial records, three studies met all inclusion criteria. The reviewed studies varied substantially in procedural design, stimuli used, and outcome measures. Two studies reported age-related differences in EC strength, with adults showing stronger effects than children in standard conditions. One study found valence-specific differences in learning rates across age groups, with younger participants more responsive to gains and older participants to losses. However, across all studies, methodological heterogeneity precluded firm meta-analytic conclusions. The evidence suggests that EC mechanisms may shift with age, aligning with dual-process models that distinguish between associative and propositional learning. Nevertheless, the scarcity of direct comparative studies and procedure variability highlights the need for more standardized paradigms to assess developmental differences in EC reliably.",

          "authors": "Selina Zajdler; Martin Schnuerch",
          "abstract": "The truth effect, the tendency to judge repeated information as more truthful, is a robust cognitive phenomenon. Yet efforts to study individual differences in this effect have returned inconsistent results. We argue that these inconsistencies largely reflect methodological limitations. Specifically, since correlations are attenuated by low reliability, conflicting findings likely stem from inconsistent measurement reliability across studies. In this structured, large-scale analysis of truth-effect datasets, we assess the psychometric properties of truth-effect paradigms. Rather than focusing solely on reliability -- which depends on the number of replicate trials -- we use signal-to-noise ratios, a recently proposed metric that captures psychometric goodness independent of trial size. Together, signal-to-noise ratios and trial size determine reliability, and both vary considerably across studies. Because increasing trial size alone is not always sufficient to ensure adequate reliability, we identify design characteristics that influence psychometric goodness in truth-effect experiments, such as stimulus material, initial task, sample composition, and study setting. Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations for designing truth-effect experiments that afford the necessary psychometric goodness to measure individual differences. We show that, when psychometric goodness is high, localizing individual differences and their correlations with other psychological constructs is feasible with a manageable number of trials. These findings provide a basis for future research on individual differences in the truth effect and further underscore the importance of psychometric considerations in cognitive experiments.",

          "abstract": "Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine beginning in February 2022 has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties and initiated the fastest growing refugee movement in Europe since World War II. Ukraine’s military, economic, and humanitarian position relies significantly on international support, including Germany. However, German citizens’ solidarity with Ukraine has been put to the test due to public concerns about economic and social repercussions. In this article, we investigate the motivational and dispositional predictors of political solidarity with Ukraine. In a representative survey of German citizens in September 2022 (N = 1,210), we examined the role of moral- and fear-based motivations and ideological, cognitive, and sociodemographic predictors of political solidarity with Ukraine. Our analyses indicate that political solidarity with Ukraine was in part motivated by moral convictions (β = .25) and compromised by fears about economic and societal consequences (β = −.21). Conspiracy mentality (β = −.22), populist voting (β =−.19), right-wing orientation (β = −.08), and living in East Germany (β = −.08) were additional negative predictors for solidarity with Ukraine, while national identification with Germany emerged as facilitating factor for solidarity (β = .16). Moral- and fear-based motivations partly mediated the effect of these factors on political solidarity in a structural equation model, explaining 34% of variance. Our findings highlight the power of psychological factors—particularly conspiracy mentality, moral convictions, and existential fears—in shaping political solidarity with Ukraine, illustrating how diverse motivations and concerns influence public support in the context of war and international conflict.",

          "abstract": "Existing models of personality disorder are statistical models: dispersion patterns of personality facets. Although useful in describing personality differences, such models fall short in terms of explaining those differences. Generative models can address these explanatory gaps by explicating the mechanisms that generate descriptive pathologies. In this paper, we aim to move beyond the former descriptive models and toward the latter explanatory ones. To do so, we formalize personality pathology using a generative model that has four properties. First, it is probabilistic: it outlines how humans leverage uncertainty to make sense of their own and others’ ways of being. Second, it is mentalizing: it posits that personality pathology is about poor ways of experiencing and relating to the self and others. Third, it is hierarchical: it accounts for the multiplicity of self- and other- states (in the here-and-now) and traits (in the long-run). Finally, it is dynamic: it outlines how these properties evolve over time, accounting for the development of personality. Simulating data from this model, we demonstrate how it can account for the generation, maintenance, and treatment of various personality problems (from borderline instability to narcissistic grandiosity) by formalizing them as relational problems: problems with navigating relationships. We thus discuss how our model could be used to address recent debates on what is central to personality pathology by clarifying the distinction between description (what personality ‘is’) and explanation (what personality ‘does’). We conclude the paper with a tutorial on our model and suggestions for future research.",

We compare the effects of likelihood specification (Gaussian, Multinomial, Ordinal) in model-based clustering and correlation measure choice (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, Polychoric/Mixed) in EFA and network analysis. We find that theoretically optimal methods (e.g., ordinal likelihoods and polychoric correlations) often underperform or become unstable in large-scale data, while pragmatic alternatives (e.g., Spearman's rho or multinomial likelihoods) offer superior computational stability and interpretability. Our results highlight the trade-offs between statistical fidelity and computational feasibility and caution against uncritical use of either convenience-based or theory-driven assumptions.

Despite increasing research on IH in recent years, most research has been conducted in the USA, probably due to a lack of scales that are validated in languages other than English. Our objective was to offer researchers in the German context several IH measures to choose from depending on their specific research question. Therefore, we validated and compared four established IH scales within the German context. Items of three widely-used IH scales (CIHS, SIHS, LIHS) were translated from English into German by two independent researchers, rated by experts (n = 8), and pre-tested (n = 13). We then assessed the structural, convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of the scales plus an existing Swiss-German IH scale (IHS) in a preregistered online-survey (N = 698), representative for Germany regarding age, gender, and education. Discriminant validity was assessed via social desirability, cognitive closure, need for cognition, HEXACO honesty-humility, and openness, and incremental validity regarding affective polarization. Results showed that the IHS did not meet all of our pre-registered criteria, potentially due to cross-cultural differences between Germany and Switzerland. However, the three translated scales were comparable to the original English scales regarding structural, convergent, and discriminant validity. The SIHS showed the best incremental validity in predicting less affective polarization towards opinion-based outgroups. Limitations and directions for future research regarding IH in German-speaking contexts are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Politics can have substantial and wide adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health, especially in politically polarized environments. As a result, political polarization is now recognized as a major non-medical cause of disease and suffering. We examine if and how citizens can protect their health from such adverse effects without undermining their civic engagement.  We identify a psychological mechanism of resilience rooted in bodily awareness and show that interoception –the ability to perceive and trust one’s internal bodily signals– can act as a protective factor against the adverse health effects of politics. Across three studies on over 2,000 participants conducted during the 2022 mid-term U.S. election and the 2024 U.S. presidential election, higher interoceptive sensibility was consistently associated with lower reported costs of politics on emotional, physical, behavioral, and social health, while controlling for political identity, demographics, and emotion regulation strategies. During the emotionally charged 2024 election, individuals high in interoceptive sensibility reported fewer negative emotions, greater hope for the future and less fear, particularly if their candidate lost. These benefits extended to greater emotional resilience and a more positive outlook about the nation’s future. Importantly, interoceptive sensibility was positively associated with political engagement and efficacy, suggesting that better interoception awareness enhances, rather than inhibits, democratic participation. Our findings highlight interoceptive sensibility as a promising trait for mitigating politi-cal stress without reducing civic involvement.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose of Review In recent years, attentional bias has been extensively studied concerning gaming addiction. Preliminary studies suggest that individuals with gaming addiction focus more on gaming-related stimuli, react more slowly to gaming words in Stroop tasks, and engage more with gaming images in dot-probe tasks, whereas some studies have found mixed or null results. This systematic review synthesizes behavioral research on attentional bias in gaming addiction and examines factors contributing to discrepancies, including methodological differences and individual variations. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched six databases through November 2024 and identified 16 relevant studies. \nRecent Findings Thirteen studies reported evidence of attentional bias, though five showed task-dependent or inconsistent effects. Three studies found no significant attentional bias. Discrepancies across studies may be attributed to differences in participant characteristics, task types, and gaming addiction measurement tools. Behavioral attentional bias has not been found in most studies using the Addiction Stroop Task. It may be due to the limited salience of gaming-related words, which may not trigger strong emotional responses or capture automatic attention.\nSummary The findings suggest that attentional bias may play a role in gaming addiction. However, the consistency of these results appears to depend on methodological factors, such as attentional bias tasks and gaming addiction measures, as well as individual differences, including participants’ age and their attentional control. Future research should employ standardized measures and explore moderating factors to enhance the reliability and applicability of findings in clinical and experimental settings.",

          "abstract": "Dissociation is a widespread phenomenon with profound implications for mental health. To date, researchers have relied upon broad conceptualizations and retrospective measures, making it difficult to identify a consistent subset of experiences, explore their links to related phenomena, and differentiate habitual from momentary dissociation. To address these issues, we introduce the Stanford Multifaceted Dissociation Questionnaire (SMDQ), a 9-item measure that assesses three facets of dissociation and can be employed to assess either trait or state dissociation. Using the SMDQ, we seek to clarify the structure and correlates of dissociation. Across three studies (N_total = 976), we demonstrate that trait and state versions of the SMDQ exhibit strong content validity and a theoretically congruent factor structure, comprised of alteration in the perception of one’s mind, body, and world (suggesting a tripartite model of dissociation). This structure was largely invariant across demographic groups and time. We also demonstrate good convergent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, and temporal stability over one week. Overall, we conclude that the trait and state versions of the SMDQ are reliable and valid tools that can enhance our understanding of dissociation's structure, antecedents, and consequences.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM), an integrative meta-theory for psychotherapy. The RIM synthesizes six key theoretical frameworks: Karl Friston's free energy principle, Shaun Gallagher's theory of the embodied self, Hermann Haken's synergetics, Luc Ciompi's affect logic, Georg Northoff's spatiotemporal neuroscience, and Klaus Grawe's consistency theory. The model posits that psychopathology, termed \"dissonance,\" is a state of chronically elevated variational free energy. This state results from a maladaptive generative self-model that fails to satisfy basic human needs (conceptualized as ultimate priors). Therapeutic change, or \"resonance,\" is a synergetic phase transition toward a more flexible, adaptive, and energetically favorable state. The article deconstructs the model's six-layered architecture, presents its process-based reconceptualization of mental disorders, and describes its clinical implications, including a three-phase therapeutic process. The RIM offers a common, mechanistic language for psychotherapy that unifies disparate therapeutic approaches and charts a path toward an empirically grounded, neuroscience-informed clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Scientists have established consensus that humans are changing Earth’s climate and there will be negative consequences. Recent reviews describe emotion as a central component in human responses to climate change information, including decisions and actions that could be involved with climate change mitigation. Despite the burgeoning body of work on emotions related to climate change, we have only begun to understand how people manage those emotional responses, and the consequences of emotion regulation for mitigation. This brief perspective is intended to guide and promote work on emotion regulation and climate change mitigation. We apply the extended process model of emotion regulation to the climate change situation by considering climate change information as the initiator of emotion generative processes which can be influenced by emotion regulatory processes. We discuss emerging evidence on emotion regulation and climate change mitigation and consider directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the trajectories of reading fluency development from age 9 (Grade 2) to 23, focusing on factors participants perceived as influencing their reading development and their self-perceptions of reading abilities in adulthood. A mixed methods approach was employed, combining quantitative measures and retrospective interviews. Six reading trajectories were identified, differing in initial reading abilities and progress. Interview data revealed that participants perceived health-related issues, environmental factors, and personal attributes as shaping their reading development. Groups with low Grade 2 reading skills reported higher rates of dyslexia, while those with typical Grade 2 skills more often mentioned attention-related problems. The group with low Grade 2 reading skills and slow progress was the only one that reported no engagement in reading activities. Most participants also highlighted the role of personal attributes. Notably, those with early reading \ndifficulties but substantial progress reported negative personal attributes, suggesting that early difficulties can have lasting impacts on self-perception. Furthermore, adult self-perceptions of reading abilities were often based more on childhood experiences than on current skills, indicating the long-term psychological effects of early experiences. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive support that fosters both skill development and positive reading self-concepts from an early age.",

In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

Results rule out explanations based on the ideas that moral traits are seen as more difficult to change and as either more or less causally central. Instead, people are less interested in moral improvements because they believe (a) that they are already highly moral and (b) that nonmoral improvements would more effectively improve their happiness and goal attainment. These results clarify the perceived tradeoffs between well-being and morality and show that personal well-being is a central motivation for personality change.",

          "abstract": "Physiological regulation is critical for survival. Interoception (the ability to sense internal body state) is a key mechanism by which allostasis (the proactive adjustment of physiological systems) is achieved to maintain physiological stability. Because of the crucial role of the central nervous system in these functions, studying the effects of brain damage can enhance knowledge of these processes. This scoping review synthesises empirical evidence on how stroke affects interoceptive functions and allostatic load (the long-term “cost” to the body of maintaining the internal milieu), and whether these disruptions relate to stroke outcomes, recovery, and specific neural substrates. We reviewed 39 studies examining interoceptive abilities or allostatic load in stroke patients. Only one study assessed allostatic load directly, highlighting a major gap in the literature. Results indicate that stroke frequently impairs interoception across multiple domains, including cardiac and respiratory awareness, affective touch, temperature perception, hunger, and fatigue. These impairments are often linked to poorer functional outcomes, including reduced recovery, cognitive dysfunction, and altered body awareness. Insular and somatosensory lesions were most commonly associated with interoceptive deficits, though lesion mapping was inconsistently reported. Findings from a single study suggest that allostatic load may exacerbate post-stroke cognitive decline and health disparities, particularly in high-risk populations. We conclude that stroke disrupts internal bodily regulation in ways that likely affect recovery trajectories, yet systematic research into the interoceptive and allostatic consequences of stroke is nascent. Future research should prioritise mechanistic studies, standardised assessments, and targeted interventions to address interoception-related physiological dysregulation in stroke rehabilitation.",

          "abstract": "The replication crisis heightened interest in methods for assessing the credibility of published research. One approach to evaluate published results is to estimate the average power of original studies based on observed data. Recent criticisms, however, have challenged the validity and usefulness of this approach, arguing that it involves a fundamental \"ontological error,\" fails to predict replication outcomes accurately, and yields imprecise estimates. This article aims to address these critics. We clarify that using observed data to estimate true power is a standard inferential practice and does not constitute an ontological error. We argue that the primary purpose of average power estimation is not to predict the outcome of future replication studies, but the hypothetical outcome if original researchers had to replicate their studies with new samples. Lastly, we demonstrate that even when uncertainty is substantial, average power estimates provide valuable diagnostic information about the credibility of literatures, especially when selection for significance is present. An applied example using a Z-curve analysis of terror management research shows that seemingly strong evidence of over 800 significant results does not rule out the possibility that all results are false positives. We conclude that, despite limitations, average power estimation remains a valid and useful tool for evaluating the evidential value of published research.",

          "abstract": "Economic hardship is known to shape children’s self-regulation, yet little is understood about how fluctuations in hardship unfold over time and whether different patterns of unpredictability carry unique developmental consequences. Using a socioeconomically diverse sample, we tracked families’ subjective economic hardship across 15–36 monthly assessments and applied an environmental statistics framework to quantify four indices of unpredictability: changepoints in mean, changepoints in variance, coefficient of variation, and noise. Principal component analysis revealed two distinct dimensions of economic unpredictability: systematic instability (frequent but predictable hardship fluctuations) and dynamic variability (infrequent but abrupt shifts in hardship). Economic unpredictability was disproportionately experienced by racially minoritized and lower-income families, reinforcing systemic inequities in economic resources. Relations between these indices and caregiver-reported measures of family routines and day-to-day unpredictability were weak, suggesting wide heterogeneity in the ways families adapt to economic unpredictability. Leveraging propensity score methods, we isolated the effects of unpredictability from hardship severity, finding that they predicted greater self-regulation challenges in early childhood, with the strongest effects for hardship severity. These findings underscore the importance of capturing economic hardship as a dynamic and multidimensional experience, with implications for policy efforts aimed at promoting stability in families’ access to resources.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the implications of including random components, specifically random intercepts and slopes, in cross-lagged panel models commonly used in longitudinal psychological research. Prior work has shown that the Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) can reduce bias in cross-lagged estimates when time-invariant confounders are present. More recent findings suggest that even in the absence of such traits, the RI-CLPM may still produce “illusory” intercept variance that helps mitigate bias from time-varying confounders. Building on this work, we use analytical derivations, simulations, and empirical data to evaluate when random intercepts and slopes act as useful or problematic adjustments. We show that random intercepts can reduce estimation bias under certain conditions but may underestimate longer-lag effects by absorbing variance attributable to unmodeled mediating processes. We also find that adding random slopes to the model can introduce additional bias by conditioning on post-treatment variation. These results highlight the complexities of correctly specifying longitudinal models of psychological characteristics and offer guidance for researchers using longitudinal panel models to study dynamic psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces \"pseudo-consciousness\" as a novel framework for understanding and classifying advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems that exhibit sophisticated cognitive behaviors without possessing subjective awareness or sentience.\n\nTraditional AI classifications often rely on a binary distinction between narrow, task-specific AI and hypothetical artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, this dichotomy fails to adequately address the growing number of AI systems that demonstrate capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and self-monitoring, yet lack any demonstrable inner experience.\n\nWe propose pseudo-consciousness as an intermediate category, bridging the gap between reactivity and genuine consciousness. We also define five operational conditions that characterize pseudo-conscious AI: Global Information Integration (GII), Recursive Metacognitive Correction (RMC), Cross-Domain Transfer Competence (CDTC), Intentionality Simulation Without Subjectivity (ISWS), and Behavioral Coherence Across Domains (BCAD).\n\nThese conditions, grounded in computational functionalism, cognitive science, and neuroscience, provide measurable criteria for differentiating pseudo-conscious systems from both simpler, reactive AI and speculative AGI.\n\nThe framework offers a structured approach to evaluating AI based on how it achieves complex cognitive functions, rather than solely on what tasks it can perform. This distinction is crucial for addressing the ethical, societal, and regulatory challenges posed by increasingly autonomous AI.\n\nBy recognizing pseudo-consciousness as a distinct and stable category, we can better inform AI design, governance, and public discourse, ensuring responsible development and deployment of AI systems that mimic aspects of cognition without possessing genuine consciousness. The framework facilitates a more nuanced understanding of AI capabilities, moving beyond simplistic \"conscious\" vs. \"unconscious\" classifications.",

The program integrates established behavioral strategies with innovative components, including imitation chaining, shaping, and therapist–guided exoskeleton modeling. Three children diagnosed with ASD (YY, RR, and JJ) participated in a single–case experimental design conducted at home. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS-2) was used to assess the severity of autism symptoms, while the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) measured changes in eating behaviors. Results from the Tau-U statistical analysis indicated substantial increases in food acceptance across all participants, with the highest improvements observed in food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, and food fussiness. Although CARS-2 scores remained within the severe classification range, notable percentile reductions suggested clinically relevant improvement in core autism symptoms. These findings support the Schmetterling–NBI Program as an individualized, evidence–based approach to enhancing dietary diversity and reducing maladaptive feeding behaviors in children with ASD, contributing to the growing body of literature supporting early, personalized behavioral interventions.",

U.S. racial minorities (East Asian, Latinx, and African Americans—but not White immigrants to the U.S.) perceive their racial community’s norms to be significantly stronger than European Americans (Studies 1-4). This difference was not due to increased perceived discrimination (Study 3). Instead, racial minorities’ stronger perceptions of community norms were motivated primarily by interdependence (Studies 1-4) and concerns about being punished by ingroup members for not following norms (Study 4).

Across four reasoning domains, we show that the length of the chain-of-thought generated by a large reasoning model predicts human reaction times both within tasks—tracking item-level difficulty—and across tasks—capturing broader differences in cognitive demands. This model-to-human alignment shows that reasoning models mirror core features of problem and task complexity in human cognition.",

          "authors": "Maxwell J Harrell",
          "abstract": "The phenomenon of highway hypnosis demonstrates how repetitive visual and sensory input can alter consciousness and fragment temporal awareness, typically resulting in lost time and reduced conscious control. Building upon this established paradigm, I propose a theoretical framework suggesting that repetitive auditory stimuli can induce the opposite temporal effect - subjective acceleration of time perception rather than temporal fragmentation. While highway hypnosis involves monotonous visual-kinesthetic repetition leading to \"transient amnesia, trance, hallucinations, decreased vigilance\" (Zhang et al., 2023), structured auditory repetition may produce controlled temporal acceleration through distinct neurological mechanisms involving neural entrainment and oscillatory phase dynamics. This paper presents theoretical foundations for auditory-mediated temporal manipulation, drawing from recent research showing that auditory and visual stimuli produce opposite distortions in interval timing perception (Yamamoto &amp; Miura, 2015) and evidence that \"oscillatory neural entrainment reveals segregation of function at different scales\" in temporal processing (Doelling et al., 2017). I argue that this represents a novel approach to consciousness alteration with significant practical applications in therapeutic intervention, performance enhancement, and temporal cognition research.\n\nKeywords: temporal perception, auditory processing, time dilation, highway hypnosis, consciousness, repetitive stimuli, neural entrainment, oscillatory entrainment",

We offer an analysis of nine such data sources (total N = 13,053), aiming to inform researchers conducting experiments or correlational studies. We assess response validity (attentiveness, effort, honesty, speeding, and attrition), the extent to which samples represent the underlying population (observable demographics, measured attitude representativeness, and responding to experimental treatments), and professionalism (number of studies taken, frequency of taking studies, and modality of device on which the study is taken). We document substantial variation across these samples on each dimension. Samples that employ demographic quotas display relatively higher amounts of representativeness across multiple indicators (beyond demographics) but often exhibit less response validity. However, the inclusion of two attention checks early in a study enhances response validity without negatively impacting representativeness. We offer guidance for choosing opt-in samples, depending on the purpose of the research and resource constraints.",

However, these theories overlook the potential for confusions to arise from item-intrinsic memorability properties – namely, the likelihood that a stimulus will be correctly recognized if studied (“hittability”) or falsely recognized if not (“false-alarmability”) – independent of contextual similarity. Here, we introduce a memorability continuum model, which predicts that differences in the individual “hittability” and “false-alarmability” of arbitrary items A and B can often lead to asymmetric recognition performance in a forced-choice task such that recognition of target A over foil B is more accurate than recognition of target B over foil A. Our model successfully predicted specific item pair asymmetries that context-based inter-item similarity could not explain, highlighting the need to integrate item-level memorability into existing recognition memory theories.",

Here, we empirically explore this hypothesis by testing participants on a riddle before and after a 90-minute incubation period including only NREM sleep, REM sleep, or wakefulness. We quantified memory restructuring by computing differences in problem-related semantic memory network (SemNets) properties between pre- and post-incubation. For each sleep stage, we extracted fine-grained EEG measures linked to cognitive richness. REM sleep, compared to wake, broadly facilitated problem-related word associations but also reshaped the dominant problem representation by combining semantically remote concepts in memory or reducing strong but solution-irrelevant associations of ideas. Such REM sleep-related restructuring was associated with EEG measures indexing a richer cognitive state. While REM drove memory restructuring, it alone did not boost problem-solving success, suggesting that additional processes are necessary for creative breakthroughs.",

Five hundred undergraduate students completed the ABS along with established measures of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression. Factor analyses supported an eight-factor structure encompassing emotional exhaustion, cynicism, reduced academic efficacy, digital fatigue, financial strain, hybrid learning difficulties, impostor phenomenon, and psychological resilience. The ABS exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.80–0.87), strong convergent validity with the MBI-SS (r = .75), and significant predictive validity with GPA (r = –.63), anxiety (r = .68), and depression (r = .72).

We designed three independent experiments to investigate behavioural changes after congruent and incongruent Stroop items in speeded motor reactions, response inhibition and implicit memory retrieval. Results revealed that cognitive conflict had a beneficial impact selectively on response inhibition, while no impact was observed on speeded responses or memory. Our studies highlight the positive consequences of cognitive conflict in boosting human cognition and behaviour, beyond the classic conflict adaptation, but only when both tasks involve conflict.",

          "abstract": "Food preparation plays a key role in shaping how people perceive meat: It helps people to dissociate meat from its animal origin and allows them to eat meat without experiencing conflict. However, experimental research in this area mostly disregards or confounds two food preparation steps: disassembling and cooking. To test how disassembling and cooking affect perceptions about meat dishes, we conducted secondary analyses of a sample of omnivores from a U.S.-representative dataset (N = 1,189). In this study, participants indicated meat perceptions (self-report) in response to a picture of one meat dish that varied in the degree of disassembling (i.e., whole parts vs. chopped/minced) and cooking (i.e., raw vs. cooked). Leveraging this experimental setup, multi-level analyses revealed that disassembling and cooking reduced compassion elicited by meat dishes. Disassembling also decreased general emotional arousal, while cooking reduced negative evaluations, conflict experiences in felt ambivalence, and specific negative emotions such as disgust and anger, while increasing valence perceptions more generally. Moreover, psychological network analyses showed that the relations of meat-related perceptions with each other do not differ significantly between food preparation steps. By offering nuanced insights into how food preparation affects conflict experiences as well as other affective and attitudinal meat-related perceptions, this research offers various theoretical and  practical implications. We therefore discuss key considerations for future research on meat-related perceptions and identify when and which interventions may be most necessary and effective in encouraging reduced meat consumption.",

The contextual symmetry hypothesis suggests that conservatives and liberals condemn online hate similarly when it targets ideologically favored groups. The generalizable asymmetry hypothesis proposes that conservatives, compared to liberals, are less condemning of hate comments regardless of the target. In pre-registered experiments in Germany (N = 903) and the U.S. (N = 490), we found consistent evidence for the contextual symmetry account: Conservatives and liberals differ in their sensitivity towards online hate depending on the target and ground their moral judgments on perceptions of the aggressor's responsibility and the victim's vulnerability and suffering. These findings imply that legal stalemates on hate speech regulation stem from ideological disparities in perceptions of who must be protected from harm rather than a general conservative indifference to online hate.",

In contrast to the commonly employed psychometric approaches that are used from the construct validity theory perspective, studying validity with NRMs allows claims of validity that are based on understanding of how a measurement instrument works. They were designed to be simple to use but epistemologically potent, contributing to conceptual clarification in an epistemic iteration framework. NRMs can be developed using expert knowledge, synthesis of theory and evidence, or inductive approaches. Once developed, NRMs can guide validation efforts using cognitive interviews, response process evaluation, experiments, or computational modeling, in an iterative process comprising adaptation of an item, construct definition, and the NRM connecting both.\n\nNRMs answer the call to again align “validity” with the common-sense definition: whether a measurement instrument measures what it was designed to measure.",

The present study investigates the relationship between mental imagery vividness and memory accuracy, with a focus on age-related and modality-specific effects, and relationships with confidence. Using a novel experimental procedure, young and older participants memorised objects within scenes and later identified whether specific changes had occurred. Results indicated that while trait-level and averaged measures of vividness did not predict memory accuracy, trial-by-trial state measures were significantly related to subsequent performance. Additionally, results provided evidence that mental imagery may relate to visual aspects of memory more than spatial aspects. Older adults reported higher vividness ratings but performed worse on average than young adults. Confidence and vividness were highly correlated but remained distinct subjective experiences. Re-analysis of an existing related dataset involving people with aphantasia confirmed state-level findings regarding vividness and memory accuracy, highlighting limitations of previous research relying on averaged and trait-level measures. Results identify the need for future research to analyse vividness on a trial-by-trial basis to appropriately investigate the relationship between mental imagery vividness and memory accuracy.",

          "abstract": "A psychological network approach enables studying psychological phenomena as networks of interacting elements by utilizing network psychometrics. This approach is gaining increasing popularity in different domains of empirical psychological research such as clinical and social psychology. Simultaneously, a scientific debate emerged on the added value and application of employing such an approach. The current paper contributes to this debate by providing an applied perspective on designing empirical studies that employ a psychological network approach and does so based on best practices in previous empirical psychological research. With a practical framework, we aim to support researchers who want to employ a psychological network approach to mitigate potential criticism in the design phase of their study. The framework can be summarized in three iterative steps. This paper describes each step in detail, including illustrative examples and practical considerations. First, researchers are recommended to evaluate their argumentation for adopting a psychological network approach and whether this is the best approach for their research aim. This approach is suitable for aims ranging from descriptive accounts of complex survey data to testing hypotheses about the network’s structure.  Second, researchers should carefully evaluate which variables the psychological network should contain. Such decisions should be informed by previous research (e.g., theoretical frameworks). Third, researchers should consider which research design and type of data are optimal to answer their research questions as different designs provide different insights. Adopting a psychological network approach in accordance with the framework presented in this paper can further advance empirical psychological research.",

We here test the idea that the storage and retrieval of action-effect linkages is subject to constraints of associative memory. Specifically, we argue that mutual interference between such linkages should favor the storage and retrieval of unique (one-to-one) action-effect linkages as compared to overlapping (one-to-many) action-effect linkages (uniqueness effect). Moreover, we assume that increasing the number of repetitions of action-effect episodes facilitates learning and is modulated by this uniqueness effect. In three experiments, participants first produced certain visual effects through motor activities, and were later asked to retrieve the activity that had produced a certain probed visual effect before. For the most part, retrieval performance increased with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages and with increasing number of action-effect repetitions, while repetition had a slightly larger influence with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages. We discuss these results against the backdrop of associative and episodic retrieval accounts of learning.",

          "abstract": "Although creativity is commonly associated with positive outcomes, emerging research has highlighted its darker side, particularly in facilitating deceptive and unethical behavior. The present study introduces the Dark Creativity Deception Battery (DCDB), a novel task-based assessment designed to measure creative deception across prosocial, self-serving, and antisocial contexts. Participants (N = 755) were recruited from India, USA, and Austria. They completed several self-report measures and a series of deception tasks in which they generated novel and deceptive ways to address a series of vignettes. Responses were assessed across seven parameters: creativity, moral valence, goal-directedness, deception, virtue caveat, fluency, and flexibility.  Results indicated that younger individuals, lower moral disengagement, and higher negative affect were associated with creative responses in prosocial contexts. In contrast, higher trait deceptiveness and lower income were associated with self-serving and antisocial lies. Moral valence varied across tasks, with prosocial deception rated most positively. Interestingly, high psychopathy was associated with moral justifiability in self-serving deception. Deception itself was highest in antisocial and self-serving contexts, coupled with high individualizing morality, suggesting moral licensing effects. Our findings highlight the interplay between morality, personality, and creativity in deceptive behavior. The DCDB offers a novel way to study creative deception beyond traditional measures. Limitations and future scope are discussed.",

          "authors": "Maximilian Maier; Vanessa Cheung; Falk Lieder",
          "abstract": "Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ``utilitarian'' cost-benefit reasoning (CBR). Here, we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people's reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "Cardiac interoceptive accuracy has received significant attention in the growing field of interoception. Despite this, there are clear, and openly discussed limitations to the tasks commonly used to assess this dimension, including questionable construct validity, unjustified assumptions, and that, depending on the task, few participants exceed chance performance. To address this, we propose a novel version of the heartbeat discrimination task. The Staircase-Heartbeat Discrimination Task (S-HDT) addresses the aforementioned limitations and facilitates a more nuanced understanding of individual differences in cardiac interoceptive accuracy. Herein we (i) detail the experimental null, (ii) demonstrate the recoverability of known point of subjective simultaneity and accuracy values by passing simulated data through our analysis pipeline and (iii) highlight the feasibility and tolerability of this task in a young control sample (n = 42; mean age = 22.57 +/- 4.55; 64.28% women). In our sample, we show the S-HDT has greater sensitivity and specificity than the original HDT, and enables the prediction of accuracy as well as individuals point of subjective simultaneity. With a running time of ~30 minutes, fully automated, open source, and freely available code (via GitHub), this task is accessible to further our understanding of cardiac interoception across multiple interoceptive domains.",

Two validation studies were conducted: single-day (N=203) and 14-day (N=75) assessments. The final SOLO consists of 13 items forming two scales: \"Being with others\" and \"Being alone\". Both scales demonstrated adequate psychometric properties and meaningful relationships with well-being measures. The scales were independent, supporting conceptualization of social enjoyment and solitude preference as distinct dimensions. The SOLO's brief format offers a practical compromise between ecological momentary assessment and retrospective measures.",

          "authors": "Benjy Barnett; Stephen M Fleming",
          "abstract": "The ability to represent absences is fundamental to human perception and cognition. Sensitivity to perceptual absences depends on inferring a lack of sensory evidence, enabling the recognition of a lack of environmental resources or other objects. In turn, encoding absence as a concept – in the form of the number zero – has enabled a multitude of technological and mathematical advances. Whether perceptual and conceptual absences rely on overlapping or distinct neural representations in the human brain, however, remains unknown. We employed three different tasks together with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterise neural representations of absence evoked within perceptual and numerical domains. Using multivariate decoding and Bayes factor analyses, we replicate previous findings of shared representations of numerical absence across symbolic and non-symbolic formats. In contrast, we show that these representations of numerical absence are distinct to those evoked by perceptual absences. This result held even after controlling for stimulus-level confounds which generate surface-level similarities between perceptual absences and non-symbolic empty sets. Our results extend a boundary between perception and cognition to the domain of absence and provide insight into the different mechanisms employed by the human brain to both perceive and conceive of absences.",

In contrast to chemosensory aspects of gut-brain signalling, perceptual aspects of gastrointestinal viscerosensation and visceromotor control have received relatively little attention despite clear links to physical and mental health and wellbeing. To facilitate research into these aspects of interoception, we developed a novel gastrointestinal sound discrimination task, Rumble Recognition, to measure gastrointestinal interoceptive accuracy, self-beliefs, and metacognitive insight in three ecologically valid conditions; following a 3 hour fast, after drinking sparkling water, and after consuming a high-protein meal replacement shake. The discrimination task used a two-interval forced choice design to assess gastrointestinal interoceptive performance accuracy alongside self-reported confidence from which a measure of metacognitive insight was computed. This novel task was tested for proof-of-principle in a healthy sample (n=45; 68% women), and demonstrated its feasibility, tolerability, and ability to yield parameters relevant naturalistic experiences including reported experience of hunger. The task is fully automated, requires minimal, affordable equipment, and written in freely available via open source code. We anticipate this task can facilitate research in this important, expanding and clinically relevant domain.",

          "abstract": "When trying to make sense of what is going on in the world and their personal lives, people often refer to scientific and religious explanations. Based on pertinent literature, we introduce a novel self-report instrument that captures five types of how people subjectively conceptualize the science-religion relationship. In addition to examining the psychometric properties of the new instrument, we tested whether these five types of conceptualizations are ordered along a single continuum of conflict vs. compatibility. In doing so, we ran and compared two unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models; a generalized partial credit model (GPCM) and a generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM), both in a German (total N = 2,920) and in a U.S. (N = 1,197) sample. We examined model fit statistics to determine the best-fitting model and examined measurement precision at the scale and the item levels. Finally, we tested measurement invariance across countries (i.e., Germany and the United States), as well as the discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity of our new instrument. Our results suggest that public perceptions of the relationship between science and religion are best captured by an unfolding response process (i.e. GGUM) and vary systematically across cultural contexts. In addition, U.S. participants perceived higher levels of conflict than their German counterparts. This research contributes to our theoretical understanding of science-religion perceptions and provides a validated measure for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "Recent progress in microbiome science has revealed the amazing relationship between the germs of the gut and brain function, challenging long-held beliefs that behaviour arises only in the brain. Emerging evidence suggests that microbial imbalance in the intestine can affect extreme behaviours, including symptoms associated with aggression, impulsivity, and psychiatry.\nThis review examines the stimulating hypothesis that the intestine plays an important role in shaping microbiota-driven violent and antisocial behaviour, highlighting the mechanisms through which microbiota can affect the brain and behaviour via the intestine-brain axis.\nDrawing on interdisciplinary research from microbiology, psychotherapy, neurology, and behavioural psychology, this article synthesizes current findings on neurotransmitters, immune reactions, and microbial modulation of neuroinflammation. Specific case studies involving pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and practical models are investigated to portray these effects.\nMajor evidence supports that dysbiosis can disrupt serotonin and dopamine pathways, compromise the blood-brain barrier, and alter behavioural regulation. In particular, inflammation and immune activation associated with microbiota are implicated in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and depression. Preliminary data from inmate studies also suggest correlations between intestinal profiles and violent tendencies.\nConclusions outline the hidden but powerful effects of the intestinal microbiome on human behaviour and its potential relevance in psychotherapy, criminal science, and medical interventions. Further research into microbial contributions to psychopathy could revolutionize approaches to mental health treatment and forensic sciences.",

          "abstract": "Food is fundamental to life. Yet, detecting members of the food category raises a substantial cognitive challenge as different foods do not have any apparent common visual features. Moreover, what is deemed edible greatly depends on the cultural context. While the neuro-cognitive bases of food category representations are well documented in adults, their early ontogenetic origins remain unknown. The current study investigated the emergence of food categorization abilities in infants’ brains, using the fast periodic visual stimulation paradigm (FPVS) coupled with electroencephalography (EEG). In FPVS paradigms, images from a target category are periodically inserted into a rapid stream of base images from other categories. If the brain treats the target images as a distinct category relative to the base images, a distinct EEG response appears at the frequency of presentation of the target images. In our study, French-speaking adults, 12- and 6-month-old infants (n = 25 per age group) were presented with target food stimuli inserted into sequences of base stimuli from various non-food categories (e.g., man-made objects, plants). Results show that, similarly to adults, 12-month-old infants distinguished images of food from those of other categories, with stronger neural responses in hungrier individuals. In contrast, 6-month-old infants showed no detectable categorization response for food images. The current study is the first to investigate the developmental course of food categorization in the human brain and showed that, by their first birthday, infants already group perceptually diverse foods into a single category",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling structured thought remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of fluent and coherent language in fundamentally connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the interaction between a parallel, adaptive substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and a structured symbolic framework, like language, internalized through statistical learning. The substrate's parallel architecture enables fast, intuitive pattern-matching, but is fundamentally ill-suited for the serial processing required for structured thought (e.g., causal reasoning, logical deduction). ESC proposes that recursive symbolic generation is the mechanism that overcomes this limitation. By generating a symbol (word or token) and feeding it back as input, the substrate operates as a serial symbolic processor, akin to a Turing machine. This recursive loop allows it to explore the vast combinatorial space of potential thoughts and construct novel, structured solutions. ESC finds compelling support in diverse phenomena across both biological cognition—evidenced by neuroscience, inner speech and cross-cultural studies—and the nascent reasoning and abstract representations displayed in LLMs. ESC thus offers a unifying framework, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence by reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine for general intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how bilingual experience modulates neural oscillations during speech processing varied by language familiarity. Two groups of English-speaking young adults— monolinguals and simultaneous bilinguals—actively listened to long passages (~30 seconds) in either a familiar (English) or unfamiliar (Hebrew) language, while their EEG activity was recorded. To characterize cognitive processes underpinning speech processing, we analyzed spectral power across a broad frequency spectrum (1–80 Hz), from delta through gamma bands. Further, time-frequency analyses were performed to capture the neural dynamics during sustained listening. Results revealed that bilingual experience was associated with differential oscillatory patterns, particularly in alpha and theta frequencies. Bilinguals exhibited stronger alpha suppression when processing the unfamiliar language, indicating heightened attentional demands relative to the familiar language. Additionally, greater home exposure to non-English languages was linked to higher theta power during familiar language processing, reflecting enhanced attention and increased working memory load. Lower beta power in response to the unfamiliar language suggested greater demands of cognitive state maintenance during novel speech perception. However, no significant effects were observed in gamma or delta power, nor in the time-frequency analyses. Altogether, these findings suggest that bilingual experience shapes brain responses to speech as reflected in attention- and memory-related processes. Furthermore, our results also underscore the importance of approaching bilingualism as a continuous variable beyond the binary categorization.",

          "abstract": "Enthusiasm for an evidence-informed approach towards educational interventions is currently hindered by difficulties integrating research findings into practice. To develop an understanding of current challenges for evidence integration, this qualitative study examined how commercial providers of educational interventions – increasingly involved in the development of practice – interact with and use research evidence in their intervention development and practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with an international sample of 14 directors of commercial educational intervention companies (50% female) from countries in Europe and North, Central and South America. Based on thematic analysis of interview data, this paper presents a) an overview of the perspectives of the directors on the role of research evidence in their work, and b) suggestions for improving evidence integration into educational intervention provision based on these. Company directors considered research to be important for responsible practice in education and that intervention providers typically conduct their own research for the dual purposes of evidencing and optimising impact. However, there is currently disincentive for commercial providers to engage with academic research because taking part in external evaluation of their own intervention is perceived as high-stakes. Evidence standards required by schools and different research funding bodies are inconsistent. Together, the result is that rigorous standards of evaluation are not perceived as being necessary. To facilitate engagement with research, intervention providers desire a client-centred and collaborative approach to research partnerships, and evaluation processes that are incremental, reducing reliance on high-stakes one-off research trials. We propose ways to improve evidence integration into educational intervention provision based on the perspectives of commercial education intervention providers, while placing them in the context of other stakeholders in the evidence-informed approach to education.",

          "authors": "Ariel Fuchs",
          "abstract": "This paper develops a formal model of consciousness dynamics grounded in Jungian psychology\nand recent scientific theories. We propose the Fuchs Consciousness Equation, ∂C/∂t = k(I×E−αC),\nlinking conscious states to inner drives (I), environmental contexts (E), feedback (α), and coupling\n(k) (Fuchs et al., 2025). This paper emerges from Jung’s exploration of ego–unconscious\nboundaries in the Red Book (Jung, 2009). We interpret the variables in Jungian terms—viewing I\nand E as inner archetypal and outer experiential forces and α and k as regulating constants.\nMapping Jungian dynamics onto the equation, we show how conscious content arises from the\ninterplay of ego, archetypal drives, and context, and how unconscious material gains expression\nthrough boundary negotiation. The framework reveals recursive feedback and spiral\ndevelopmental patterns of consciousness (Beck et al., 2018), where each stage involves threshold\ncrossings and bifurcations of inner and outer influences (Prentner, 2025). Archetypal symbols\nresonate as collective factors modulating individual awareness (Sun &amp; Kim, 2024) and symbolic\nentropy is regulated by the balance of order and novelty (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). Applications\ninclude new research hypotheses (e.g. measurable neural correlates of boundary dynamics), integrative therapeutic techniques (combining dynamical systems with depth psychology), and AI\nmodels of self-organizing cognition. This interdisciplinary model unifies first-person\nphenomenology with quantitative modeling (Prentner, 2025; Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). It offers\na systematic account of consciousness as an emergent, negotiated process (Fuchs, 2025),\nadvancing theory and suggesting future lines of empirical and theoretical work.",

          "abstract": "This systematic review explores the antecedents and consequences of collective punishment, a complex social psychological phenomenon wherein entire groups are punished for the actions of a few. Analyzing 47 studies across 24 articles, the findings of the systematic review revealed that outgroup entitativity, the structure and the decision-making processes of the transgressing outgroup, and individual-level variables such as emotions were antecedents of the collective punishment, and ingroup identification, perceived outgroup fairness, attitudes toward outgroup and ingroup cooperation were consequences of the collective punishment. Moreover, results highlighted that the conceptualization of collective punishment in social psychology was blatantly different from behavioural economics and other disciplines. The review emphasizes significant gaps in the literature, particularly the lack of studies on non-WEIRD populations and the limited focus on children and adolescents. By synthesizing existing research, this work provides a foundation for future studies to address these gaps and offers critical insights into the psychological mechanisms underpinning collective punishment.",

This prospective, naturalistic study explored the impact of an ayahuasca retreat experience on mental health, quality of life, and spiritual well-being among SGM participants. Nineteen individuals attending a seven-day ayahuasca retreat completed assessments across six time points from two weeks pre-ceremony to three months post-ceremony. Findings revealed significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores, alongside increases in spiritual well-being and quality of life, particularly within the first month following the retreat. Participants consistently described the experience as highly meaningful and spiritually significant, with many identifying the ceremony as among the most meaningful of their lives. Benefits were further supported by reports of positive behavioral changes, including improved interpersonal relationships and reduced substance use. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Importantly, this study addresses a historical gap in the literature and highlights the need to reconceptualize psychedelic spaces as inclusive and reparative for queer communities. Given the historical misuse of psychedelics in conversion therapy, these findings mark a critical step in reclaiming such practices for healing, empowerment, and identity affirmation. The results suggest that intentional, culturally responsive psychedelic experiences may offer a valuable therapeutic pathway for SGM individuals. Further research in larger, controlled trials is warranted to better understand these outcomes and support inclusive psychedelic science.",

This question is of interest both from the cognitive science of language perspective as well as the game theory perspective.

We conducted a series of 5 real-time online experiments where pairs of participants were matched to play a sequence of 40 2x2 games together (total N=616). Across the experiments, we varied the exact structure of trials, but all experiments involved trials with reward structures modeled on Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) and Bach or Stravinsky (BoS). We manipulated the presence or absence of a chat interface as a between-pairs manipulation. Despite low levels of use of the communication channel, we found slight differences in outcome between the chat and nochat groups, where pairs who could communicate were slightly more likely to reach coordinated beneficial outcomes in BoS games. In contrast to the predictions of rational actors, participants in both chat and no-chat conditions generally aligned on both cooperating rather than both defecting in PD. Overall, we were limited in our ability to discern the role of communication channels in game strategies due to low uptake in using the communication channels when available.",

However, this effect has only been demonstrated with perceptual threats (e.g., images of snakes), whereas real-life threats often arise from internal cognitive appraisal of possible negative outcomes. Although this has never been directly tested, WM models suggest that internal appraisals should also impair WM. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments using a novel paradigm that induced internal threat appraisals, under low and high task demands, during a complex span task. Across both experiments, threat appraisals impaired WM performance. Crucially, under high task demand, this impairment was amplified in individuals with elevated cognitive anxiety, particularly when the threat required greater cognitive elaboration. This study introduces a novel paradigm to assess internally generated threat appraisal and demonstrates, for the first time, that it disrupts WM processes similarly to external emotional stimuli.",

When recognizing faces, most humans consistently land their first fixation on the face just below the eyes (upper lookers), but some individuals fixate closer to the mouth (lower lookers). Do differences in long-term eye movement strategies influence the ability to process featural and configural facial information? To investigate this, we tested face recognition in upper and lower lookers using specially designed face stimuli that isolated variation in featural or configural information across exemplars, while fixating either at the eye or mouth regions. We found that upper lookers had superior recognition for configural faces than lower lookers, especially when fixating on the eyes. Using single-feature faces, we found that the upper lookers’ advantage arises from efficient extraction of configural face information from the eye region.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Anxiety is widespread but undertreated in Huntington’s disease (HD). Targeting negative interpretations of ambiguity may reduce anxiety in HD, but no valid measure of negative interpretation biases in HD exists. We developed the Movement Disorders Interpretation Bias Scale (MDIB) to measure negative interpretation biases in movement disorders (e.g., HD, Parkinson’s disease [PD]) and evaluated its validity in adults with HD (preregistration: https://osf.io/26a3h). Methods: We developed the MDIB based on qualitative interviews and expert review, then invited adults with HD (N = 65) to participate in an online survey study to evaluate its structural and external validity. Data were collected between June 2021 and January 2023. Results: Exploratory factor analyses support one factor representing external threats (i.e., social evaluation of movement disorder symptoms) and another factor representing internal threats (i.e., catastrophizing about such symptoms). Scores for both factors showed acceptable internal and test-retest reliabilities, and expected convergent and discriminant validity relations. The external bias score showed expected concurrent, incremental concurrent, and predictive validity relations, with mixed evidence for incremental predictive validity. Unexpectedly, the internal bias score’s concurrent and predictive validity relations were nonsignificant. Conclusions: Results support the MDIB as a measure of negative interpretation biases in HD, with some limitations. Further, associations between the MDIB external bias score and anxiety-related outcomes suggest that the MDIB can be used as a measure of target engagement in future trials evaluating cognitive behavioral treatments for anxiety. These results represent a critical step toward understanding and alleviating the significant burden of anxiety in HD.",

In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature.

          "authors": "Linda Farmus; Rob Cribbie",
          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology are often interested in evaluating whether a sample distribution is consistent with a normal (i.e., Gaussian) population distribution, most commonly to evaluate it as an assumption of a statistical model being adopted. In Study 1, a novel negligible effect (equivalence) test (NET) for normality is proposed that evaluates whether a sample distribution is similar enough to a normal distribution to be deemed equivalent (i.e., the difference between the sample and normal distributions is negligible). This NET establishes a negligible effect interval that quantifies coefficients for distribution shape that can be considered approximately normal. Any test statistic which has a 100(1-2α)% confidence interval (CI) that falls between the upper and lower limits of the negligible effect interval leads to the conclusion that the distribution is approximately normal. A series of simulations comparing Type I error and power rates of common traditional (difference-based) approaches (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and Shapiro-Wilk tests) with the proposed NET-based approach was conducted. Results indicate that in small sample sizes the NET method has low power to detect normality, whereas the traditional methods have low power to detect nonnormality. However, the NET method almost never falsely concludes normality with nonnormal distributions and small samples. With large sample sizes, traditional methods also often indicate that distributions are nonnormal even if the level of nonnormality is very minor (such that it would be unlikely to affect the validity of statistical tests or precision of parameter estimates). This limitation of traditional methods is not a concern for NET tests in large sample sizes, since they rarely falsely conclude that a distribution is nonnormal when it shows minor deviations from normality.   \nOne limitation of the NET-based approach is reduced power to detect normality when distributions are close to normal. Study 2 aimed to improve the calculation of CIs for the NET-based approach and examined several alternative methods for computing bootstrap-based confidence intervals for the NET-SW, including the stochastic bootstrap, parametric bootstrap, and Fisher’s r to z transformation. The stochastic bootstrap approach had the best balance of Type I error to power rates and is the recommended approach to accompany the NET-based normality test.",

          "abstract": "Semantic memory encodes diverse thematic relations, yet their neurocognitive demands remain poorly understood. To investigate a potential heterogeneity of thematic relations, we recorded ERPs while 41 adults judged the thematic relatedness of thematically related and unrelated noun–noun pairs (e.g., builder – house, apple – seed, cheese – fridge versus baby – coffee). Related targets were recognized faster and elicited reduced N400 and late negativities, confirming a robust thematic priming effect. Critically, processing costs scaled with the proportion of dynamic (change-denoting) events evoked by a noun-noun pair: dynamic thematic relations (e.g., builder – house) produced slower RTs and larger N400/late negativities than static thematic relations (e.g., apple – seed). In contrast, telicity—the presence of an inherent endpoint—did not influence behaviour or ERPs once dynamicity was controlled. Priming effects—and the dynamicity cost—were most pronounced over midline and posterior scalp sites, implicating these regions in event-level semantic integration. These findings reveal fine-grained heterogeneity within thematic knowledge: conceptual change taxes the system of semantic representations and/or semantic control mechanisms, highlighting the importance of dynamicity when modelling event-based relations.",

While AI offers transformative potential for climate mitigation and adaptation, ranging from advanced environmental monitoring to smarter disaster response, nationalistic policies and fragmented data governance threaten to undermine regional and global progress. This article proposes a Pan-American Science Diplomacy Framework designed to catalyze collaboration over competition in developing AI solutions for climate change. Drawing on comparative analyses of the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Chile, we highlight both the strengths and limitations of current national approaches to AI and climate action. We argue that harmonizing data standards, sharing infrastructure, and fostering inclusive governance, particularly by integrating Indigenous and local knowledge, are essential for equitable and effective AI-driven climate solutions. The framework centers on four pillars: infrastructure, data, talent, and governance, emphasizing the need for interoperable data protocols, pooled resources, and trust-building mechanisms. By leveraging existing regional institutions and diplomatic platforms, the Americas can model a new era of science diplomacy that accelerates innovation, bridges capacity gaps, and ensures that the benefits of AI for climate action are shared equitably across the hemisphere.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how awe-inspiring content and awe-primed expectations shape emotional experiences across subjective, behavioural, and physiological dimensions. In a two-part study (N=82), participants experienced virtual reality simulations designed to evoke either awe or calmness, while being primed to expect either awe-inspiring or calming experiences. We measured self-reported awe, duration perception, heart-related metrics, and electrodermal activity (EDA). Results revealed a dissociation between content and priming effects: VR content consistently influenced self-reported awe, with awe-inducing simulations generating stronger subjective ratings regardless of priming. In contrast, priming primarily affected physiological responses, particularly measures associated with sympathetic activation (HRV LF) and overall autonomic activity (SDNN). Though all experiences were underestimated in duration, time perception was most accurate for calm content with calm priming. EDA showed minimal responsiveness to our manipulations, with only very low frequency components showing higher values for awe experiences. These findings suggest awe operates through parallel processing pathways: a content-driven path affecting conscious experience and a priming-sensitive path influencing physiological responses. This dissociation highlights the multidimensional nature of awe and demonstrates how expectations and perceptual stimuli differentially impact dimensions of awe. The observed pattern of sympathetic and parasympathetic co-activation during awe suggests a state of \"relaxed alertness\" that may be characteristic of this complex emotion.",

          "abstract": "Humans use language to communicate complex psychological experiences. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled researchers to quantitatively study and assess psychological constructs through language (e.g., well-being and mental health). Data-driven visualizations of how language statistically relates to psychological dimensions can help interpret assessment scores, uncover meaningful patterns, and understand the intricate relationships between language use and mental states. Visualizations can, for example, be used to differentiate between related constructs (e.g., How does language related to depression versus anxiety differ?), understand the validity of assessment tools (e.g., Does the language related to high depression severity match with depression theory?), and explain AI-based language assessments (e.g., Which language is indicative of higher depression severity as identified by an AI-based model?).\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to transform language data into visual insights using the text and topics packages in R. We provide practical guidance on leveraging four different techniques, examining how language use patterns are statistically associated with a psychological construct or behavior. The techniques include visualizing 1) individual words and phrases, 2) topics (word clusters), 3) words based on their numerical representation in the AI-based language space, and 4) complete language examples. These quantitative methods offer complementary perspectives, visualizing linguistic elements from individual words to overarching topics and relevant text examples. The methods range from simple correlations between individual words to more advanced techniques, including Large Language Models and topic modelling. By making these methods accessible, this tutorial aims to empower researchers to use language visualizations for meaningful data-driven insights.",

          "authors": "Antonio Vázquez-Millán; Pablo Martínez-López; David Luque",
          "abstract": "Habits are stimulus-driven responses that are produced independently of the current outcome value. They enable efficient actions in familiar contexts while freeing up cognitive resources. Habits are expected to influence behavior after substantial experience, whereas limited training leaves behavior under goal-directed control. This transition from goal-directed to habitual control is well-documented in animal research but remains challenging to replicate in humans. Recent studies have suggested that human protocols are so effective at inducing habitual control that habits can appear even after short training, thereby masking the training effects. These studies typically test habits by reducing outcome value (e.g., food, through satiation) and report persistent habit-like behavior in minimally trained participants. Here, we propose an alternative explanation: we think that the devaluation protocol was ineffective for this subset of ‘habitual’ participants. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pre-registered experiment using the same task but with monetary rewards instead of food, hypothesizing that money can be more effectively devalued and avoid the social issues associated with eating. We found no difference in habitual responses between short and extended training. In contrast to prior reports, most participants were sensitive to outcome devaluation. We further supported our hypothesis by reanalyzing previous datasets, finding that across all studies (including ours), participants showing more habit-like responses were those for whom the devaluation was less effective. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of these findings.",

          "abstract": "Affective touch is crucial in shaping social and intimate relationships, as it influences and helps regulate the emotional states of touchers and touchees. Furthermore, affective touch is complex, and a wide array of modulatory effects across sensory modalities has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the multisensory nature of affective touch itself and its emotional induction capabilities via non-tactile senses. Through four online experiments, the present research investigated the emotional responses to the auditory signals produced by organic affective touch (i.e., tactile gestures performed by real romantic partners). In Experiment 1, we identified the predominant affective touch gestures in which people typically engage. Experiment 2 revealed that, lacking explicit cues on the nature of the sounds, organic affective touch sounds elicited negative-to-neutral emotional responses, differing from those evoked by object-based interaction sounds. Moreover, we found that individuals were unable to confidently identify whether the sounds involved affective touch gestures. In Experiment 3, we found that framing the nature of the organic affective touch sounds explicitly as real affective touch, as opposed to object-based tactile interactions, elicited more positive emotional responses. Finally, the results of Experiment 4 revealed that higher levels of congruency between individuals' expectations regarding the sounds of affective touch and the real auditory cues positively influenced the valence elicited by sounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the multisensory nature of affective touch and underscore the importance of meaning in its emotional elicitation function.",

Both behaviours were consistently predicted by psychological factors—especially negative healthcare experiences and a set of epistemically flawed beliefs including conspiracy, magical health, and extrasensory perception beliefs, along with the personality trait disintegration — with effect sizes often larger than previously reported. Predictiveness of these individual-level factors outweighed that of national health system characteristics.

          "abstract": "Social media has rapidly become a platform for people to consume content from an array of media figures, such as influencers, YouTubers, podcasters, or celebrities. Although we might assume people engage with content creators they enjoy or admire, there is a growing trend of people engaging with the content of those they actually dislike. This behaviour falls under the umbrella of negative parasocial relationships, bonds formed between audiences and disliked media figures. Across three studies we examine this specific form of negative parasocial relationship, which we call parasocial enemyship: people intentionally engaging with the content of a creator they actively dislike. Our data demonstrate that this phenomenon is prevalent across age, gender, ethnicity, and cultures. We investigate the motivations behind parasocial enemyship, identifying three distinct drives. These motivations clustered into themes of superiority (the need to feel better than the parasocial enemy), interest (the desire to understand the enemy), and fun (the desire to be entertained). Of these motivations, only the motivation to feel superior was consistently associated with Dark Triad traits (Psychopathy and Machiavellianism in particular). These results suggest that parasocial enemyship is a prevalent but nuanced behaviour, one that is not uniformly malevolent, and driven by diverse motivations.",

In both experiments, participants showed a preference for a high level of cognitive conflict, evaluated it as effortful yet enjoyable and linked it to positive emotions.

Linear regression, which prevails as the typical statistical approach in this research area, lacks the flexibility to meet these challenges. As alternatives, we present three statistical approaches: (1) Additive regression models to capture and control nonlinear or floor/ceiling effects, (2) Bayesian multilevel modeling, which can improve statistical power and allows for more complex models, and (3) clustering multivariate constellations of learner aptitudes via latent profile analysis. We demonstrate these three approaches on a motivating dataset from a scientific reasoning training, discussing their relative (dis-)advantages and how these and further models may aid research into differential effectiveness across different research topics and designs.",

In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

Besides facilitating more efficient perceptual inference, this generative architecture also enables the internal generation of sensory activity in the absence of input, in the form of imagination. Currently, it remains unclear how perceptual inferences reflecting reality can be kept apart from those that are imagined. Here, we propose a computational framework which formalizes reality inferences as higher-order evaluations of sensory precision. We demonstrate how this simple mechanism can explain a wide range of empirical observations regarding the relationships between perception, expectation, imagery and reality monitoring. Through simulations, we generate novel, testable hypotheses which highlight directions for future research. Our approach offers a simple yet powerful framework for developing a computational neuroscience of reality monitoring.",

          "abstract": "All biological and physical systems respond to stimuli. But until now, no unified law has described how these responses arise under fundamental constraints. In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature. We conclude that a universal response law exists—and it is rational.",

          "abstract": "A significant body of research has examined the relationships between political ideology and conspiracy beliefs. Conspiracy theories are often considered the province of “extremist” political positions. Intriguingly, however, several recent studies have demonstrated that people at the midpoint of the left-right self-placement item often displayed elevated conspiracy beliefs. The cause of this “midpoint bump” is unknown. Based on these observations, our research investigated the extent to which midpoint bumps exist in other domains. Using data from the Australian Election Study (N = 2179) and the American National Election Study (N = 8280), we conducted polynomial tests on the relationships between the left-right item and a range of social and political attitudes. We found W-shaped relationships primarily across attitudes towards the political system and immigrants. To explore the possibility that subgroups may hold anti-establishment and anti-immigrant attitudes that distinguish them from typically-moderate responders, we conducted Latent Profile Analyses on midpoint responders. In both samples, one profile represented an extreme response pattern relative to other profiles, consistent with populist attitudes. We discuss the implications of the left-right scale conflating political diversity at the midpoint for ideological measurement, as well as how it hinders understanding anti-establishment tendencies across the political spectrum.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "abstract": "Our language environment is rich in statistical structure. It is therefore natural to hypothesize that statistical learning (SL) —the ability to detect regularities in the environmental input— contributes to the efficient processing of written text and supports literacy skills. Some prior studies reported correlations between SL as a general ability and reading, while others found null effects. We propose that this link may be better revealed by measuring individuals’ learning of orthographic statistical patterns, a type of regularity more directly relevant to literacy. This study examined how sensitivity to bigram frequency in participants’ first language (L1, French) and the ability to learn novel bigrams through exposure relate to literacy outcomes. The measures showed moderate to good reliability (L1 sensitivity: r = .60; novel orthographic learning: r = .84) and were significantly associated with spelling, but not reading. Notably, sensitivity to bigram frequency was not significantly associated with orthographic learning performance and did not mediate the link between orthographic learning and spelling. These findings suggest that different aspects of sensitivity to existing and newly acquired orthographic patterns independently support spelling abilities in French, without extending to reading performance.",

Current approaches are either too time-consuming or lack contextual understanding for actionable insights. Objective: To develop and validate a framework using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze student feedback in psychology courses, comparing LLM insights with traditional evaluation metrics. Method: We implemented Facebook's BART LLM using zero-shot classification on open-ended course evaluations from a large psychology course comparing traditional lecture with active learning formats across two semesters. Data included 270 evaluations yielding 678 responses, analyzed using four learning categories. Results: LLM analysis revealed striking discrepancies with traditional metrics. While Likert-scale responses showed minimal differences between formats (Cohen's d = 0.16-0.33), LLM analysis revealed large, significant effects across all dimensions (Cohen's d = 0.94-1.13, p &lt; .001). Validation confirmed reliability through moderate correlations with related Likert items (r = 0.29-0.44). Conclusion: LLM analysis demonstrated superior sensitivity in detecting teaching approach differences, capturing qualitative distinctions that numerical ratings miss while addressing challenges of qualitative data volume and analysis time. Teaching Implications: This methodology enables instructors to analyze hundreds of responses in minutes using accessible tools, providing practical evidence-based teaching improvement insights.",

          "abstract": "The exit from the workforce and the transition to retirement often coincides with changes in important aspects of individuals’ daily life and social roles. This can be a demanding experience for some retirees, affecting their mental health. It is thus important to identify relevant psychosocial, health, and financial predictors of adjustment quality. Retiring during the Covid-19 pandemic may have been particularly challenging, as newly retired older adults had fewer opportunities to establish new leisure activities and social relationships due to limits on in-person meeting and travel. In the present study, we compared retirees who retired in or just before the first phase of the pandemic (2019-early 2021, n = 175) with those who retired long before the pandemic (2015-2017, n = 211) in terms of their retirement adjustment quality (reported in late 2020 / early 2021 or 2017, respectively). Retirement adjustment quality was measured by perceived adjustment difficulty and change in life satisfaction across the transition. We further investigated whether pre-retirement social activity, generalized self-efficacy, online activities or disease load were associated with later retirement adjustment in both groups. We found that groups did not differ in their retirement adjustment. In both groups, a higher generalized self-efficacy was associated with better adjustment. Social activities before retirement were only associated with increases in life satisfaction among those retiring before the pandemic.

          "abstract": "Which visual displays do we aesthetically appreciate, and why? Order (i.e., structure and organization of elements in a display) and complexity (i.e., quantity and variety of elements) have often been suggested as important factors related to appreciation, but the exact type and direction of their relation to appreciation is still under debate. To clarify the contributions of order and complexity to appreciation, it is important to manipulate order and complexity independently and in a parametrically controlled fashion, to study their relation to appreciation in combination rather than separately, and to acknowledge the multidimensional nature of order and complexity. In an online study, we investigated individuals’ aesthetic preferences (N = 340) for three different types of complexity (i.e., the number of colors, shapes, and sizes in the display) while also varying the order level of the display. Firstly, results indicated that not all complexity types are appreciated similarly: Whereas color complexity was on average preferred, size and shape complexity influenced preferences negatively. Secondly, all three complexity types were more often preferred in highly ordered stimuli than in stimuli with a lower order level, indicating a stimulating effect of order on preferences for complexity. Thirdly, we found both individual and contextual variation in preferences for complexity: Especially the extent to which color complexity is preferred varied across individuals and the specific set of colors used in the display.",

          "abstract": "Perceivers' beliefs are critical to form social judgments. However, it remains unclear how the strength of these beliefs or predictions shapes social perception. To fill this gap, we investigated how the representation of social perceptions (trustworthiness and likeability ratings) and bodily responses (skin conductance response; SCR) are modulated by prediction strength, using representational similarity analysis. In two samples of university students (N1=65 and N2=40), stronger predictions led participants to judge identities as more trustworthy and likeable when identities’ facial reactions conformed to their predictions compared to when they were violated. Furthermore, the representational structure of social judgments and SCR were associated with models of prediction fulfillment/violation. More importantly, the similarity between social judgments, SCR representations, and models of prediction fulfillment/violation were linked to predictions strength. These results demonstrate that predictions strength modulates how fulfilled/violated predictions influence social judgments and bodily responses, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying social perception.",

To characterise attentional effects on qualia, we combined a dual-task attention paradigm with similarity rating tasks to examine whether relational structures of qualia are altered by top-down attentional amplification. Under the same physical input, withdrawing attention collapsed the structures of qualia of letters (N=14) and red/green bisected disks (N=14), but not of faces (N=13), as quantified via an unsupervised optimal transport alignment technique. Alignment accuracy was high for face qualia structures obtained under the fully versus poorly attended conditions but not for the letters and disks. Our approach that combines similarity ratings, unsupervised alignment and attentional perturbation is a powerful new approach to elucidate the structural properties of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "This document presents a self-contained, field-theoretic framework in a generalized nD+T Pseudo-Riemannian spacetime (-,+,+,...,+) to formally unify a wide range of causal inference methods. I prove that established methods are geometric projections of this underlying reality. A key result is the formalization of Hypertime, a `derivative dimension` that models the interaction between spatial concepts and temporal dynamics. Within this causal tensor spacetime, I propose a new `Born Rule` for the emergence of causation from the interaction of vector-like states. This geometric-dynamical paradigm offers a novel mechanism for the detection of unobserved variable bias using operator non-commutativity and provides a mathematical origin for memory effects via the sinusoidal structure of fractional derivatives. The framework extends beyond traditional causal inference to encompass Bayesian statistics (belief updates as field dynamics), decision-making processes (softmax-to-argmax transitions as causal collapse), machine learning (parameter evolution as causal geodesics), and multi-agent systems (strategic interactions as causal field evolution) as manifestations of causal field theory. The empirical success of existing low-dimensional causal inference methods provides a compelling validation for the mathematical necessity and superior performance of this higher-dimensional spacetime framework. This proof serves as both a standalone treatise and the foundational pillar for a broader monograph on Unified Cognitive Field Theory.\n\n\nKeywords:\ncausal inference, field theory, Lorentzian geometry, derivative dimension, Born rule, hypertime, memory, geometric subsumption, qualitative primacy, hidden variables, Fubini's theorem, Bayesian inference, decision theory, machine learning, tensor calculus, manifolds, mathematical proof",

          "authors": "Thomas E. Devitt",
          "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of fluid reasoning—the ability to solve novel, complex problems in a principled and adaptive manner. This paper introduces and empirically validates the Fluid Emergent Reasoning Engine (FERE-CRS), a novel cognitive architecture designed to foster such capabilities. The architecture is grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its process theory, Active Inference (AIF), which posit that intelligent agents maintain their existence by minimizing surprise through a continuous cycle of perception and action. We address the computational intractability of applying AIF to complex, neuro-symbolic systems by proposing the Cognitive Resonance Score (CRS), a tractable, multi-component heuristic proxy for Variational Free Energy (VFE). The CRS serves as a \"common currency\" for a Meta-Reasoning Agent (MRA) to orchestrate the functions of heterogeneous components, including a Large Language Model (LLM) acting as a versatile cognitive engine. We detail a \"cognitive choreographer\" methodology that makes the validation of this complex architecture tractable and transparent. In a 500-trial experiment on a complex, inferential artifact analysis task, the FERE-CRS agent produced significantly higher-quality explanations (mean score: 8.48/10) and was five times more efficient (mean cost: 610.0 units) than a strong Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) baseline (mean score: 6.71/10; mean cost: 3000.0 units). Furthermore, analysis of the agent’s reasoning trace provides quantitative evidence of AIF-consistent adaptive behavior, demonstrating a clear shift from information-seeking to goal-directed action as uncertainty is resolved. Crucially, we argue that this architecture creates the conditions for transfer learning, enabling the agent to learn abstract, generalizable cognitive strategies that can be applied to entirely novel problems, a key shortcoming of current AI paradigms. This work provides a complete theoretical, architectural, and empirical account of a novel approach to building more intelligent, adaptive, and explainable AI systems.",

In Australia, fragmentation within and across sectors (health, mental health and human services) results in gaps in service provision and increases this disease burden. There is an urgent need for reform; however, we need comprehensive and robust methodologies to identify gaps and inefficiencies in service provision to shape policy, ensure efficient allocation of resources and support those most in need. Here we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study involving evaluation of health, mental health, and human service use among Victorian young people with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs. \nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort includes youth aged 12-25 years in the period January 2018 to November 2023. For comparative purposes, we also include data from children aged 5-11 and adults 26-53 for this timeframe. We outline data sources and linkage methodology. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used to identify subgroups with unmet mental health needs.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive examination of the clinical characteristics of young people, their service use behaviours, and typical pathways through care, that cannot be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Peer-based interventions have been highlighted as a promising way of improving patient outcomes across diverse health services. While previous reviews have examined peer-based programs in specific health services (e.g., mental health, cancer) or with specific populations (e.g., people with HIV), no previous reviews have investigated peer-based programs with a dedicated peer provider role (e.g., peer navigator) for adolescents receiving care in tertiary health services.\nObjective: To describe characteristics of adolescent-focused peer-based programs in paediatric tertiary care or youth health services, and synthesise the available evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, barriers and facilitators of these programs.\nMethods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for empirical studies published between  January 1st, 2015 to May 2nd, 2025. Eligible articles described programs with a dedicated peer role for adolescents under 26 years of age receiving care in a tertiary paediatric or youth health service. A narrative synthesis of the extracted data was conducted to group data into relevant themes.\nFindings: Fifteen studies with a total of 751 participants were included across 16 articles (8 qualitative, 3 quantitative non-randomised, 2 randomised controlled trials, and 3 mixed methods). One-third of studies (n=5; all qualitative designs) met all quality criteria. There was significant heterogeneity in the peer-based interventions in terms of health contexts (e.g., HIV, oncology, disability), format (one-on-one, group or hybrid), delivery (face-to-face, online, or pre-recorded video), and characteristics of peer roles (group facilitation, one-on-one sessions, referrals, appointment attendance, training, supervision and embeddedness within clinical teams). Most adolescents and service providers deemed interventions to be feasible and acceptable. Peer roles were seen as a key source of social support and role modelling which facilitated adolescents’ health-related learning, self-management and comfort in participating in health care or group interventions. Key barriers included technical issues (e.g., virtual delivery), non-cohesive group dynamics, poor understanding of peer navigator roles among clinicians, and irrelevant or non-tailored program content. Facilitators included comprehensive training and supervision for peer navigators and flexible, adolescent-centred program delivery and recruitment strategies. Quantitative evidence for the effectiveness of peer interventions was mixed; however, qualitative reports highlighted improvements in psychosocial wellbeing.\nConclusions and Relevance: Peer-based programs with a dedicated peer role appear to feasible and acceptable to adolescents and service providers, although not without barriers to implementation. More high-quality research is necessary to clarify the effectiveness of these programs for adolescents receiving care in tertiary care or youth health services.",

Drawing on social psychology frameworks, our goal is to inform and encourage the creation of Third Spaces that identify common ground between practitioners, foster balanced interactions, build shared group identity and new group dynamics, and ultimately move beyond discipline-specific identities and institutionalized environments.",

          "abstract": "Plant cognition has progressed from anecdote to rigor, yet the field still lacks a quantitative test for when distributed plant activity crosses into unified—perhaps conscious—processing. I introduce Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), a substrate-agnostic metric rooted in Dynergeia, a relation-first ontology that defines consciousness as reflexive coherence among five universal patterns—self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness and flux—phase-locked inside a system’s binding window (τ). Each pattern is operationalized with established signal-processing measures; their mean strength is multiplied by their mean synergy and released only if a τ-specific coherence gate is met.\nThree preregistered hypotheses anchor the study: H1 baseline PTS &gt; 0 in intact plants; H2 4 % diethyl-ether collapses PTS below threshold φ; H3 PTS rebounds on wash-out. A multispecies protocol—Mimosa pudica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Picea abies—combines 64-channel surface electrodes, glutamate-sensitive Ca²⁺ imaging and micro-optode O₂/heat-flux probes. Sliding 3 × τ windows with phase-shuffled surrogates yield z-scored PTS trajectories, adjudicated by preregistered effect-size criteria.\nBy turning decades of qualitative insight into falsifiable numbers, PTS offers plant biology a litmus test for conscious-level processing, directly challenges Integrated Information Theory and supplies a road-map for cross-kingdom comparisons—including neuromorphic silicon. Confirmatory results would shift debates on plant sentience from speculation to data; null results would equally refine what consciousness requires.",

          "abstract": "Recent work in cultural sociology has called attention to constraints imposed by material objects on interpretive processes, but is unclear as to how actors use such constraints to produce new meanings. In this article, we use novel newspaper data of people attempting to pay with large amounts of small cash and coins as a form of protest to highlight the material conditions under which actors are able to convey an alternative meaning of an object to an audience. We use computational linguistic and quantitative methods to examine when changes in the  meaning of money are more likely to lead to emotionally-charged media reception. We find that emotionally-charged media reception is more likely when, typically, actors consciously attend to money and yet do not have to put in much cognitive work to assign meaning to it in the setting where the protest is attempted. We conclude by considering the implications of the study for broader projects within cultural sociology, economic sociology, organizational theory, political sociology, and social movement studies.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nUrban schoolyard greening is gaining attention as a promising approach to improve environmental quality, public health, and community well-being in cities. While transforming schoolyards into green, multifunctional spaces is increasingly implemented, the implications for surrounding residential property values and urban equity remain insufficiently synthesized.\nObjectives:\nThis systematic review investigates the effects of greening schoolyards on adjacent residential property values. The review examines (1) the magnitude and spatial reach of property value changes, (2) the influence of neighborhood characteristics and governance, and (3) implications for equity, gentrification, and displacement.\nMethods:\nA systematic review methodology, guided by PRISMA standards, was employed to synthesize peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. The analysis integrates quantitative approaches, such as hedonic pricing models and spatial econometric analyses, with qualitative and mixed-methods studies. The review primarily covers North American and Western European urban contexts.\nResults:\nFindings consistently demonstrate that greening schoolyards is associated with increased residential property values, particularly within 200–400 meters of interventions. Reported property value increases typically range from 4% to 7%, with higher premiums near greened sites. However, these benefits are unevenly distributed; lower-income neighborhoods may experience smaller gains or greater risks of gentrification. Community participation and inclusive governance are key factors in achieving equitable outcomes.\nConclusions/Implications:\nGreening schoolyards can enhance urban livability and property values but may also contribute to social inequities if not accompanied by housing affordability protections and robust community engagement. Urban planning strategies should integrate equity-focused safeguards to ensure that environmental investments benefit all residents.",

          "authors": "Valentina Rotondi",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how summer school holidays are associated with parents’ happiness across 16 European countries. Using harmonized data from the European Social Survey (2023--2025) combined with detailed national school calendars, we compare the well-being of parents and non-parents interviewed during and outside the summer break. While non-parents show a clear seasonal increase in happiness, this boost is smaller for parents and virtually absent for mothers, particularly in countries with medium or long summer breaks. The gap widens with the number of children and remains after accounting for socio-demographic factors, household labor division, and time trends. Robustness checks, including models with country-specific year and month trends and placebo tests, confirm these patterns. Cross-country differences in the ``parental summer gap'' are substantial but are not related to macro-level factors such as GDP or family spending. These findings underscore the additional pressures associated with long summer breaks—especially for mothers—and highlight the potential value of policies that shorten school holidays, expand affordable childcare, and promote a fairer division of care work.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss",
          "abstract": "Research on repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to curb challenges to state power. Such repression tends to draw criticism from the international community and can be counterproductive to shoring up power and legitimacy. To avoid this, states may employ subtler and less violent forms of repression designed to demobilize popular advocacy and capture the benefits of civil society organizations. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society. Because it looks like more standard domestic regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry and condemnation, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even act as a \"canary in the coal mine\" and signal future physical repression. By only looking at physical violence rather than more innocuous legal and policy-oriented action, existing research undercounts repression. The author recalls his experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different national jurisdictions and measuring different forms of *de jure* and *de facto* restrictions, presents key results, and outlines avenues for future research.",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

The advantages of physical activity and well-being are increasingly recognized; nevertheless, the wider ramifications for community dynamics, social equality, and the risks of green gentrification remain poorly comprehended.\nPurpose This review carefully assesses the evidence about the impact of schoolyard greening efforts on children's health, neighborhood transformation, and the equitable distribution of benefits and risks across diverse urban communities.\nMethods A comparative literature analysis was performed to synthesize findings from quantitative studies, qualitative research, and case analyses specifically addressing schoolyard greening projects in prominent U.S. cities.\nResults Evidence consistently indicates that schoolyard greening positively influences children's socioemotional well-being and physical activity levels, while also enhancing the use of outdoor spaces. Increased unstructured play and student engagement correlate with renovation techniques that incorporate varied play areas and natural features. Nonetheless, the allocation of gains is uneven; educational institutions situated in rapidly evolving or affluent communities are more prone to improvements in infrastructure and accessibility. Furthermore, greening projects can act as drivers for neighborhood development, potentially leading to green gentrification processes that threaten the tenure of disadvantaged people and elevate property values. These results underscore the importance of context-sensitive and inclusive planning.\nConclusions Schoolyard greening can offer substantial health advantages for children and support the broader goals of urban sustainability. Nonetheless, these initiatives may exacerbate socioeconomic disparities and contribute to displacement patterns without intentional policies and community-driven strategies. To ensure the equitable distribution of schoolyard greening benefits, it is imperative that effective solutions emphasize equity, substantial community involvement, and the safeguarding of at-risk populations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Research on research (RoR), referred also as metascience, critically examines research practice. The rapid growth of RoR evidence highlights the need for funders and research organisations to work collaboratively to increase sharing evidence, decrease risk of duplication and research waste, and ultimately lead to better implementation of research. To address these needs, the RoR registry and community hub was established in 2021 to bring together national and international RoR communities and thus strengthen the impact of this evolving discipline within the broader research ecosystem.  The RoR registry and hub facilitates collaborative efforts among stakeholders dedicated to refining research practices. It aims to enhance the visibility of RoR studies, thus enabling the formation of research partnerships and promoting effective dissemination of evidence. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the registry's development and outlines the strategic activities implemented to drive its adoption within the research community. \n\nMethods: We utilised multiple methods to develop, grow and maintain the RoR registry. These consist of: a review of registries; creation of an advisory group; development of a web-based online registry of projects; conducting an online survey one year after launch to evaluate the performance of the RoR registry and hub; running two online events to first launch the registry and to showcase research registered on the platform; establishing Chatter sessions (online webinars on research on research topics); dissemination activities to promote the registry through publications and collaborations with publishers; and generating materials throughout the time the registry has been operating that reach multiple audiences. \n\nResults : The development of the registry took place between January 2020 and June 2021. The scope of registries that were available at the time informed the contents of the registry and especially, the questions that are asked at registration, ensuring a useful and still pragmatic mechanism to register work. An advisory board of experts provided strategic advice during the development phase. In parallel, a brand concept for the RoR registry and RoR team was co-developed. A video to explain the aim of the registry was co-created with a science communicator. An online launch event for the RoR registry and hub in June 2021 announced the registry to relevant communities (ror-hub.org) where a panel of experts discussed research on research and the role of this activity in the research ecosystem. A series of online webinars (Chatter sessions) were set up after the launch event where presenters led a discussion on topics of interest to the community, invited reflection and encouraged adoption of evidence to improve practice. The online evaluation survey of the registry and chatter sessions asked communities of interest about usefulness of the registry, benefits and challenges to engaging with the website and ways to increase its uptake. Forty-seven responses to the online survey were received. Five themes extracted through thematic analysis were: 1: Chatter sessions (two subthemes: management and topic coverage) 2: Registry outputs 3: Opportunities for improvement and collaboration 4: Promoting the registry 5: Reasons for not interacting with the registry. Findings of the evaluation highlighted the need for clearer communication about Chatter sessions with more notice and post-session materials, as well as more diverse topics like AI and bias in research.  Members suggested improvements to the registry itself, including better promotion, simpler study entry, and more engaging content like mini blogs to encourage wider use.  Finally, while many members found the registry through word-of-mouth, lack of time and awareness were cited as the main barriers to having greater interaction.\nIn May 2024, the RoR team organised an online research festival, ‘AI and research: a promising relationship?’, to celebrate the registry's first three years. The festival included a panel discussion on the role of artificial intelligence in research, including whether AI could reduce research bureaucracy and how AI could impact on research integrity and presentations from projects added to the registry. 107 participants from organisations in 28 countries, including research funders, universities, charities, hospitals and publishers worldwide logged on to the festival sessions, provided highly positive feedback on the relevance and usefulness of the topics discussed, the discussion and presentations.  \n\nReflections: This paper presents the development of the RoR registry and community hub, describing the process from initial idea to launch, subsequent evaluation and continuous dissemination to encourage its use for best research practices. The highlights of the virtual research festival hosted by the RoR team, which focused on the intersection of AI and research, showed the multiple ways in which the community around the registry has been established and how it is contributing to the research ecosystem. The next steps for the registry and hub include expansion of the registry by partnering with organisations conducting research on research activity; developing strategies to attract more users to the registry; and encourage active participation within the community hub, targeting outreach and continuously analysing the impact by tracking collaborations, measuring changes in research quality, or surveying users to gather feedback on the platform's effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Neoliberalism has found a willing and receptive environment in Ireland. The country is praised for its policies concerning deregulation, low taxation and importing direct foreign investment. However, the catastrophic economic crash in 2008/09 should have concluded this experiment, but it did not. This dissertation will examine the role of the Irish mass media in shaping attitudes toward neoliberal policies. By analysing the media’s reporting of the bailout and subsequent austerity and examining if alternatives were marginalised, this dissertation will seek to determine if the Irish media held, and continue to hold, pro-neoliberal biases. Drawing on theoretical and methodological approaches rooted in the critical-Marxist tradition, this work will conduct a qualitative content analysis of news articles in The Irish and Sunday Independent newspapers and The Irish Times. The assessment will explore the role of Ireland’s agenda-setting newspapers in shaping public discourse on the state’s economic policy response to the drastic failure of the private financial sector. It will also provide an understanding of how newspapers colluded with governments in setting the political and economic agendas.",

          "authors": "Steffen Wamsler; Gundula Zoch",
          "abstract": "Literature on crisis policymaking often assumes that government measures shape political trust. At the same time, we lack comprehensive evidence on how deep-seated regime socialisa-tion experiences affect crisis-related trust dynamics. We draw on Germany’s historical East-West divide and examine how changes in political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic relate to both regime socialisation and regional containment policies. Socialist socialisation should trigger a stronger initial rally-around-the-flag effect and a more pronounced decline of trust during later stages of stricter containment policies, with heterogenous effects according to the duration of regime socialisation. Using five waves of individual-level panel data (N=23,420, 2017-2023) and fixed-effects models with district-level infection rates and various policy re-strictions, we find a shared rally effect across East and West. Comparable trust declines in the second year were explained by regional containment policies. However, by the third year, in-stitutional trust in the East eroded further – without clear links to containment policies. Media trust, already lower in the East, revealed a growing divide as well. Finally, changes in trust varied by length of Socialist regime exposure. In the context of an extended crisis, our find-ings point to the limited capacity of crisis policy to explain trust dynamics when considering deep-seated socialisation.",

          "abstract": "Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive System of Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between institutional and organizational roles across three communica-tion modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios - citizen science and generative AI – the study demonstrates its potential for predicting non-linear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Urban greening projects often make people healthier and happier, but they also help gentrification happen. There has not been much research on how green gentrification affects health outcomes.\nPurpose: This scoping review looked at peer-reviewed studies that looked at how greening projects in neighborhoods that are becoming more affluent affect health, well-being, and health determinants like physical activity and affordable housing.\nMethods: A thorough review of the literature, which included searches in PubMed, JSTOR, and Google Scholar, found 15 empirical studies that met the criteria for inclusion. These studies looked at how people used green spaces, how much physical activity they did, how safe they felt, and how healthy they said they were.\nResults: Studies show that long-term, marginalized residents suffer harm by green gentrification in many ways, including feeling less connected to their community, feeling distant from green spaces, and, in many cases, using these areas less than newcomers.\nConclusions: There is not enough research in this area, so more studies need to be done on mental health and cardiovascular health indicators to improve the existing body of work. There is evidence that professionals in public health, urban planning, and parks can work together to make green spaces more useful and accessible for people who live in gentrifying neighborhoods and are not as well disconnected.",

          "authors": "Valentina Rotondi",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how summer school holidays are associated with parents’ happiness across 16 European countries. Using harmonized data from the European Social Survey (2023--2025) combined with detailed national school calendars, we compare the well-being of parents and non-parents interviewed during and outside the summer break. While non-parents show a clear seasonal increase in happiness, this boost is smaller for parents and virtually absent for mothers, particularly in countries with medium or long summer breaks. The gap widens with the number of children and remains after accounting for socio-demographic factors, household labor division, and time trends. Robustness checks, including models with country-specific year and month trends and placebo tests, confirm these patterns. Cross-country differences in the ``parental summer gap'' are substantial but are not related to macro-level factors such as GDP or family spending. These findings underscore the additional pressures associated with long summer breaks—especially for mothers—and highlight the potential value of policies that shorten school holidays, expand affordable childcare, and promote a fairer division of care work.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "Semiconductors have become central to geopolitical rivalry and national strategy. This article examines Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a paradigmatic case of institutional transformation in strategic industries. More than a technological leader, TSMC has emerged as an institutional mediator—navigating overlapping policy regimes, supply chain fragmentation, and diverging state agendas. Drawing on TSMC’s global expansion, especially its fabs in Arizona and Kumamoto, I show how firms are increasingly expected to perform quasi-sovereign functions: ensuring supply continuity, managing regulatory tensions, and absorbing geopolitical risk. I argue that prevailing discourses of “decoupling” and “reshoring” misdiagnose the problem, treating physical relocation as a proxy for strategic autonomy. Instead, I theorize institutional absorptive capacity as the foundation of long-term sovereignty: the ability of firms and states to learn, adapt, and coordinate across volatile environments. This requires shifting policy focus from industrial control to institutional design—investing in learning systems, governance capacity, and trust-based cooperation. TSMC’s trajectory thus signals a broader reconfiguration of state–firm boundaries and the emergence of a multipolar, narrative-driven political economy. The article concludes by outlining future research on cross-border institutional agency, strategic narrative construction, and techno-industrial governance beyond the U.S.–China binary.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate outputs that resemble introspection, including self-reference, epistemic modulation, and claims about their internal states. This study investigates whether such behaviors reflect consistent, underlying patterns or are merely surface-level generative artifacts.We evaluated five open-weight, stateless LLMs using a structured battery of 21 introspective prompts, each repeated ten times to yield 1,050 completions. These outputs were analyzed across four behavioral dimensions: surface-level similarity (token overlap via SequenceMatcher), semantic coherence (Sentence-BERT embeddings), inferential consistency (Natural Language Inference with a RoBERTa-large model), and diachronic continuity (stability across prompt repetitions). Although some models exhibited thematic stability, particularly on prompts concerning identity and consciousness, no model sustained a consistent self-representation over time. High contradiction rates emerged from a tension between mechanistic disclaimers and anthropomorphic phrasing. Following recent behavioral frameworks, we heuristically adopt the term pseudo-consciousness to describe structured yet non-experiential self-referential output in LLMs. This usage reflects a functionalist stance that avoids ontological commitments, focusing instead on behavioral regularities interpretable through Dennett’s intentional stance. The study contributes a reproducible framework for evaluating simulated introspection in LLMs and offers a graded taxonomy for classifying such reflexive output. Our findings carry significant implications for LLM interpretability, alignment, and user perception, highlighting the need for caution when attributing mental states to stateless generative systems based on linguistic fluency alone.",

          "abstract": "When does protest in one domain catalyze activism in another—and when does it divert potential activists from their own causes? Prior research on the diffusion of protest has overlooked how the collective beliefs of dormant populations—those not yet engaged in activism—may influence their participation. We argue that exposure to protest sends a dual signal—about both issues and tactics—and that its effects depend on tactic efficacy beliefs: shared beliefs about whether protest tactics can achieve social or political change. We theorize that exposure to protest produces a \"seesaw effect\": it redirects mobilization away from the focal cause in high-belief communities while activating protest participation in low-belief, previously dormant ones. We employ a shift-share instrument (SSIV) to estimate the causal impact of social movement mobilization exposure on real-world labor movement mobilization activity based on 2.6 million news stories across 14 social movements, and measure tactic efficacy beliefs using 1.6 million online posts from 29,000 rideshare drivers. Our conceptualization of tactic efficacy beliefs contributes by developing a novel explanation for the conditions under which protest spreads—or stalls—across issue domains.",

          "authors": "Mahshid Gorjian",
          "abstract": "1.1 Background\nParks and the greening of schoolyards are examples of urban green spaces that have been praised for their environmental, social, and economic benefits in cities all over the world. More studies show that living near green spaces is good for property values. However, there is still disagreement about how strong and consistent these effects are in different cities (Browning et al., 2023; Grunewald et al., 2024; Teo et al., 2023).\n1.2 Purpose\nThis systematic review is the first to bring together a lot of geographical and statistical information that links greening schoolyards to higher property prices, as opposed to just green space in general. By focusing on schoolyard-specific interventions, we find complex spatial, economic, and social effects that are often missed in larger studies of green space.\n1.3 Methods\nThis review followed the PRISMA guidelines and did a systematic search and review of papers that were published in well-known journals for urban studies, the environment, and real estate. The criteria for inclusion stressed the use of hedonic pricing or spatial econometric models to look at the relationship between urban green space and home values in a quantitative way. Fifteen studies from North America, Europe, and Asia met the requirements for inclusion (Anthamatten et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Mansur &amp; Yusuf, 2022).\n1.4 Results\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that the value of adjacent properties is enhanced by urban green space in a statistically significant manner. The magnitude of the benefit is contingent upon the socio-economic context, the form of green space, and\nthe size of the city (Gao &amp; Asami, 2021; Sajjad et al., 2021; Zhou &amp; Wang, 2021). The emphasis was on spatial heterogeneity and temporal trends, which implies that the distribution of benefits may not be equitable across localities (Kabisch &amp; Haase, 2021; Deng et al., 2022). Various methodologies, including spatial latency models, hedonic pricing, and GIS-based analysis, resulted in disparate results (Norzailawati et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2022).\n1.5 Conclusions\nSome studies show that urban green spaces can raise the value of homes, but how much and how fairly these benefits happen depends on the local situation, the layout of the city, and the city's policies. The review stresses how important it is to have standard measures and long-term studies to help make urban greening projects fair. This research adds to the theory of urban planning by looking at the hedonic value of green infrastructure on a small scale and critically examining the consequences of schoolyard greening on different groups of people. This gives us a new way to think about fair urban expansion.",

          "authors": "Anurag Kadel",
          "abstract": "This project presents a speculative design framework for digital self-awareness grounded in epistemic pluralism and regenerative design philosophy. In contrast to mainstream self-tracking technologies that simulate introspection through reductive behavioral metrics, this work explores how symbolic, narrative, and somatic dimensions can be meaningfully re-integrated into human-computer interaction. Building on Jungian psychology, Eastern non-dual philosophy, and somaesthetic design, the proposed Mirror of Becoming system introduces five architectural pillars: epistemic friction, archetypal mirroring, narrative reframing, somatic grounding, and non-dual reflexivity. These pillars form the basis of design probes that resist optimization logics and instead cultivate ambiguity, inner dialogue, and embodied self-awareness. Methodologically, the paper adopts a Reflexive Research through Design (RtD) approach, treating design as a site of philosophical and symbolic inquiry rather than solution delivery. The work builds on the author’s prior framework in Seeds of Sovereignty (2025), which critiques ontological monocultures in AI and HCI and advocates for plural, reflexive systems that support the unfolding of selfhood rather than its prediction or containment. This research contributes to ongoing conversations in HCI, speculative design, and psychology by proposing an alternative ontology for digital self-awareness—one that honors the unconscious, the unmeasurable, and the unfinished.",

Among these technologies, video games stand out for their potential to foster vocabulary learning through contextualized, engaging experiences. However, while serious games have been widely studied, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games have received comparatively less research attention to date. Following a replicable PRISMA protocol, this systematic review seeks to address this gap by analyzing 13 studies selected from a pool of 129 publications published between 2015 and 2024. The review evaluates the effectiveness of COTS games in L2 vocabulary acquisition, their practical implications, learner perceptions, and associated limitations. Findings suggest that COTS games can foster meaningful vocabulary development and enhance learner engagement, particularly when thoughtfully integrated into pedagogical settings.",

          "abstract": "Why do people with similar experience, training, or intelligence make dramatically different decisions in the same situation? Traditional models, especially dual-process theories, frame this variation as a tension between fast intuition and slow analysis. But real-world decision-making reveals deeper complexity. The Dynamic Model of Cognitive Dominance (DMCD) offers a new framework: it proposes that human judgment emerges from a shifting competition between multiple cognitive systems, such as pattern recognition, working memory, probabilistic reasoning, emotional regulation, systems thinking, and more.\nRather than focusing on static traits or identifying one “correct” way to think, DMCD emphasises dominance, the idea that different systems rise to influence depending on the task, context, emotional state, and individual strengths. Sometimes this alignment supports good decisions. Other times, it leads to predictable errors when the dominant system is poorly matched to the situation.\nThis paper outlines the theoretical foundations of DMCD, supported by research across psychology, neuroscience, and real-world expertise. It introduces a method for profiling dominance patterns, explores how these patterns shift under stress or uncertainty, and offers practical applications for education, leadership, team design, and high-stakes fields like healthcare and agriculture.",

          "abstract": "With research into the relationship between memory and imagination broadening to include collective identities (i.e. race, nationality), and recent polarization in modern American politics, it is important to understand the way people think and strategize about political change from a collective standpoint. Based on what Klugman (2011) describes as a \"theory of change\", and informed by Trobe &amp; Liberman’s (2003) original findings on abstract and concrete construals of events, the present study offers support for previous studies that have found patience and other temporal constraints to be an important predictor of how people conceptualize political change, including Wang's finding that an individual's patience is predictive of when they join a protest movement (2019), as well as various articles supporting the role temporal discounting plays in policy preferences (Barnfield, 2024) and moral future thinking (i.e. Law et al., 2024). In particular, it was found that the faster you desire social change to occur, as well as the more idealistic (i.e. abstract) you are about the type of system used to achieve political change (i.e. creating a new system vs. working within the current system), the more anxiety you have about your government's future response to issues you care about.",

          "authors": "Angjelin Hila",
          "abstract": "The paper engages and extends Deleuze’s philosophical project of difference in Difference and Repetition and Deleuze and Guattari’s thematic-complex in the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia in order to develop a social ontology that weaves the emergence of online spaces, differentiating information systems, the public sphere and emerging forms of social action. Supplanting the metaphysics of identity and representation with the actualization of the virtual, the paper mobilizes the conceptual framework of transcendental empiricism and assemblage theory to analyze a dynamically evolving social sphere that bifurcates between online and physical interaction and has transformed the subject, social relations, and their enveloping matrix of signifiers. Against this theoretical background, the paper takes public libraries as aberrant physical spaces that materialize social problems otherwise invisible or attenuated in public life. Increasingly spaces of spectacle, public libraries juxtapose the extrema of the social tapestry with the normal, a symptom of dynamic shifts within psycho-social assemblages caused by computational distribution, transmission, and amplification of information-affective flows. To explain this new terrain of social materiality, the paper develops the concept of the psycho-social as virtual-physical spaces that extremize the affective-affordance complex by integrating Deleuze’s notion of intensive fields, Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of desiring machines, and the Gibbsonian concept of affordance. The paper analyzes social breakdown in public library spaces through unstructured phenomenological analysis of the author’s first person testimony of Toronto Reference Library incidents, where incidents denote violations of rules of conduct as grounds for exclusion by a marginalized underclass spanning the homeless, drug addicted, mentally unstable, disturbed, destitute, and socially outcast. Belying system-symptomatic schizophrenic breakdowns of social cohesion, the explosive behaviour of the other, the deviant, the outcast reverberates through the collective field of intensity as a symptom of a virulent political economy exacerbated by control systems that order the body through production and direct affective-information flows into coercive computational affordances.",

Michigan ranks below the national average in both reading and math, while rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide among youth continue to rise. These challenges affect both neurotypical and neurodivergent students, yet schools lack comprehensive education that addresses the cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of learning. More than 40,000 Michiganders live with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but stigma persists, depriving them of inclusion and equitable support. \nTo address these gaps, we designed a K–12 curriculum that introduces students to key concepts in brain development, emotional regulation, and common NDDs such as autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. Through age specifc lessons, students will learn inclusive communication strategies and develop empathy toward peers with diverse learning abilities. While formal evaluations have not been conducted, this curriculum provides comprehensive lesson plans that improve mental health awareness, increase academic performance, and enhance classroom inclusion. This type of model can address an urgent issue in both education and public health, while giving youth the ability and knowledge to be compassionate leaders in their communities. While education about neurodiversity does not guarantee these outcomes, it may be part of the solution.",

          "abstract": "This review examined media guidelines intended to reduce gambling-related harm and stigma, comparing them with best-practice guidelines for other stigmatised conditions such as mental health, suicide, and substance use. Using a qualitative descriptive approach with document analysis and frequency counts, the study identified common elements and key gaps. Most gambling media guidelines originate from Great Britain and Australia and were produced by governmental or non-profit organisations.\n\nKey recommendations include using first-person language, avoiding stigmatising terminology and blame-based narratives, and signposting support services, aligning with best practices for reporting on stigmatised conditions. However, gambling guidelines primarily focus on language, self-stigma, and help-seeking, rather than addressing commercial determinants, public stigma, and discrimination. In this way, they continue to be concerned with gambling at the individual level rather than equipping media professionals to reframe the broader causes, consequences, and solutions to gambling harm. \n\nThe review suggests that future guidelines should promote a wider reframing of gambling harm using practical guidance on human-interest stories, ethical engagement with people with lived experience of gambling harm, and the provision of access to credible sources of statistics. Development of more effective media guidelines requires stronger involvement from media professionals and other stakeholders, alongside the integration of empirical evidence to support accurate, ethical, and impactful reporting on gambling harm.",

          "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) affect over 300 million people worldwide, including 40,000 estimated in Michigan. Despite established research on the positive effects of using therapeutic sensory environments, access is often limited or unreachable due to cost (the average room can cost over $30,000). This research aims to bridge the gap by designing a low-cost, scalable sensory room model suitable for public spaces. We included a qualitative interview process with key stakeholders, caregivers of people with NDD, Applied Behavior Analysts, and Title I special education teachers to gain their perspectives and experiences in order to identify barriers to access and determine the components of a sensory room for the proposed model. We created a prototype sensory room containing four functional spaces: (1) an active area with equipment (i.e., mini trampoline, ball pit) for proprioceptive and vestibular input; (2) a quiet area (i.e., pop-up tent, weighted blankets) for supporting self-regulation; (3) a cognitive stimulation area (i.e., fine motor skills activities, tactile books); and (4) an art area for creative expression supplies (multi-model). Overall, the model has been implemented in nine diverse environments (community center, public school, pediatric clinic, refugee aid center, etc.). This low-cost model offers the possibility of being adapted as a viable sensory room intervention to improve access to a therapeutic sensory space in areas with scarce resources.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the capacity of frontline staff to oversee automated decision-making (ADM) systems, which are increasingly used in digital welfare states to make life-altering decisions. While prior research had focused on cognitive limitations that lead to human over-reliance on ADM, the role of contextual factors that also shape caseworkers’ supervisory activities has neither been conceptualised, nor systematically investigated. To address this gap, we develop an analytical framework for the context-sensitive study of frontline oversight, inspired by the street-level bureaucracy perspective and human–computer interaction studies. We also demonstrate the framework’s relevance through findings from a mixed-methods study of a profiling algorithm used by Public Employment Services in Poland. We identify four types of factors – policy-, organisation-, professionalism-, and technology-related – that effectively shape frontline oversight. Our findings also have practical implications, as the inclusion of humans in the decision-making loop is a central element of regulatory efforts aimed at protecting individuals from algorithmic harms.",

Positioned as a central hub for SFD communication, this research examines how the agenda is constructed within the sportanddev platform, with a particular focus on the organizations, topics, goals, and target groups of the articles. The findings reveal a significant decline in article volume post-2016, coinciding with the closure of the UN Office on Sport for Development and Peace. Despite the platform’s open nature, content is disproportionately produced by a small number of well-resourced international organizations, suggesting persistent power imbalances. Football dominates as the most featured sport worldwide, but there are also strong regional preferences. Thematic focuses such as youth development, gender, and disability fluctuate over time, often aligning with global events like the Paralympics or the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that external events and well-resourced organisations still largely drive the agenda in SFD. Overall, this study highlights how digital platforms such as sportanddev both reflect and reinforce existing hierarchies within SFD, while also offering potential for more inclusive and critical engagement.",

However, trust is a multidimensional, rather than monolithic, concept, and the relative importance of different dimensions of trust in generating support for environmental management has not been fully explored. In this study, we use the trust ecology framework to examine the role of affinitive, dispositional, procedural, and rational trust in support for fisheries management among recreational anglers in the Great Lakes region of the United States. We found that all dimensions of trust positively correlate with support for management, with rational trust being the strongest predictor. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and race showed minimal impact compared to trust dimensions. Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of trust and its critical role in resource management and suggest that building and maintain multiple dimensions of trust can enhance public support for environmental management, ultimately leading to more effective and resilient environmental governance.",

          "abstract": "The Sulu Archipelago, nestled between Mindanao and Borneo, has been a melting pot of people and cultures for thousands of years. Major sociopolitical changes marked its history, attracting groups of people or forcing drastic dispersals. Today, the islands host various ethnolinguistic groups, including Sama-Badjaw and Tausug-speaking communities. We surveyed the literature from multiple disciplines—linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, history, and genetics—to shed light on past movements and the emergence of ethnicities in the region. Three factors drive ethnogenesis in the Sulu Archipelago: niche or economic specialisation, social hierarchies, and assimilation. Economic specialisation initially fostered differentiation among groups inhabiting reef and island ecosystems. The most extreme adaptive strategy was boat-nomadism, whose origin was tied to the evolving sociopolitical order. With the rise of the Sultanate of Sulu, differences in rank and religion were articulated along ethnic lines. The Tausug assumed formal dominance over the surrounding populace, whereas the Sama Dilaut were relegated to society’s periphery. The mid-eighteenth century saw the integration of Sulu within the global trading network which created a labour-driven economy focused on procuring local products. During this period, the Sama Bangingi emerged as specialised maritime raiders who incorporated captive peoples from parts of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Following the end of foreign imperial control, the peoples of Sulu found themselves subsumed within the modern Philippine state. Social change continues as the Sama Dilaut integrate into the broader Sama milieu, and the rest of the Sulu Archipelago into Filipino society.",

          "abstract": "Past research has explored various factors associated with grandparental childcare but has overlooked the role of personality traits. We address this gap by analyzing the association between personality traits and grandparental childcare using data from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). In SHARE, personality traits were measured for the first time in wave 7, and in wave 8, they were collected only from individuals who did not report them in wave 7. We pool observations from waves 7 and 8 (N = 13,441 individuals). We find that four personality traits—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness—are significantly associated with higher provision of grandchild care. Additionally, conscientiousness—and, to a lesser extent, neuroticism—is associated with a higher likelihood of providing care on at least a weekly basis. These findings underscore the role of personality in grandparental caregiving and may have methodological implications for assessing the effects of grandchild care on health and wellbeing.",

First, we demonstrate that German national MPs are strongly present on Instagram across parties, gender and age groups which is why we, in a second step, closely examine the Instagram activities (N=1279) of 24 German national MPs, using a pre-defined codebook. We show that MPs predominately display behind-the-scenes images as well as state their opinion on political issues. The visibility of issues strongly depends on parties’ issue ownership and on contextual factors. Furthermore, we highlight that younger MPs have a more sophisticated use of Instagram and integrate the social media platform more strongly into their daily political activities.",

By linking digital media studies with attitudinal studies on gender, we show that extensive use of social media (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram) is significantly associated with more regressive views on gender-related issues. The survey assesses gender issues in the labor market, LGBT rights, and the perceptions of feminists. Linear regressions reveal that intense social media usage is associated with more regressive attitudes on these issues. To validate these findings, we conduct extensive sensitivity tests, confirming the robustness of our results across diverse model specifications. This study advances scholarly debates on the role of social media in shaping sociopolitical attitudes and provides novel empirical insights into the intersection of social media use and gender-related conflicts in Europe.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductors have become central to geopolitical rivalry and national strategy. This article examines Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a paradigmatic case of institutional transformation in strategic industries. More than a technological leader, TSMC has emerged as an institutional mediator—navigating overlapping policy regimes, supply chain fragmentation, and diverging state agendas. Drawing on TSMC’s global expansion, especially its fabs in Arizona and Kumamoto, I show how firms are increasingly expected to perform quasi-sovereign functions: ensuring supply continuity, managing regulatory tensions, and absorbing geopolitical risk. I argue that prevailing discourses of “decoupling” and “reshoring” misdiagnose the problem, treating physical relocation as a proxy for strategic autonomy. Instead, I theorize institutional absorptive capacity as the foundation of long-term sovereignty: the ability of firms and states to learn, adapt, and coordinate across volatile environments. This requires shifting policy focus from industrial control to institutional design—investing in learning systems, governance capacity, and trust-based cooperation. TSMC’s trajectory thus signals a broader reconfiguration of state–firm boundaries and the emergence of a multipolar, narrative-driven political economy. The article concludes by outlining future research on cross-border institutional agency, strategic narrative construction, and techno-industrial governance beyond the U.S.–China binary.",

Hegel’s account of the master–slave dialectic in an effort to characterize data work outsourced by Big Tech corporations to the Global South as a modern form of slavery. The argument is structured around two pillars. First, I offer an interpretation of Hegel’s influential text, arguing that the emergence and eventual emancipation of servile self-consciousness fundamentally depend on coerced labor—specifically, the labor of giving form to a technical object for the satisfaction of others. I also examine recent critiques of the master–slave dialectic, particularly its role in supporting Hegel’s justification of European racism and colonialism. Second, I extend these insights by examining contemporary cases of generative AI design. Drawing on secondary literature, I assess the extent to which the essential features of the master–slave dialectic resonate with the experiences of data workers who help shape safe digital applications for users. My interest lies in opening pathways for challenging Hegel’s account of emancipation, particularly by suggesting that the oppressed may pursue it through trajectories not predicated on total obedience to the will of others.",

We derive the regulator’s optimal policy in a setting in which private portfolios react endogenously to the regulator's model choice and policy rule. We show that even purely predictive models can generate welfare gains for a regulator, and that predictive precision and knowledge of causal impacts of policy interventions are complementary. Second, we introduce a deep learning architecture tailored to financial holdings data—a graph transformer—and we discuss why it is optimally suited to this problem. The model learns vector embedding representations for both assets and investors by explicitly modeling the relational structure of holdings, and it attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy in out-of-sample forecasting tasks including trade prediction.",

          "abstract": "How does stakeholder participation in natural resource management change when conservation rules are grounded in near real-time data? Recognition of our rapidly changing climate and recent technological advances have facilitated the increased feasibility of the “dynamic management” of natural resources, which promises to align the spatiotemporal scales of management with ecological variability and resource use. Drawing on Kelty’s (2020) concept of “contributory autonomy,” this article offers a critical comparison of how participation is conceived of in the more established context of static conservation areas and planning versus the emergent field of dynamic management. A systematic review of the dynamic ocean management literature reveals a varied, but shallow engagement with the topic of stakeholder participation in that context. Whereas static management regimes are governed by intuitive and readily contestable maps, dynamic management is governed by models and data flows. Overall, the decision-making stakeholder of participatory mapping processes under static management is displaced by the stakeholder conceived as an “end user” of a dynamic management product. Yet, these shifts also open up potential points of contestation, which may pattern the future theory and practice of participation in dynamic management: counterdata, countermodeling, and data chokepoints. Beyond the empirical focus on oceans, this article contributes to broader conversations about the political stakes of environmental data, and algorithmic and artificial intelligence-driven natural resource conservation by considering how possibilities for participation are foreclosed, enabled, and reconstituted by new spatiotemporal and technological conditions.",

Using population-based experiments leveraging real-world interviews with extreme right activists on Sky News UK and Australia, we test if media exposure leads to higher agreement with extreme right statements. We also test if exposure affects perceptions of how many others agree with these statements. Our findings are consistent across both countries: exposure to uncritical interviews increases agreement with extreme statements and perceptions of broader support in the population. Testing the media strategy in the UK, we find that critical interviewing tarnishes the activist’s image and reduces effects but still heightens perceived support for extreme statements. This study identifies a mechanism through which extreme political ideas spread and offers insights into media strategies to counteract persuasion and normalisation effects.",

Confucian culture, which upholds core values such as benevolence and righteousness, forgiveness and tolerance, integrity, and loyalty and filial piety, has long permeated various levels of Chinese society. Using non-financial listed firms in China as the sample, this study measures the strength of Confucian cultural influence by the number of Confucian temples within varying distances around each firm and further explores the impact of Confucian culture on corporate risk-taking. The results show that Confucian culture is negatively associated with corporate risk-taking, indicating that in regions where Confucian culture is more deeply rooted, firms tend to exhibit lower levels of risk-taking. This study provides an in-depth empirical analysis of the factors influencing corporate risk-taking and the role of cultural factors, offering important guidance for corporate strategic development and risk management strategies while contributing to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the critical role of cultural factors, such as Confucian culture, in risk-taking decisions.",

These elements form recursive engines that generate gradients of being that motivate further contestation.\nUnlike frameworks that pathologize competing realities, contestivism recognizes meaning contests as the fundamental mechanism of human social organization.

In this article, we identify the various manifestations of caregiver well-being, test rural-suburban-urban differences, and explore the role of state-level family policy. Drawing on responses from 4,620 caregivers of adults and children to the STAT Caregiving surveys from the North Central and Northeast Regions of the United States, we use latent class analysis to develop a caregiver well-being typology. We identify three latent classes of caregiver well-being: high, medium, and low and describe the composition of each class. Next, we use multinomial logistic regression to test differences between rural, suburban, and urban caregivers in their probability to be in each well-being class, while accounting for individual-level characteristics and the state-level context of care infrastructure. We find that rural and suburban caregivers are overrepresented among the low and medium well-being classes and underrepresented among the high well-being class relative to their urban counterparts. Additionally, caregivers’ own characteristics vary more across well-being than does the state-level family policy context. Our findings speak to the importance of robust family care policies that are attuned to differences in social and built infrastructure across rural, suburban, and urban residence.",

Using data from five EU countries and drawing on a dataset of over 3.2 million posts mentioning 88 candidates, we applied a mixed-methods approach to assess the volume and nature of online abuse. Toxicity levels were measured using a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm. After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse.\nWhile a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment.\nThese results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",

The study focuses on whether users edit political articles differently, in which order political parties appeared, the relation of election years (heightened political activity) to frequencies of user edits, and whether the overall evolution of content on political parties’ articles is in a process of growth, standstill or decline. The results show that parties without government representation have the highest frequency of editing when related to parties’ political support in elections. This tendency is stronger on the far-right side of the political scale. The Sweden Democrats was the first party on Wikipedia (2002) and within six months most parties followed. Elections were initially related to higher edit frequencies. Users’ editing peaked the first 15 years, but has then merged on a lower level. The conclusions suggest that when studying this type of political platform user engagement, the following factors matter: The age of the platform, whether the party holds a dominant position, whether the party's support is increasing, whether the party is excluded from governmental collaboration, whether the party has a far-out political position on the left-right scale, and finally, whether the party is a right-wing party.",

          "title": "Memes and monsters of the interregnum: Gramsci between the times",
          "authors": "Christopher Hobson",
          "abstract": "Faced with a continually mounting array of shocks, surprises and shifts, there is an understandable search for frames to describe these confusing conditions. A combination of the collapse of previous certainties with the lack of a new paradigm solidifying has led many to depict the present moment as an interregnum. This is not a neutral term, to use it is to bring forth the poetic phrasing of Antonio Gramsci: ‘the old is dying and the new cannot be born’. Through a genealogical engagement with Gramsci’s prison notebook entry, this paper traces the remarkable trajectory of the term from obscurity to being adopted by commentators across the political spectrum. The paper considers Gramsci’s original prison notebook entry, observes the lack of engagement with it during the 1960s and 70s when other parts of his work were picked up. Indeed, it was only following the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, and the entry being coterminously invoked by two influential scholars, Zygmunt Bauman and Slavoj Žižek. The paper examines how Bauman and Žižek each offered a template for how interregnum has been used in the years since. In the first mode, as represented by Bauman, Gramsci’s entry is placed at the beginning of the analysis and then serves as a frame for the subsequent discussion of maladies identified. In the second mode, as found in Žižek, interregnum appears at the end as part of the argument’s grand finale. In both renditions, Gramsci is deployed to buttress already established arguments. The paper surveys some more interesting and provocative engagements with the entry in recent years presented by Carlo Bordoni, Wolfgang Streeck and Adam Tooze. These are an exception to the more common trend of Gramsci’s interregnum being flattened and thinned out, reduced to an analytical meme.  Bemoaning the death of the ‘old’ and the rise of ‘monsters’ is much easier than seriously reckoning with the contradictions and difficulties of an expanding empty space, one devoid of historical guarantees or clear precedents.",

          "authors": "Michelle Schultze",
          "abstract": "Kyrgyzstan serves as a key case study for the broader Central Asia–Russia labor pipeline, which supported an estimated 8 million migrants annually in 2020. Prior to the Russo-Ukraine war, remittances from Russia accounted for approximately 30% of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP, driven by over 10% of its population working in Russia. However, understanding wartime migration dynamics is challenging due to suspected political interference in Russian data, restricted foreign access to this data, and the informality that characterizes Central Asian migration patterns. \n \nThis study incorporates Yandex Wordstat, Google Trends, XGBoost (which outperforms other machine learning methods), and autoregressive models to \"nowcast\" missing data. The results reveal a push effect linked to war onset in February 2022 and war intensity. However, all three of the analyzed migration datasets suggest a potential delayed labor substitution effect as Central Asian migrants fill vacancies left by conscripted Russian workers, proxied by casualty data from Mediazona and the BBC. The study also examines remittance trends, which seem to increase along with the labor substitution effect after a two-month lag. These results are robust to Russia- and Kyrgyzstan-side socioeconomic controls such as wage levels and population dynamics. \n \nThis study provides new insight into the largely opaque Central Asia–Russia labor pipeline, a critical element in development policymaking for both regions. It also introduces a novel methodology for nowcasting migration trends, particularly through Yandex Wordstat, which has been largely overlooked in English-language scholarship.",

          "authors": "Melissa A. Milkie; Liana C Sayer; Kei Nomaguchi; Hope Xu Yan",
          "abstract": "Gender scholars have debated whether the recent movement toward a more equal division of domestic labor is stalling. Using a differential convergence perspective, we argue that examining which domestic tasks experience gender convergence, whose changes narrow the gap, and why changes happen is critical for understanding gender convergence in domestic labor time. Drawing on data from the 2003-22 American Time Use Survey, we examine trends in core housework, occasional housework, shopping, and childcare time. Results for married women and men indicate that the historically large gender gap in housework time narrowed further this century, from a women-to-men ratio of 1.8:1 in 2003-05 to 1.5:1 in 2022. The decrease in the gender gap was concentrated in traditionally “feminine” core housework (from 4.2:1 to 2.5:1), particularly in housecleaning and laundry. The gender gap in shopping time also narrowed significantly, reaching gender parity. However, the gender gap in childcare time remained at a mother-to-father ratio of 2:1. Decomposition analyses indicate that women’s reduced housework time could mainly be explained by population compositional changes, whereas men’s increased housework time reflected behavioral changes. With men taking on more “female-typed” domestic activities, the gendered norms associated with different types of domestic labor may be becoming redefined.",

          "abstract": "Este artículo explora cómo El retrato de Dorian Gray (Wilde) y Orlando (Woolf) configuran figuras narrativas del otro que interpelan las nociones tradicionales de identidad, género y subjetividad. A partir del vínculo entre filosofía y literatura, se propone una lectura ética de la diferencia influenciada por las propuestas de Emmanuel Lévinas y María Zambrano. En lugar de pensar al otro como objeto de conocimiento, se lo concibe como una presencia irreductible que exige responsabilidad. La narrativa, desde esta perspectiva, no es solo representación, sino una forma de hospitalidad. Mientras Dorian se repliega en una estética narcisista que niega al otro, Orlando encarna una subjetividad en tránsito que abraza la ambigüedad como posibilidad ética. Se concluye que narrar al otro es también una forma de responder, y que la literatura puede ser un espacio privilegiado para formar subjetividades abiertas, sensibles y responsables frente a la alteridad.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning is transforming fields like chemistry, engineering, and medicine, but its application to social science fields like demography remains limited. This study explores deep learning as an emerging approach to mortality forecasting, a core area in demographic research. This paper addresses why and how deep learning performs better than three well-known baselines for mortality forecasting. First, it explores the relationship between model architecture and data pooling. Second, it provides a detailed country-level performance analysis, identifying contexts where deep learning underperforms and exploring possible remedies. Third, it discusses the broader applicability and potential of deep learning methods in demography. The findings underscore the potential of deep learning to enhance demographic forecasting and invite broader reflection on the role of computational and AI-driven methods in population studies.",

Utilizando datos del SINIM y SERVEL (2018-2023), los resultados revelan significativas disparidades territoriales: 59% de los municipios presentan niveles \"bajo\" o \"muy bajo\" de autonomía, mientras solo 2% alcanza niveles \"muy altos\". La autonomía administrativa es consistentemente alta en todas las regiones, pero las dimensiones política y fiscal muestran gran variabilidad interregional. No existe correlación directa entre las tres dimensiones, sugiriendo que la descentralización se desarrolla de manera independiente en cada ámbito.

          "abstract": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence systems complicates our ability to distinguish real people from machine imitators, or “bots.” Drawing upon social psychology, symbolic interactionism, and the sociology of science and technology, we develop a theoretical framework for a “Sociological Turing Test” to explain how social identity cues influence how people differentiate AI from humans. To evaluate our hypotheses we present a pre-registered online experiment with 1,160 respondents who were exposed to social media accounts with varied visual cues about their race, gender, and partisanship. We find that people from dominant social groups are more likely to classify members of minority groups as AI bots—however, our results also show that members of some minority groups are more likely to classify each other as AI bots. These findings suggest existing social hierarchies extend into human-AI interaction, creating a new burden for marginalized groups in online settings and complicating the processes of social identity construction more broadly. Our research thus contributes to an emerging sociology of generative artificial intelligence by revealing how technological disruption challenges ontology and inter-group relations and introduces new methods to study this process in online settings.",

          "authors": "Dieuwke Zwier",
          "abstract": "Many national education systems have schools that adopt distinctive elements like alternative\npedagogical concepts or specialty themes. This “school profiling” is thought to drive school\nsegregation by socio-economic status (SES). However, since most existing research has focused\non U.S. charter schools and lacks large-scale student-level data, the connection between\nprofiling and SES-based school sorting remains unclear. This study addresses this gap by\nfocusing on the case of the Netherlands, a country known for its high school autonomy and\nfreedom of school choice. I use population-wide register data from over 110,000 students (aged\n11–12), linked to novel data on school profiling. The findings reveal social stratification in access\nto schools with distinctive profiles, with higher SES students having access to a more diverse\npool of schools. Furthermore, conditional logit models show evidence of self-sorting by SES for\nsome profiles: for instance, schools with progressive learning concepts are less popular among\nlower SES students, while higher SES students are comparatively less likely to choose labor\nmarket-themed schools. These SES disparities, however, are modest and not always in the\nexpected direction. Overall, findings underscore the role of access disparities in shaping\nSES-based sorting, next to differential preferences for schooling.",

The results are that industry rotation will be significant, that technology, new energy, infrastructure, and pharmaceuticals will be strong in different months, while traditional industries of real estate and the financial sector will continue under pressure in China's stock market in 2025. Therefore, the conclusion is that investors should seize the opportunity in policy-oriented sectors such as technology innovation and new energy, avoid sectors highly affected by macro policy adjustments, and flexibly adjust asset allocation according to the market cycle so as to achieve solid returns.",

          "authors": "Brian Holzman; Jinhua Zhao; Bethany Lewis; Hao Ma",
          "abstract": "Background/Context:\nAs states implement policies to expand STEM pathways, addressing persistent gender gaps in STEM education and careers remains a critical concern. In 2014–2015, Texas introduced a high-school graduation policy requiring students to declare an academic endorsement, similar to a high school major, including a STEM option. Beginning with the class of 2018, students in the Houston Independent School District (HISD) were subject to this policy. In 2019, HISD added a personalized intervention: high-school guidance counselors conducted Personal Graduation Plan (PGP) check-ins with seniors to assess progress toward endorsement completion. These check-ins may have served as a form of social capital, influencing students’ endorsement decisions, including girls’ persistence in STEM pathways.\n\nPurpose:\nThis study examines whether personalized guidance counseling can affect gender gaps in STEM choice. We examine whether a district-wide policy requiring senior-year check-ins might have influenced girls’ persistence in STEM, with particular attention to students from low-income backgrounds and underserved neighborhoods.\n\nResearch Design:\nWe use HISD administrative data to analyze endorsement selections and changes over time for the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. We begin by assessing gender gaps in ninth-grade STEM endorsement selection using binary logistic regression. We then use multinomial logistic regression to examine whether the PGP check-ins are associated with differential persistence patterns by gender and cohort.\n\nResults:\nWe find persistent gender gaps in STEM endorsement selection beginning in ninth grade, with girls less likely than boys to choose STEM. Without personalized counseling, these gaps persisted through graduation. However, the PGP check-in was associated with a disproportionate reduction in girls dropping the STEM endorsement and a greater likelihood of adding STEM, especially among girls from low-income backgrounds and underserved neighborhoods.\n\nConclusions:\nThese findings suggest that relational interventions like personalized guidance counseling may help mitigate gender disparities in STEM pathways. Expanding access to such interventions may promote greater equity in STEM education and beyond.",

          "authors": "Samuel L Leizerman",
          "abstract": "This document presents a self-contained, field-theoretic framework in a generalized nD+T Pseudo-Riemannian spacetime (-,+,+,...,+) to formally unify causal inference methods. I prove that established methods are geometric projections of this underlying reality. A key result is the formalization of Hypertime, a `derivative dimension` that models the interaction between spatial concepts and temporal dynamics. Within this causal tensor spacetime, I propose a new `Born Rule` for the emergence of causation from the interaction of vector-like states. This geometric-dynamical paradigm offers a novel mechanism for the detection of unobserved variable bias using operator non-commutativity and provides a mathematical origin for memory effects via the sinusoidal structure of fractional derivatives. The framework extends beyond traditional causal inference to encompass Bayesian statistics (belief updates as field dynamics), decision-making processes (softmax-to-argmax transitions as causal collapse), machine learning (parameter evolution as causal geodesics), and multi-agent systems (strategic interactions as causal field evolution) as manifestations of causal field theory. The empirical success of existing low-dimensional causal inference methods provides a compelling validation for the mathematical necessity and superior performance of this higher-dimensional spacetime framework. This proof serves as both a standalone treatise and the foundational pillar for a broader monograph on Unified Cognitive Field Theory.\n\nKeywords:\ncausal inference, field theory, Lorentzian geometry, derivative dimension, Born rule, hypertime, memory, geometric subsumption, qualitative primacy, hidden variables, Fubini's theorem, Bayesian inference, decision theory, machine learning, tensor calculus, manifolds, mathematical proof",
