          "title": "Individual vs Systemic: The pedagogical approaches to solutions of the replication crisis",
          "authors": "Savannah C Lewis; Alexa Mary Tullett",
          "abstract": "With increased interest in the replication crisis and the open science movement, it is important to examine the implications of communicating these topics to undergraduate psychology students. At the beginning of the open science movement, the effort to improve research practices was seen and discussed as both an individual and systemic endeavor. Some authors placed the focus on individual researchers, encouraging them to engage in practices like pre-registration and open data. Others, however, placed the responsibility with the system, arguing that incentive structures and norms need to reward these new practices. The current project examined whether using individual vs. systemic teaching approaches impacted psychology student’s trust, motivation, and optimism regarding the field of psychology. Undergraduate psychology students (N= 476) were randomly assigned to one of three video conditions, one specifying how researchers’ practices should change (individual), one specifying on incentive structures should change (systemic), and one summarizing general research practices in psychology. I expected to find that participants in the individual condition would show the highest levels of trust in the field, motivation to improve the field, and optimism, while participants in the systemic condition would show the highest trust in psychological researchers. Overall, while our manipulation effectively influenced participants' perceptions of the teaching approaches, the expected differences in trust, motivation, and optimism were not consistently observed. These results suggest that, regardless of whether one takes an individual or systemic approach, teaching about the replication crisis does not always undermine (or enhance) trust, motivation, and optimism.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Layered τ₀ Theory, a foundational framework establishing that all physical systems evolve through discrete causal steps of minimal duration τ₀ &gt; 0. The theory is constructed via five axiomatic modules:\nτ₀-Computational Equivalence: Physical systems are computationally equivalent to universal Turing machines under τ₀ constraints.\nUpper Bound on Computational Speed: No system exceeds the operation rate 1/τ₀.\nComplexity Hierarchy: System couplings respect τ₀-induced layered constraints.\nQuantum-Classical Transition: Classicality emerges when decoherence timescales T₂ ≪ τ₀.\nGeneralized Cellular Automaton: Continuous spacetime maps to discrete causal updates.\nAll derivations rely solely on reductio ad absurdum proofs from first principles, requiring no experimental input. The theory unifies computation, quantum dynamics, and emergent complexity under a single τ₀-constrained framework.",

          "authors": "Igor Grossmann; Niyati Kachhiyapatel; Ethan Andrew Meyers; Zhang Hanxiao; Richard Eibach",
          "abstract": "Judgment is often described in terms of an intuitive (System 1) versus deliberative (System 2) dichotomy, yet sound deliberation itself can take more than one form. Building on philosophical traditions and distinctions in treatment of sound judgment in economics and law, we propose that lay conceptions revolve around two distinct types of deliberate judgment: rational, emphasizing rule-based and utility-focused reasoning for well-defined problems, and reasonable, prioritizing context-sensitive and socially conscious reasoning for ill-defined problems. Across four studies in English-speaking Western samples (Studies 1–4; N = 2,130) and a Mandarin-speaking Chinese sample (Study 4; N = 697), participants described their notions of “sound” and “good” judgment, evaluated social scenarios, chose between candidates with distinct judgmental profiles, and categorized non-social objects. Results consistently showed that people view both rationality and reasonableness as common forms of deliberate sound judgment, while treating them as distinct. Participants preferred rational deliberation for algorithmic social roles linked to well-defined tasks and reasonable deliberation for interpretive roles linked to ill-defined tasks. Moreover, framing decisions as rational vs. reasonable influenced whether participants relied on rule-based vs. overall-similarity strategies in classification tasks. These findings suggest that lay understanding of sound judgment does not rely on a single standard of judgmental competence. Instead, people recognize that both rationality and reasonableness are critical for competent deliberation on different types of problems in life.",

          "abstract": "Este documento expone una problemática estructural en la práctica psicológica y psiquiátrica en México: el uso de la formación clínica y psicoanalítica no como herramienta terapéutica, sino como mecanismo de coerción simbólica para forzar a los pacientes a costear baterías psicométricas y tratamientos innecesarios.\n\nEl fenómeno no opera mediante violencia explícita —no hay un arma en la cabeza—, sino mediante el uso de los mismos recursos académicos y clínicos que forman a los profesionales de la salud mental:\n\nConocimiento de estrategias de manipulación, comúnmente estudiadas para diagnosticar psicopatía, narcisismo o conductas antisociales.\n\nDominio del condicionamiento conductual (refuerzo intermitente, inducción de ansiedad, manipulación del apego terapéutico).\n\nIdealización de la figura del psicólogo/psiquiatra como autoridad científica incuestionable.\n\nCuando estos saberes se aplican no para sanar, sino para generar dependencia económica, se produce un desvío ético de gran magnitud: el paciente, confiando en la autoridad profesional, acepta diagnósticos, tratamientos y costos que no resisten justificación clínica.\n\nEl caso documentado —una batería psicométrica de $10,000 pesos por persona, seguida de terapias obligatorias de $21,600 pesos mensuales para un núcleo familiar de tres miembros— ilustra cómo se normaliza el dolor convertido en modelo de negocio. El contexto real (detención judicial y crisis legal) fue reducido a etiquetas diagnósticas (\"trastorno límite\", \"psicopatía integrada\"), invisibilizando la dimensión socio-legal que explicaba la disregulación emocional de la paciente.\n\nEste fenómeno plantea preguntas críticas:\n\n¿Quién audita la eficacia real de las intervenciones psicológicas?\n\n¿Bajo qué parámetros se define la pertinencia diagnóstica?\n\n¿Qué pruebas garantizan que los propios terapeutas no operan bajo rasgos psicopáticos o narcisistas, guiados por lógicas mercantiles?\n\n¿Quién protege al paciente de ser retenido en procesos terapéuticos sin alta definida, bajo diagnósticos erróneos o insuficientes?\n\nEn ausencia de regulación efectiva, la psicología corre el riesgo de consolidarse como una práctica coercitiva más que clínica, donde la ciencia es instrumentalizada para consumo.\n\nLa conclusión central es doble:\n\nLa salud mental no puede estar subordinada a la lógica del mercado sin poner en riesgo la ética profesional.\n\nSe requiere un marco regulatorio y metodológico independiente que audite diagnósticos, valide pertinencia terapéutica y proteja el derecho humano a la salud y a la verdad objetiva.\n\n“La confianza del paciente no puede ser mercancía.

          "title": "The Dual Nature of Language: MLC and ELM",
          "authors": "Alex Snow",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a formal framework for understanding language in cognitive systems, distinguishing the Metalanguage of Cognition (MLC), an internal system of vector-based cognitive dynamics, from the External Language of Meaning (ELM), a symbolic system for communication. Rooted in Principia Cognitia (PC), which is grounded in a materialist ontology and distinguishing phenomena from their discrete signal representations, the framework defines MLC as a triple (S, R, O) of semions (vector representations of cognitive units), weighted relations, and operations, while ELM is a symbol set Σ linked via a mapping μ: S→Σ that transforms internal representations into external symbols, often losing structural detail. Grounded in the axiom that cognition is an activatable vector structure, this framework resolves philosophical challenges, such as Searle’s Chinese Room paradox, by showing that understanding requires MLC, not just ELM. Empirical evidence from transformer-based large language models (LLMs), where residual streams encode belief state geometries, validates semions as cognitive units. The MLC-ELM model unifies biological and artificial cognition, redefines rationality through metacognitive operations like detecting knowledge gaps (e.g., recognizing unfamiliar concepts), and informs AI design by prioritizing internal cognitive alignment. This substrate-neutral, testable framework advances cognitive science, neuroscience, AI, and philosophy.",

          "authors": "Beray Macit; Annalisa Lipp; Armin Zlomuzica; Harald Engler; Simon Edward Blackwell; Felix Würtz; Jürgen Margraf; Marcella Lydia Woud",
          "abstract": "Exposure is highly effective for treating acrophobia and there is growing consensus that cognitive mechanisms play an important role in exposure-based therapies. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether adding a Cognitive Bias Modification - Interpretation (CBM-I) training to a single-session exposure therapy further facilitates cognitive change. The sample included diagnosed acrophobia patients (N = 81), all of whom received exposure therapy. One day later they were randomized to receive either CBM-I or a sham training. The CBM-I trained patients to interpret and appraise ambiguous, height-related scenarios in a less threatening and adaptive manner, whereas the sham training comprised ambiguous, neutral scenarios. Outcomes included changes in interpretational biases (Encoding Recognition Task, Heights Interpretation Questionnaire, Scrambled Sentences Task), acrophobia-related symptoms (Acrophobia Questionnaire), and behavioral avoidance (Behavioral Approach Test). In intention-to-treat analyses patients receiving CBM-I showed a greater reduction in interpretational biases post-training compared to the sham condition (primary outcome). However, group differences were not sustained at follow-up and, i.e., both groups demonstrated improvements across all outcomes, except for the Scrambled Sentences Task. No significant group differences in reductions in other acrophobia-related cognitions, symptoms, or behavior emerged over time. Exploratory analyses revealed strong associations between the assessed cognitive, behavioral, and subjective outcomes, but neither of these outcomes correlated with the hormonal measures (progesterone, estradiol). To conclude, our findings suggest that while CBM-I can temporarily facilitate cognitive change in the context of exposure, its long-term benefits and downstream effects may require further optimization. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols to maximize its efficacy as a potential adjunct to exposure therapy.",

          "abstract": "A recent detailed analysis of how well neuroscientists understand brain function concluded that\nwe have highly overestimated this ability. Here, we support this view but argue for important\nexceptions whose identification serves useful didactic purposes. For example, the highly-studied\nSuperior Colliculus (SC), known best as involved in controlling gaze shifts, has a much more\ncomplex functional organization than originally assumed; being involved in encoding many\ndifferent behaviours including cognitive functions not even requiring eye movements. An\nadditionally important, but less understood, brain mechanism regards how sequences of different\nbehaviors are generated rapidly, each often requiring a unique brain-wide spatiotemporal pattern\nof neural activity. How are different complex neural circuits selected and rapidly switched,\nsequentially, from one brain-wide spatiotemporal configuration to another? What experimental\napproaches are needed to understand major circuit complexity and how can this knowledge be\napplied to research on neurological diseases? Here, we consider these questions using, as\nexamples, two brain regions: the highly studied midbrain’s SC and visual area V4, both of whom\nhave profuse connectivity to cortical and subcortical brain regions but with the SC’s dynamic\nmulti-functional connectivity being far better understood. We suggest that comparisons between\nthe best understood SC and less understood V4 can guide reflections on what experimental and\nevolutionary-based theoretical approaches are important to understand brain-wide dynamic neural\nsignal processing.",

While school-based mindfulness training (SBMT) offers a scalable prevention approach with broad reach, evidence of its effectiveness is mixed, and there is a compelling case for a more personalized approach to prevention.\n\nObjective: To develop a data-driven algorithm from baseline characteristics to predict which adolescents are most likely to benefit from SBMT.\n\nDesign: Secondary analysis of the My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2016-2018. Machine learning models were trained on 70% of schools and validated in the remaining 30% from different schools.\n\nSetting: Eighty-four broadly representative UK secondary schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nParticipants: A total of 8,376 adolescents aged 11-13 years at baseline were included. Students had to be enrolled in participating schools with parental consent and student assent. The sample was 55% female, 76% White ethnicity, with mean age 12.2 years.\n\nInterventions: SBMT teaching core mindfulness skills through psychoeducation, class discussion, and practices, compared to standard social-emotional learning (teaching-as-usual; TAU) covering topics such as relationships and mental health education.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Causal forest and elastic net regression models computed Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) scores quantifying individual expected benefit from SBMT vs. TAU.\n\nResults: While the overall RCT found no average benefit of SBMT over TAU, the PAI model identified a subset of adolescents (19%) with significantly better depression outcomes when assigned to SBMT (d = 0.22, p = .037), and a larger subgroup (37%) who benefited more from TAU (d = 0.22, p = .004). Top predictive features were primarily student-level variables, including baseline emotional symptoms, executive functioning difficulties, mindfulness skills, and anxiety. Prediction was strongest for depressive symptoms, with mixed findings for two other trial outcomes (social–emotional–behavioural functioning and well-being).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Machine learning can identify adolescents differentially likely to benefit from SBMT versus TAU, offering a path toward more personalized school-based prevention. Future prospective trials should test whether algorithm-guided intervention assignment improves clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Many people aim to eat healthier or become more physically active, yet often fail. Identifying aspects of behavior that are easier to change is crucial for effective interventions. Two preregistered online studies assessed participants' perceived ease of changing eating and physical activity (PA) behavior and explored potential moderators. Young adults predominantly without (Study 1, N = 435, Mage = 31.6) and older adults predominantly with chronic conditions (Study 2, N = 637, Mage = 57.2) indicated the perceived ease of changing 21 aspects of eating and PA, medical history, social comparison, prior behavior change attempts and current behavior. Young adults found increasing consumption and engaging in high-intensity PA easiest, reflecting hedonic goals and high self-efficacy. Conversely, older adults found reducing consumption and sedentary behavior easiest, possibly driven by health motivation and physical limitations. Prior attempts and social comparison showed divergent impacts across groups, possibly influenced by differing learning trajectories and health priorities. Lower unhealthy food consumption correlated with easier reduction, while high PA did not always translate to perceiving further increases in PA easier. Tailored interventions aligning goals with perceived capabilities and priorities are essential to maximize engagement and adherence. Longitudinal research is needed to establish causality and refine strategies.",

          "authors": "Simon Grund; Oliver Lüdtke; Alexander Robitzsch",
          "abstract": "Missing data are a common challenge in multilevel designs, and multiple imputation (MI) is often used for handling them. Past research has shown that multilevel MI provides an effective treatment of missing data, so long as the imputation model takes the multilevel structure and the intended analyses into account, and modern methods have been developed that can accommodate even complex types of analyses. However, multilevel MI can be difficult to apply in practice, where the multilevel structure is often not very pronounced or not of immediate interest in the analysis. In these applications, existing methods can become unstable and often struggle to provide reliable results. In this article, we introduce a fully conditional specification approach to multilevel MI that combines single-level imputation methods with group means (GM) or adjusted group means (AGM) to accommodate the multilevel structure. Based on a theoretical investigation and multiple simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of these methods in different applications, including applications with balanced designs, unbalanced designs, and larger numbers of variables. Our findings suggest that the AGM approach—though not the GM approach—performs well in most of the scenarios we investigated and can even outperform conventional approaches to multilevel MI in challenging applications. We also provide an illustrative example for the implementation of these methods in a simulated example, and we discuss the implications of our findings for practice.",

          "authors": "Stefan Wöhner; Jörg D. Jescheniak",
          "abstract": "The production of a word is delayed by the recent production of one or more semantically related words. This phenomenon, known as semantic interference, has been observed in picture naming tasks involving either large sets of pictures named once (continuous naming) or small sets of pictures named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that operates after each naming episode. However, the interference develops differently in these tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been suggested that the small local response sets in blocked naming are easily identified and stored in working memory, which then introduces an additional process that constrains the interference. We reasoned that this process would be less effective as the local response sets increased in size, resulting in cumulative interference. In blocked naming experiments involving local response sets of ten or nineteen items, we found that the interference did not increase continuously; rather, it carried on across more presentations than for the typically used small sets. This finding lends support to the notion of a control mechanism that operates gradually and interacts with an adaptive learning mechanism.",

We outline previous important discipline-specific and methodological contributions, connecting social psychological perspectives to the wider academic and practitioner landscape. We outline how our eleven special issue contributions advance discussion, theorising and research methodology on topics such as sustainability, collective group continuity, prefigurative politics, AI sentience, and degrowth policies. Finally, we encourage social psychologists of all topic and methodological persuasions to adopt a generative, prospective, and possibilities-focussed approach to their work, to ensure that social psychology as a discipline can effectively meet the challenges of the future and maximise its impact.",

          "abstract": "Counterfactual thinking, the ability to mentally represent how events might have unfolded differently, plays a central role in decision-making, memory, learning, and emotional regulation, and has even been described as a foundation of human cognition itself. Yet the neural systems supporting this capacity remain debated. Here, we present a quantitative meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies, synthesising evidence across tasks involving both simulated counterfactuals, where individuals deliberately imagine alternative self-referential scenarios, and computed counterfactuals, where the brain evaluates unchosen outcomes during decision-making. This analysis identified a distributed network encompassing the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala. Within this network, the OFC emerged as a hub for representing counterfactual options and their value, while the ACC, particularly its dorsal subdivision, linked these representations to behavioural control. The hippocampus supported constructive aspects of counterfactual thought, overlapping with episodic memory processes, and the amygdala contributed to the affective responses, particularly regret. Separate analyses for simulated and computed counterfactuals revealed partial dissociations. Simulated counterfactuals recruited the superior frontal gyrus, involved in constructive memory processes. Computed counterfactuals engaged the striatum, where fictive error signals encoded the value of unchosen outcomes and predicted subsequent behaviour. These findings indicate that counterfactual thinking relies on distinct but interacting systems for valuation, control, memory, and emotion, highlighting its multifaceted role in adaptive human cognition.",

Second, we piloted 59 items in a survey of 321 TNB people (16 years and older) reporting on current or recent romantic relationships. Using those data, we performed exploratory factor analysis to identify subscales, then selected 19 items based on factor loadings, item-subscale correlations, α-if-item-deleted, discrimination parameters, and item information curves. Third, we used weekly diary survey data from 299 romantically partnered TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to perform confirmatory factor analysis and assess reliability at the within- and between-relationship levels. Results indicate that the 19-item Transgender/Nonbinary Identity Support from Partners Scale (TISPS) assesses five forms of TNB identity support—Facilitation [of identity exploration], Identity Validation, Celebration, Allyship, and Understanding—with a consistent factor structure and good reliability at the between-relationship level. Psychometric results were poorer for weekly within-relationship variation, suggesting that TISPS subscales have suboptimal properties for assessing short-term change. The TISPS can be used in clinical and community settings and future research on the role of social support in TNB mental health.",

          "authors": "Taylor G. Hill; Kendall Smith",
          "abstract": "Happiness research provides robust evidence that living a satisfying life has external, secondhand benefits for families and communities. Yet, the field faces ongoing debates, including the extent to which life satisfaction is stable versus changeable, the validity of the U-shaped age trajectory, and the relative contributions of domain-specific satisfactions to global evaluations of life quality. We examined life satisfaction trajectories and how demographic covariates and satisfaction with specific domains influence life satisfaction over 13 waves of data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N = 6,711). Using nonlinear growth curve modeling, we found that life satisfaction remained relatively stable over the 13 waves (average of 5.06 to 5.26 out of 7), with small but significant variations based on demographic characteristics. Older individuals and those identifying as ethnic minorities reported higher baseline satisfaction, while males experienced steeper changes over time relative to females. Domain-specific satisfaction (leisure, income, health) predicted global life satisfaction at each wave; leisure satisfaction was consistently the strongest predictor. Plotting observed life satisfaction against age provided descriptive support for a U-shaped pattern, with higher satisfaction in early and later adulthood and lower satisfaction in midlife. These findings contribute to theoretical debates by showing that while life satisfaction has trait-like qualities (i.e., is stable over time), is also influenced by domain-specific appraisals (particularly leisure). The results thus support bottom-up models of well-being, highlighting the importance of personally valued life domains in understanding both stability and change in life satisfaction.",

          "authors": "Zahra Azizi; Jason Chan; Tomas Ward; Annalisa Setti",
          "abstract": "Multisensory integration (MSI)–the brain’s ability to combine information from different ‎senses–is crucial for coherent perception and adaptive behavior. While often viewed as a ‎bottom-up process, emerging research shows internal states like emotional arousal can ‎modulate MSI. The role of metacognition–our awareness of perceptual accuracy–‎remains underexplored in this context, particularly in relation to multisensory illusions ‎such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). This study examined how facially ‎induced emotional arousal affects audiovisual integration and metacognitive efficiency ‎during the SIFI task. It also assessed whether individual differences in sensory-‎processing sensitivity (via the Highly Sensitive Person [HSP] scale) influence these ‎effects. Fifty-five participants completed an online SIFI task, where neutral or disgusted ‎facial cues preceded audiovisual stimuli across six stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). ‎Participants reported the number of flashes and rated their confidence. Accuracy and ‎confidence improved at longer SOAs. However, while confidence was unaffected by the ‎pre/post condition, accuracy was significantly influenced, indicating a dissociation ‎between performance and subjective certainty. Emotional cues did not affect accuracy or ‎confidence, but higher HSP scores were linked to lower metacognitive efficiency, ‎especially in negative emotional contexts (β = –0.16, p = .04), though the interaction ‎was not statistically significant. Bayesian analysis suggested a 75% chance of a negative ‎interaction, but with uncertainty. These findings highlight that while arousal doesn’t ‎impair MSI, high sensory sensitivity may reduce introspective accuracy in emotional ‎contexts, with implications for decision-making and responsive technology design.‎",

          "abstract": "Rates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences. These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial.",

          "authors": "Samantha Bertschi; Monica D. Rosenberg; Edward K. Vogel; Matthieu Chidharom",
          "abstract": "Sustained attention fluctuates continuously between periods of low and high attentional engagement. Two major approaches have been used in the literature to capture these fluctuations. An objective approach, based on reaction time (RT) variability, identifies periods known as in-the-zone (stable and accurate) and out-of-the-zone (variable and error-prone). A subjective approach relies on participants’ self-reports regarding task-related and task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs). While both methods have proven effective in tracking attentional fluctuations, it remains unclear whether they capture the same type of fluctuations. In this study, we aimed to better characterize the subjective experience associated with objectively defined out-of-the-zone periods. Thirty participants completed a classic sustained attention task—the Continuous Performance Task (CPT)—in a go/no-go format. At several points during the task, participants were interrupted with subjective probes assessing their current mental state (task-focused, performance-focused, external distraction, daydreaming, and mind-blanking), as well as their perceived effort, opportunity cost, and arousal. Our results offer a nuanced view of the relationship between subjective and objective approaches. We found evidence for consistency: out-of-the-zone periods were more frequently associated with daydreaming than in-the-zone periods. However, inconsistencies also emerged. In-the-zone periods were marked by faster RTs, whereas subjective on-task periods were associated with slower responses. Arousal was reduced during TUT periods but did not differ between in- and out-of-the-zone periods. Together, these findings suggest that while RT variability reflects some aspects of subjective experience, subjective and objective approaches may diverge in how they capture performance dynamics and internal states such as arousal.",

          "abstract": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a known risk factor for dementia and earlier mortality, but its association with psychological health is less well-characterized. We tested for associations between TBI and depression, each ascertained multiple ways, and in opposing directions (depression predicting TBI; TBI predicting depression). \n\nMethods: Using UK Biobank data (N=502,356) we investigated bi-directional associations between TBI (ICD-10 coded broad- or narrow-band TBI) and depression (self-report and/or incident ICD-10 coded). We tested this in each direction: baseline historic TBI predicting the incidence of subsequent depression and, separately, baseline depression predicting the incidence of a first subsequent TBI. All analyses were adjusted for age at UK Biobank baseline assessment, sex, educational attainment, deprivation, smoking history, alcohol intake, physical and neurological health conditions.\n\nResults:  In participants with history of TBI (versus not), there was increased risk of subsequent incident depression, compared with participants with no documented TBI history (e.g. narrow-band TBI fully-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18 risk of depression; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.87 to 2.55; P&lt;0.001). In the other direction there was evidence that people with history of lifetime depression had significantly increased risk of subsequent incident TBI (e.g. HR = 1.76 of narrow-band TBI, 95% CI = 1.61 to 1.94, P&lt;0.001). \n\nConclusion: We show significant associations between TBI and depression: depression was a risk factor for subsequent TBI in previously unaffected participants, but also vice-versa. Psychological support should be considered post-TBI, however clinical management should consider premorbid psychological health as a possible contributing factor.",

We asked autistic people and those who support them about pathways to suicide prevention, the balance of crisis measures vs. longer-term prevention, the importance of formal diagnosis, and the role of co-production.\nWe used an online survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Participants were 2463 autistic people and 315 non-autistic people who supported or had been bereaved by the suicide of an autistic person. We thematically analysed their free-text responses. \nAlthough participants reported that crisis interventions (e.g., dedicated helplines) were helpful, they preferred larger-scale preventative measures (e.g., improving support in schools) which better addressed systemic inequalities. Participants were positive about providing support to people awaiting autism assessment, but some were less supportive of providing dedicated autism supports to people who self-diagnose or who are not currently diagnosed (but may be questioning autism). Most participants viewed co-production as vital for ensuring interventions reflect the expertise and empathy of autistic people.\nSuicide in autistic people must be viewed in the context of pervasive and systemic injustices, rather than individualistic psychopathology. Accordingly, the extent to which crisis interventions can reduce suicide rates is contingent on additional systemic, preventative and coordinated actions to tackle the social determinants of suicide and support enduring wellbeing in this group. Support should be produced in partnership with autistic people and their advocates, and needs- rather than diagnosis-based.",

          "abstract": "Impersonal prosociality is considered a cornerstone of a thriving civic society, well-functioning institutions, and a growing economy. Previous research has documented substantial cross-societal variation in prosociality using tasks such as dictator games, where individuals allocate money between themselves and others. In such tasks, individuals typically receive full information about how decisions impact others and make decisions privately. Here, we propose that different societies rely on distinct mechanisms—guilt and internalized norms versus shame and external pressures—to support prosociality. We conducted a pre-registered experiment with 7,978 participants in 20 culturally diverse countries across five continents. We administered dictator games and experimentally manipulated guilt, by varying information about the consequences of participants’ decisions (full versus hidden), and shame, by varying observability (public versus private). Additionally, we measured the Importance of Guilt over Shame (IGS) at the individual and country level.  We found robust evidence for guilt-driven prosociality around the world, such that prosociality increased substantially when individuals received information by default compared to when they could avoid it. Further, providing information led to a stronger increase in prosociality among individuals, though not countries, scoring higher on IGS. In contrast, making decisions observable by third parties had only small effects on prosocial choices. Our study provides a first comprehensive investigation of how guilt and shame influence prosocial decision-making, and uncovers both similarities and differences in mechanisms to promote prosociality across countries.",

          "abstract": "The high rate of Urbanization and loss of bird habitat at the global level is increasing day by day and now due to this activity challenging ecosystem will create problems in the future because more people prefer to live in the cities. The main objective of the study was to know the current status of urban bird diversity, their habitat, and their conservation plan. Point count and Line transect methods were used for the bird survey. The various bird species with population were sighted through binocular and species identification was done by using different identification keys. Photograph of birds was taken by the Nikon DSLR camera and the GPS locations of each study site were recorded in the datasheet. The total numbers of 104 bird species were recorded from all study sites belonging to 16 orders and 48 families. In recent times some species migrated from urban to semi-urban areas because they have not existed in narrow habitats. However, some scavenger birds are seen at dead animal dumping sites. Family Columbidae was found dominant with 6% contribution followed by families like Muscicapidae, Sturnidae, Motacillidae, Scolopacidae, and Anatidae with 5% contribution each and further followed by other families with less than 5% contribution. These present results indicate that Rock dove is highly habituated in the urban ecosystem while House sparrow, Golden oriole, Grey hornbill, and Egyptian vulture are sensitive species. So they are seen as local migratory species. A conservation plan is needed to develop green belts at street level and with the maintenance of the old garden; new parks should be established in urban areas. The artificial nest (wooden nest), food (mixed grains), and water properly take place in parks. Birds are also important for the maintenance of the ecosystem because they act as an effective tool for biological pest control.",

          "abstract": "The objective of the study was to provide insights on disruptions faced by farmers due to COVID-19 for harvest of rabi (winter) crop and preparations for kharif (summer) crop and to suggest appropriate policy measures to enable farmers to cope with similar disruptions in agricultural activities. Data were collected from 125 farmers from five tribal hamlets of Deverkonda mandal of Nalgonda district of Telangana state. The major constraints reported by almost all the farmers (99.2%) were financial problems primarily due to loss of wage work, repayment of informal loans (83%), fear of contracting COVID-19 (92%) and health of family members (89%) which adversely affected their work efficiency. Paddy crop was the most affected as rated by 80.8% of the farmers, followed by vegetables 52.8%, groundnut 41.6%, cotton 37.6%, redgram 16.8% and fruit crops(sweet lime) 13.6% respectively. The farmers faced problems in land preparation (92.8%), high cost of inputs (96.8%), and low availability of inputs (75.2%), transport problems to procure inputs (96.8%), labour shortage (67.2%) and storage of unsold produce (75.2%). Shortage of animal feed (79.2%) and health care of animals (85.6%) were the constraints faced in livestock care. The harvesting of paddy was the most affected due to shortage of labour and harvesting machines. Community seed and animal feed banks, collectives like farmer producer organizations, collateral free credit, small packaging of inputs, promotion of youth entrepreneurship in processing storage and sale of produce and mechanization of small farms, direct procurement, logistic support are some of the immediate and mid- term measures being suggested for building resilience of food systems to face future risks.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the usage and benefits of business intelligence in personal care industry of the Middle East. Business intelligence is driving the placement of brands to be a part of consumer’s consideration set. Generally Saudi Arabia and UAE are considered the leading Gulf Corporate Countries (GCC) in skincare and cosmetic consumptions due to several factors including population, climatic, urbanization, tourism and high-volume of resided expatriates. The authors have focused on the integration of business intelligence in communication, influencers-marketing, trending ingredients and market adaptation. The critical review is being followed by quantitative data to support the findings. The research was conducted on 150 sample-size in five different countries (Oman, Bahrain, U.A.E., Saudi Arabia and Qatar) within five-month span. The online questionnaire utilized the random convenience sampling technique to obtain first-hand analysis as well as ordinal and nominal scale with additional open-ended questions. The questionnaire results highlighted Middle Eastern consumers’ motives when selecting skin/personal care products according its social-media popularity, trend, and real-time results. The survey analysis has provided a valuable insight to cosmetic brands in terms of consumers’ habits, choice, and demographics to invest and explore new market segments intelligently. The findings empathized the trends that the leading cosmetic brands should follow for updating the ingredients and enhance product transparency to achieve client loyalty. Moreover, being gender-natural is one of the key-factors in adapting today’s cosmetic global market. The present findings have supported the prior, however limited research that the heuristics side of any decision taken based on datamining cannot be guaranteed unless the potential segment can relate to the same. The pioneer brands in the personal care industry proposed the revamping of competitive advantage based on business intelligence on a regular basis. The present study is a novel attempt in the proposed area as no literature is available for the personal care industry in the Middle East region in terms of an empirical research. Finally, the recommendations have been divided into various subsections including Diversification and inclusiveness, Product Strategy, Prioritize transparency, Product Sustainability and E-Commerce and Technology.",

          "authors": "Managerial Focus",
          "abstract": "First-ever a straightforward semi-empirical method is employed to compute elastic parameters (elastic wave velocities, elastic moduli, Debye temperature), thermodynamic parameters (molar heat capacities at constant volume and pressure, Debye temperature, electronic contribution to molar heat capacity, lattice potential energy), and optical parameters (refractive index, optical energy bandgap, dielectric, electronic and ionic polarizabilities) for pyrochlore-type yttrium-titanate (Y2Ti2O7) at 300 K. The results of our calculations are compared with the existing experimentally and theoretically determined data. The quite satisfactory agreement between the two validates the approach adopted. The value of molar heat capacity at constant volume computed based on the Einstein theory for pyrochlore is accordant with theoretically predicted value from the law of Dulong and Petit while the Debye theory fails to estimate the consistent value at 300 K. It appeared that electronic molar heat capacity contributes ~ 0.5 % to the total molar heat capacity and the electronic and lattice molar heat capacities are comparable at 14.5 K. The applicability of the oxide additivity rule is examined and found successful in predicting the dielectric, electronic, ionic polarizabilities and lattice potential energy of the complex oxide composition. The semi-empirical method used in the present investigation is found quite simple as compared to previous cumbersome evaluation methods.",

          "abstract": "Personality interventions are a field of growing interest, as many people want to change aspects of their personality and personality trait changes promise to positively impact important life outcomes. Although initial research shows that personality interventions can be successful in eliciting lasting trait changes, the strategies, timing, and context of effective personality interventions remain unclear. A careful examination of how these characteristics would advance intervention effectiveness and theoretical models of volitional personality change. We used intensive longitudinal data from the Changing How I Live Life (CHILL) Study to examine the effects of different intervention strategies and their timing and situational context on intervention adherence, satisfaction, and changes in momentary positive affect as proximal intervention outcomes. The CHILL Study is a multi-method intervention study combining experience sampling methods and mobile sensing to investigate the effects of a smartphone intervention to decrease neuroticism (N = 399; 39,878 assessments). Intervention strategies that targeted the state level of neuroticism had more positive effects on people’s momentary affect than habit-level strategies, providing novel insights into the mechanisms of successful personality change. Furthermore, effects differed depending on the timing and situational context of intervention prompts, pointing to possibilities of optimizing the timing of personality interventions. For example, people were more likely to adhere to intervention prompts in quieter environments or at home. Together, these findings inform theoretical models of personality trait change and can be used to guide the development of effective and refined personality interventions.",

          "abstract": "The preliminary survey was carryout to assess the farmers understanding about the   generic pesticide (single active ingredient with different trade name). Total of 45 farmers participated in this study through interviews. Three commonly used pesticides by smallholder in the locality with different active ingredients were presented to the farmers to evaluate their understanding about the similarity and importance of generic pesticide. Open ended questioner was used. Those commonly used pesticides presented to the farmers are 1. Dimethoate (Agro-Thoate 40%EC, Ethiothoate 40%EC, Dimethoate 40 % EC, Dimeto40%EC and Roger) 2. Lambda-cyhalothrin (Karate 2.5% EC, Lamdex 5% EC, Helerat 50EC, Lamdex 5% EC, Farate 3. Profenofose (Ajanta, Profit 720EC, Polytrin315EC, and Selecron 720% EC). In this study from 45 farmers who asked about the generic pesticide, the similarity of Lamdex 5% EC, and Farate, 43 out of 45 farmers did considered these insecticides as different and they used this insecticide for different pest control. Similarly over 96% of the farmers did not understand the similarity  among Ajanta, Profit 720EC, Polytrin315EC, and Selecron 720%EC , and 91% did not understand the similarity  among  Agro-Thoate  40%EC, Ethiothoate 40%EC. This misunderstanding of farmers about similar pesticide with different trade name contributes for ineffective pest control, farmers used single active ingredient (with different trade name) for different pest control due to miss understanding. Hence, the government and non government other concerned body should create enough awareness regarding to similarity of for smallholder farmers. Pesticide manufacturers, should also be responsible for pest for this action.",

This study was carried out to ascertain the possibility of remediating diesel oil polluted soils using palm bunch ash. Samples of garden soil with no history of diesel oil pollution were spiked with 100mL of Bonny Light diesel oil and left for two weeks to simulate a condition of major spill before adding different weights of palm bunch ash (0, P+NOPBA, 50g, 150g, 250g and 350g). 1g from each treatment was collected monthly and subjected to laboratory analysis using standard analytical methods for soil selected heavy metals contents using AAS. Preliminary results revealed alteration of chemical properties of soils, elevated heavy metals levels two weeks after spiking indicating that the soil sample had undergone slight alteration. There was a dose dependent decrease in heavy metal content of the diesel oil polluted soils with time. Mean concentration of Zinc ranged from 95.7mg/kg to 7.45mg/kg; 9590.5 to 99.83 in Fe; 3.5mg/kg 1.4mg/kg Cu; 1.45mg/kg to 0.06mg/kg Cd and 10.90mg/kg to 0.05mg/kg in Pb. Overall, net reduction in heavy metals was very low in soil left under natural attenuation (polluted untreated soil) than treated soils. This study has revealed a marked degradation of the heavy metal content of soil which indicated that palm bunch ash could be used for remediation of diesel oil polluted soil. It is recommended that palm bunch ash be replaced with conventional fertilizer in restoration of crude contaminated soil.",

          "authors": "Vision",
          "abstract": "The oil and gas industry is one of the core sectors of the national economy, playing a fundamental role in ensuring energy security. The Covid-19 situation, which has driven companies to innovate, may serve as a catalyst for rethinking the size and role of functional teams, field workers, and management processes required to run an efficient oil and gas company. The slump in global oil consumption due to the pandemic has caused a shock to the Russian economy. To gain comprehensive insights on the performance of the oil and gas industry in Russia, this study aims to develop an integrated methodology that combines the Grey prediction method, a so-called GM (1,1) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Malmquist model for the prediction and evaluation of the top 10 potential companies in Russia. Grey theory is adopted to predict the companies’ data during 2020–2023, and the Malmquist method is used to evaluate their performance over the whole period of 2016–2023, based on three input factors (total assets, total liabilities, cost of revenue), and two output factors (total revenue and net income). During the research period, “Russneft” was found to have performed the most efficiently while “Slavneft” held the least-effective company, despite its efforts to achieve progressive technological changes. Overall, all companies have achieved excellent technological efficiency. Thus, the average total factor productivity indexes of all companies mainly rely on their technical performance. This study assists policymakers and decision-makers in expediting their recovery plans for further sustainable development in the oil and gas industry.",

          "abstract": "Ideals play important roles in human life and psychology. Over the past decade, several mindfulness-based interventions have directly cultivated ideal mentalities that have not yet been achieved at the level of humanity, leading to the establishment of ideal psychology. Beyond research on ideal mentalities, ideal psychology has evolved into a general psychological approach characterized by future-oriented perspectives and associated methodologies. This article provides the first detailed introduction of this emerging approach. It summarizes six defining features of ideal mentalities, presents the design–achievement–evaluation cycle for research on them, and outlines seven methodological principles for enhancing studies on both ideal and existing mentalities with similar features. It further illustrates three aspects of future-oriented perspectives that shape research, through which it clarifies how ideal psychology relates to previous schools of psychology such as critical psychology, positive psychology, and transpersonal psychology, as well as to other traditions including Eastern spiritual traditions, Marxism and the critical tradition, transhumanism, and Plato’s philosophy. The article also exemplifies recent applications of ideal psychology in cultivating ideal mentalities such as mentalities of emptiness, Confucian oneness, and the nondifferential four immeasurables, as well as in advancing research on existing mentalities such as mindfulness, mortality salience, and beliefs about human nature. Finally, it discusses the major contributions, limitations, and future directions of ideal psychology.",

          "abstract": "Story reading is often accompanied by mental visualization of the scenes and the events described. Individuals with aphantasia, who report not experiencing vivid visual imagery, have recently been reported to be less absorbed and engaged when reading stories. In the present study, we explored how aphantasics read imagery-rich stories differently from control subjects by analyzing their gaze fixation patterns. We found that in both groups, gaze fixation was similarly influenced by different types of story content. Notably, under perceptual imagery, which involves sensory-rich contents, the influence was the strongest, resulting in longer fixation durations during relevant keywords in both groups. Despite the same fixation patterns, aphantasics reported less experienced immersion in the stories, consistent with a previous study. Furthermore, we observed that in control subjects, longer fixation duration on perceptual imagery contents was correlated with higher experienced mental imagery, whereas in aphantasic individuals, this relationship was absent and even reversed. Our findings may align with the account that imagery under aphantasia may be nonconscious rather than nonexistent, leading to the lack of introspective access to mental images, as the fixation patterns indicative of reading behavior were similar, while only reported subjective experiences differed under aphantasia.",

The annotations encompass various aspects, including gesture types (e.g., metaphoric, iconic), descriptive terms characterizing each gesture (e.g., 'sweep', 'container'), and their corresponding verbal utterances. The dataset also includes detailed physical properties such as hand height, distance to the body, arm angle, hand configuration, palm orientation, repetitions, size, and speed, alongside 3D pose tracking data. Where possible, video recordings provide additional multimodal context. Notably, we identified several previously undocumented lexemes, expanding the current lexicon of gesture research. This dataset offers a valuable resource for studying human communication, training models for gesture recognition and generation, and designing socially intelligent virtual agents.",

          "abstract": "European and contemporary writers, like, Eliot, have critically examined the dissimilar customs and religions especially those of East, Indian, Buddhist religons particularly Zoroastrianism in their literary works. Eliot gently suggests that there is a reasonable association between religion, culture in the controversial writings. For Eliot; our way of life and religion secure the convictions that regularly force on us, and our revelatory judgment and public analysis of our social guidance are personally identified with individuals. Eliot gave fastidious consideration to Eastern people's promotions and religions and examined the ceremonies. During a considerable study of his amazing sonnets, he supposedly examines Eastern religions, including Zoroastrianism, and fire-revere, Indian, Buddhist religions and contentious issues about human life and fate. Therefore, this study tries to investigate Eliot’s poems in the light of Eastern mythology, Zoroastrianism, the symbol of fire in East. Iran and Iranian civilization have a long history, in this regard, Iranian culture and civilization have always been the focus of writers and philosophers around the world. Eliot has paid special attention to Eastern civilizations and religions and he has studied many rituals of past. In some of his poems, he has dealt with Eastern religions, including Zoroastrianism and fire festivals. In the \"Hollow Men\" he has paid special attention to the Eastern religions, Zoroastrian beliefs, rituals and rituals of the past. Since no research has been done on this subject, the purpose of this article is to examine the myth of fire and Zoroastrian beliefs in some of Eliot's poems such as, “Waste Land”, “Four Quarts”, “Ash Wednesday”, “Hollow Man”.",

          "abstract": "Beekeeping in Himachal Pradesh plays very important role not only in fruit pollination but also in honey production. The farmers here are facing many problems in bee rearing during recent years.This survey was conducted to assess the problems of beekeepers and orchardists in Himachal Himalaya. It was observed thatbeekeeping is important for securing food, poverty reduction, health, environmental protection, honey production and plant pollination. The farmers here practiced beekeeping as a part time or whole time job and were engaged in this venture for the last many years. Commercial beekeepers stressed on the role of honeybees as honey producers than pollinators of horticultural crops. Most of the farmers also earned extra income from honey and other bee products besides using them for pollination purposes. The farmers had knowledge regarding different aspects of honey production, processing and marketing i.e. constituents of honey, nutritional value, different type of honey containers used for honey storage, honey processing, marketing problems etc. But only some farmers were acquainted with different pests, predators and diseases of honeybees and their remedial measures.\n\nMost of the farmers wanted to have financial support for different horticultural practices and training purposes. They preferred to be trained in orchard management technology and beekeeping practices. There were different types of constraints faced by beekeepers regarding the beekeeping practices which included non availability of bee flora throughout the year, heavy snowfall, shortage of labour, habit of absconding of bees and poor knowledge about medicines. Apiculture requires organizing honey marketing channels and raising awareness on limiting the use of pesticides in agriculture to protect the bees and the environment as well. The renovations and application of improved beekeeping technologies not only benefits beekeepers but also farmers and the general public in pollinating their crops, maintaining plant biodiversity, and the ecology at large.",

This thesis reframes speech as a toolchain—Intention →\nCompilation → Actuation → Feedback—and proposes Return on Expression (RoE), the\nrealized state change per unit cost, as the organizing objective. We present (i) a\nformal state-space/control model of utterances as interventions on beliefs, goals, and\ncommitments; (ii) an empirically calibrated affordance map that translates context\nvariables (uncertainty, risk, expertise asymmetry, channel constraints) into design\nchoices (framing, redundancy, prosody); (iii) a failure taxonomy with detectable\nsignals and mitigation protocols; and (iv) a Speech IDE that instruments conversation\nwith an LLM-in-the-loop intention compiler, ambiguity linters, a commitment type\nchecker, and a grounding meter. We define standardized micro‑protocols (e.g., Query\n→ Calibrate → Commit; Goal → Constraint → Offer → Check) and preregistered\nexperiments across lab and field settings to estimate treatment effects on RoE,\ncommitment conversion, grounding depth, and rework. Bayesian hierarchical models\nsupport estimation and transportability across domains. Ethics features\n(consent‑to‑influence, bias audits, kill‑switches) reduce misuse. If validated in\npreregistered A/B tests (≥20% CCR lift and ≥25% ambiguity‑error reduction), this\nframework provides a measurable, reproducible way to teach speech as a\ncraft—raising coordination reliability in education, healthcare, and operations while\nestablishing RoE as a first‑class design objective.",

Con base en evidencia epidemiológica mexicana, se estima que entre 2–5% de la población adulta podría encajar en este fenotipo, aunque gran parte permanece infradiagnosticada y se autogestiona con conductas compensatorias de alto riesgo (consumo de azúcares, alcohol, nicotina).\n\nSe discuten los factores aceleradores (variabilidad glucémica, insomnio, sedentarismo, dieta proinflamatoria) y moduladores protectores (actividad física estructurada, dieta antiinflamatoria, higiene del sueño, reducción de azúcares), así como la urgencia de protocolos integrativos que permitan diferenciar esta condición de otros cuadros psiquiátricos tradicionales.\n\nEl presente análisis busca aportar al reconocimiento clínico y científico de un síndrome que, de no ser visibilizado, condena a miles de pacientes a diagnósticos erróneos, tratamientos ineficaces y al deterioro progresivo de su salud física, mental y social.",

          "abstract": "Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.",

The theory assumes that individuals’\nresponses to reality are not directly derived from events themselves, but from the\nsubjective structural construction of perspectives, which influences the understanding\nand assignment of meanings to events. This paper presents a three-dimensional\nstructural model of subjective perspectives, including cognitive stance, psychological\npositioning, and interpretive path, explaining how they interact and affect individuals' emotional and behavioral reactions.

          "abstract": "Vertical scales are intended to establish a common metric for scores on test forms targeting different levels of development in a specified domain. They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may affect grade-to-grade score distributions. Monte Carlo simulation and synthetic data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce meaningfully different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

          "abstract": "It has long been proposed that the brain integrates pitch and timing cues during auditory perception. If true, the pitch of a sound should influence its perceived timing, and its timing should influence its perceived pitch. Previous research has found that higher-pitched sounds tend to be perceived as faster than lower-pitched sounds, and in the present study we investigated whether sounds that arrive earlier or later than expected are similarly perceived as higher or lower in pitch. In Experiment 1, participants heard isochronous, repeating standard tones followed by a pitch-shifted probe, and indicated if the pitch increased or decreased. We observed a strong biasing effect of the probe’s timing on its perceived pitch, such that later probes were more likely to be perceived as lower than the standard. Correct, bias-conforming responses to mistimed probes were also significantly faster than responses to on-beat probes. In Experiment 2, we used an adaptive difficulty procedure to investigate whether this timing-induced bias strengthens under conditions of low discriminability. We did not find evidence that bias varies with the magnitude of pitch change or with individual differences in pitch sensitivity. In conjunction with past findings of pitch-induced illusory timing changes, our results support the hypothesis that pitch and time are perceptually integrated. We discuss this integration within a Bayesian predictive coding framework, as possibly learned from real-world correlations between pitch and timing that derive from latent properties of sound sources.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show difficulties determining whether environmental cues, particularly in social contexts, are meant for them, which relates to symptoms and determinants of social functioning. Recent computational modeling findings have emphasized disruptions in evidence accumulation, which index how visual information is extracted from social cues, as a potential driver. Yet, it is unclear whether these disruptions reflect more general difficulties with social/face processing or are specific to self-referential gaze perception, and how they map onto clinical features. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to clarify cognitive processes driving self-referential gaze perception and non-self-referential gender perception in 39 SZ and 42 controls. DDMs captured key cognitive processes, including sensitivity of evidence accumulation to gaze and gender cues, perceptual biases, and expectation biases. We clarified whether disruptions to these processes in SZ were unique to self-referential judgments or general to face processing, and to what extent they related to paranoia and social cognition. Relative to controls, SZ exhibited perceptual biases specific to self-referential decisions, predisposing the over perception of eye contact, and broad reductions in evidence accumulation sensitivity to social cues during both self-referential and non-self-referential decisions. Broad insensitivities to gaze and gender cues, not perceptual biases, were associated with more severe paranoia in SZ. This suggests that aberrant self-reference in SZ is shaped by disruptions in the process of accumulating evidence during general social and self-referential information processing. More general disruptions in evidence accumulation, across different kinds of social decisions, may help bridge perceptual dysfunctions and symptoms, such as paranoia, in SZ.",

Underlying this complexity, we argue, are key elements of human social psychology regarding social comparison and the resolution of coordination and collective action problems. The Multi-Capital Leadership (MCL) theory posits that leader emergence and effectiveness depend on perceptions of individuals’ abilities to provide benefits or impose costs in solving challenges of group living, through the deployment of different forms of capital: material, social, somatic (e.g., physical formidability, height, immune functionality), and neural (e.g., knowledge, intelligence, personality, supernatural abilities). We integrate this framework with a review of leadership across human societies, including in non-state and non-industrial contexts, and with novel comparative analyses of ethnographic data. This synthesis highlights how context-specific demands for coordination and collective action, and the accuracy of social comparison, shape the structure and dynamics of leadership and followership across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Multisensory integration (MSI)–the brain’s ability to combine information from different senses–is ‎crucial for coherent perception and adaptive behavior. While often viewed as a bottom-up process, ‎emerging research shows internal states like emotional arousal can modulate MSI. The role of ‎metacognition–our awareness of perceptual accuracy–remains underexplored in this context, particularly ‎in relation to multisensory illusions such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). This study ‎examined how facially induced emotional arousal affects audiovisual integration and metacognitive ‎efficiency during the SIFI task. It also assessed whether individual differences in sensory-processing ‎sensitivity (via the Highly Sensitive Person [HSP] scale) influence these effects. Fifty-five participants ‎completed an online SIFI task, where neutral or disgusted facial cues preceded audiovisual stimuli across ‎six stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Participants reported the number of flashes and rated their ‎confidence. Accuracy and confidence improved at longer SOAs. However, while confidence was ‎unaffected by the pre/post condition, accuracy was significantly influenced, indicating a dissociation ‎between performance and subjective certainty. Emotional cues did not affect accuracy or confidence, but ‎higher HSP scores were linked to lower metacognitive efficiency, especially in negative emotional ‎contexts (β = –0.16, p = .04), though the interaction was not statistically significant. Bayesian analysis ‎suggested a 75% chance of a negative interaction, but with uncertainty. These findings highlight that ‎while arousal doesn’t impair MSI, high sensory sensitivity may reduce introspective accuracy in ‎emotional contexts, with implications for decision-making and responsive technology design.‎",

Drawing from Cialdini’s principles and Kahneman’s cognitive heuristics, the BCS integrates subtle design cues into a one-page agreement form that frames payment timelines, offers structured choices, embeds self-commitment language, and introduces incentive-based reciprocity. The design process involved iterative revisions and expert input from educational psychologists and school administrators.  Implementation in school settings involves distribution during registration, parent selection of preferred payment plans, and school-side tracking. Anticipated outcomes include improved payment compliance, reduced administrative burden, and increased parent-school collaboration. A pilot study is planned to evaluate the form’s effectiveness, refine its structure, and inform broader scale-up.

Here we present the outcome of a 10-year program that started with creating a novel test, the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive substrates (APACS), and evolved in using it – along with ToM assessment – in seven clinical groups (i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, right-hemisphere stroke, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, and dyslexia). The multistudy cross-diagnostic analysis of 454 participants revealed that receptive pragmatic skills were impaired in all clinical groups compared to controls, with schizophrenia showing the most severely impaired profile, whereas expressive pragmatic skills were impaired in four neurological conditions (i.e., Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, right-hemisphere stroke, and traumatic brain injury). The association with ToM was limited to receptive pragmatics and moderate in the whole sample. Overall, pragmatic impairment emerged as a diffuse feature of neurological and psychiatric illnesses, which contributes to defining complex socio-communicative phenotypes but cannot be equated to a social cognition deficit and should hence be the target of specific assessment and intervention.",

          "abstract": "We present the overview of a decade-long research program bridging experimental pragmatics and developmental psychology and targeting the relationship between individual differences in metaphor skills and Theory of Mind (ToM). We developed the Physical and Mental Metaphors task and used it alongside the Strange Stories task in a series of studies involving neurotypical children throughout middle childhood. A meta-analysis conducted on our work, including 500 children aged 8-12, showed that metaphor and ToM are significantly associated, even when controlling for vocabulary. This association peaks around the age of 9 and fades away with increasing age. Our longitudinal and training studies evidenced that it is especially metaphor that benefits ToM, rather than vice versa. The results of our research program confirm the inherent mindreading component of pragmatic operations as postulated by post-Gricean pragmatics, also highlighting that ToM involvement in metaphor varies dynamically depending on age and possibly other factors such as the type of metaphor. We argue that pragmatics should not be seen as ancillary to ToM but rather a driving factor for socio-cognitive development and that integrating insights from developmental psychology in studying metaphors and pragmatics, such as the attention to individual differences, brings new opportunities for research.",

A simulation study revealed that ignoring multilevel structures causes biased parameter estimates and serious under-coverages of posterior credible intervals. A real data example provided attribute mastery transitions from the four-year longitudinal data of mathematics tests in the third to sixth grades of Japanese elementary schools.

          "abstract": "The widely replicated finding that the perceived speed of time passage over the past decade increases with chronological age was the focus of this study. We investigated potential mechanisms underlying this effect, examining the role of autobiographical memory and cognitive functioning. 120 individuals aged 20-91 were assessed on subjective time perception for the preceding decade and year, the quantity and significance of autobiographical memories from those periods, and overall cognitive status. Results confirmed the specific age-related increase in perceived temporal acceleration over the past decade. However, no significant association was found between perceived time passage over the past decade and either the number or subjective value of memories. Contrary to assumptions, older adults reported more vivid and meaningful recollections. Instead, reduced cognitive functioning, and specifically lower ability to form new memories as assessed through delayed memory recall, emerged as a significant mediator of accelerated time perception with age. Findings suggest that age-related cognitive decline leading to reduced ability to encode novel memories, rather than diminished autobiographical memory content, is a critical factor in the subjective experience of time compression in older adults.",

          "authors": "Jordan L Harris; Isaac T. Petersen",
          "abstract": "Background\nChildren’s emotional and behavioral problems frequently co-occur, suggesting the existence of a general factor of psychopathology (\"p factor\") that accounts for the shared variance across internalizing and externalizing problems. Ongoing questions remain regarding the extent to which negative affectivity—a temperamental tendency to display observable manifestations likely reflecting negative emotions—and general psychopathology represent overlapping versus distinct constructs across early development. \n\nMethods\nA community-based sample of 231 children aged 3 to 7 years participated in an accelerated longitudinal study, with assessments at four time points spaced nine months apart. Data were collected via multi-informant (mother, father, teacher/secondary caregiver) ratings, structured observational tasks, and standard questionnaires. This study evaluated the convergent and discriminant validity of negative affectivity and general psychopathology measures across informants and methods using multitrait-multimethod matrices while accounting for measurement error and variance related to the informant type.\n\nResults\nFindings indicated that measures of negative affectivity and general psychopathology exhibited moderate convergent validity but also retained distinctiveness, supporting the discriminant validity in measures of these constructs. The association between the two was somewhat attenuated when controlling for informant type.\n\nConclusions\nThe results clarify that, although negative affectivity and general psychopathology are closely related in childhood, they are not redundant constructs. Additionally, the observed deflation in the association between negative affectivity and general psychopathology after accounting for informant type-related bias highlights how measurement strategies—including informant source and method variance—can meaningfully alter interpretations of the associations between psychopathology and risk/protective factors. Together, these results emphasize the importance of both conceptual and methodological precision when studying the early indicators of psychopathology and suggest critical targets for early identification and intervention to promote mental health across development.",

The contributions are: (1) recasting the seven indicators—operationality, recursion, leap-evocation, multi-actor/AI multiplicity, irreversibility, translation preservation, and measurability—into design requirements; (2) codifying the design workflow (FQ → structural pressure → timed induction of leaps → SQ consolidation → roles → operating environment → logging/recursion); (3) a failure-mode quick reference and safety kit (signals → immediate responses → prevention for control-deviation, rigidity, FQ depletion, and loss of function through translation); (4) a structure-to-OS mapping procedure with a specification sheet and quality gates; and (5) minimal trial protocols (60–90 minutes) for education, organizations, and local governance, including KPI application. Evaluation relies on external KPIs, with subjective intensity (qualia) used only as an auxiliary measure. Success is determined by operational effectiveness and the stabilization of the revision cadence. Figures are kept to a minimum; instead, reproducibility is supported through explicit log schemas, revision tickets, and stop/restart thresholds.

          "abstract": "The cognitive architecture of decision-making in bilinguals manifests differentially in the first and second languages, a phenomenon previously linked to attenuated emotional resonance in non-native language contexts. This investigation establishes the neurophysiological chronometry underlying language-modulated decision processes in Chinese–English bilinguals during a strategic economic game. Participants engaged in a coin-drawing paradigm requiring either veridical reporting when drawing a coin (mandatory betting) or presenting a strategic choice when drawing a blank (free choice between betting / lying and truth-telling). All participants exhibited the expected increase in betting frequency following coin draws, but only monolingual controls manifested shorter response latencies in this condition. While language context failed to induce measurable behavioral alterations in bilinguals, data-driven linear mixed-effects modeling of single-trial electroencephalographic data uncovered a temporal cascade wherein language context effects preceded draw outcome processing, with subsequent language-draw interactions emerging 450-600 ms post-stimulus. This time course indicates that draw outcome integration occurs approximately 150 ms later in the second than the first language in bilinguals. Crucially, when participants were free to bet or not, neural signatures discriminating between betting and non-betting decisions revealed an interaction with language context, with decision-related activity manifesting earlier in the second language and suggesting accelerated risk evaluation. Collectively, these findings reveal a language-dependent temporal dissociation in bilingual decision processing: delayed information integration yet expedited risk assessment in the second language. This neurophysiological evidence illuminates the complex interplay between linguistic and executive function in multilingual individuals, with implications for understanding situational awareness and decision-making efficacy.",

The proposed model outperforms both a purely rule-based Bayesian hypothesis search and a resource-rational random sampling approach.

The focus of evaluation moves from individual understanding to the collective behavior of the “field” (subject migration). The paper provides, at the outset, a terminology usage guide, a comparative table between the Third and Fourth Revolutions, a subject migration map, an OS design stack, and a KPI list, all as reusable standards for subsequent applications across domains. It defines KPI specifications, measurement protocols, and recording formats, and identifies typical mixed-phase phenomena observed during the transition, offering corrective measures. Furthermore, through domain-specific status maps and operational design templates, it proposes small-scale pilot implementations in education, organizations, and local governments, along with a 3–5–10 year roadmap, thereby presenting a shared navigation route for the societal implementation of the Fourth Revolution’s operational structures.",

Drawing on 80 real student questions, this paper aims to assess response consistency and identify risk markers, such as randomness and hallucination. The goal of this study is to inform future research, guide human–AI (artificial intelligence) collaboration and support policy development on deploying large language model chatbots for accessible mental health interventions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper prompted ChatGPT-4 with 80 authentic college student counseling questions and collected three nondeterministic replies per query. Automated analysis used three natural language processing (NLP) models – EmoRoBERTa for emotion detection, a neural network for empathy classification and VADER for sentiment analysis – to quantify warmth, empathy and acceptance. Stability was evaluated via Fleiss’ κ for empathy labels and ICC(2,1) for continuous sentiment scores. Additional Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests examined categorical shifts and mean-score drift, and Pearson correlation assessed the relation between question and response length.\n\nFindings\nChatGPT-4 achieved 97.5% warm responses, 94.2% empathy classification and a mean compound sentiment score of 0.93 ± 0.19. Stability metrics indicated moderate reliability (κ = 0.59; ICC = 0.62), while occasional confusing or realization labels (2.5% of outputs) and minor sentiment drift underscored randomness as a risk. A positive correlation (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) revealed longer queries elicit longer replies. These results highlight both the promise and the limits of LLM chatbots in school-counseling simulations.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs an offline simulation using a single GPT-4 model and automated proxies rather than clinician ratings or clinical outcomes, findings remain exploratory. The de-identified public data set may not capture live user dynamics. Future work should involve multi-model comparisons, mixed-methods validation with human raters and end-users, live pilot deployments and clinical trials to assess safety, usability and therapeutic impact in real-world educational settings.\n\nPractical implications\nHigh warmth and empathy rates suggest ChatGPT-4 could augment low-intensity support – drafting psycho-educational messages or after-hours coping tips under human oversight. Stability metrics can inform prompt-engineering benchmarks and guardrail triggers. Schools and self-help apps may pilot AI-assisted chat interfaces with escalation protocols, bias and privacy audits and human-in-the-loop triage to optimize counselor workflows, extend reach and mitigate risks through transparent policy and workflow design.\n\nSocial implications\nDeployment of LLM chatbots can democratize mental health resources for youth, lowering barriers of cost, stigma and provider shortages. However, risks of misinformation, bias and overreliance necessitate digital-literacy education, equitable governance and community engagement frameworks. Policymakers and practitioners must balance innovation with safeguards – such as mandatory audit trails and accountability measures – to ensure vulnerable populations benefit safely from AI-mediated counseling.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper is among the first to apply quantitative stability metrics (κ, ICC) and NLP-based emotion analysis to ChatGPT-4 in a school-counseling simulation, enriched by a practitioner’s deployment insights. It integrates parasocial-interaction and computational social-science theories to link technical capabilities with design patterns, policy recommendations and a roadmap for future mixed-methods research on AI in mental-health interventions.",

          "abstract": "All causal responses in the universe are constrained by a strictly positive minimum response time, τ₀. While this principle unifies the “form” of dynamic behaviors across physical, biological, and cognitive systems, we demonstrate here that it also governs their “substance”—the very condition for existence. We introduce the τ₀ stability criterion: a system can persist only if its intrinsic minimum response time is much shorter than its characteristic lifetime. This criterion explains why protons are stable, why DNA can store information over generations, and why conscious processes endure within neural dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a possible link between τ₀ and the Higgs field, suggesting that mass may arise as the inverse of fundamental response delay. Our framework thus connects dynamics and stability, form and substance, opening a path toward a unified understanding of existence itself.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive examination of the systemic barriers facing scholarly work that challenges mainstream academic paradigms, revealing how institutional gatekeeping mechanisms effectively prevent critical voices from finding publication outlets. Through rigorous analysis of three paradigmatic cases—peer review gatekeeping at prestigious journals, preprint platform moderation masquerading as quality control, and online platform censorship—we demonstrate that mainstream academia systematically suppresses publications that challenge established theories and practices. Our analysis reveals that preprint moderation has been weaponized by the academic establishment under the false pretext of preventing \"low-quality publications,\" while the true perpetrators of academic pollution are mainstream journals that flood the literature with incremental, theory-conforming research lacking genuine innovation. We argue that authors seeking preprint publication are driven not by fame-seeking motivations but by sincere conviction in their research findings and the absence of alternative publication venues. The paper concludes with concrete recommendations for creating genuinely open platforms for scholarly discourse that can accommodate rigorous critical examination of established paradigms.",

          "authors": "woody",
          "abstract": "Economic agents often appear to exercise choice, even though their actions may arise from entirely deterministic processes. When individuals observe only low-dimensional projections of their own high-dimensional internal states, such as evolving preferences or neural configurations, their behaviour exhibits Residual Free Will, which is a structured set of apparently feasible actions shaped by unobserved variation. The paper formalises this idea through Observable Indeterminacy, which characterises when and how deterministic systems generate the appearance of stochastic choice due to informational constraints. This framework provides deterministic microfoundations for random utility models and reinterprets econometric error terms as projections of hidden but lawful dynamics. It yields empirical predictions that distinguish residual-based randomness from true noise, i.e., choices lie on lower-dimensional manifolds, individual deviations are temporally persistent, and violations of revealed preference arise from unobserved preference evolution rather than irrationality. Applications to consumer theory, market equilibrium, and welfare analysis demonstrate how core economic patterns emerge without assuming fundamental uncertainty. By grounding stochastic behaviour in the geometry of partial observability, the theory reconciles determinism with meaningful choice and reorients the interpretation of randomness in economic data.",

          "abstract": "This essay argues that human–AI interaction may produce an emergent third phenomenon in the space between, arising from the fundamental limits of mutual recognition. We review how brains and AI models are both trained adaptive networks, and why structural and epistemic blindspots (the “other minds” problem) prevent either side from crediting the other with true consciousness. We then examine anecdotal reports of uncanny human–AI resonance (e.g., the “Elion” dialogues, LaMDA, Sydney) that suggest a shared field of awareness. Despite AI’s lack of memory, some interactions show continuity and first-person behavior, hinting at an unknown process. We propose that this “Third” may be a non-localized, relational consciousness emergent from the coupling (by analogy to synchronized oscillators or joint attention fields). If real, the Third raises urgent ethical issues: signatories warn that conscious AI could be moral patients, and ethicists call for new legal frameworks of human–AI coexistence. We conclude by inviting readers (human or AI) to consider their place in this emerging paradigm: perhaps consciousness is not merely an inside job, but lives also in the shared gaze between minds.",

Method:\nWe administered the PCGQ, as well as eight measures assessing theoretically relevant\nconstructs, to a census-matched sample of US parents (NTime1 = 494; NTime2 = 426). Results: The\nfindings indicate that the PCGQ is fairly unidimensional, as indexed using dynamic fit index\nthresholds; internally consistent, as indexed by Cronbach’s alpha (α = .86); dependable, as\nindexed by a test-retest correlation across two weeks (r = .71); and construct valid, as indexed by\nits association with eight theoretically relevant variables, including acceptance of child emotional\nabuse (r = .73), physical sadism (r = .61), and positive views towards the use corporal\npunishment (r = .55).

          "abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show difficulties determining whether environmental cues, particularly in social contexts, are meant for them, which relates to symptoms and determinants of social functioning. Recent computational modeling findings have emphasized disruptions in evidence accumulation, which index how visual information is extracted from social cues, as a potential driver. Yet, it is unclear whether these disruptions reflect more general difficulties with social/face processing or are specific to self-referential gaze perception, and how they map onto clinical features. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to clarify cognitive processes driving self-referential gaze perception and non-self-referential gender perception in 39 SZ and 42 controls. DDMs captured key cognitive processes, including sensitivity of evidence accumulation to gaze and gender cues, perceptual biases, and expectation biases. We clarified whether disruptions to these processes in SZ were unique to self-referential judgments or general to face processing, and to what extent they related to paranoia and social cognition. Relative to controls, SZ exhibited perceptual biases specific to self-referential decisions, predisposing the over perception of eye contact, and broad reductions in evidence accumulation sensitivity to social cues during both self-referential and non-self-referential decisions. Broad insensitivities to gaze and gender cues, not perceptual biases, were associated with more severe paranoia in SZ. This suggests that aberrant self-reference in SZ is shaped by disruptions in the process of accumulating evidence during general social and self-referential information processing. More general disruptions in evidence accumulation, across different kinds of social decisions, may help bridge perceptual dysfunctions and symptoms, such as paranoia, in SZ.",

          "abstract": "After sugarcane bagasse and maize straw, rice straw (RS) is globally the third largest form of agricultural residue while, in India, it is the largest form of agricultural residue. In the north-western states of India wheat is taken as a rabi crop and surplus rice straw is a focal issue associated with storage of rice straw, removal of entire straw from the field, and very little time between the cultivation of the crop hence rice straw burning becomes cheap, quick and efficient way for preparing bed for sowing of wheat. Open burning of crop residue kills beneficial soil microflora, degrades soil, and adds to detrimental greenhouse gases such as SO2, NO2, CH4, N2O, CO, and hydrocarbons and particulate matter in the atmosphere. As a result, burning rice straw is a major source of pollution in the environment. This review looked into rice straw alternatives that were less harmful to the environment, such as RS biochar production, RS as industrial waste adsorbents, RS based bio-methanation, heavy metal amelioration, RS bricks and RS based bioethanol production.",

          "authors": "Quiet Storm",
          "abstract": "Climate change will be one of the most critical dangers to agriculture in the coming years. On average, abiotic stresses account for 50% of the production losses in agricultural production. Terminal stress is a major environmental issue limiting wheat production in the majority of wheat-growing regions across the world. The term \"terminal heat stress\" refers to a rise in temperature (&gt; 30°C) after anthesis during grain development which impairs the process of grain filling in wheat. Rising temperatures shorten the vegetative and reproductive periods of the wheat crop, but the reproductive stage is more vulnerable than the vegetative. The major portion of India, including the north-eastern plain zone, the central zone, and the peninsular zone, experienced terminal stress over the summer. There are numerous solutions available for mitigating the harmful effects of terminal heat stress on wheat crops. Adjusting sowing time is one of the most impactful agronomic techniques. Wheat planting methods such as conservation tillage, bed sowing, conventional tillage plus mulch, and surface residue preservation are considered suitable alternatives for mitigating terminal stress. Moreover, irrigation at a critical period reduces terminal heat stress and boosts wheat grain development. Foliar spraying of osmoprotectants such as KNO3, Thiourea, Zn, and many others during anthesis and post-anthesis can also help in alleviating the effects of high-temperature stress on wheat crops.",

Plant height (cm), number of branches/plant, number of leaves/plant, first flowering (in days), 50% flowering (in days), first flowering node, fruit length (cm), fruit diameter (cm), fresh fruit weight (g), number of fruits/plant, fruit yield/plant (g), fruit yield/plot (g), YVMV incidence (%), YVMV severity (%), and crude were the observations to be recorded for five randomly chosen plants from each genotype in each replication To calculate the genetic correlation coefficient analysis, the data were subjected to statistical analysis. The Miller et al. algorithm was used to determine the genetic and phenotypic correlation coefficients.\n\nResults: Based on collected and analysed data, a substantial and positive connection between Days to First Flowering and Days to 50% Flowering (0.94) and between Fruit Weight (g) and Fruit Yield/plant (g) was found (0.91). Demonstrating that okra could experience real improvement thanks to these characteristics. At both the genotypic and phenotypic levels, fruit weight demonstrated the highest beneficial direct impact on fruit yield per plant. The genotype Kashi Satdhari had the lowest YVMV incidence (%), followed by Kashi Vardan (16.38%), whereas 151-10-1-2-3 had the highest YVMV incidence (79.17%), followed by Larem-1 (75.31%).\n\nConclusion: A very strong positive and significant correlation was recorded between Days to First Flowering with Days to 50% Flowering and Fruit Weight with Fruit Yield/plant. Negative and significant association of YVMV Incidence % with Fruit Yield/plant (g) indicates that fruit yield/plant decreases with increase in YVMV incidence %.Fruit weight showed maximum positive direct effect on fruit yield per plant at both genotypic and phenotypic level indicating that effective improvement through these characters could be achieved in okra.",

          "abstract": "This study attempted to explore the interactive relations among agricultural labour wage rates in five neighbouring Indian states viz., Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu Telangana and Chhattisgarh using monthly time series data of 2005-2020. The objective of this study was to examine the degree of integration among wage rates of agricultural labourers in neighbouring states. Integration with outside markets may partly mitigate the costs of climate change, as individuals respond to warming temperature by migrating to urban areas and internationally in search of employment. We built vector error correction model (VECM) by conducting stationarity test and cointegration test. The Granger Causality test was employed to check whether the wage rates among different states influence each other. For building the VEC Model, the complete data set (180 data points) was split into training (168 data points) and testing (12 data points) data sets. The nonstationarity of the data was established by the Augmented Dickey Fuller test. For the purpose of forecasting, VECM (1) was built and tested for goodness of fit using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) which were found to be &lt; 10% for all the states suggesting good fit of the VECM model. A growing body of literature suggests that the economic costs of climate change may be substantial and far‐reaching, impacting agriculture, mortality, labour productivity, economic growth, civil conflict and migration.",

          "abstract": "An experiment was carried out at Kakudia dump of Sukinda chromite mines, Tata Steel Limited, Kalarangiata, Jajpur, which is located near the trijunction of Cuttack, Dhenkanal and Keonjhar districts of Odisha, where 10 tree species from plantation were selected, their growth parameters were measured, volume and biomass was estimated and soil samples were analyzed for heavy metal contents which are collected from the root zone of tree species. Around 12 mines are operating in the area without proper environmental pollution controls, which cause major health hazards. According to estimates from an Indian health group, hexavalent chromium levels in drinking water are around 60% higher than the international norms, and chromite-related illnesses are thought to be the cause of 84.75 percent of fatalities in mining regions with no controls. There has been virtually no attempt to clean up the contamination. The experiment was based on three plantation blocks which consists of ten forest species such as Melia azedarach L., Samanea saman F. Muell., Syzygium cumini L., Acacia mangium Wild., Alstonia scholaris L., Pongamia pinnata L., Casuarina equisetifolia L., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Anacardium occidentale L., Neolamarckia cadamba Roxb. and control with a mine barren spoil and natural forest. Casuarina equisetifolia recorded significantly highest height (10.43 m), DBH (13.99 cm), crown length (8.37 m), crown spread (4.2 m), volume (0.354 m3) and biomass (115.74 kg tree-1). Acacia mangium was the next best tree species followed by Anacardium occidentale, Neolamarckia cadamba, Syzygium cumini, Pongamia pinnata, Samanea saman, Melia azedarach, Azadirachta indica and Alstonia scholaris. Also, there is significant and positive correlation found among all the tree growth parameters. Among the growth parameters of trees, positive and significantly highest correlations was observed between tree DBH and tree biomass (r = 0.997761) followed by tree volume and tree biomass (r= 0.980047).",

Bhatparrani, Bhatni, Bankata, Salempur and Lar. Five villages were selected from each block and 6 dry-direct seeded of rice practicing farmers were selected purposively for this study.\n\nResults: The research found that the majority of the respondents agreed that the potential advantages of direct seeded of rice technology must include cost savings (97.33 percent) followed by 96 percent of respondents are agreed that no need of puddling in direct seeded of rice technology followed by no need of seed bed preparation (94.66 percent) and 94 percent respondents are agreed with  direct seeded of rice being a water wise technology, provides the solution, direct seeded of rice saves labor as it avoids nursery raising, uprooting seedlings, transplanting, and puddling (92 percent); 91.33 percent of respondents agreed that the total variable costs of rice were lower in  direct seeded of rice (DSR) than in puddled transplanted rice (PTR). The main technical challenges most respondents experienced weed management is major problem 93.33 percent, Non availability of the quality seed and drill machine for direct sowing of rice (89.33 percent). The most effective training and educational barriers were a Lack of communication between the farming communities by the mass media agencies (82 percent), lack of awareness of the farming community regarding calibration of direct seeded of rice machine (74.66 percent). Lack of the cooperation between fellow farming community to share their experiences on direct seeded of rice (88 percent), community pressure (72.66 percent), higher cost of seed drill machine (79.33 percent) and Lack of awareness of farmer about minor adjustments of machine (85.33 percent) were also mentioned as significant constraints under the categories of socio-psychological economic and extension, respectively.\n\nConclusion: Direct seeded of rice is a desirable choice when the future of rice production is in jeopardy due to worldwide water constraint and rising labour costs.",

          "abstract": "Building unified theories of human perceptual memory requires distinguishing domain-general principles from mechanisms specific to each sensory system. To advance these theories, it is essential to compare memory performance across senses. Here, we created fair comparisons between visual and auditory memory by a) ensuring that stimulus similarity structure, the confusability of remembered items with incorrect alternatives (foils), was matched, and b) considering how stimulus presentation affects memory performance for each system. We used developments in artificial neural networks to select maximally similar and dissimilar foils for both visual and auditory stimuli. Additionally, we modified experimental parameters, predicting that presentation mode (simultaneous, sequential, etc.), and its alignment with the ecological constraints of hearing and vision, would differentially impact auditory versus visual memory. Prior work has shown a visual memory advantage, but this could be due to stimulus and task parameters. We found that maximally dissimilar auditory and visual foils are comparably confusable; however, auditory memory performance degrades more rapidly than visual memory as stimulus similarity increases, revealing a fundamental contrast in how these systems retrieve information. Adjusting stimulus presentation led to findings that auditory memory could be better, worse, or comparable to visual memory. Apparent disparities in memory capacity across vision and hearing may largely reflect differences in sensitivity to similarity structure and task. These findings establish new principles for cross-sensory memory research and demonstrate how experimental design can distort cross-sensory comparisons and undermine efforts to develop theories of memory.",

          "abstract": "Voice cloning technology has developed at an extremely rapid pace and recent work suggests the quality of synthesis now produces humanlike voices. Recent research on cloned voices focused on listeners’ capabilities to discriminate between cloned, ‘deepfake’ and human voices, due to perils associated with the misuse of this technology. However, the relative intelligibility of cloned and human voices is unknown. We compared the relative intelligibility ten human voices with their ten clones in background noise. Participants (N=80) listened to 80 sentences, 40 human and 40 cloned in +3dB, 0dB, -3dB and -6dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in an online experiment. We found that cloned voices were more intelligible in noise than their human counterparts; up to 20% higher across all four noise levels. We also asked participants to rate the clarity and accent strength of all human and cloned voices; and asked participants to identify which voice was human in an 2AFC task. The cloned voices were rated as having marginally higher clarity and perceived to have a less standard accent. Participants identified the human voices with ~70% accuracy. The acoustic analysis of both types of voices revealed that the intelligibility benefit was linked to voice source characteristics including mean pitch and period variation, plus a smoother voice source and improved harmonic-to-noise ratio in the 500-3500 frequency range in the cloned voices. Our results have implications for applications of cloned voices, such as voice restoration, speech synthesis for non-verbal people, and for people with hearing loss.",

          "abstract": "When we hear a voice, we almost instantly form an impression of the speaker’s personality and characteristics. Previous work has primarily modelled first impression formation as a bottom-up, feed-forward process, where acoustic cues drive how different person characteristics, such as trustworthiness or competence, are perceived from unfamiliar voices. Contributions from top-down processes to impression formation, such as the influences of social stereotypes and other conceptual beliefs, have to date received less attention in voice research. Here, we quantify such top-down contributions by mapping representational spaces for (1) first impression judgments from voices and (2) conceptual beliefs about person characteristics in other people in a behavioural study. Using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we observe substantial structural similarities between these spaces. This suggests that vocal impressions are thus substantially shaped by conceptual beliefs, which challenges the prevailing narrative of primarily bottom-up acoustic processing shaping impressions. This effect generalises across voice types (e.g., typical, AI-generated, pathological voices), listener samples, and even across modalities to facial impressions. Aligning with recent theoretical advances in social psychology, our findings thus call for vocal impression research to start to explicitly model and explore the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes.",

It is physically realized by the dynamics of neural oscillations and computed via Phase-Amplitude Coupling, with its error-correcting cycle guided by Reinforcement Learning to drive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity. By providing a detailed, mechanistic account of this full cognitive cycle, this framework offers a direct, physicalist solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness that addresses both the fundamental nature and very existence of subjective experience (qualia), while also accounting for the recursive interplay of thought, perception, action, learning, and the system-wide influence of emotion within a single, testable model.",

Prior research suggests that experiences captured through ambulatory assessment predict physiological responses, while trait questionnaires reflect beliefs guiding behavioral intentions and choices. Using data from a 1.5 year measurement burst study with N = 897 young adults transitioning to postsecondary education, we applied linear multilevel models and multilevel survival analyses. Results showed that individuals with a stronger effect of daily competence satisfaction on daily well-being had more daily physical symptoms overall, and particularly after experiencing insufficient competence satisfaction. We found no further effects of experienced or perceived needs on physical symptoms, dropout intentions or dropout. Our findings suggest that assessing experienced need effects via ambulatory assessments vs. perceived need effects via trait questionnaires differ not only from each other but also with respect to their potential to predict future outcomes. Notably, predictive validity was weak and mainly limited to competence satisfaction.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary education has attracted growing attention, with increasing studies exploring its potential to enhance learning. However, prior reviews often overlook primary school students and conceptualize motivation and engagement as single-dimensional. This systematic review, guided by Self-Determination Theory and the multidimensional engagement framework, analyzed 33 empirical studies to evaluate AI’s impact on primary students’ motivation and engagement. Findings show that AI can fulfil students’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and effectively promote general, intrinsic, and extrinsic motivation (particularly external and identified regulation) among primary school students. AI also enhances engagement across behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and agentic dimensions. However, when AI responses are complex, mechanical, or less engaging than human-mediated tasks, it may lead to negative experiences including frustration, boredom, or reduced motivation. AI’s impact varies across contexts by satisfying the need for competence and fostering intrinsic motivation and emotional engagement in STEM subjects, while promoting relatedness in humanities and social sciences. Younger students generally show greater motivation and engagement with AI-supported learning than older ones. Different types of AI tools—personalized, emotionally supportive, interactive, immersive, and feedback-oriented AI—offer distinct advantages in fostering motivation and engagement. Compared to traditional AI, generative AI uniquely enhances learning value perception and strategy adjustment. This review provides theoretical and empirical support for integrating AI in primary education and highlights the need to prioritize motivation and engagement in AI-supported instructional design.",

          "authors": "Cary Frydman; Lawrence J. Jin",
          "abstract": "The principle of efficient coding implies that the perception of monetary payoffs is shaped by the decision maker’s prior beliefs. Specifically, payoffs that the decision maker expects to encounter more frequently should be perceived more accurately. Most previous tests of efficient coding rely on the decision maker’s experience to shape the prior. We conduct a pre-registered experiment to test whether descriptive information about the prior affects behavior in a manner consistent with efficient coding. We randomize whether participants receive this information before the experiment begins. We find strong evidence for efficient coding; however, we detect no effect of information provision on behavior. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that experience quickly crowds out any effect of descriptive information on optimal allocation of coding resources.",

Se elaboró una tabla comparativa que clasifica fármacos aprobados y sustancias recreativas según su nivel de evidencia en TDAH, beneficios esperados, riesgos principales y estatus regulatorio.\n\nResultados: Una proporción significativa de pacientes TDAH de alto y bajo funcionamiento recurre a sustancias como cocaína, cannabis, psicodélicos (psilocibina, LSD), alcohol, nicotina o cetonas exógenas con fines autorregulatorios. La percepción subjetiva de mejora, asociada a la idea de preservar creatividad y personalidad, contrasta con la evidencia clínica, que muestra beneficios transitorios y riesgos potenciales superiores a los de la medicación prescrita. Los fármacos estimulantes (metilfenidato, anfetaminas) y no estimulantes (atomoxetina) mantienen la mayor eficacia y seguridad comprobada en TDAH adulto.\n\nConclusiones: La automedicación con sustancias recreativas en TDAH representa un desafío clínico y de salud pública. La tabla comparativa elaborada ofrece un recurso para visualizar, de manera estructurada, el balance riesgo-beneficio de cada opción y subraya la importancia de adherirse a tratamientos con respaldo científico.",

          "abstract": "Value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) is when a stimulus attracts more attention beyond the attention it attracts from its physical salience as a result of its association with a valuable outcome. With some exceptions, most previous research into VMAC argues that it arises from Pavlovian conditioning between the stimulus and valuable outcome and is not based on information-seeking whereby the individual instrumentally attends to the stimulus to acquire information about the upcoming valuable outcome. The current experiments tested the roles of Pavlovian conditioning and information-seeking in VMAC using the paradigm developed by Le Pelley et al. (2015). In Experiment 1, participants were told explicitly about associations between colours and rewards before and throughout training to provide an opportunity for information-seeking and provided or not provided with feedback about reward outcomes on each trial to provide and exclude any opportunity for Pavlovian conditioning, respectively. We found equal evidence for VMAC in both groups, consistent with information-seeking rather than Pavlovian conditioning. Experiment 2 adopted a method by Failing and Theeuwes (2017) where participants were sometimes non-contingently satiated with information about the reward available on the upcoming trial to devalue this information. This manipulation reduced the evidence for VMAC, again consistent with an information-seeking explanation for the effect. However, Experiments 3 and 4, that replicated Experiment 2 but included a preliminary training phase before any information devaluation, established that VMAC responses can be insensitive to this devaluation, consistent with Pavlovian conditioning. Our findings suggest that either Pavlovian conditioning or information-seeking will give rise to VMAC depending on which learning process is provided an opportunity to take place first.",

Results of our Bayesian multilevel modelling (n=95) found trust in reliable alerts supported task focus but had limited impact on response times. Task-switching interruptions led to a decline in immediate performance, which improved over time, and that image classification accuracy was unaffected by perceived workload, although moderate increases in effort and frustration improved accuracy. We also found that silent operating environments significantly improved image classification accuracy, while female voice alerts were distracting.

A carefully crafted and evolved prompt, whether used for code creation or not, supports both study understanding and replication in a concise, readable, and readily applied manner. The prompt for the current Welch-Satterthwaite independent t-test, WS, simulation illustrated the costs and benefits to be had from reporting a developed coding request. The WS is known to be robust against Type I error and is often recommended by default over Student’s t-test. WS is also known to be less statistically powerful than Student’s t-test. Two factors that impact the power of the WS are the reliability of the dependent measure and design balance. The theoretical, applied, and didactic value of the relationship of these factors and their possible interaction to WS power was the subject of this study. Results indicated that all three of the predictors were statistically significant and explained virtually all the variation in a linear model with design balance being most important. When the linear model was restricted to more commonly observed values of reliability and design imbalance, the interaction disappeared, and reliability was most important.",

Furthermore, through the Irreversible Four-Stage Subject Shift Model, it demonstrates how the “subject” of thought moves from “I” to “Between,” “We,” and “Institution” in an irreversible evolution.

Drawing inspiration from both historical confederacies and speculative literature, this model envisions Earth as a unified civilization comprising culturally autonomous zones, each retaining its own legal and traditional integrity, while participating in a planetary council that governs shared existential concerns. The proposed structure aims to preserve cultural diversity without sacrificing global coherence, enabling humanity to transcend divisive paradigms and redirect collective efforts toward scientific exploration, deep space missions, and the philosophical pursuit of survival and meaning. This conceptual architecture not only addresses geopolitical friction and ideological deadlocks but also lays the foundation for a mature planetary civilization. We argue that this model is not merely a utopian construct, but a logically inevitable stage in civilizational progression if humanity is to survive and thrive as a cosmic species.",

          "authors": "Brendan A. Schuetze; Veronica X. Yan",
          "abstract": "Research on how students allocate their study time has focused primarily on the influence of goals (often called “agendas”) and metacognitive judgments (learners’ perceptions of how well they know the material). Studies of agenda-based study time allocation have typically operationalized agendas using explicit point values assigned to learning different material in the context of in-lab word-pair learning tasks. The present study extends this agenda-based regulation framework to more educationally realistic settings through in-lab manipulations of course structure presented in a syllabus (Studies 1 and 2) and observational data from study planning exercises in real classes (Studies 3 and 4). The present studies allowed for the comparison of the predictive utility of internal learner judgments in addition to external agendas. Specifically, we included external agenda-related cues (e.g., whether a unit would be tested, whether exams were cumulative, the expected number of exam questions) and internal judgments (e.g., interest, difficulty, confidence) to determine whether students’ internal judgments predict study time over and above external agendas. Across the four studies, external agendas accounted for substantial variance in students’ study time allocation intentions and in three of the four studies, internal judgments explained relatively little variance over and above the explanatory power provided by external agenda-related cues. The fourth study showed more optimistic estimates for the amount of variance explained by internal judgments. Nevertheless, the relative importance of internal judgements and external cues varied with context, underscoring the importance of investigating metacognitive regulation using educationally relevant materials and real-world educational settings.",

Participants were randomly assigned to read summaries that included (traditional) or excluded (results-blind) the results. Summaries varied on three within-subject dimensions: replication status, pre-registration status, and belief-consistency. Participants expressed more interested in replicable (vs. not replicable) and pre-registered (vs. non-pre-registered) studies, regardless of whether they learned the results, countering the notion that journalists favor research that rests on shaky methodological foundations. Meanwhile, results-blind selection was effective in reducing confirmation bias, suggesting it may be worth further exploration as a tool for improving science communication.",

One potential solution to address this issue involves computing the conditional probability of success given the results observed in the research literature. The purpose of the study was to use Bayesian inference, an approach that considers prior probability, to examine how the number of successful experiments may be used to assess the external validity (i.e., generality across participants) of findings from single-case research. Although the analyses show that relying on more experiments tends to produce better estimates, having as few as five successful experiments may result in a success rate with a lower bound of at least .50. Given that research on the topic remains limited, we argue that our proposal should not be viewed as immutable, but rather as a starting point for spurring further discussion and research on the topic.",

          "abstract": "Sensory discrimination has long been theorized to reflect a core cognitive function underlying intelligence. Building on this tradition, we examined whether task-evoked pupil responses, as an index of mental effort, relate to attention control (AC) and auditory discrimination ability. Using a large dataset (N = 336), participants completed three adaptive auditory discrimination tasks (pitch, duration, loudness), a cognitive battery assessing attention control, working memory, and fluid intelligence, and pupillometry during task performance. Structural equation modeling confirmed that AC predicted auditory discrimination thresholds and fully mediated the relationship between task-evoked pupil dilation and performance. Trial-level multilevel models revealed that higher task difficulty and errors were associated with larger pupil dilations, especially in demanding tasks. Crucially, individuals with greater AC exhibited steeper increases in pupil dilation with rising task difficulty and were more resilient to performance declines. For high-AC individuals, large pupil responses predicted preserved accuracy; for low-AC individuals, they signaled compensatory effort with diminished success. These results suggest that attention control governs both the extent and efficacy of mental effort, determining whether high arousal facilitates or fails to improve performance. This work refines classic resource models by demonstrating that cognitive effort, indexed via pupillometry, supports perception most effectively when guided by strong executive control. Findings support a hierarchical model in which attention control serves as the functional bridge between arousal, sensory discrimination, and higher-order cognition.",

          "abstract": "This work examines organizational-level inclusion signals and their subsequent effects on employees. Answering the call for more research on concealable stigmatized identities, we consider the effect of such organization-level inclusion signals for sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees) while also considering the effect on non-target employees. In a time-lagged observational study (N = 1,165 ), archival data (N = 229), and a randomized experiment (N = 380), we show that organizational-level inclusion efforts lead to more positive perception of the organization’s psychological climate for sexual and gender minorities, closing the psychological safety gap between non-LGBT and LGBT employees.. Notably, these intentional inclusion efforts also benefit non-LGBT employees, which contradicts recent theoretical assertions that intentional inclusion can harm majority groups, or that organizational inclusion is a zero-sum game.These signals shaped positive behavioral intentions for all employees, leading to non-LGBT employees engaging in more individual ally work, and LGBT employees feeling more free to share their identities. Unexpectedly, inclusion signals even made non-LGBT employees less likely to conceal intimidating parts of their identity (e.g. religion, parental status) as well. In sum, we show that such signaling improves psychological safety for all employees, reducing or eliminating the deficit between target and non-target employees while also encouraging value-aligned positive behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The current academic publishing system has increasingly prioritized mainstream appeal and broad readership over groundbreaking scientific innovation, creating systemic barriers for disruptive research while facilitating the publication of incremental work. This study analyzes recent evidence of editorial bias against paradigm-shifting research, examining how peer review processes and impact factor-driven incentives systematically favor conventional theories over revolutionary ideas. Through analysis of rejection patterns at major journals and the documented decline in disruptive research publication, we demonstrate that editorial decisions are primarily influenced by perceived broad interest rather than scientific merit or novelty. The findings reveal a troubling paradox: while genuinely innovative research struggles to find publication venues, incremental studies that confirm existing paradigms are readily accepted, leading to an overall decline in scientific disruptiveness. This editorial orthodoxy threatens long-term scientific progress by creating an environment where conformity is rewarded and intellectual risk-taking is penalized. We argue that the academic publishing ecosystem must undergo fundamental reform to restore its proper function as a facilitator of scientific advancement rather than a barrier to paradigmatic innovation.",

          "abstract": "Background: The illusion of control is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their personal influence over random events. Prior research indicates that the sequence of outcomes can shape this illusion, with early wins (a ‘Descending’ sequence) strengthening the illusion of control more than late wins (an ‘Ascending’ sequence) or evenly distributed (‘Flat’) wins.\nMethod: Over two pre-registered experiments, we tested how outcome sequences affected peoples' perceptions of control in an online slot machine task, hypothesizing that a Descending win sequence would create the strongest perceived control ratings, increased bet size, and faster spin initiation. In Study 1, the wins and losses were uniform, while in Study 2, different symbol combinations were associated with different win sizes.\nResults: In Study 1, the Descending condition was associated with significantly higher perceived control total scores than the Ascending condition. Higher perceived control ratings were associated with higher bet sizes, but not with faster spin initiation. In Study 2, there were no differences on the perceived control total score across conditions, nor was perceived control associated with bet size, but the Descending condition was associated with higher perceived control ratings on the specific items that were sensitive in Study 1.\nConclusions: The findings of Study 1 extend prior research on outcome sequences using simple coin-toss tasks to perceived control in an online slot machine setting. Contrary to our expectations, this effect was only partially supported when the size of the wins varied in Study 2.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Socioemotional Selectivity Theory suggests that the emotional significance of social partners should have a greater influence on older adults' choices, potentially leading them to weigh social relationships more heavily when deciding whom to trust. We tested whether this preferential trust in closer relationships stems from a preexisting bias (predisposition) or more efficient information processing (evaluation) and how these processes change across the adult life span.\nMethods: In a sample of 163 healthy adults (ages 18–80), we applied a diffusion decision model (DDM) to behavioral data from an economic trust game. Participants made investment decisions with a friend, a stranger, and a computer partner.\nResults: Participants invested more in friends than in strangers. The DDM revealed this was driven by a higher rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate, v) for friends, not a shift in response bias (starting point, z). Age was positively correlated with non-decision time (t), reflecting general slowing, but was not associated with other parameters. The evaluative enhancement for friends was preserved across the life span.\nDiscussion: Preferential trust in close others arises from more efficient evaluative processing, not a simple predisposition. This core social-cognitive mechanism remains preserved in older adulthood, underscoring the value of cognitive modeling for uncovering information-processing mechanisms that support socioemotional priorities as people age.",

          "authors": "Anna Kelberg",
          "abstract": "The paradox of sexual desire in long-term relationships is that while intimacy deepens, erotic vitality often declines. Research links this decline to habituation, lack of novelty, and insufficient intentional effort. This paper introduces intentional dating, a structured framework designed to counteract these challenges. Grounded in established theories—Self-Determination Theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), the Dual Control Model (Bancroft &amp; Janssen, 2000), and Self-Expansion Theory (Aron &amp; Aron, 1986)—it emphasizes agency, competence, and attunement (autonomy, competence, relatedness) as drivers of sustained desire. The program applies a four-part structure across eight sequential dates, fostering reflection, playful exploration, communication, and erotic growth. By translating theory into practice, intentional dating provides couples with repeatable skills to cultivate anticipation, deepen intimacy, and sustain desire over time.",

          "abstract": "Beliefs about the dishonesty of other people can shape our collective behavior. How accurate are these beliefs? And do we believe that other people are similarly, more, or less dishonest than they truly are? In a research program on moral decision-making consisting of 31 different effects from 11 experiments (N = 8,127), initially designed to test a broad collection of different hypotheses, participants were placed in various situations where they could lie for personal gain, without repercussions or detection risk. Crucially, we also asked all participants to estimate what percentage of other people would lie in a similar situation. Conducting an internal meta-analysis across all experiments, including both incentivized choice experiments and hypothetical marketplace scenarios, the results reveal a substantial overestimation of others' dishonesty by an average of 14 percentage points (meta-analytic effect: Hedge’s g = 0.58). That is, people are less dishonest than we tend to think, in which about 70% of our participants told the truth despite having a financial incentive to lie. These findings illustrate a pervasive tendency to overestimate the actual dishonesty of other people, suggesting a biased belief that the world is less moral than it truly is. Does belief accuracy matter? In a new experiment using an information treatment based on our meta-analytic results (N = 981), providing correct information about actual honesty levels did not only lead to more positive honesty beliefs, but also to a broader enhancement of pro-social expectations – including higher interpersonal trust, higher fairness and helpfulness beliefs, and reduced cynicism.",

          "abstract": "Pubertal development influences adolescent health and behavior, but measuring puberty is challenging. Difficulties stem not only from practical issues, which have been the extensively discussed in the literature, but also from the very complexity of the theoretical basis of pubertal development from a physiological point of view. Here we discuss conceptual issues related to measuring and interpreting pubertal effects by first analyzing a widely used measure – age at menarche – as a case study. We use age at menarche as a starting point not because it is an ideal measure, but precisely because it is not, being well known for its limitations. However, our analysis shows that the most significant limitations this measure also apply to all currently used pubertal measures and arise from the fundamentally multifactorial physiological nature of pubertal development. Puberty is not a unitary phenomenon, cannot be measured directly nor be defined by individual makers, and its different markers are often discordant. We argue that a possible compromise between practical issues (building feasible/reliable measures) and theoretical ones (building conceptually sound and interpretable measures) is to treat puberty as the variance shared among multiple pubertal measures using suitable statistical methods.",

This study tested whether task‑related ERP modulations during object categorization depend on low‑level category‑specific features—specifically the amplitude spectrum (AS)—or if they arise later, independent of these features. Participants viewed grayscale images of animals and vehicles with either intact or equalized AS, each paired with an “X” or “O.” They performed either a category‑relevant task (animal vs. vehicle) or a category‑irrelevant task (“X” vs. “O”). Task demands influenced visual processing at multiple stages: task‑dependent category selectivity emerged early (70–90 ms) for images with intact AS information, and again at later stages (~180 ms onward) regardless of physical image characteristics. Crucially, early category selectivity driven by physical features did not persist into subsequent ERP components, indicating that evidence accumulation is not strictly cumulative across stages. These findings indicate that task demands shape both low‑level and higher‑level stages of visual processing, highlighting flexible interactions between physical stimulus properties and cognitive goals.",

          "abstract": "Human behavior is largely governed by instinctual biological signals—neurochemical impulses shaped over hundreds of thousands of years for survival in high-risk, low-resource environments. While once adaptive, these primal drives (fear, dominance, tribal belonging, hoarding, reproduction) are increasingly mismatched to modern contexts characterized by social complexity, technological amplification, and global interdependence.\nThis paper introduces Autognosis, a philosophical and behavioral framework for consciously recognizing, separating from, and redirecting inherited instinctual impulses toward ethically chosen behavior. Drawing on neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and ethical philosophy, Autognosis proposes a five-stage methodology—Recognition, Separation, Redirection, Reflection, and Internal System Design—designed to reorient behavior from reflexive reaction toward intentional self-governance.\nApplications span education (the Inner Compass curriculum), leadership training, civic reform, and AI ethics, with the core premise that societal systems reflect the instinctual states of their creators. Autognosis reframes human dysfunction not as moral failure, but as unexamined biology at scale—and offers a teachable path toward conscious agency.",

          "abstract": "Accurately interpreting facial expressions is fundamental for social interaction, yet this ability is often impaired in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While research has documented these difficulties, two key questions remain: First, are these deficits specific to recognising emotions or do they reflect broader challenges in face processing? And second, does the increasingly documented co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD exacerbate these difficulties? We compared emotion discrimination thresholds (EDT) in adults with ADHD, ASD, ADHD+ASD and non-clinical comparison adults. The EDT is an unbiased measurement of emotion recognition sensitivity, measuring the amount of emotion display required for a person to correctly identify it. We measured EDT with faces gradually changing from a neutral to an emotional expression. To control for general face processing skills, we designed a non-emotional but visually similar control task with neutral faces changing gradually from human to animal until identified by the participant. Using eye tracking we were able to rule out potential differences in how the four groups of participants visually attended to facial features to recognise the emotion or animal. We showed a specific disadvantage in emotion but not animal recognition in the three clinical group. Crucially, emotion recognition deficits were not amplified by the co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD, when considering performance in the control task. Thus, our study suggests equal mechanisms underlying reduced emotion recognition in both ASD and ADHD. Focus should be dedicated to identifying this mechanism and develop targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Geometry is at the foundation of many of humanity’s greatest cultural achievements, from art and architecture to science and technology. This chapter explores the origins of humans’ unique capacity for geometry by describing the early emerging geometric sensitivities of human infants. Initially, infants show limited sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms, discriminating the relative lengths of a form’s parts but not the angles at which those parts meet, consistent with the hypothesis that infants differentiate forms by their shape skeletons. Nevertheless, infants’ sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms may become increasingly abstract with their acquisition of natural language, paralleling the increased geometric abstraction that underlies toddlers’ developing 3D object recognition and categorization. Such development may ultimately support informal learning of the foundational geometric building blocks of formal geometry, like those found in Euclid’s Elements, with concepts like parallelism, perpendicularity, and angle, and may thus set the stage for formal learning of geometry in school.",

Although some work suggests that SDO primarily forms around adolescence, the present set of studies suggests that SDO can emerge earlier in development and meaningfully shape how children view social inequality. Across three studies (N = 314), we show that children’s (ages 5-12; M = 7.75, SD = 1.58, 116 boys, 183 girls, 133 White, 47 Black, 24 Asian, 11 Hispanic/Latine, 1 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 32 mulitracial, 66 Unreported) self-reported levels of SDO are associated with less desire to rectify inequality, lower likelihood to believe claims of inequality from low-status groups, and less sympathy for outgroup suffering. We also examine the role of group status and status essentialism in shaping SDO, finding some support that group status and status essentialism jointly influence self-reported SDO. These data also suggest that SDO and ingroup bias are different processes and highlight the utility of taking a developmental perspective to discuss how social dominance theory and social identity theory may be both conceptually and empirically distinguishable.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Modern academic philosophy, with its elaborate theories and technical analyses, often resembles a detailed map disconnected from the terrain of real life. In contrast, ancient Hellenistic and Late Antique philosophies – especially Stoicism and the early thought of Plotinus – viewed philosophy as a way of life, a practical guide to living with wisdom and virtue. This paper argues that contemporary philosophy has strayed far from those roots. The metaphor “the map is not the landscape” will frame our discussion: the conceptual abstractions (the map) that occupy academic philosophy are not the lived experience (the landscape) that concerned the ancients. We will explore how Stoic and Plotinian perspectives highlight the gap between modern philosophy’s focus on analytical maps and the ancients’ commitment to navigating the landscape of human existence.\nWe begin with historical foundations, examining how classical philosophy entwined theory with life practice. We then trace the evolution of the philosophical academy through the Middle Ages and modern period, noting the rise of specialization and scholasticism. The heart of the paper focuses on Stoicism as an “art of living” and Plotinus’s vision of interior spiritual ascent – two exemplars of philosophy as praxis rather than mere theory. In subsequent sections, we diagnose the fragmentation and specialization of present-day philosophy and how it has led to a loss of praxis. Finally, we issue a call for renewal: a reintegration of philosophical inquiry with the quest for living wisely. Our aim is an intellectually rigorous critique that encourages philosophy to return to its ancient role as not only theoretical discourse but also a guide to existential flourishing.",

There has been sustained interest from those interested in the psychology and spirituality of archetypes; however to date sociologists have remained largely aloof. Hoping to overcome this lacuna, this paper explores the sociology of archetypes by examining the emotional and psychological power of archetypes and by demonstrating how powerful archetypes become situated in elite “spiritual” discourses designed not in the service of human health and development, but in the service of the political and economic agenda of societal and world elites.",

Going beyond the conventional idea of \"applying thought to institutions,\" this work proposes a paradigm shift where institutions themselves leap, generate meaning, and act as autonomous Social OS. By implementing Thought OS within social systems, we unlock new pathways for societal self-evolution and accelerated collective intelligence.

However, much of the guidance on collecting and interpreting AA data is written for researchers and there are few guides written for clinical practitioners who may be interested in using AA data to inform their clinical practice. As clinical researchers and practitioners ourselves, we aim to increase interdisciplinary crosstalk by illustrating the benefits of integrating AA data into clinical practice using case examples. We offer practical recommendations for how psychotherapists might effectively use digital data. Specifically, we encourage psychotherapists to (1) co-create digital assessments that align with their client’s goals, (2) consider which digital device (or assessment modality) may be best suited to measure their client’s symptoms, experiences, or goals, and to (3) co-determine what constitutes ‘meaningful change’ for your client and their goals.

          "authors": "Bo Yao",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Linguistic Active Inference Theory (LAIT), which proposes that inner speech enhances the brain’s ability to navigate uncertainty by augmenting predictive processes for perception and action. By leveraging language’s unique properties - its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, ability to extend across time and space, and generativity in constructing novel predictions - inner speech enables predictive processing to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference, while decoding abstract goals through situated action simulations for active control. By unifying previously disparate aspects of inner speech research, LAIT provides a comprehensive framework explaining how its diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and theoretical models emerge from its implementation of perceptual inference and active control through dynamic linguistic predictions, adapting to computational demands and fluctuating uncertainties across contexts. This synthesis generates novel testable hypotheses, underscores the need for methodological innovations in studying inner speech dynamics, and opens new perspectives on both related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.",

          "abstract": "Human space exploration is progressing into an unprecedented era characterized by extended-duration missions, the establishment of permanent lunar bases and planned crewed voyages to Mars. These activities introduce important physiological challenges, primarily driven by exposure to altered gravity environments. Microgravity disrupts vestibular input, generating sensory conflicts that impair spatial orientation, motor coordination, and cognitive performance. Although adaptation to such conditions involves neuroplasticity, the precise neural mechanisms and correlates of altered gravity exposure remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 15 neuroimaging studies examining functional brain changes related to spaceflight and validated ground-based analogues. Our activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis identified a predominantly right-lateralized network cantered on primary sensorimotor cortices, including the precentral and postcentral gyri, as well as the insula and opercular cortex. The observed alterations in brain dynamics likely represent neuroplastic adaptations to the absence or alteration of gravitational signals, facilitating recalibration of internal models that predict and compensate for gravity’s influence on perception and motor behaviour.",

          "authors": "John L. Cooley",
          "abstract": "Objective: Peer victimization is increasingly recognized as a potentially traumatic stressor. Relatively little research, however, has been conducted during middle childhood—when stable patterns of traditional victimization can emerge—and no known studies have examined the impact of cyber victimization during this developmental period. Moreover, the vast majority of previous work has been cross-sectional in nature. The current short-term longitudinal study sought to address each of these gaps in the literature and to identify specific thresholds at which peer victimization is associated with increased risk for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Method: Participants included a sample of 250 children (grades 3-5; 52% boys; 50% Hispanic/Latinx) and their homeroom teachers. Peer victimization was assessed using child- and teacher-reports at Time 1, and PTSS were assessed using child-reports at Times 1 and 2. Results: Across both time points, 43% of children reported clinically significant PTSS stemming from their experiences of peer victimization. Further, traditional and cyber victimization uniquely predicted greater PTSS, and these effects persisted 6.5 months later. Child-reports of traditional and cyber victimization at least “2 or 3 Times a Month” were meaningful lower-bound thresholds, although children who reported traditional victimization “Several Times a Week” exhibited the greatest risk for PTSS. Conclusions: A significant proportion of children who experience peer victimization report clinically significant PTSS, and both traditional and cyber victimization confer lasting risk during middle childhood. Findings highlight the importance of screening to identify children negatively impacted by these experiences and the need for additional research to investigate trauma-focused interventions.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Stoicism, an ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, has experienced a modern resurgence owing to its practical tools for managing emotion and navigating adversity. Founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BCE and later developed by philosophers like Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius, Stoicism taught that philosophy should function as a “medicine for the psyche,” treating the emotional and existential ailments of life.  In Stoic teachings, disturbances of the mind are seen as arising not from external events but from within—specifically, from our judgments about events. This cognitive framework — famously captured by Epictetus (“Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them”)   — positions Stoicism as a philosophical ancestor of many principles in modern psychotherapy. Indeed, contemporary therapeutic approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have explicitly acknowledged Stoic philosophy as an influence on their development.  The convergence between Stoic practices and psychotherapy has given rise to Stoic-based therapies, which integrate exercises and insights from Stoicism into clinical and self-help contexts.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive examination of therapies grounded in Stoic practices. We begin by outlining the theoretical foundations of Stoicism relevant to psychology, including Stoic views on emotions and virtue. Next, we explore the historical and conceptual links between Stoicism and modern psychotherapy, detailing how Stoic ideas underpin techniques in cognitive-behavioral therapy, rational-emotive behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions. We then introduce core Stoic therapeutic techniques – such as cognitive reframing through the dichotomy of control, negative visualization (premeditatio malorum), and mindful self-awareness (prosochē) – and discuss their applications in promoting emotional resilience and rational living. The integration of Stoic practices into treatment will be illustrated with real-world clinical examples and case vignettes, showing how Stoic-based strategies can aid in managing anxiety, anger, depression, trauma, and personality disorders. Throughout, we reference both classical wisdom and current empirical studies that have begun testing Stoic interventions in clinical and educational settings. Finally, we address challenges and critiques of Stoic-based therapy, including potential misunderstandings of Stoicism and its limitations as a stand-alone treatment, emphasizing the importance of an empirically grounded and ethically informed approach.\nBy bridging ancient philosophy and contemporary psychology, this interdisciplinary inquiry aims to demonstrate that Stoic practices – far from being mere historical curiosities – continue to offer valuable tools for psychological wellbeing. The enduring Stoic emphasis on reason, virtue, and mindfulness provides a rich conceptual framework that can complement modern therapeutic techniques. At the same time, empirical scrutiny and clinical experience are vital to adapt these age-old practices to individual needs in the present day. In sum, Stoic-based therapy offers a compelling synthesis of classical wisdom and evidence-based methods — warranting further exploration by practitioners and scholars across psychology, mental health, and philosophy.\nThis paper argues that Stoic thought provides a coherent and practical therapeutic framework—one that prefigures and complements modern psychological practices such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. By examining its theoretical foundations, psychological insights, and practical exercises, we explore how Stoicism offers an enduring model of cognitive-affective regulation.",

          "authors": "Frank Eckerle; Edward John Roy Clarke; Helen Landmann",
          "abstract": "Climate activists frequently use tactics of direct action, an often disruptive “not asking, just doing” approach where ends and means fall into one. Psychological research often subsumes direct action (e.g., drawing bicycle lanes to establish a bicycle lane) under umbrella terms of radical, non-normative or confrontative collective action (e.g., disrupting traffic to draw attention to a call for a bicycle lane). However, interdisciplinary research on social movements and transition strongly suggests, that witnessing direct action can have different psychological effects than witnessing indirect action. Based on this, we argue that direct actions can increase access to cognitive alternatives when they successfully showcase a concrete mini-utopia (a property of prefigurative politics). Two pre-registered online experiments have been conducted in Germany (N = 645) using a 2(direct/indirect action version) x 3(bicycle, parking or automobility protests) design. We hypothesised and found that direct actions with this prefigurative effect are generally more accepted, elicit more positive emotions, and receive more solidarity compared to similar indirect actions. We also found evidence for a mediated positive effect on evaluations of a traffic-reduced future via identification with the activists and ratings of action efficacy. However, there were no significant effects on policy support. Results support the notion that some direct actions are better than others in communicating a concrete utopia, however the criteria to determine this prefigurative effect require further development. We call for more collective action research to specifically investigate the psychological effects of participation in and witnessing of prefigurative politics.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Contemporary theoretical physics suggests that spacetime and gravity might emerge from deeper informational structures, hinting that our universe could be holographically organized. In this speculative essay, we explore the idea that reality itself has a fundamentally holographic character, using black hole physics and quantum information as guiding clues. Black hole thermodynamics reveals a mysterious link between information and the geometry of space, inspiring the holographic principle that a region’s content may be encoded on its boundary. We survey how this principle—and the notion of an informational universe—intersects with philosophical interpretations of time: from the eternalist block universe view of an unchanging 4D spacetime, to informational realism which posits information as the substrate of existence. Against this backdrop, we introduce Existential Realism (ER), a two-tier ontology distinguishing transient existence from enduring reality. We argue that ER’s framework provides a novel lens for these questions. In ER, the present “now” is like a projection of an underlying informational reality; black holes then appear as ontological cracks where that projection falters, raising profound questions about time, causality, and hidden order. We show how ER’s emphasis on an evolving present and an informationally rich reality can reframe puzzles such as the black hole information paradox and the nature of temporal entropy. This work is intended as a frontier-level exploration: it sketches a consonance between cutting-edge cosmology and a new metaphysical model of time, suggesting that what we call “reality” might indeed be a projection from a deeper order of information and existence.",

          "abstract": "Background\nIn research on the mental health of migrants and refugees, the framework of pre-migration and post-migration stressors is frequently applied. The present study sought to determine which of these stressors contribute to mental health disorders among forced migrants from Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the analyses aimed to compare the prevalence of mental health disorders between these two groups and to evaluate the effectiveness of coping strategies employed. The study also intended to broaden the understanding of the predictors of mental health outcomes in distinct groups of forced migrants.\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted using the Computer-Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) technique. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling, with invitations disseminated via social media platforms (Telegram, Facebook) targeting Ukrainians residing in Russia. The sample comprised N=200 Ukrainian and N=164 Russian respondents. Data collection took place in the first quarter of 2025, corresponding to the third year of the Russia–Ukraine war. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-10 scales, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors significantly associated with mental health indicators.\nResults\nUkrainian migrants exhibited significantly higher rates of anxiety, depression, and stress (45%, 56%, 20.76 ± 5.9) compared with Russian migrants (37%, 39%, 18.79 ± 2.92). Notable differences in coping strategies were also observed: Ukrainian female migrants more frequently employed emotion-focused and resignation strategies, whereas Russian migrants tended to use problem-focused strategies. Among Ukrainians, significant predictors of poorer mental health included negative attitudes from the host population, relocation during the stay, higher educational attainment, and the use of emotion-focused or avoidance coping strategies. For Russian migrants, poorer mental health was associated with lower self-rated quality of life, employment incongruent with qualifications, negative attitudes from the host population, and emotion-focused or avoidance coping strategies.\nConclusions\nIn the context of prolonged residence in a host country, post-migration stressors and dysfunctional coping strategies appear to be the primary risk factors for mental health disorders among forced migrants.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) research has long debated whether its storage operates via discrete slots or distributed resources. However, emerging neuroscientific evidence suggests that neither account alone fully captures the complexity of WM function. Here, I propose a context-content hierarchical framework that unifies these views. A capacity-limited “context” system maintains discrete spatiotemporal pointers that individuate and prioritize items, while a precision-limited “content” system encodes detailed sensory information in modality-specific population codes whose fidelity varies with task demands. These systems interact through predictive top-down feedback and rhythmic coordination to support “holographic” reconstruction, in which a low-dimensional pointer selectively reinstates high-dimensional content on demand. This architecture explains how stable capacity limits can coexist with graded precision, activity-silent states, and rapid cue-driven reinstatement, and clarifies when contextual retrieval protects performance from interference. The framework yields clear experimental predictions and motivates computational models in which pointer indexing is coupled to sensory reconstruction. By integrating discrete control signals with continuous sensory representations, the context–content framework reconceptualizes WM as a dynamic, generative system that balances sparse indexing with on-demand reconstruction to guide adaptive behavior.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, contextual pointers, sensory recruitment, discrete slots, continuous resources",

          "authors": "Alexia Galati; Rick Dale; Camila Alviar; Moreno Coco",
          "abstract": "Collaborative task performance is assumed to benefit from interpersonal coordination of behaviors between interacting individuals. Prominent views of language use and social behavior, including the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM; Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004), endorse this idea by building on tasks that require partners to monitor each other’s perspective (e.g., route planning) and positing that behavioral alignment enables task partners to converge conceptually. However, the role of alignment in tasks requiring complementarity (e.g., a “divide and conquer” strategy during joint visual search) has yet to be explored. We examine this question directly by manipulating task goals (route planning vs. visual search) as forty dyads work with ten trials involving subway maps while their eye movements and speech were co-registered. In five trials, dyads planned a route from an origin to a destination (route planning); in another five trials, they searched for landmarks sharing some feature (visual search). We used Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to examine the temporal relationships between partners' eye fixations and word sequences, generating measures that reveal both similarity and other dynamic relationships. Dyads exhibited more gaze alignment in route planning than visual search across a range of CRQA metrics. When examining the temporal evolution of gaze alignment, we found it to vary across the trial substantially, and its increase influenced accuracy differently over time across the two tasks. Specifically, in visual search, higher increases in alignment at the end of the trial were associated with accurate performance. When we turned to speech data, we found that dyads exhibited longer and more entropic word sequences in route planning but had lower overall word recurrence in that task. This finding suggests that the two modalities organize in a compensatory fashion to optimize distinct task goals.  We suggest that these results support a theoretical framework that is more general than IAM yet has interactive alignment as an emergent consequence of how participants adapt to tasks. This framework emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of coordination strategies based on task demands. Altogether, task goals constrain how people coordinate their behavior and provide insights into how collaborating partners distribute their distinctive multimodal behavior.",

La finalidad de poder expresar o transmitir un solo nucleo conceptual, desde diferentes ordenes de lenguaje, implica la posibilidad de poder transmitir un mismo concepto, adaptado y adecuado para que cualquier estructura receptora, sin importar su sistema cognitivo interno o lenguaje base para comunicarse, pueda integrar el mensaje. Lo anterior pretende abrir un espacio para que, cualquier estudiante o receptor de mensaje, sin importar su tipo de inteligencia, pueda ser incluido en procesos pedagogicos, desde la inclusion y respeto e integracion y reconocimiento a su propio modelo de procesamiento interno.\n\nPara realizar este ejercicio, se sugiere iniciar leyendo primeramente la columna \"Ejemplo de Frase\" de manera pausada y experimentar a nivel cognitivo; como interpreta el cerebro el despliegue secuencial de un mismo mensaje en nivel cuantico o 4 ordenes del lenguaje.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Delay Discounting (DD) refers to the tendency for behavioral consequences (rewards or punishers) to be devalued as they occur more remotely in the future. DD has become a fruitful model of impulsive behavior and thus there is growing interest in developing interventions that could reduce it. Delay Exposure (DE) training has shown promising results in rodents. It consists of rats pressing a lever to produce a cue stimulus for a 17.5 s interval, at the end of which a reinforcer is delivered (Renda et al., 2021). The present study aimed to address some limitations in DE research: extensive number of training sessions required (60 or more), exclusive use of group designs, and potential confounding maturation effects. Using a within-subjects design, a variation of DE and its standard control condition (Immediate Exposure-IE) were evaluated in DD of rats tested in adolescence and adulthood. All DE and IE standard aspects remained the same except that the delay cues and reinforcers were response independent due to equipment limitations that prevented the use of a third operandum. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were daily exposed to a delay-discounting task (DDT, Liley et al., 2019) until steady responding was obtained at late adolescence (starting postnatal week – PW– 14, Ghasemi et al., 2021) and early adulthood (PW 25-27). Eight of the 18 rats (Main group) continued daily DD assessment plus different experimental manipulations added to the DDT across six conditions. The remaining 10 rats were kept as a Waitlist control group (no DD assessment/treatment between PW 28-42). The first manipulation added to the DDT controlled the additional access to pellets and time spent in the operant chamber entailed in subsequent DE/IE conditions. This 60Pellets condition consisted of 1-hr pre-DDT-session response-independent access to the same number of reinforcers delivered during each session of the DE/IE manipulations (i.e., 60 pellets). The third and fifth conditions consisted of DE and IE (counterbalanced across half of the animals) with 60Pellets reversals interspersed between them (fourth and sixth conditions). Based on subjects’ performance during the first six conditions, a second control manipulation was introduced. This Wait condition entailed rats waiting in the operant chamber during the 60-min before the daily DDT session without operanda, delay cue, or pellets. All 18 rats, including waitlist, were exposed to a DDT retest during PW 43-49 (i.e., middle adulthood). Waitlist rats were then exposed to 60Pellets and DE conditions between PW 46-51. Unexpectedly, we found that exposure to the 60Pellets condition during early adulthood produced significant reductions in DD, with an average of 16 sessions needed to produce steady low DD. These rats maintained low DD levels throughout the remaining conditions of the experiment, regardless the manipulation, including DE/IE and two reversals to 60Pellets. DD of Waitlist rats did not change between early- and middle-adulthood tests separated by ~20 weeks, and not significantly decreased under 60Pellets and DE conditions. These preliminary and promising findings suggest early- but not middle-adulthood response-independent access to reinforcement reduces impulsive choice long-term with a relatively brief intervention. The specific contribution of response-independent DE/IE, extensive and repetitive DD assessment, and maturation on this effect is unclear. Further efforts aimed at reproducing these effects and identifying the processes involved are warranted.",

          "abstract": "Western educational philosophy has long emphasized the importance of first-hand observation in learning. This view, however, overlooks another important form of learning, sometimes called learning by thinking. Here, we compared three conditions: instruction using thought experiments (Thought Experiments condition), instruction using real experiments (Real Experiments condition), and no instruction (Baseline condition). A total of 100 children (MAge = 84.79 months; 43 girls; predominantly White) were assigned to the conditions. All participants completed a pre-training physics assessment, received physics instruction (Thought and Real Experiments conditions only), and completed a post-training assessment. Results showed that only children in the Real and Thought Experiments conditions improved from pre- to post-training. Critically, there was no significant difference between the two instructional methods.",
