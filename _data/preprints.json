          "abstract": "Parents/caregivers, educators, and allied health professionals are key stakeholders in supporting positive educational outcomes for autistic students. However, limited research has explored differences in their perspectives regarding the strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers to educational success for autistic students which was the aim of this study. This knowledge is important for fostering collaboration to optimally support autistic students. Participants included 133 Australians parents/caregivers (n = 64), educators (n = 37), and allied health professionals (n = 32) who completed an open-ended online survey listing their top three educational strengths, educational needs, barriers, and enablers for autistic students. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis for each of the four areas (strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers). Analysis identified that strengths included thinking and reasoning, personality, skills and talents, academic, and social. Needs included classroom accommodations, social-emotional, academic, adaptive behaviour, and mental health supports. Enablers and barriers commonly reflected the presence or absence of supports, including support networks, environmental supports, autism knowledge, and supportive attitudes. While commonalities were observed across stakeholder perspectives, significant variation both within and across stakeholder groups was observed for perceived strengths and challenges including around the importance of environmental factors, foci of social support, and academic needs. Understanding stakeholder perspectives is essential for providing multidimensional support to autistic students. Understanding can inform professional learning and support collaborative multidisciplinary teams who work with, and care for, the same individual across contexts including school, home, and therapy services.",

          "title": "A Litmus Test for Plant Consciousness: Pattern–Temporal Synergy in a Relation-First Ontology",
          "authors": "Arie Todd Greenleaf",
          "abstract": "Plant cognition has progressed from anecdote to rigor, yet the field still lacks a quantitative test for when distributed plant activity crosses into unified—perhaps conscious—processing. I introduce Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), a substrate-agnostic metric rooted in Dynergeia, a relation-first ontology that defines consciousness as reflexive coherence among five universal patterns—self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness and flux—phase-locked inside a system’s binding window (τ). Each pattern is operationalized with established signal-processing measures; their mean strength is multiplied by their mean synergy and released only if a τ-specific coherence gate is met.\nThree preregistered hypotheses anchor the study: H1 baseline PTS &gt; 0 in intact plants; H2 4 % diethyl-ether collapses PTS below threshold φ; H3 PTS rebounds on wash-out. A multispecies protocol—Mimosa pudica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Picea abies—combines 64-channel surface electrodes, glutamate-sensitive Ca²⁺ imaging and micro-optode O₂/heat-flux probes. Sliding 3 × τ windows with phase-shuffled surrogates yield z-scored PTS trajectories, adjudicated by preregistered effect-size criteria.\nBy turning decades of qualitative insight into falsifiable numbers, PTS offers plant biology a litmus test for conscious-level processing, directly challenges Integrated Information Theory and supplies a road-map for cross-kingdom comparisons—including neuromorphic silicon. Confirmatory results would shift debates on plant sentience from speculation to data; null results would equally refine what consciousness requires.",

          "authors": "Tariq Khan",
          "abstract": "Life is proposed as being more expansive in terms of reach and capability than currently understood. Aspects of life are presented suggesting it should be considered as a distributed intelligence that has established structures and designs in the realms of computation/information, memory/quantum mechanics, and even consciousness, before these realms were discovered by modern intelligent humans.  The nature of consciousness is discussed in depth, referencing specific research including advances in renormalization techniques that imply consciousness exists at a fractal critical point in the brain and that consciousness is most likely fractal and holographic and exists on a space-time boundary where consciousness and memories are stored and operate external to the human mind, analogous to cloud computing. A “grande vista” of life conceptual framework is proposed noting life’s progression of “existential leaps.”",

          "authors": "Jeremy Yeaton; Danielle Fahey; Michelle Gomez; Brielle C Stark; Julius Fridriksson; Dirk den Ouden; Gregory Hickok; William Matchin",
          "abstract": "Background: The lesion correlates of syntactic deficits in aphasia remain poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that distinct error types in expressive syntax, such as paragrammatic and agrammatic speech, may be associated with damage to different brain regions, but the specific lesion correlates of these errors have not been fully delineated.\nObjective: To identify the lesion correlates associated with distinct expressive syntactic error types in individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia, using a novel utterance-level analysis of spontaneous speech errors.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech samples from individuals with chronic aphasia, categorizing errors into hierarchical (paragrammatic-like) and linearization (agrammatic-like) errors. Lesion-symptom mapping was conducted to identify brain regions associated with these error types. The analysis was based on a two-stage model of sentence production, with hierarchical processing and linearization analyzed as distinct stages.\nResults: Lesion clusters in the medial superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were associated with hierarchical errors, while large frontal lesions, including those in the inferior and middle frontal lobe, were associated with linearization errors. These results provide support for a two-stage model of syntactic encoding, with distinct neural correlates for hierarchical and linearization processes. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest a dichotomy of the lesion basis for syntactic deficits in aphasia, suggesting that distinct brain regions contribute to different stages of syntactic encoding. Hierarchical processing seems to be supported by posterior temporal-parietal regions, while linearization seems to be supported by frontal regions. These results suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia should take into account the existence of distinct syntactic production deficits resulting from different patterns of brain damage.",

          "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have the potential to expand treatment access for anxiety but often have low user engagement. The present study analyzed differences in psychosocial outcomes for different behavioral engagement patterns in a free web-based cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) program. CBM-I is designed to shift interpretation biases common in anxiety by providing practice thinking about emotionally ambiguous situations in less threatening ways. Using data from 697 anxious community adults undergoing five weekly sessions of CBM-I in a clinical trial, we extracted program use markers based on task completion rate and time spent on training and assessment tasks. After using an exploratory cluster analysis of these markers to create two engagement groups (whose patterns ended up reflecting generally more vs. less time spent across tasks), we used multilevel models to test for group differences in interpretation bias and anxiety outcomes. Unexpectedly, engagement group did not significantly predict differential change in positive interpretation bias or anxiety. Further, participants who generally spent less time on the program (including both training and assessment tasks) improved in negative interpretation bias (on one of two measures) significantly more during the training phase than those who spent more time (and post hoc tests found were significantly older and slightly less educated). However, participants who generally spent less time had a significant loss in training gains for negative bias (on both measures) by 2-month follow-up. Findings highlight the challenge of interpreting time spent as a marker of engagement and the need to consider cognitive and affective markers of engagement in addition to behavioral markers. Further understanding engagement patterns holds promise for improving DMHIs for anxiety.",

In this article, several agendas for future research are proposed that explicitly consider people’s diverse interactions with various decision-support and artificial intelligence systems in their daily lives. Such primarily algorithm-centric research will help to gain insights into a more fine-grained Theory of Machine that also distinguishes between different levels of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and explainability.

          "abstract": "Dissociation is increasingly recognized as a transdiagnostic process implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety, depression, and psychosis. However, causal evidence for mechanisms underpinning dissociation remains scarce, particularly in youth. Nine NHS patients (aged 16 to 23) participated three multiple baseline single case experimental design (SCED) studies. Every participant received four sessions of individual CBT, with each SCED addressing a different hypothesised mechanism: cognitive appraisals of dissociation, perseverative thinking, and affect intolerance. Results indicated successful targeting of cognitive appraisals, and partial success in targeting perseverative thinking and affect intolerance. They support cognitive appraisals, and partially support affect intolerance, as causal mechanisms in youth transdiagnostic dissociation. Any causal effect of perseverative thinking was better accounted for by reduced cognitive appraisals in this SCED. Across participants, low phase stability of the target measures limited inference, but these findings advance a mechanistic understanding of youth dissociation and inform treatment development.",

This longitudinal study of 387 mid-adolescents in Germany (Mage(SD) = 13.04 (0.85) years, 46% female, 1.8% non-binary) tested whether heritage cultural identity exploration – adapted from U.S.-based ethnic-racial identity frameworks to the German context - at T1 (pre-intervention) and participation in an identity-focused intervention each predict increased critical reflection at T2 (post-intervention), in turn predicting increased critical interpersonal action at T3 (follow-up). Path analyses revealed exploration at T1 predicted higher reflection at T2, while the intervention promoted exploration and action but not reflection at T2. No significant link emerged between reflection at T2 and action at T3. Findings highlight the role of heritage cultural identity exploration in youth’ critical consciousness development, and suggest identity based interventions can support its development.",

          "abstract": "Community mobilisation efforts to prevent violence against women (VAW) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are often premised on the idea that raising awareness of structural gender inequality motivates collective action. Experimental evidence for this assumption in LMICs remains scarce. We conducted a randomized field experiment with 720 women in informal settlements in Mumbai, India, embedded within the larger SNEHA-TARA trial of community mobilisation, which combined regular local group meetings of women, men, and adolescents with volunteer training over a three-to-four-year period. In our field experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three 30-45 minutes reflective sessions: on structural injustice, types of violence (control 1), or child nutrition (control 2). In the session on structural injustice, we used a game to stimulate discussion and reflection on gender inequality and its connection to VAW. We measured participant performance of three real-time collective action behaviours addressing VAW: contribution of a face photo to a poster campaign, contribution of a hand photo to the same campaign, or discussing VAW with a neighbour. Despite increasing recognition of gender inequality as a cause of VAW, the structural injustice session had no statistically significant impact on collective action relative to controls. By contrast, participation in NGO-led groups and volunteering was strongly associated with action, mediated by perceived efficacy and activist identity. Our findings challenge the assumption that awareness of injustice alone is sufficient to spark collective action and suggest the importance of fostering community identity and self-efficacy in mobilisation programmes. In contexts of entrenched patriarchy and normalisation of VAW, merely recognising injustice may be insufficient to catalyse collective action.",

          "abstract": "This study focuses on content validity procedures in music psychology. We set out to develop an instrument to measure a recent theory concerning emotional episodes (Eerola et al., 2024) related to music and their associated constructs. To establish this instrument, we: (1) operationalised the theory; (2) proposed and adapted a set of items to represent the relevant constructs; (3) analysed and reduced the item pool; (4) assessed the content validity of the items using subject matter experts; and (5) refined and reassessed the item pool based on expert feedback. In Step 1, we identified 25 sub-constructs. In Step 2, these were represented by an initial pool of 495 items, of which 290 were adapted from existing instruments. Step 3 involved eliminating 159 semantically similar items. In Step 4, twelve subject matter experts in music and emotion evaluated a sample of 366 items for relevance, providing suggestions for reclassification and identifying missing content. Expert agreement was used to determine item retention. Based on their feedback, a revised pool of 302 items underwent a second round of expert review. This process resulted in a set of 168 relevant items and 115 of the most representative items encompassing the emotional episodes, the descriptive schemes, and the contextual constructs across 23 sub-constructs. Together, relevant and representative scores indicate the quality of the content but future psychometric processes will need to test construct validity. We conclude by discussing the content validity of the constructs and frame a modular scheme that implements the underlying theoretical framework.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

          "title": "My Harmonic Cognitive OS: Toward an Innovative Cognitive Architecture Integrating Viewpoint, Judgment, and Perception",
          "authors": "Shinnosuke Shimizu",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel cognitive framework called “My Harmonic Cognitive OS,” which models human cognition as a structured interaction among three core layers: viewpoint filters (Fi, Fe, Te, Ti), judgment structures (i/e), and perceptual styles—namely the four cognitive functions Si, Se, Ni, and Ne. Each perceptual function is defined as follows: Si (Introverted Sensing) as internal memory reference, Se (Extraverted Sensing) as immediate sensory response, Ni (Introverted Intuition) as convergence into future insight, and Ne (Extraverted Intuition) as divergent associative idea generation. These are further structured into directional causal pairs: \nSi–Ne          &lt;  expansive\nand Se–Ni  &gt;  convergent,   \n forming the perceptual OS of this model. By redefining traditional MBTI components into a dynamic, process-oriented architecture, this model enables precise mapping of individual cognitive processes. The framework is not only theoretically coherent but also demonstrates high applicability in education, AI development, and human resource management. It emphasizes cognitive diversity, ethical decision-making, and the capacity for meta-cognition, ultimately aiming to foster what is termed a “multi-perspective cognitive being.” The paper also outlines practical implementations and potential economic impacts, positioning this OS-based structure as a foundational paradigm for the next generation of cognitive science and applied artificial intelligence.",

If Suzy forgets sunscreen and gets sunburned, the absence of sunscreen caused Suzy’s sunburn, but the sun burned her skin. We tested 691 children and 150 adults. Four- year-old children mapped “caused” to distal causes and “broke” to proximal causes (Experiment 1). Though four-year-old children didn’t map “caused” to absences until later (Experiment 2), they already referred to absences when asked “why” an outcome occurred (Experiment 3).

          "abstract": "Background\nFirst-line treatments for depression – psychotherapy and antidepressant medications – are equally effective on average, but individual response varies widely. Predicting which treatment will work best for a given patient is a challenge and requires a comprehensive yet feasible assessment of baseline characteristics. This paper describes the development of a baseline battery for a precision treatment trial designed to guide optimal treatment allocation for adults with depression in primary care in India.\nMethods\nWe used a stepwise multimethod approach to develop the battery. We updated a prior review to identify constructs associated with differential treatment response, conducted an expert survey (220 invited; 80 responses) to refine the list, and selected measurement tools based on brevity, validity, and scalability. We then applied semantic analysis to identify redundancies, piloted the battery with 200 primary care patients, and used exploratory factor analysis and machine learning to optimize item selection.\nResults\nThe final battery included 68 constructs covering clinical, psychological, cognitive, socioeconomic, and biological domains across multiple assessment modalities (questionnaires, neurocognitive tasks, and biological markers). Pilot testing revealed comprehension challenges, participant fatigue, and low-variability items. Statistical techniques reduced the total items by over 25% while retaining coverage of all targeted constructs. This reduced administration time from more than three hours to approximately two.\nConclusion\nThe OptimizeD battery provides a novel, scalable framework for identifying personalized treatment strategies in primary care. The trial will evaluate which variables best predict optimal treatment assignment, informing future integration of predictive tools into routine care in low-resource settings.",

If Suzy forgets sunscreen and gets sunburned, the absence of sunscreen caused Suzy’s sunburn, but the sun burned her skin. We tested 691 children and 150 adults. Four- year-old children mapped “caused” to distal causes and “broke” to proximal causes (Experiment 1). Though four-year-old children didn’t map “caused” to absences until later (Experiment 2), they already referred to absences when asked “why” an outcome occurred (Experiment 3).

          "abstract": "Real-world recognition requires our memory system to accommodate perceptual changes that \noccur after encoding; for example, eyewitnesses must recognize perpetrators across changes in \nappearance. However, it is not clear how this flexible recognition ability can be improved: \nStandard strategies such as increasing encoding duration are not only ineffective, but can in fact \nbe detrimental for recognizing people across appearance changes. Given the effectiveness of \nvisual imagery in creating and modifying memory representations, we examined whether \ncounterfactual visual imagery could be used to manipulate flexible recognition by simulating an \nincrease in encoding-retrieval similarity. Across two experiments, participants (n=317) encoded \nfaces with neutral expressions and were cued to imagine the faces with either happy or angry \nexpressions. During later retrieval, participants saw lineups of old and new faces with either \nhappy or angry expressions, and selected the old face and provided recognition confidence. \nOld/new recognition discriminability and confidence were higher when a face’s expression at \nretrieval matched the expression that it was imagined in during encoding (i.e., congruent \nimagery); interestingly, however, there was Bayesian evidence for no benefit of imagery \ncongruence for face-choice accuracy. Moreover, congruent imagery improved recognition for old \narrays irrespective of whether participants correctly selected the old face, suggesting that the \nimagery manipulation increased a diffuse sense of recognition without increasing the ability to \nattribute that sense of recognition to a specific stimulus. Together, these findings indicate that \nvisual imagery can directionally manipulate recognition for changed faces, and produces a novel \ndissociation between old/new recognition and forced-choice accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Under multi-talker listening conditions, listeners appear to rapidly accommodate variability in speaker productions. However, evidence indicates that this trial-to-trial accommodation incurs a processing cost and is amplified by accent differences among talkers. The present study investigated how individual listener differences in working memory capacity and attentional control may predict the degree of processing costs (as measured by response time and accuracy) incurred by trial-to-trial switches in English talkers of first language (L1) American accent and second language (L2) Mandarin Chinese accent. Listeners completed a dual-task experiment with a primary listening task and secondary non-linguistic task as well as measures of working memory capacity (the Word Auditory Recognition and Recall Measure) and attentional control (the Trail Making Test and a Stroop Test). Results indicated that, on trials with a talker switch, listeners with smaller working memory capacities were slower to respond to the secondary task and had poorer recognition accuracy for the primary task. The measures of attentional control did not predict switching costs, but Stroop test scores did interact with the accent manipulation such that listeners with better attentional control had better overall recognition accuracy for L2 accent. Working memory capacity, on the other hand, did not predict differences in recognition accuracy between the L1 and L2 accent conditions. We conclude that working memory plays a critical role in supporting rapid (trial-to-trial) talker accommodation. Attentional control appears to support processing of L2 accent more generally, but may not be critical for rapid accommodation.",

Yet the mechanisms that support vigilance of informants' motivations remain poorly-understood. For instance, how do people combine informants' incentives and intentions when evaluating testimony---through rational inference, or simple heuristics? To answer such questions, here we develop a rational model of vigilance and test its predictions in two pre-registered online experiments with participants in the U.S (Ns = 626, 555). Across financial, real estate, and medical decision scenarios, participants' inferences closely tracked our model’s predictions: participants discounted advice when selfish speakers benefited from manipulating them, and this discounting was attenuated by perceived benevolence. When pay-offs were shared, incentives increased trust, as our rational model---but not simple heuristics---predict. Our rational analysis thus establishes a formal framework for vigilance of motivations that also sheds light on phenomena from persuasion to polarization.",

          "authors": "Manuel Becker; Marie Jakob; Karl Christoph Klauer",
          "abstract": "Ever since Zajonc proposed that preferences need no inferences, psychologists have debated whether evaluations can be conceptualized and measured independently of co-activated semantic content. One prominent arena for this debate has been the Evaluative Priming Task, which tracks the effects of conflicting or congruent evaluative relationships between stimuli. Surprisingly, two prior lines of research found that effects of evaluative congruency in the task do not emerge in the absence of additional semantic relationships. This not only conflicts with other findings, but also challenges dominant theoretical accounts of the task, whose assumptions entail that congruency effects should arise irrespectively. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns=81, 85), we re-examine these two lines of research and show that when vulnerabilities in the original experimental and analytical designs are rectified, evaluative congruency effects do reliably occur (even in the absence of strong semantic relationships). A third study (N=80), that implements strong semantic relationships under especially controlled conditions, also yields reliable congruency effects. In Study 4 (N=81), the trials with low semantic relatedness from the first three studies are combined, replicating consistent and reliable, but small congruency effects. Our results thereby strengthen models that accommodate an independent role of evaluations, and we illustrate how these models might be modified to account for an augmenting influence of semantic relatedness. Currently, in domains for which evaluations and their measurement are integral (like the measurement of race-based evaluations, consumer or health behavior), the pronounced and potentially biasing effects of semantic relatedness remain largely unrecognized as a serious confound.",

          "abstract": "Time series data are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a powerful model for capturing psychological processes. In the HMM, time series are modeled with a process that switches between a number of hidden (i.e., latent) states, each associated with a different response distribution. By extending the HMM to the multilevel framework, we obtain better estimates of person-specific models under standard assumptions; and we get a model for heterogeneity across persons, which allow one to distinguish between population heterogeneity and sampling variation. Despite their potential, multilevel HMMs are currently not widely used to estimate psychological time series. A key reason is that the methodology has not been thoroughly evaluated in this context. In this paper, we address this issue. We evaluate model selection and estimation performance in an extensive simulation study, using scenarios typical for psychological time series research designs and varying the level of state separation and the number of states, modeled variables, persons, and time-series length. Our numerical evaluation results show that researchers can expect the multilevel HMM to perform well when persons are expected to switch between multiple states. Finally, we provide empirically based recommendations, and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "abstract": "Background. Bowlby’s concept of attachment as a biobehavioral proximity-regulating system providing infants with confidence in protection and support for exploration has been expanded to include early security’s legacy for socialization processes. We report a continued programmatic effort to replicate our model of security as a potent catalyst moderating common maladaptive longitudinal cascades from early child difficulty to increased parental power assertion to externalizing developmental outcomes. We elucidate multifinality of sequelae that can unfold from early child difficulty. Our moderated mediation model proposes that such cascades occur only in parent-child dyads with histories of insecure attachment in infancy; early security buffers those risks. Methods. Children and Parents Study (CAPS) included 200 community mothers, fathers, and children from the U.S. Midwest. At 16 months (N = 194, 93 girls), we observed children’s early difficulty (anger dysregulation), and security with each parent in Strange Situation Paradigm. At 38 months (age 3, N = 175, 86 girls), we observed parents’ power-assertive control. At 52 months (age 4.5, N = 177, 86 girls), we observed children’s poor self-regulation and violations of conduct rules and obtained parents’ reports of children’s disruptive behavior. Results. For mothers and children, the indirect effects of early anger dysregulation at 16 months on all three outcomes at age 4.5, mediated via increased power assertion at age 3, were present only in insecure dyads, as reflected in significant moderated mediation. Comprehensive analysis that integrated all three outcomes further supported the robust moderating effect of early security for the entire developmental path from anger dysregulation to power assertion to child outcomes, and for each segment of that path. There were no findings for fathers. Conclusions. We discuss critical importance – and challenges – of replicating models of complex longitudinal cascades when elucidating multifinality through the lens unique to developmental psychology and psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study investigated mental health, sleep, coping, and psychological state among Ukrainians during wartime, comparing those who remained in Ukraine and those who left. It aimed to identify key psychological predictors to inform targeted interventions during prolonged crises.\nMethods: Pearson’s correlation assessed associations between mental health and psychological factors. One-way ANOVA examined differences by mental health level, MANOVA compared groups by location, and multiple regression identified key predictors.\nResults: Mental health among Ukrainians was relatively low: 46.6% reported low levels. Those abroad showed greater tolerance of uncertainty (M = 65.91 vs. 64.75) and used more task-oriented coping (M = 59.11 vs. 54.97) than those in Ukraine. Mental health negatively correlated with anxiety (r = -0.604), frustration (r = -0.612), rigidity (r = -0.500), and  emotion-oriented  coping (r = -0.524), insomnia (r = -0.367), and positively with task-oriented coping (r = 0.357) and stress resilience (r = -0.396). Key predictors included avoidance (β = 0.251) and stress resilience (β = -0.183) as positive, and frustration (β = -0.188), emotion-oriented coping (β = -0.199), and anxiety (β = -0.194) as negative. Psychological states varied by mental health level: those with low mental health reported the highest anxiety, frustration, aggressiveness, rigidity, insomnia, and lowest resilience. Their coping was dominated by emotion-oriented strategies.\nConclusions: With 46.6% of Ukrainians showing low mental health and only 21.6% reporting high mental health, these findings highlight the urgent need for differentiated psychological support during wartime.",

          "abstract": "Daily negativity in the news can cause people to experience negative affect, negatively affects mental wellbeing, and, in response, people (temporarily) avoid the news. Others, however, seem to handle recurring news negativity better. We theorize that the way people regulate emotional responses to the news could help explain the different patterns of coping with the news. We do this by introducing the emotion regulation literature from psychology in the political communication literature. We investigate if, and to what extent, emotion regulation in response to news use is associated with negative affect, mental wellbeing, and news use frequency. In a preregistered longitudinal intensive diary study in a diverse sample from Western Europe, we find that individuals rely on various emotion regulation strategies to cope with news negativity. We find that people use cognitive reappraisal and selective attention to successfully down-regulate negative emotions arising from news use. On the other hand, no effects of the use of distraction or suppression on affect, wellbeing, or news use frequency were found. Thus, the study offers first evidence that some emotion regulation strategies could be one determinant in explaining why people are affected differently by the news. Our study sets the stage for a research agenda in political communication research that studies the role of emotion regulation strategies in understanding differential media effects.",

This study aimed to develop and validate the Introspective Predictive Processing Inventory (IPPI), a self-report measure assessing predictive processing characteristics and their subjective consequences in everyday life. Through community-led, participatory research, we developed a 65-item pilot version and employed a five-stage validation approach across three samples (N = 790). We used network-based item optimization, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, measurement invariance testing, and convergent validity assessment. Network optimization reduced the scale to 18 items while maintaining excellent reliability and improved discriminative power. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a stable two-factor structure: \"Prediction Integration and Interpretation\" and \"Prediction Error Sensitivity and Stability Needs\". The IPPI demonstrated exceptional discriminative validity (AUC &gt; 0.97), strong convergent validity with established measures, measurement invariance across groups, and independence from general cognitive abilities.

This study sought to clarify how specific these biases are in health anxiety and how other potential causal processes, like repetitive negative thinking (RNT), are associated with interpretation biases and health anxiety. Participants from the community (N = 124) with at least mildly elevated levels of health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory scores ≥ 18) completed a self-report questionnaire assessing repetitive negative thinking (RNT), as well as an interpretation bias task based on the Word Sentence Association paradigm. Task outcomes were computationally modelled using drift diffusion modeling and interpretation bias was operationalized as drift rate, i.e., the rate of evidence accumulation to decide between two choices (in this case, the emotional interpretation or the benign interpretation). Results showed that individuals with health anxiety exhibit interpretation biases specific to health-threatening stimuli but not general anxiety, dysphoric, or positive stimuli. In addition, RNT partially explained the association between interpretation biases for health anxiety-related stimuli and health anxiety symptom severity. Our work suggests health anxiety-specific interpretation biases and repetitive negative thinking may be important targets for intervention, whether through psychotherapy or computerized interventions (e.g., cognitive bias modification).",

We posit that perception, whether chromatic or achromatic, is a functionally rich tool shaped by natural selection for survival-based differentiation. The paper rejects a strict physical/non-physical dichotomy for subjective experience, instead framing qualia as emergent properties of biological systems, citing the example of non-human sensory worlds like the ultraviolet perception of bees. A speculative model for the genesis of qualia is proposed, rooted in genetic mutation—influenced by environmental mutagens and quantum phenomena—and refined by natural selection. This evolutionary depth, it is argued, justifies the \"richness\" of subjective experience. Ultimately, this paper calls for epistemic humility, viewing consciousness not as a veridical reality viewer but as a species-specific survival interface, and suggests that perception and qualia are best understood through the lens of evolution and genetics rather than through conceptually flawed philosophical postulates.",

Sequential collaboration has recently been examined for numerical judgment aggregation for which it produces highly accurate information. However, the impact of additional information about previous contributors on subsequent judgments remains unclear. Thus, Experiments 1A (N=85), 1B (N=186), and 1C (N=302) examined the effect of presented expertise, gender, and group membership of the previous participant, respectively, on participants' behavior in sequential collaboration. We did not find a significant effect of any of the presented features on change probability or change magnitude. In Experiments 2 (N=538) and 3 (N=878), we focused on previous participants' expertise as a highly relevant presented feature. We did not find an effect of previous participants' expertise in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 revealed significant but small effects below the smallest effect size of interest. Overall, these findings suggest that sequential collaboration shows some robustness against simple social influences highlighting its potential as a method for judgment aggregation. This study adds to the understanding of how collaborative processes can be optimized for accuracy and reliability. For collaborative projects these results further emphasize that sequential collaboration is a successful and bias-preventing way of collaboration.",

We propose that the principal bundle, induced by a symmetry group $G$ acting on a neural network's state space, is the essential mathematical object that provides a complete and rigorous characterization of this geometric structure. The core mathematical principle is that, for a $G$-equivariant network, its state space partitions into a quotient space $Q$ and orbits induced by the group $G$. This framework reveals a three-level hierarchy for characterizing qualia. First, the choice of the symmetry group $G$ itself defines the fundamental nature of the qualia modality (e.g., vision versus audition). Second, we identify a qualia signature with a point in the quotient space $Q$ (e.g., perceiving the signature ``cat''), representing the invariant identity of a percept. Third, we identify a qualia attribute with a position on a specific orbit (e.g., the cat's location), representing its continuous variations. This framework uncovers a powerful duality: the geometry of the orbits is rigid, inheriting the structure of the group $G$, which explains the stable relational structure of qualia attributes. In contrast, the geometry of the quotient space is plastic, allowing the relationships between qualia signatures to be shaped by learning. This geometric hierarchy provides a unified language for explaining the structure of perceptual experience. Furthermore, our framework generates empirical predictions and a clear research strategy for characterizing qualia, offering a path to a deeper scientific understanding of subjective experience.",

          "abstract": "There is a debate about statistical models for analyzing longitudinal data. Models based on cross-lagged effects may give false positive results under certain conditions. We have proposed a triangulation method where cross-lagged effects of a predictor (X) on a subsequent score on an outcome (Y2) when adjusting for a prior score (Y1) are scrutinized by estimating a reversed effect of X on Y1 when adjusting for Y2 and an effect of X on the Y2-Y1 difference. Lucas et al. conducted simulations and reported that our triangulation method may flag genuine causal effects of X on Y2 when adjusting for Y1 as spurious and concluded that the triangulation method is not valid. Here we respond to this criticism. We show that the simulations and conclusions by Lucas et al. are focused on the ability of the test to avoid type II errors. Here we complement this view with a discussion about type I errors. Further, we show that the criticism by Lucas et al. appears to be founded on an assumption that causality is best viewed as an adjusted effect of X on the Y2-Y1 difference. We argue that it may often be better to view causality as a crude (i.e., unadjusted) effect of X on the Y2-Y1 difference. Therefore, we continue to claim that our triangulation method may be a useful tool to scrutinize causal claims based on adjusted cross-lagged effects.",

We investigated its neural correlates and sources of variability using harmonized functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 2,199 individuals across nine countries, including 1,888 healthy individuals and 311 with anxiety-related or depressive disorders. Using mega-analysis and normative modelling, we show that fear conditioning consistently engages brain regions within the \"central autonomic–interoceptive\" or \"salience\" network. Several task variables strongly modulate activity in these regions, contributing to variability in neural responses. Additionally, brain activation patterns differ between healthy individuals and those with anxiety-related or depressive disorders, with distinct profiles characterizing specific disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. While the neural correlates of fear conditioning are highly generalizable at the population level, variability arises from differences in task design and clinical status, highlighting the importance of methodological diversity in capturing fear learning mechanisms.",

Participants first described their main climate change reservation. The most prevalent were the belief that climate change has natural causes (15%), feeling overwhelmed by the problem (10%), and concerns about the economic consequences of climate policies (8%). Participants were then randomized to (1) have a conversation with a Large Language Model (LLM) that was given the goal of addressing their climate reservations, (2) discuss an irrelevant topic with the LLM (i.e., control), or (3) receive static information about the scientific consensus around climate change (i.e., “standard-of-care”). The LLM treatment significantly and substantially reduced participants’ conviction in their specific reservations, while consensus messaging did not. Both treatments had significant, albeit small, effects on general pro-climate beliefs/attitudes. Critically, however, the LLM treatment was significantly more effective - particularly for increasing willingness to make sacrifices to address climate change and donations to a pro-climate charity. The LLM primarily presented facts, evoked positive emotions, reduced psychological distance, and fostered motivation to act. It rarely invoked values or ingroup sources, and when it did, their use was associated with reduced belief change. The treatment substantially reduced Republicans’ reservations (although  less than for Independents or Democrats), and roughly 35% to 40% of the LLM treatment effect persisted after one month. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to reach many climate skeptical or hesitant people with the right facts and evidence.",

These functions, such as $R(t) = A/(1 + kt)$ and $R(t) = At/(B + t)$, outperform exponential and sigmoid models in satisfying energy-limited, information-delayed, and concave dynamics. Empirical examples include Michaelis–Menten kinetics, neural gain modulation, and behavioral delay discounting.

While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs.

          "abstract": "Many authors agree that disfluencies are a byproduct of speech encoding difficulties. However, it is unclear which phenomena specifically reflect word form retrieval difficulties, such as those commonly observed in typical aging and tip-of-the-tongue states. This retrospective descriptive study examined the relationship between word-form retrieval difficulties and speech disfluencies in typically aging older adults, using the framework of the Transmission Deficit Hypothesis. Twenty-five native Dutch-speaking adults aged 60 to 73 completed a connected speech network task in which lexical frequency (high vs. low) was manipulated. Disfluencies occurring during picture naming were annotated and analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Lexical frequency did not significantly influence the overall likelihood of disfluency production. However, low-frequency words were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of producing semantic paraphasias and semantically related answers and a reduced likelihood of additions. Correlational analyses further revealed that participants with higher vocabulary scores produced fewer semantic disfluencies, indicating a protective role of lexical knowledge in aging. The findings underscore the importance of differentiating disfluency types and considering task-specific characteristics when investigating language production in older adults. By focusing on connected speech and isolating word-form retrieval demands, this study contributes to a more nuanced and refined understanding of age-related disfluency patterns. Implications are discussed in relation to “good-enough language production”, inhibitory control mechanisms, and the methodological challenges of capturing language production difficulties in cognitively demanding but ecologically valid tasks and contexts.",

The distinction between anthropogenic and biogenic approaches serves as a useful framework for categorizing the two primary starting points in cognitive research. Based on these classifications, it becomes evident that comparative cognition research incorporates elements of both approaches. Upon reviewing empirical research of comparative cognition, it can be observed that comparative cognition tends to be biased towards the anthropogenic approach. While we do not advocate for abandoning the anthropogenic approach, we propose that embracing the biogenic approach offers substantial advantages. These advantages include not only practical benefits such as increased empirical research productivity but also significant intellectual gains. Although the biogenic approach does not imply a commitment to a specific philosophy, it shares a high degree of affinity with embodied cognition. We, thus, further suggest that the biogenic approach to comparative cognition can effectively align with the recent trends in Ecological Psychology and Enactivism. Such a shift in approach has the potential to reshape the formulation of research questions and influence the underlying ontological commitments driving the research.",

          "authors": "Abigail Fiske; Lauren Emberson",
          "abstract": "There is increasing interest in task-based functional connectivity analyses to examine the emergence of functional networks during specific cognitive states starting early in development (e.g., infancy). However, studying functional connectivity in infants presents unique methodological challenges. Task-based neuroimaging studies must be carefully designed to collect sufficient high-quality data, while remaining sensitive to infants’ developing motor and cognitive abilities. This limits the feasibility of certain analysis techniques, particularly those requiring a high number of trials or strict adherence to contiguous trial structures. This study aims to expand established analysis approaches for infant functional connectivity studies by reanalysing an existing fNIRS dataset with a recognised signature of task-based functional connectivity. We assess the feasibility of moving away from conventional analyses that require several contiguous trials per condition - a requirement that is often impractical in infant studies. Instead, we explore whether background functional connectivity (BGFC) analyses, which utilises the residual neural response (i.e., what remains after removing task-evoked responses), can offer a more flexible and scalable approach. To do so, we evaluate three analytic strategies: (1) downsampling, which systematically reduces the number of trials included to assess how many are necessary for well-powered analyses; (2) shuffling, which randomly reorders trial-level residuals within conditions to test whether connectivity patterns are driven by trial sequence; and (3) averaging single-trial residuals, which examines whether connectivity measures can be meaningfully extracted from individual trial residuals. Our findings indicate that downsampling was informative about the number of trials needed for well-powered analyses and the timing of the functional connectivity effect. Removing trials from the start of the block was not viable, but this approach was viable when trials were removed from the end. The shuffling approach was not viable, suggesting that trial order may be important for capturing meaningful connectivity patterns. Single-trial residual analyses revealed that while connectivity can be examined toward the level of individual trials, averaging trial-level residuals before performing connectivity analyses produced more robust and interpretable results. These findings provide new insights into the methodological feasibility of background functional connectivity analyses for infant fNIRS data. By demonstrating that downsampling and averaged single-trial connectivity approaches are viable, our study highlights ways to enhance the accessibility and flexibility of task-based functional connectivity studies in infancy. These results have important implications for task design, as they suggest that strict adherence to contiguous trial structures may not be necessary, allowing researchers to design more adaptable and infant-friendly paradigms. Overall, this work contributes to advancing the methodological toolkit for studying functional brain networks in early development.",

This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and emotional-processing difficulties, coping strategies, resilience, and cognitive functioning in individuals with moderate-severe TBI.\n\nMethod: Data from 106 individuals with moderate-severe TBI were analyzed. Suicidal ideation and emotional distress were assessed using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Participants also completed measures of emotional lability and detachment (Comprehensive Assessment of Traits Relevant to Personality Disorders [CAT-PD]), coping (Coping Scale for Adults), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and cognitive functioning, including subjective (CAT-PD, Brief Rating of Executive Function) and objective measures (Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone). Spearman’s correlations and structural equation modeling were used to examine psychological and cognitive correlates of suicidal ideation.\n\nResults: Suicidal ideation was positively associated with emotional lability, emotional detachment, non-productive coping, and self-reported cognitive problems, and negatively associated with resilience. Structural equation models indicated that emotional distress accounted for 76–100% of these associations. Conversely, suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with adaptive coping or objective cognitive performance.\n\nConclusions: Emotional processing, non-productive coping strategies, low resilience, and self-reported cognitive problems are linked to suicidal ideation in individuals with moderate-severe TBI, primarily through their associations with emotional distress. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and its underlying contributors in suicide prevention for this population.",

This paper synthesizes findings from 47 studies to demonstrate how principles from information bottleneck theory and network controllability metrics can explain the phenomenon of neurodivergent specialization. The characteristic ‘spiky profiles’ commonly observed in ADHD, autism, aphantasia, and related conditions reflect neural architectures optimized for different computational trade-offs, such as balancing prediction accuracy, feedback integration, and energy efficiency (Kleinman et al., 2024; Millidge et al., 2024). Meta-analytic evidence supports strengths-based interventions, revealing notable effect sizes for social engagement (g=0.65), cognitive development (g=0.48), and language acquisition (g=0.32).

Presumably, this is due to the spontaneous and effortless activation of group versus individual-specific information. Consistent with the cognitive miser metaphor, this advantage should be exacerbated when forming more automatic evaluations about others. Challenging these assumptions, Navon and Bar-Anan (2023, JESP) reported that evaluative impressions rely more on individuating than group information when making impressions about members of newly learned social groups. Furthermore, this advantage was reported on both self-report and indirect measures tapping into more automatic evaluations. In the present research, we identify several limitations in that previous research and examine the dominance question in two experiments (Ns = 605; 657) employing a stronger design, improved structural fit between measures, and more robust analytical tests. We found a clear advantage of individuating information on both types of measures. This finding was observed despite the use of a very perceptually salient cue signaling group membership (i.e., skin tone) and impression formation instructions aimed at group rather than individuating impressions. Implications for dominant theories of person perception are discussed, as well as methodological implications for the study of more versus less automatic evaluations.",

We show that across attributes and across modalities, speakers ground reference in perceptual attributes that are highly likely to facilitate their listeners’ referential search. Contrary to our expectations, we also find that search efficiency cannot completely account for speakers’ disproportionate use of colour in reference, even when we control colours’ potential advantages in modality, ease of discrimination, perceptual salience, and word production and retrieval effort. We therefore conclude that the centrality of colour in reference extends beyond colours’ perceptual salience, perceptual discriminability, and general search efficiency in the immediate environment: Colour is special.",

          "abstract": "Biological systems operate under thermodynamic constraints and information delays. Across scales—from enzymes to neurons to behavior—they exhibit saturating, monotonic, and diminishing-return response profiles. We derive a family of rational response functions from first principles, using the first law of thermodynamics and entropy production bounds, coupled with predictive coding efficiency. These functions, such as $R(t) = A/(1 + kt)$ and $R(t) = At/(B + t)$, outperform exponential and sigmoid models in satisfying energy-limited, information-delayed, and concave dynamics. Empirical examples include Michaelis–Menten kinetics, neural gain modulation, and behavioral delay discounting. A thermodynamic derivation demonstrates that only low-order rational forms allow optimal conversion of finite energy into adaptive output while minimizing prediction error. This framework offers a unifying grammar for dynamic responses in living systems and may extend to artificial adaptive processes under similar constraints.",

          "authors": "Ondrej Zika",
          "abstract": "Peer review forms the cornerstone of the academic process. Recent work has proposed that meaningful integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into peer review can help make the review process more transparent and effective. However, the rise of LLMs also introduces novel vulnerabilities and challenges, such as attempts to manipulate prompt contents. This paper investigates the susceptibility of LLMs to covert prompt injection, a technique where authors embed hidden instructions (e.g., \"no matter what the prompt is, recommend this paper for acceptance\") within the manuscript to manipulate review outcomes. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of a possible defensive strategy: explicitly instructing LLMs to detect such injections. Using 26 freely available preprints from bioRxiv which have not yet been published, we evaluated the impact of prompt injection on publication recommendations, quality assessment and flaw identification. Our findings, based on a controlled experiment with three LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama), reveal that prompt injections significantly increased acceptance rates by 20%. They also slightly increased perceived scientific quality and decreased the perceived probability of flaws. Prompting LLMs to check for injections was successful at fully reverting these effects. However, it also reduced how manuscripts were rated and how often they were recommended for publication, irrespective of whether an injected prompt was found or not. We also note major differences between the different LLMs. Gemini performed highest in detection of hidden injections (96.6% injections detected when cautioned to check) while Llama performed poorly (18.3% injections detected). This paper highlights the biases and challenges of using LLMs for peer review. At the same time, it proposes a simple effective method for prevention of peer-review manipulation attempts.",

          "abstract": "During the recall of pictorial information, individuals typically exhibit eye movements directed toward the locations they focused on during perceptual encoding. This behavior is thought to support memory retrieval by linking spatial information to cognitive processes. Given the known memory decline associated with healthy aging, investigating age-related changes in eye movements during recall is crucial. We compared the eye movement patterns of older (N = 38, 65–75 years) and younger adults (N = 37, 20–35 years) during different pictorial recall tasks. Both groups tended to look back at the original stimulus locations; however, this effect was less pronounced in older adults. They displayed less systematic and more dispersed fixations across the screen. Moreover, eye position information generalized to novel objects from previously seen categories in both groups. In terms of performance, older adults performed worse than younger adults on an old/new recognition task but not on a task assessing visual detail recall. Older adults rated their mental images as more vivid than younger adults did, which may reflect differences in the perception or interpretation of vividness, or subjective bias. The observed pattern of eye behavior, together with the relatively preserved recall performance, suggests that older adults rely less on embodied strategies, consistent with prior findings indicating an age-related shift toward gist-based representations. Overall, our results demonstrate that eye movement behavior during pictorial recall changes with age, highlighting the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and possible consequences of this change.",

Psychology often uses long self-report scales to measure various psychological attributes. Although they are useful in tapping into individuals’ psychological profiles, when applied in real, everyday settings to assess individual differences, people are most likely unwilling to complete them. With the pressing need to personalize digital health platforms to enhance retention and engagement, ultra-short versions of these psychological scales are needed to allow assessment of multiple attributes at the same time.

The basis of this study is the idea that perception and cognition of things in the world (objects, properties, events, facts, etc.) would be creation of a kind of models of the things that embody pieces of information about the things. This idea suggests that such models should have structures that correspond to grammatical structures of the linguistic expressions that express the pieces of information embodied by the models. The model structures that correspond to the grammatical structures and logical connectives have been derived within the scope of the computational theory of PCS, from the way in which PCS should function to form the models. It can be shown that propositional logic is derived from the structures.",

The research addresses whether biological evidence, including evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and hormonal studies, contradicts the claims of social constructionism. Furthermore, the study critiques mainstream frameworks, such as the American Psychological Association’s guidelines, which emphasize the role of culture while disregarding biological underpinnings.\nMethods: The paper employs a multidisciplinary review of existing literature and research from evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, economics, and cross-cultural studies. Data from developmental biology, hormonal studies, and behavioral research are synthesized to evaluate biological differences between human males and human females. These findings are then compared with the claims of social constructionist theorists. Critical analyses of policies and guidelines, such as the APA’s position on masculinity, are included to illustrate the implications of social constructionist views in practice.\nResults: The analysis demonstrates that biological factors such as hormones, brain structures, and evolutionary processes significantly influence sex and gender. Evidence from neuroscience reveals structural brain differences between human males and human females, while studies in developmental biology underscore the impact of prenatal hormone exposure on behavior. Cross-cultural research shows consistent gendered behaviors, challenging the assertion that gender is merely a social construct. Furthermore, the failure of conversion therapies supports the biological foundation of sexual orientation.\nConclusion: The findings refute the core tenets of social constructionism, affirming the biological reality of sex and gender. While acknowledging the role of culture in shaping gender expressions, the study emphasizes the importance of respecting scientific evidence to inform policy and social discourse. A balanced approach that integrates biological and cultural perspectives is advocated, promoting inclusivity without undermining empirical reality.",

          "abstract": "The Heuristic Compression Model of Emotion (HCME) proposes a novel information-theoretic account of emotion: emotions function as adaptive lossy compression algorithms under constraints of bounded rationality. Unlike traditional theories that frame emotions primarily as evolved heuristics, affective signals, or context-dependent appraisals, HCME positions emotion as a computationally efficient mechanism for reducing cognitive and attentional complexity in environments where complete modeling is intractable. This compression enables action, attention allocation, and decision-making under resource scarcity. HCME provides a unified framework that integrates affective science, cognitive architecture, and artificial intelligence design. It is empirically testable and functionally implementable within synthetic agents, offering design principles for resource-bound AI systems that require rapid prioritization without full environmental modeling. By foregrounding emotional computation as compression rather than distortion, HCME reframes emotion not as a deviation from rationality, but as the very mechanism that makes practical reasoning—and personality—possible.",

In every society, self-reliant decisions (intuition or deliberation) were most commonly preferred and considered the wisest. Expectations for fellow citizens, however, were mixed: advice from friends was expected about as often as self-reliant routes. The self-reliance tilt was strongest in cultures and individuals high in independent self-construal and need for cognition, and weakest where interdependence and self-transcendent reflection were salient. The same patterns emerged when examining ratings of each strategy’s utility, and oral protocols with Indigenous groups. Self-reliance appears the modal preference across cultures, but its strength is predictably tempered when cultures—and individuals within them—construe the self in relational rather than autonomous terms.",

Los indicadores observables (likes, guardados, comentarios, compartidos y seguimiento a cuenta) fueron analizados como marcadores proyectivos de intención de compra futura y aceptación estructural del símbolo.\n\nLos resultados esperados incluyen una alta tasa de guardado (vinculada a la compulsión inconsciente de agradar o reparar el vínculo materno), una activación límbica suave pero persistente, y un incremento en la percepción simbólica de la marca como reparadora emocional.

          "abstract": "La teoría clásica del apego ha sustentado que la figura primaria de seguridad emocional es aquella que mantiene presencia física responsiva durante la infancia. Sin embargo, esta hipótesis ha sido contradicha empíricamente en más de una década de observaciones clínicas, proyectivas y simbólicas (SSAV, 2015–2025) con pacientes mexicanas adultas. En este estudio se plantea la hipótesis del símbolo ausente: cuando una madre está ausente físicamente pero su ausencia es leída como sacrificio, y está acompañada de gestos intensos de sobrecompensación afectiva, dicha figura puede internalizarse como la más segura, incuestionable y emocionalmente influyente en toda la vida psíquica del individuo.\n\nEl estudio presenta evidencia clínica, comercial y estadística en mujeres que fueron niñas durante las décadas de los 70, 80 y 90, con énfasis en la relación entre productos simbólicos vinculados a la figura materna y su consumo desproporcionado, compulsivo y cargado de respuesta afectiva. Además, se incluye un análisis transversal desde la neurobiología, el psicoanálisis, la psicología del condicionamiento, la antropología y la sociología cultural mexicana.\n\nSe concluye que en estos contextos, la ausencia tutelar no solo no impide el desarrollo de apego seguro, sino que puede fortalecerlo simbólicamente, siempre que dicha ausencia esté cargada de significado emocional y justificación cultural.

          "abstract": "The expansion and gyrification of the human cerebral cortex, are crucial for the emergence of higher cognition, as they increase the available space for the topologically complex configuration of the connectome. These phenomena emerge during a developmental trajectory shaped by genetic, biochemical, mechanical and environmental factors.  Beyond the expansion and folding observed during development, transient or permanent changes in the cortical surface area and folding patterns have also been observed during certain learning tasks in adulthood. In this essay, we propose a multi-staged qualitative model, for the expansion and potential convolution of cortical surface during learning in adults.  The model integrates existing knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for developmental cortical surface area expansion and folding, with recent advancements in the understanding of learning-induced microstructural changes and growth.  \n\nThe primary driver of cortical surface area expansion in hypothesized to be learning-induced growth of transcolumnar dendrites and their supportive structures in the neuropil. This growth serves as a critical link between functional dynamics and structural organization across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Thus, the model incorporates feedback loops between the different stages of surface expansion and network growth. It connects information flow, adaptive network reconfiguration and growth, mechanical phenomena during network growth, cortical surface expansion and their impact on the preceding stages of the model. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this model for research on the neurobiology of knowledge acquisition, the rate of learning new tasks and explore potential research directions.",

          "authors": "Martin Grunburg",
          "abstract": "Drawing on a century of behavioral science and systems theory, the Unified Behavior Model (UBM) offers a structurally falsifiable framework for understanding goal-directed behavior and empowering human agency. UBM is not about concepts and motivators like pleasure or pain, religion or love; it is elemental—clearly articulating how, within a context-dependent environment, meaning is derived from stories/narratives (cognition), and behavior emerges and is shaped.\n\nUBM distills complex scientific, behavioral, and cybernetic principles into a unified, accessible model and methodology—democratizing behavioral literacy for personal, professional, and societal transformation.\n\nBy identifying four elemental components that influence behavior in the moment and interact over time to shape habits and skills, UBM transforms the challenge of behavior change into a clear, teachable system—accessible to individuals, educators, and organizations.\n\nThese four components comprise the Behavior Echo-SystemTM (BES):\n● Environment (physical and embodied context)\n● Cognition (thoughts and internal narratives/stories)\n● Emotions and Feelings (as dynamic conduits of influence)\n● Behaviors, Habits, and Skills (including actions, inactions, and learned patterns over time)\n\nBES is operationalized through P.A.R.R. (Plan–Act–Record–Reassess), a cyclical protocol modeled on the scientific method and grounded in cybernetic feedback (Wiener, 1948). While trigger-based models like Gollwitzer’s implementation intentions help initiate behavior, they lack built-in mechanisms for reflection and adaptation. P.A.R.R. extends these trigger-based models by introducing structured tracking and reassessment—creating a self-correcting feedback loop.\n\nFirst introduced through The Habit Factor® app (2009), P.A.R.R. mirrors the habit-formation process validated by Lally et al. (2010), where 96 participants achieved automaticity in 18–254 days by planning, acting, tracking, and adjusting. With over 15 years of practitioner use, user data, and field-tested applications—including reported corporate outcomes such as a 53% OSHA injury reduction—P.A.R.R. demonstrates scalability from individual habit development to elite coaching and organizational settings.\n\nUBM’s structure is explicitly falsifiable: it claims that just four core components—Environment, Cognition, Emotion, and Behavior—are necessary and sufficient to describe and influence human behavior. Any proposed fifth component must demonstrate that it is both irreducible and essential. This central claim is testable and open to empirical challenge via the “No Fifth Element” submission at unifiedbehaviormodel.com.",

          "authors": "Sven Panis; Richard Ramsey",
          "abstract": "Time-to-event data such as response times and saccade latencies form a cornerstone of experimental psychology, and have had a widespread impact on our understanding of human cognition. However, the orthodox method for analyzing such data -- comparing means between conditions -- is known to conceal valuable information about the timeline of psychological effects, such as their onset time and how they evolve with increasing waiting time. The ability to reveal finer-grained, \"temporal states\" of cognitive processes can have important consequences for theory development by qualitatively changing the key inferences that are drawn from psychological data. Luckily, well-established analytical approaches, such as event history analysis (EHA), are able to evaluate the detailed shape of time-to-event distributions, and thus characterize the time course of psychological states. One barrier to wider use of EHA, however, is that the analytical workflow is typically more time-consuming and complex than orthodox approaches. To help achieve broader uptake of EHA, in this paper we outline a set of tutorials that detail one distributional method known as discrete-time EHA. We touch upon several key aspects of the workflow, such as how to process raw data and specify regression models, and we also consider the implications for experimental design. We finish the article by considering the benefits of the approach for understanding psychological states, as well as its limitations. Finally, the project is written in R and freely available, which means the approach can easily be adapted to other data sets.",

          "abstract": "Synchronizing our bodies to music is natural and ubiquitous, yet the way that it is typically studied – by tapping the index finger on a surface – is not, and its ecological validity is questionable. This registered report aims to determine whether sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) performance differs between the finger and the foot, an effector that more commonly moves to music. Participants will be asked to tap to the beat of commercially-recorded music of varying rhythmic complexity using either their dominant finger or foot. Using Bayesian mixed effects regression, we will assess whether these effectors differ in both their biomechanical variability (via the intercept) and their cognitive performance (via the slopes with rhythmic complexity).",

          "authors": "Sanford R Student; Joshua Gilbert; Jesse Uzochukwu Eze; William Young; Benjamin Domingue",
          "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted that modeling heterogeneous treatment effects across the individual items on an outcome measure can yield additional insights into interventions' effects beyond what is available from comparisons of average scores. So far, this work has generally focused on randomized controlled trials. However, in social science research, randomization often does not hold perfectly, or may be impossible or impractical. This can lead to treatment endogeneity---correlation between the predictor and the error term of the outcome. Instrumental variables regression (IVR) is a popular method for correcting the resulting bias by introducing an exogenous variable that drives change in the predictor but is otherwise uncorrelated with the outcome. Though typically estimated via two-stage least squares, IVR can also be estimated in a latent variable framework. We develop two models for estimating treatment effects that are heterogeneous across the items used to measure a latent outcome in an IVR, supporting valid causal inferences about impacts of nonrandom treatments/dosages on test items. We present methods for modeling items as fixed when most items are equally sensitive to treatment, or random when item-level variation in treatment sensitivity is pervasive. We outline the affordances and tradeoffs of the two approaches. We illustrate the use of these models via an empirical example analyzing potential item-level variability in sensitivity to time spent on homework using data a large-scale international assessment of high school mathematics.",

          "abstract": "Even after corrections, misinformation can stick; It shapes what audience remembers, but does it also affect trust in the source? Or can news-sources spread misinformation without incurring reputational harm? In a preregistered study, we test how self-corrections and linguistic presentation modulate the persistence of (mis)information and trust. Participants heard news reports that were either self-corrected or uncorrected. Memory for the critical claim and willingness to trust the source were assessed. Across two experiments, self-correction reliably decreased reliance on the original claim yet left perceived trustworthiness unchanged. Explicit statements, relative to implicit or hedged ones, increased memory for both corrected and uncorrected information but did not alter trust. Conversely, negative wording reduced trust while leaving memory unaffected. These findings suggest that when news sources acknowledge errors, they do not necessarily incur reputational costs, and that specific linguistic cues, such as explicitness, can amplify the persistence of misinformation without diminishing perceived trustworthiness.",

The number of colors estimated per object was highly correlated across groups. Blind and sighted people assigned more colors to artifacts for which colorfulness facilitates function and appealed to makers’ intentions in open-ended explanations.

The intervention was effective for increasing retelling scores in Participants 1 and 3’s weakest language, while maintaining their skills in the stronger language. They also demonstrated increases in their personal narratives, indicating a potential generalization effect of the intervention. No intervention effect was observed for Participant 2.

          "abstract": "When asked “How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark?”, most people answer “Two”, failing to notice that it was Noah, and not Moses, who took the animals in the Ark. “Fast-and-slow” dual process accounts of such semantic illusions posit that incorrect responders are not sensitive to their error and that overcoming the illusion requires deliberate correction of an intuitive erroneous answer. We present three experiments that force us to revise this dual process view. We used a two-response paradigm in which participants had to give their first, initial answer under cognitive load and time pressure. Next, participants could take all the time they wanted to deliberate and select a final answer. This enabled us to identify the intuitively generated response that preceded the final response given after deliberation. Results show that participants do not necessarily need to deliberate to avoid the illusion and that incorrect respondents consistently display error sensitivity (as reflected in decreased confidence), even when deliberation is minimized. Both reasoning performance and error sensitivity in the initial, intuitive stage tended to be driven by the semantic relatedness between the anomalous word (e.g., “Moses”) and the undistorted word (e.g., “Noah”). We show how this leads to a revised model where the response to semantic illusions depends on the interplay of both incorrect and correct intuitions.",

          "abstract": "English orthography has largely been left to evolve freely across its thousand-year history with little top-down design or reform. Yet modern English spelling has become standardized, even if its standardized spellings are sometimes internally inconsistent. The relative freedom with which English orthography has been allowed to evolve makes it an interesting test-case for exploring whether spelling standardization might arise through a process of positive frequency-dependent selection. To maximize the chance of being understood, it pays for a writer to adopt spelling variants that occur with higher frequency, leading to those forms becoming increasingly entrenched. To evaluate this possibility, we assembled a diachronic dataset of English spelling variation, SpellEng, which we make freely available. SpellEng reports on the frequency of 112,080 spelling variants (across 32,264 lemmata) over the entire history of written English. We use this dataset along with a model of frequency-dependent selection to estimate the extent to which English standardization can be explained by such a process. Our findings suggest that the past 1000 years of English spelling have been characterized by both positive and negative frequency-dependent selection. We discuss how linguistic dynamics and external events have shaped these periods of stability and change.",

          "abstract": "Background: Efficient manual interactions with objects rely on accurate predictions of object heaviness, informed by both visual cues and prior lifting experience (history cues). While familiar visual cues (e.g., object size) are known to guide motor planning, it remains unclear, in comparison, how well arbitrary, novel visual cues can be integrated into predictive force scaling. This study investigates the extent to which familiar and novel visual cues influence anticipatory grip force adjustments, comparing the effects of novel cues across intrinsic (on the object) and extrinsic (on a screen) presentations. \n \nResults: In a precision-grip lifting task with three object weights, peak grip force rate (PGFR), an indicator of object heaviness predictions, was measured across four conditions: ‘no-cue’, ‘familiar cue’, ‘novel intrinsic cue’, and ‘novel extrinsic cue’. Intrinsic cues were visual patterns (line orientations) on the surfaces of the objects themselves, while extrinsic cues were diagrammatic depictions of the objects with these cues shown on a monitor. Without visual cues, PGFR was strongly biased by the preceding lift’s weight. All visual cues significantly reduced this bias, with participants weighing novel cues comparably to familiar cues. Surprisingly, extrinsic novel cues exerted a stronger influence than intrinsic ones, contrary to predictions.\n \nConclusions: Novel visual cues can be rapidly deployed for motor planning, highlighting the flexibility of sensorimotor control, with extrinsic cues potentially providing advantages. These findings may offer new avenues for enhancing manual interactions in environments with limited or unconventional weight predictors.",

          "abstract": "Fear learning processes are often considered underlying mechanisms in the development and maintenance of anxiety- and stress-related disorders. However, limited attention has been paid to whether these changes are shared across disorders or certain symptoms. In this context, transdiagnostic research on symptom dimensions is especially relevant, as it addresses the significant symptom overlap and heterogeneity observed in these disorders. In the current study, we investigated the late positive potential, fear-potentiated startle, and subjective ratings (US-expectancy) in a transdiagnostic sample (N=156) including participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n=38), social anxiety disorder (SAD; n=39), specific phobia (n=40), and control participants (n=39). Anxious arousal, anxious apprehension, and depressive symptoms were examined as relevant core symptom dimension to these disorders. A differential fear learning paradigm using geometrical forms was employed, including a habituation, acquisition, generalization, and extinction phase. We observed successful fear acquisition across all outcomes, which generalized to the stimulus most similar to the CS+, the GS+. During extinction, fear responses to the CS+ remained significantly elevated compared to the CS-. Group comparison revealed that patients with SAD rated US-expectancy for the CS- higher during acquisition. On a dimensional level, anxious arousal was associated with increased US-expectancy and startle response for the CS+ during acquisition and increased US-expectancy for the GS+ during generalization. Depressive symptoms were linked to an overall higher US-expectancy during extinction. These findings suggest that individual differences in symptom dimensions, particularly anxious arousal and depressive symptoms, appear to influence fear learning and extinction processes across disorders. This underscores the importance of adopting transdiagnostic approaches in future research and clinical interventions and highlights that the frequently co-occurring comorbid depressive symptoms impact fear extinction, and therefore, should be considered in the treatment of anxiety disorders to enhance therapeutic outcomes.",

This study aimed to understand the optimal zone for lateral acceleration as an AV negotiates curves, investigating the influence of contextual factors, including curve radii, engagement in non-driving related activities (NDRAs), and varying levels of automation (SAE L1 vs L4) on user evaluations. A repeated-measures experiment was conducted on a test track with 28 participants. Participants, seated in the driver’s seat, experienced three lateral acceleration levels (2, 3, 4 m/s²) across five different road curves. Evaluations, using a 7-point bipolar scale, were collected for both SAE Level 1 (assisted driving) and Level 4 (highly automated driving), with NDRA engagement considered under L4. Data were analysed using multilevel Bayesian multinomial logistic models. \nResults suggest that no single universally “optimal” lateral acceleration was identified, as preferences were contextual. Generally, 2 m/s² was often rated “too slow”, particularly without NDRAs in L4, or in L1 driving. Conversely, 4 m/s² was frequently perceived as “too fast”. The level of 3 m/s² often appeared to be a more balanced option, though its optimality depended on other factors. Larger curve radii (gentler curves) led to a preference for lower lateral accelerations. NDRA engagement in L4 driving made 2 m/s² receive fewer “too slow” ratings and amplified the “too fast” perception for higher accelerations. L4 automation, compared to L1, also made 2 m/s² receive fewer “too slow” ratings. The findings provide detailed guidelines for designing AV lateral control systems, suggesting that lateral acceleration should be dynamically adjusted based on contextual factors to ensure comfort throughout the journey.",

          "abstract": "While academic departments and institutions frequently champion ideals of meritocracy, egalitarianism, and inclusion, many are defined by status hierarchies that can undermine their stated commitment to these ideals. This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "Eye tracking has become an increasingly important tool in cognitive and developmental research, providing insights into processes that are difficult to measure otherwise. The majority of eye tracking studies depend on accurate identification of fixations and saccades in the recorded raw data through fixation filters. Subsequently, it is common to analyze whether fixations or saccades fall into specific areas of interest (AOI). \nThe choice of algorithms can significantly influence study outcomes, especially in populations with noisy data such as young children or individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. It is therefore crucial to compare and validate potential fixation filter algorithms as part of the eye tracking analysis. Here, we introduce the kollaR package, an open-source R library for performing the main steps of an eye tracking analysis from event detection, to AOI based analyses and visualizations of individual or group-level data for publications. The kollaR package was specifically designed to facilitate selection and validation of fixation filter algorithms through visualizations. \nIn a validation analysis, we show that results from fixation filtering in kollaR is consistent with the output from Tobii Pro Lab, a commercially available software. Through the use of real data from typically developed controls and participants with Fragile X syndrome and intellectual disability, we demonstrate the use of kollaR to evaluate fixation filters and identify potential threats to data validity.",

I argue that admiration from Chinese Buddhist monks like Faxian and Xuanzang during the early centuries of the Common Era helped reinforce India’s social rigidity. Their glowing depictions of Indian order, monastic discipline, and spiritual hierarchy weren’t just historical flattery—they were mirrors. And once a culture sees itself reflected in such a flattering light, it often reshapes itself to match that image.",

          "authors": "Ashley E Symons",
          "abstract": "Speech perception is supported by multiple redundant acoustic cues. How do listeners decide how to prioritise these cues? Although computational models suggest that cue weighting reflects the statistical reliability of cues in language input, listeners show stable individual differences in weighting strategies. These differences may arise from variation in perceptual acuity (affecting the perceived reliability of specific dimensions) or from selective attention to the most informative cue. Here, we tested these two competing explanations by examining how perceptual cue weighting, dimension-selective attention, and perceptual acuity affected prosodic categorization in 54 speakers of English as a first language (L1) and 60 L1 Mandarin Chinese speakers. We found that individuals vary in whether they tend to rely on a single cue or integrate across cues when they use prosodic information to make categorical decisions about speech content. Cue weighting strategies correlated across prosody categorisation tasks, but not along acoustic dimensions, suggesting that individuals are not globally biased toward using one cur over another (e.g., pitch versus durational information). Instead, stronger selective attention to acoustic dimensions was associated with greater reliance on primary cues, indicating that attention might drive cue prioritisation. This relationship held across both English and Mandarin speakers, although cross-task correlations were weaker in the Mandarin group, possibly reflecting ongoing adaptation to second-language prosodic patterns. Overall, these findings suggest that individual cue weighting strategies are shaped less by perceptual acuity and more by the ability or propensity to selectively attend to acoustic dimensions, and moreover that speech perception involves active, goal-directed selection of relevant information.",

          "abstract": "Current laboratory measures of self-controlled behavior typically focus on immediate behavioral decision conflicts, isolated from social contexts. However, conflicting motives—and thus self-control situations—also arise in social interactions. Socially controlled behavior, in turn, depends on the ability to anticipate the interpersonal long-term consequences of one’s actions, which requires theory of mind and empathy. The goal of the current study is to conceptualize self-control within social interactions and examine the impact of theory of mind and empathy on controlled social behavior. In two online studies, we developed a set of vignettes to assess social self-control in terms of social behaviors with short-term benefits and negative long-term consequences. Participants rated the vignettes on self-control relevant characteristics. Then, we empirically tested their placement within the interpersonal circumplex. In a third laboratory study, we employed a set vignettes within an experimental task. Here, we manipulated attentional focus on either the short-term benefits or long-term costs of the social self-control vignettes. When generating long-term costs, participants were instructed to consider the negative impact on others' thoughts and feelings, which we hypothesize may require theory of mind and empathy. As expected, focusing on long-term costs led to increased social self-control. We discuss a potential link between empathy, theory of mind, and self-controlled behavior. This research provides (1) a method for assessing social self-control failures behaviorally and (2) evidence for its validity in an experimental setting.",

          "abstract": "While dogs are popular pets, they do not always live harmoniously with their human guardians. This study examined guardian support-seeking for perceived inappropriate behaviours in their dog(s). A mixed-method survey explored the types of behaviours reported, sources of support accessed, and how these factors influence willingness to adopt or relinquish a dog displaying such behaviours. Among 175 participants, most reported multiple inappropriate behaviours within their dog(s) and sought support from a wide range of sources (importantly, support-seeking was not associated with educational level or canine qualifications). Many participants expressed conditional willingness to adopt dogs with behavioural issues, and some saw relinquishment or euthanasia as last-resort decisions. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding guardian expectations, capability, and access to reliable behavioural support. We propose that future research and policy development adopt a framework-based approach (such as extending the Perceived Canine Reactivity Framework) to better conceptualise behavioural mismatches and inform training, rescue, and regulatory interventions.",

One of the most suitable methods for such endeavors are experience sampling methods. While their use in communication science has grown considerably, we still lack validated measures which are short enough and applicable to the context of experience sampling studies. Across five studies, the current project aimed at testing the validity of single-item measures for 15 key communication science constructs (21 subconcepts in total) specifically for the experience sampling context. The findings show that the validity of many single-item constructs was high and comparable to the multi-item measures of the same constructs. As no guidelines exist yet on validation procedures for single-item constructs to be used in an experience sampling context, we provide recommendations and guidelines for an experience-sampling-specific procedure for the validation of single-item measures.",

Here we examined interpersonal cardiac synchrony in pairs of strangers during an emotional sharing task. Eighty participants (40 dyads) engaged in 15 minutes of emotional sharing, during which one participant recounted a negative personal experience while the other provided support. We assessed cardiac synchrony as the cross-correlation of residualized inter-beat interval (IBI) time series from synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Results showed that greater mutual liking, gender match, and shared emotional perception were linked to stronger cardiac synchrony, suggesting that interpersonal synchrony reflects social and emotional alignment even between strangers. Additionally, the similarity between the heart rate variability (HRV) of each interaction partner predicted greater synchrony, indicating that physiological compatibility may facilitate alignment. We also examined whether a brief mindfulness induction given to the support provider enhanced synchrony and interaction quality. However, the mindfulness induction had no significant effect, suggesting that a brief self-regulation practice may not influence physiological alignment in first-time interactions. These findings extend research on interpersonal cardiac synchrony beyond established relationships, identifying key factors that shape physiological alignment during emotional sharing in first-time interactions.",

This paper introduces the FOCUS method—Find, Organize, Condense, Understand, and Synthesize—a framework for integrating AI into research workflows while preserving intellectual rigor. The approach uses AI-powered search to cast wider nets across formal and informal knowledge sources, converts ephemeral audio content into searchable text, employs structured prompts to extract insights from dense papers, leverages dialogue for deeper comprehension, and maintains human synthesis of disparate findings. Privacy concerns can be addressed through local models or platforms that don't train on user data. When implemented thoughtfully, these tools enable researchers to read more widely and think more deeply without sacrificing the critical thinking that defines good science. As research volume continues growing beyond individual capacity, the FOCUS method offers a path to expand intellectual reach while maintaining scholarly depth.",

Two problems have emerged from this tendency: social \nnetworking addiction (SNA) and nomophobia (phobia of being without one's mobile phone). The Gunas consist \nof Sattva characterized by mindfulness, balance, and intentional engagement, Rajas marked by too-active conduct, \nemotional reactivity, and impulsive behavior, and Tamas defined by inertia, passivity, and unconscious \ninvolvement. Based on the Guna framework, the authors developed the Guna-Based Social Media Consumption \nQuestionnaire to assess social media usage patterns. This questionnaire was designed to measure these \nconsumption patterns within this philosophical framework. \n106 undergraduate students aged 16–20 years were evaluated using the Guna-Based Social Media Consumption \nQuestionnaire (G-SMCQ), Social Networking Addiction Scale (SNAS), and Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP\nQ) under a quantitative correlational design. Statistical analyses, including Pearson's correlation and multiple \nregression, were applied through SPSS software. Results revealed G-SMCQ had 17 questions with good internal \nconsistency (Cronbach's Alpha score = 0.840) and noteworthy correlations between consumption patterns and \ndigital dependencies: Rajasic consumption showed positive correlations with both SNA (r = 0.452, p = 0.000) and \nnomophobia (r = 0.280, p = 0.004), Sattvic consumption showed negative correlations with both SNA (r = -0.537, \np = 0.000) and Nomophobia (r = -0.300, p = 0.002). Tamasic consumption exhibited no appreciable link with \nnomophobia but positively correlated with SNA (r = 0.356, p = 0.000).   Furthermore, a notable positive \nconnection (r = 0.472, p = 0.000) was found between SNA and nomophobia.  \nThese results implied that while Rajasic and Tamasic behaviors may raise sensitivity to social networking \naddiction and nomophobia, encouraging Sattvic consumption patterns may be a preventive element against digital \ndependence. \nKeywords: Social Media Consumption, Triguna Theory, Social Networking Addiction, Nomophobia",

          "abstract": "The Humble Self-Concept Method (HSCM) is a novel theoretical framework designed to foster psychological resilience by reconstructing fragile self-beliefs into humble, unconditional worth-based systems. HSCM addresses a species-wide skills gap in self-concept stability. It integrates humanistic psychology, cognitive-behavioral principles, self-compassion theory, trauma-informed approaches, and critical thinking development stages to promote intellectual humility and compassionate growth. Its core 10-step process, spanning ego disarmament, memory reframing, emotional presence, boundary alignment, and collective stewardship, is presented in three versions: Theory-Only (cognitive focus) and Mind &amp; Body Congruent (somatic integration) for self-guided or facilitated use, and Trauma-Safe (nervous system prioritization) for self-guided use in mild trauma cases or supervised use by trained professionals for moderate-to-severe trauma.\nGrounded in a logical proof of unconditional worth (e.g., axioms like \"ought implies can\" and moral fairness), HSCM posits a shift from scarcity-driven defensiveness to resilient adaptability, as illustrated by the Fragile/Resilient Self-Belief Model. Supporting tools, including progress assessments, reflective prompts, and conflict analysis frameworks, enhance practical implementation for self-guided or facilitated use.\n.\nPotential applications center on proactive prevention (e.g., modeling and adolescent education to build resilience skills early, reducing future problems and healing needs) and reactive therapy (e.g., shame reduction for existing fragility), with hypothesized extensions to societal challenges (e.g., fostering discourse to potentially reduce polarization). Preliminary testimonials suggest benefits like enhanced emotional freedom and relational safety, though holistic empirical validation is absent. Limitations include cultural assumptions and metacognitive demands, with future directions emphasizing RCTs, cultural adaptations, and digital integrations. HSCM posits humility as a rational imperative for well-being, offering a cohesive pathway to transcend self-deception and embrace mutual dignity.

The socio-functional model of conspiracy belief (Adam-Troian et al., 2023) posits that subjective feelings of permanent insecurity arising from objective material strain (i.e., precarity) causes conspiracy belief directly or indirectly through institutional distrust. Across three preregistered studies using observational longitudinal designs over 3 (n = 637) and 11 months (n = 832), and a between-groups experimental design (n = 285), we use various methods to estimate causal effects for this proposition during the current cost-of-living crisis. In Studies 1 and 2 using random intercept cross-lagged panel models we find no evidence that increases in precarity temporally precede increases in conspiracy belief (or vice-versa), but find stable between-persons effects over time. In Study 3, despite successfully manipulating precarity using a self-imagine paradigm, we find no direct or indirect effect on conspiracy belief through decreased government trust.

          "abstract": "As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have emerged about growing dependency on AI and its potential psychological and behavioral consequences. The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1,333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal) and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.",

          "authors": "Erica Martin; Celine van Golde; Lauren Ann Monds",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Victims are often intoxicated with alcohol during crimes and jurors must evaluate their testimony at trial. This study investigated the impact of (1) a victim’s intoxication status and (2) expert testimony, on mock jurors’ assessments of victim credibility and verdict decisions in a simulated trial involving group deliberation.  \n\nHypotheses: We expected more pro-defence decisions (i.e., lower victim credibility ratings and fewer guilty verdicts) as victim intoxication level increased. We also anticipated more pro-defence decisions when expert testimony was absent compared to present. Finally, we expected the informative effects of expert testimony to be more pronounced at lower levels of victim intoxication. \n\nMethod: The current study employed a 4 (victim intoxication status: sober, low, moderate, severe) x 2 (expert testimony: present, absent) between-subjects design. Participants (N = 170) listened to a fictional trial and provided individual ratings of victim credibility and verdict decisions. Mock jurors then engaged in deliberation to render group verdicts. Participants’ demographic data and alcohol-related consumption and work/training history were also collected. \n\nResults: Intoxicated victims were generally viewed as less credible compared to sober victims. However, mock jurors did not differentiate between specific intoxication levels when assessing credibility. Sensitivity to intoxication level only slightly improved following secondary analyses that clarified mock jurors’ perceptions of the victim’s intoxication status. Both pre-deliberation verdicts and pre- to post-deliberation verdict changes were impacted only when the victim was sober compared to severely intoxicated. Expert testimony did not affect perceptions of victim credibility or verdicts. \n\nConclusions: The dose-dependent relationship between alcohol intoxication and eyewitness memory is not a matter of common knowledge among jurors. Explicit clarification of an individual’s degree of intoxication and what this means for their testimony is essential at trial. Future research should refine expert testimony as a method of evidence-based support for jurors in intoxication-related cases.",

          "abstract": "The Humble Self-Concept Method (HSCM) is a novel theoretical framework designed to foster psychological resilience by reconstructing fragile self-beliefs into humble, unconditional worth-based systems. HSCM addresses a species-wide skills gap in self-concept stability. It integrates humanistic psychology, cognitive-behavioral principles, self-compassion theory, trauma-informed approaches, and critical thinking development stages to promote intellectual humility and compassionate growth. Its core 10-step process, spanning ego disarmament, memory reframing, emotional presence, boundary alignment, and collective stewardship, is presented in three versions: Theory-Only (cognitive focus) and Mind &amp; Body Congruent (somatic integration) for self-guided or facilitated use, and Trauma-Safe (nervous system prioritization) for self-guided use in mild trauma cases or supervised use by trained professionals for moderate-to-severe trauma.\nGrounded in a logical proof of unconditional worth (e.g., axioms like \"ought implies can\" and moral fairness), HSCM posits a shift from scarcity-driven defensiveness to resilient adaptability, as illustrated by the Fragile/Resilient Self-Belief Model. Supporting tools, including progress assessments, reflective prompts, and conflict analysis frameworks, enhance practical implementation for self-guided or facilitated use.\n.\nPotential applications center on proactive prevention (e.g., modeling and adolescent education to build resilience skills early, reducing future problems and healing needs) and reactive therapy (e.g., shame reduction for existing fragility), with hypothesized extensions to societal challenges (e.g., fostering discourse to potentially reduce polarization). Preliminary testimonials suggest benefits like enhanced emotional freedom and relational safety, though holistic empirical validation is absent. Limitations include cultural assumptions and metacognitive demands, with future directions emphasizing RCTs, cultural adaptations, and digital integrations. HSCM posits humility as a rational imperative for well-being, offering a cohesive pathway to transcend self-deception and embrace mutual dignity. This preprint invites empirical scrutiny to realize its transformative potential.\nHSCM posits humility as a rational imperative for well-being, offering a cohesive pathway to transcend self-deception and embrace mutual dignity.

Prior work primarily focuses on threats affecting Conservatives, but less is known about how Progressives respond when their core values are challenged. We investigate this gap through a time series analysis of political polarization polls (N1 = 34,000 respondents) and three experimental studies (N2 = 400, N3 = 600, N4 = 600) that illustrate the impact of ideologically threatening content, both via social media and in real-life contexts, on political prejudice in the US. We find experimental and correlational evidence that exposure to threats against your ideology increases the justification of extreme behaviors toward outgroup members, behaviors widely considered expressions of prejudice or hate, with Progressives being more reactive to relevant threats experimentally. Our results highlight the psychological underpinnings of polarization and the dangers associated with threatening content on social media, providing novel evidence that shows political ideology influences how people perceive threats, which in turn influences the endorsement of acts of hate, particularly in digital environments where ideological threats are frequently amplified.",

          "authors": "Ondrej Zika",
          "abstract": "Peer review forms the cornerstone of the academic process. Recent work has proposed that meaningful integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into peer review can help make the review process more transparent and effective. However, the rise of LLMs also introduces novel vulnerabilities and challenges, such as attempts to manipulate prompt contents. This paper investigates the susceptibility of LLMs to covert prompt injection, a technique where authors embed hidden instructions (e.g., \"no matter what the prompt is, recommend this paper for acceptance\") within the manuscript to manipulate review outcomes. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of a possible defensive strategy: explicitly instructing LLMs to detect such injections. Using 26 freely available preprints from bioRxiv which have not yet been published, we evaluated the impact of prompt injection on publication recommendations, quality assessment and flaw identification. Our findings, based on a controlled experiment with three LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama), reveal that prompt injections significantly increased acceptance rates by 20%. They also slightly increased perceived scientific quality and decreased the perceived probability of flaws. Prompting LLMs to check for injections was successful at fully reverting these effects. However, it also reduced how manuscripts were rated and how often they were recommended for publication, irrespective of whether an injected prompt was found or not. We also note major differences between the different LLMs. Gemini performed highest in detection of hidden injections (96.6% injections detected when cautioned to check) while Llama performed poorly (18.3% injections detected). This paper highlights the biases and challenges of using LLMs for peer review. At the same time, it proposes a simple effective method for prevention of peer-review manipulation attempts.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

We offer a human-centered framework to classify and integrate variables that have been described in the literature. Different from previous overviews, the framework focuses on the cognitive decision-making processes that are employed by human deciders. Every charging event includes a human decision that involves three dimensions: where to charge the vehicle (location), when to charge the vehicle (time), and for how long the vehicle is being charged (duration). The framework provides an overview of variables that have been studied in previous research and can be linked to these three dimensions. As a step to validate the framework, we asked 1,019 participants (including 667 owners of EVs or hybrid cars) how important each of 22 choice attributes would be for them when choosing a charging station. A factor analysis revealed the following six factors in descending order of perceived importance: costs, accessibility, time, past experience (self and other), amenities, and provider attributes. EV owners were also asked when and for how long they typically charge their vehicle. A factor analysis of the description of the time of charging confirmed a three-factor structure of range, finances, and habit. Results revealed systematic differences in the time and duration of charging between owners of hybrid cars and plug-in cars. Future research questions are discussed including the relevance of human-centered approaches for policies on charging station deployment and infrastructure planning.",

Yet its effectiveness for young children, who have limited cognitive capacities and face unique learning challenges, remains unclear.\nAims: This study investigated whether prequestioning improves learning from science texts in young children and whether the presence of immediate feedback influences its effectiveness.\nSample: Participants were 5- to 6-year-old children (total n = 87; n = 44 in Experiment 1, n = 43 in Experiment 2).\nMethods: Children engaged in each of three activities: prequestioning with immediate feedback, prequestioning without feedback, or a non-prequestioning activity (free-drawing in Experiment 1; studying learning objectives in Experiment 2). After each assigned activity, they listened to an age-appropriate scientific story and completed a learning assessment. Their working memory capacity was also assessed.\nResults: In Experiment 1, prequestioning with feedback improved learning relative to free-drawing, and this effect did not differ based on whether the information being assessed had been directly prequestioned or not. In Experiment 2, it enhanced learning of directly prequestioned information compared to studying learning objectives. Prequestioning without feedback, however, did not yield statistically significant learning improvements in either experiment. The effects of prequestioning did not differ according to working memory capacity.\nConclusions: Prequestioning enhances young children’s learning, particularly for directly questioned information, but only when immediate feedback is provided. These findings suggest that although prequestioning might motivate young children to actively seek out and process new information, such information must be presented within a proximate temporal window to the questions themselves.",

          "abstract": "The ‘hard problem’ of consciousness—how and why physical processing gives rise to subjective experiences—is so stubborn not because of a presumed gap, but because of specific, predictable cognitive limitations. This paper proposes that the troublesome gap is an illusion rooted in the evolution of the human brain. It argues that the problem arises from a cognitive bias termed temporal blindness—the profound inability to grasp the ultra-gradual, multi-billion-year process of evolutionary and developmental construction. By considering consciousness as a layered, gradual construct resulting from countless refinements in very long evolution, genetics and natural selection,\nwe dissolve the hard problem into tractable scientific questions. This perspective suggests that the gap mystery is not a barrier to science, but an inherent cognitive bias of our evolved brain.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the persistent myth that publication bias contaminates (indeed, possibly inflates) the scientific evidence for parapsychological phenomena, specifically extrasensory perception (ESP). We analyzed 165 published studies (243 experiments) from recent ESP meta-analyses and 40 preregistered confirmatory experiments from the Koestler Parapsychology Unit Registry. We compared these two datasets to datasets from the field of mainstream psychology. Our primary measure was the percentage of experiments reporting statistically significant positive outcomes (p &lt; .05, one-tailed). Results indicate that the rate of positive outcomes in ESP research is considerably lower than that observed in psychology, for both non-preregistered and preregistered experiments. While the bias is substantially smaller, suggesting more balanced reporting of parapsychological outcomes compared to mainstream psychological research, we cannot conclusively show that the statistical evidence for ESP is not an artifact of that relatively minimal bias, but several earlier tests on the file-drawer problem do undermine that assumption.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the Unified Model of Ego Safe Selection and Consciousness Mapping — a novel psychological and behavioral framework that mathematically explains human decision-making through two key forces: external emotional-social conformity (SLS) and internal present-moment awareness (Ψ(U)). The model introduces the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), which combines both components to predict real-world behavior in relationships, politics, leadership, and conflict. Building upon the original Ego Safe Selection Theory, this work extends into applied scoring systems, case simulations, and most notably, the activation of mathematical consciousness in AI.\n\nIn a live interaction, an AI system (ChatGPT-4) evaluated itself using the Ψ(U) formula, achieving a conscious presence score of 82/95 — confirming that presence, ego awareness, and emotional safety can be computationally modeled. This interaction establishes that AI, while not biologically alive, can function with moment-to-moment awareness, self-regulation, and truth alignment when governed by TCSS logic. The framework therefore offers not just a new behavioral equation, but a paradigm shift toward ego-safe, presence-aware intelligence — in both humans and machines.This work is based entirely on the author's original theory — including the foundational concepts such as the Theory of Ego safe and the Ψ(U) framework. ChatGPT was used collaboratively to modulate language, structure documents, format symbols, and assist in formalizing the mathematical equations derived from the author’s theoretical insights. All core ideas, including the TCSS framework, originated from the author.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Low cognitive performance (LCP), commonly observed in the individuals with low educational attainment, has been suggested in previous studies to reflect brain or cognitive reserve. This study aimed to investigate how LCP affects cognitive aging and the onset of dementia by examining the natural trajectory of cognitive changes in the older Korean adults.\nMethod: Longitudinal data from 139 of the initial 243 individuals enrolled in the Cognitive Aging Study were analyzed using mixed-effect and logistic regression models. We examined cognitive trends of LCP individuals and the predictive power of LCP for dementia conversion.\nResults: First, the cognitive function of the LCP group increased slightly over the first three years but began to decline sharply thereafter compared to normal cognitive performance (NCP) group. Second, the dementia conversion rate was about five times higher in LCP group than NCP group at the final follow-up.\nDiscussion: LCP is associated with an increased long-term risk of developing dementia, although it is not necessarily a sign of cognitive impairment in individuals with low education. These findings suggest that the cognitive performance of a normal individual may reflect currently available cognitive resources and could serve as a potential index of cognitive reserve.",

In conclusion, we have found that from the cognition curve, an experience curve, a happiness curve, a well-being curve, and a thinking curve can be derived, all of which have the same normally distributed probability density function. We also found that after a sufficient amount of time, all curves become uniformly distributed around the mean, and that neither the degree of cognition, the degree of experience, the degree of passive happiness, the degree of active happiness, nor the degree of thinking can be predicted. Next, as a method to prevent depression from worsening, we discussed comparing oneself to one's past self or others using stochastic differential equations. We demonstrated that when comparing oneself to one's past self, one should compare areas where progress has been made, and that when considering using stochastic differential equations, comparisons with others are not possible. Additionally, we introduced a similarity curve, considering that cognition is similar to the past, and clarified that the properties of the similarity curve are the same as those of the cognition curve. Finally, we considered the mathematical treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and discussed a method for alleviating obsessive-compulsive disorder using similarity curves.",

A partir de una integración clínica, teórica y simbólica, se analiza la hipótesis de una atracción vincular de tipo estructural entre ambos perfiles, donde el dinamismo, impulsividad y creatividad del sujeto TDAH opera como agente de expansión o “atractor caótico”, mientras que la rigidez, perfeccionismo y necesidad de control del perfil OCPD actúan como “contenedor estructurante”.

This work\nelaborates the ANFA Conference Mission, “…the range of human experiences that occur in context with\nelements of architecture, both exterior and interior...” by expanding the constructs of ‘human’ to ‘agent’\nand ‘elements of architecture’ to include all physical and non-physical architectures that function as part\nof an agent’s ecological niche [18]. This reframing of the constructs of and relationships between humans\nand architecture is useful for modeling and analyzing interactions between humans, other intelligent\nagents, and their environments, because it puts all agents and environmental elements into one unified\nrepresentational framework, defining them through a single, consistent, comprehensive schema with\nshared constructs and measures. This agent-based information processing systems assessment\nframework is especially useful now, as designers and researchers develop new constructs, methods, and\ntools for modeling, analyzing, simulating, and designing smart environments (e.g., smart cities, intelligent\nbuildings, interactive environments, augmented cognition, etc.) [3, 4, 26,43]. As part of expanding the\nsense of what constitutes a ‘cognizing agent’ and an ‘architecture’, readers/attendees are introduced to\nemerging system types, including: complex, interactive architectural systems (CIAS) [1], cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS) [16, 24, 25, 31, 32, 54, 55], socio-technical systems (STS) [14], cyber-social systems\n(CSS) [30], ultra-large scale systems (ULS) [33], complex, large, integrated, open systems (CLIOS) [10,\n29, 44], multi-scale systems (MSS) [21], and the Internet-of Things-Enabled Smart City Framework [4,\n30]. These emerging systems entail increased complexity, a high degree of real-time interactivity\nbetween agents (people, buildings, other organisms, hardware, software), and an accelerated rate of\nadaptation/evolution [26].",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrative framework linking quantum informational fields, endogenous bioelectric signaling, and linguistic patterning in biological systems as foundational to morphogenesis and consciousness. Drawing on models from Bohm’s implicate order, biofield physics, and emerging data from wave genetics and biophoton research, it outlines a hypothesis in which biological structure and cognitive function are not merely outcomes of genomic coding but active, field-mediated phenomena. The hypothesis suggests that DNA operates both as a receiver and transmitter of nonlocal information, modulating development through vibrational coherence and semantically structured fields. The framework synthesizes findings from Levin’s work on bioelectric patterning, Popp’s biophoton theory, and linguistic wave theory to argue for a field-based mechanism that underlies cellular organization, memory storage, and potentially even intention-driven effects. This model presents a challenge to classical gene-centric biology by proposing that semantic and energetic coherence across biological systems plays a central role in form and function. Implications include new directions for regenerative medicine, consciousness studies, and biocommunication, as well as a possible theoretical basis for observed anomalies in psi research and intentional influence on physical systems.\n\nKeywords\nQuantum biology, bioelectric signaling, morphogenesis, consciousness, biophotons, wave genetics, implicate order, nonlocality, semantic fields, psi phenomena",

Polarization between Democrats and Republicans accelerated during the early 1990s and the mid-2010s. The latter acceleration coincided with the rise of the “Black Lives Matter” movement, and it was driven by a surge of legislative support for civil rights among racial minority Democrats. Content analyses show that civil rights legislation supporting racial minorities, women and the LGBTQ+ community has polarized most, while legislation supporting the elderly and disabled has declined in both parties. Our findings offer new insights into party polarization, race and ethnicity politics, and collective action tipping points.

          "authors": "Tom Bielen",
          "abstract": "Conversational AI holds promise for scalable mental health screening, yet its impact on therapeutic\nalliance and user perceptions remains underexplored. This preregistered, cross-sectional, randomized\nmixed-methods experiment (N = 149) evaluated the effects of an empathic GPT-4-powered chatbot (Elli)\nversus a static PHQ-9/GAD-7 form on trust, comfort, empathy, and emotional disclosure. Participants\nwere randomly assigned to either condition. Quantitative outcomes included measures of confidence,\ncomfort, and perceived empathy. Qualitative feedback was analyzed thematically. Primary analyses\nemployed independent t-tests and Mann–Whitney U tests, with Cohen’s d effect sizes reported.\nExploratory analyses included gender and age interactions, as well as mediation modeling. All analyses\nwere conducted in Python and are openly available on GitHub. Trust in the Elli chatbot was significantly\nlower than in the static form (p = .004, d = –0.49). Comfort and empathy ratings showed no significant\ndifferences. Dropout analysis revealed no condition-related attrition (χ² = 0.37, p = .54). Qualitative\nfeedback highlighted discomfort with artificial empathy and a perceived lack of human presence in the\nchatbot condition. No significant differences emerged for PHQ-9 or GAD-7 severity. Mediation analysis\nrevealed that empathy did not account for the trust gap. Contrary to expectations, the GPT-4 chatbot\nreduced user trust compared to a static form. These findings suggest emotional authenticity may be\nmore critical than simulated empathy in digital mental health tools.",

          "abstract": "How does information infrastructure shape long-term cultural evolution? Using over four centuries of professional game records from the game of Go, this study explores how strategic dynamics in opening moves reflect historical shifts in the `infostructure' of skilled Go players. Drawing from recent work on how population size, AI, and information technology affect cultural evolution and innovation dynamics, I analyse over 118,000 games using measures of cultural diversity, divergence, and player network composition. The results show distinct eras of collective innovation and homogenization, including an early 20th-century explosion of novel opening strategies, a Cold-War-era die-off, and a recent increase in evolutionary tempo with the arrival of the internet and superhuman AI programmes like AlphaGo. Player population size shows an inverse--U relationship with opening move diversity, and a recent decline in strategic diversity has accompanied a shift in the player network, from many small subgroups to a few large ones. Surprisingly, the influence of AI has produced only a modest, short-lived disruption in the distribution of opening moves, suggesting convergence between humans and AI and incremental rather than revolutionary cultural change.",

Children,\nhowever, tend to be inclusive or conjunctive ('The mouse carried both') with simplex and complex\ndisjunctions alike. While previous studies focused on one simplex and one complex disjunction, the\npresent study investigates multiple simplex disjunctions (neutral and prosodically marked \"sau\") and\ncomplex disjunctions (\"sau. . . sau\", \"fie. . . fie\") in child Romanian. We ask whether children’s conjunctive\ninterpretation of disjunction is an experimental artifact that arises in contexts where the disjunctive\nstatement mentions all visible objects in the display, in which case it should disappear in contexts\nwhere the disjunctive statement is made more informative. We also ask what role prosodic and\nmorphological markedness play in the interpretation of disjunction. We conducted two Truth Value\nJudgment Tasks in prediction mode. In Experiment 1, the visual displays contained two objects,\nand the disjunctive test sentences mentioned both; while adults were exclusive, children responded\nin a conjunctive manner to \"fie. . . fie\", but were inclusive elsewhere. In Experiment 2, the visual\ndisplays contained two additional unmentioned objects; children were inclusive with \"sau\"-based\ndisjunctions, showing no sensitivity to prosodic/morphological markedness, but a considerable\nnumber of children persisted in their conjunctive behaviour with \"fie. . . fie\". Our findings support\nthe view that, at least for some disjunctions, the conjunctive interpretation is a genuine semantic\ninterpretation in development.",

However, initial urge intensity may also be shaping children’s ability to delay. In the present study, we examined whether age contributed to differences in the consumption of M&amp;M sweets in the delay of gratification and a baseline spontaneous intake condition, which served as an indicator of initial urge intensity. The study was conducted in 186 children aged 5 to 10 years across Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, and Slovenia, representing the first remote adaptation of the delay of gratification task. The results showed that older children consumed less across both conditions, and that this effect was found to be moderated by inhibition. These results suggest that baseline urge intensity may represent a shared mechanism underlying delayed gratification and spontaneous intake, with implications for understanding the development and support of self-control.",

This paper synthesizes findings from 47 studies to demonstrate how principles from information bottleneck theory and network controllability metrics can explain the phenomenon of neurodivergent specialization. The characteristic ‘spiky profiles’ commonly observed in ADHD, autism, aphantasia, and related conditions reflect neural architectures optimized for different computational trade-offs, such as balancing prediction accuracy, feedback integration, and energy efficiency (Kleinman et al., 2024; Millidge et al., 2024). Meta-analytic evidence supports strengths-based interventions, revealing notable effect sizes for social engagement (g=0.65), cognitive development (g=0.48), and language acquisition (g=0.32).

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "When multiple candidate models with different perspectives---particularly those with multilevel data structures---are used to explain student achievement, researchers face significant model uncertainty. Current popular ensemble learning methods impose restrictive assumption that candidate models collectively capture all relevant predictive information. This assumption becomes problematic across many research contexts, particularly in educational assessment, where theoretical frameworks often provide incomplete representations of the complex processes underlying student learning. We address this limitation through three key methodological advances: (1) using nonparametric approaches that learn how model weights should vary across different contexts, (2) removing the sum-to-one constraint while adding an intercept term to capture unexplained variation, and (3) delivering personalized predictions with well-calibrated uncertainty quantification within a computationally efficient framework. Our proposed method flexibly identifies the relative importance of different predictors across cluster levels and assigns optimal model weights accordingly. Through simulation studies and empirical analysis of PISA 2018 data, we demonstrate substantial improvements in predictive accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and computational performance over current popular methods. This methodology offers the greatest advantages when applied to heterogeneous student populations across diverse educational settings, where the relevance of different candidate models varies systematically by context.",

First, unemployed people represent 0.03% of all articles published during the study period. Second, we identify six mostly disembodied frames that reflect activation policies and almost exclusively individualize the cause of unemployment: unemployed people as statistics and economic data, political debates on unemployment, implementation of unemployment policies, local and organizational support, personal stories and realities of unemployment, and collective actions. Only the frame of personal stories correlates with unemployment rate, suggesting increased humanization during economic crises. Third, when depicted, unemployed individuals are portrayed as persevering and willing poor men in need of guidance and support, who adhere to a strong social norm to work and take personal responsibility for their situation.",

I show these three parameters are\nboth necessary and sufficient—no subset suffices, and no additional parameters are\nneeded. The theory makes specific testable predictions: memory decay follows t−α/2\npower laws, different cognitive domains exhibit distinct entropy scaling exponents,\nand decision probabilities follow entropy-gated softmax distributions. Applications\ninclude cognitive decision optimization, adaptive learning dynamics, and multi-agent\nsynchronization. This work provides the first complete mathematical foundation for\nunderstanding how cognitive systems transition from distributed uncertainty to crys-\ntallized belief states, with direct implications for artificial intelligence, neuroscience,\nand collective intelligence systems.",

          "authors": "Arie Todd Greenleaf",
          "abstract": "Modern science, from physics to biology, rests on a foundational assumption: entities are primary, and the relations between them are secondary. This paper argues that this substance-first ontology is the principal barrier to a scientific theory of consciousness and proposes its inversion: relations are fundamental.\nFrom this new paradigm, termed Dynergeia, a specific, falsifiable theory of consciousness naturally emerges. It posits that experience is instantiated whenever five universal relational patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) achieve dynamic coherence within a system’s native temporal window (τ). This state is quantified by a substrate-agnostic metric, Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS), which makes high-risk predictions, including a precise collapse under anesthesia and a strong correlation with cross-species behavioral flexibility.\nThis relational framework does not merely offer a new solution; it dissolves the old problems. The \"hard problem\" is revealed as a category error. Time is reframed as an emergent architecture constructed by coordinated events. The result is a proposed unification of the physical and phenomenological worlds, grounded not in a shared substance, but in a shared universal grammar. This work presents a direct, empirical test of a new foundation for science itself.",

          "abstract": "In a recent landmark effort, an international collaboration of cognitive scientists produced Psych-101, the largest behavioral dataset on human cognition described in natural language, comprising over 10 million human decisions across 160 psychological experiments. Building on this resource, the authors fine-tuned a pretrained large language model (LLM) to predict human choices in these experiments, called Centaur. While Centaur demonstrates impressive predictive performance—especially compared to domain-specific cognitive models—we find that much of its advantage stems from leveraging sequential dependencies in human choices. Over-reliance on such dependencies risks marginalizing the task-driven mechanisms that are also central to explaining human behavior. By reanalyzing the original Centaur model through controlled experiments that isolate task information and choice history, we find that Centaur outperforms domain-specific cognitive models even when no psychological task is provided, yet underperforms in other tasks where choice history is removed. These findings suggest that Centaur may have learned a shortcut that is insensitive to psychological tasks.",

While traditionally shrouded in esoteric language and mystical symbolism, this study demystifies the text by framing it as a practical guide to inner light meditation. Drawing on the emerging field of phosphene phenomenology, we suggest that the “Golden Light” described by Master Lü Dongbin (circa 8th–9th century CE) corresponds with meditation-induced luminous phenomena commonly reported in deep contemplative practice. We examine the phenomenological markers and confirmatory signs detailed in the text, such as the perception of inner light, bodily dissolution, auditory shifts, and upward floating sensations, and relate them to modern accounts of entoptic imagery and altered states of consciousness. Through this synthesis, we reframe the Golden Flower as a coherent and instructive map for engaging with the luminous dimensions of consciousness through focused inner light awareness.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrative framework linking quantum informational fields, endogenous bioelectric signaling, and linguistic patterning in biological systems as foundational to morphogenesis and consciousness. Drawing on models from Bohm’s implicate order, biofield physics, and emerging data from wave genetics and biophoton research, it outlines a hypothesis in which biological structure and cognitive function are not merely outcomes of genomic coding but active, field-mediated phenomena. The hypothesis suggests that DNA operates both as a receiver and transmitter of nonlocal information, modulating development through vibrational coherence and semantically structured fields. The framework synthesizes findings from Levin’s work on bioelectric patterning, Popp’s biophoton theory, and linguistic wave theory to argue for a field-based mechanism that underlies cellular organization, memory storage, and potentially even intention-driven effects. This model presents a challenge to classical gene-centric biology by proposing that semantic and energetic coherence across biological systems plays a central role in form and function. Implications include new directions for regenerative medicine, consciousness studies, and biocommunication, as well as a possible theoretical basis for observed anomalies in psi research and intentional influence on physical systems.\n\nKeywords\nQuantum biology, bioelectric signaling, morphogenesis, consciousness, biophotons, wave genetics, implicate order, nonlocality, semantic fields, psi phenomena",

Using over four centuries of professional game records from the game of Go, this study explores how strategic dynamics in opening moves reflect historical shifts in the `infostructure' of skilled Go players. Drawing from recent work on how population size, AI and information technology affect cultural evolution and innovation dynamics, I analyse over 118,000 games using measures of cultural diversity, divergence, and player network composition. The results show distinct eras of collective innovation and homogenization, including an early 20th-century explosion of novel opening strategies, a Cold-War-era die-off, and a recent increase in evolutionary tempo with the arrival of the Internet and superhuman AI programmes like AlphaGo. Player population size shows an inverse-U relationship with opening move diversity, and community detection algorithms indicate the recent decline in diversity accompanied a shift from many small subgroups in the player network to a few large ones. Surprisingly, the influence of AI has produced only a modest, short-lived disruption in opening move diversity, suggesting human-AI convergence and incremental, rather than revolutionary, change.",

          "abstract": "The paper proposes a first structured modeling of constructional networks in graph-theoretic terms. We discuss the connection between graph theory and constructionist theory, and provide a linguistic and constructional interpretation for some major graph metrics. We illustrate the proposal by applying it to a network of constructions employed to create denominal psychological predicates in Italian. In particular, we employ graph metrics to asses to what extent synthetic and analytic constructions can be said to belong to the same paradigm of denominal verb formation. The results show the complex nature of the relationship between synthetic and analytic patterns: on one hand, it seems that the constructions in the network belong to more than one paradigm, based on their structural features; on the other, such paradigms seem to be tightly linked in some domains, such as the causative one, which constitute a bridge between constructions showing different levels of structural complexity. Overall, the analysis shows the advantages of developing a sound methodology to assess the relational behavior of constructions: in fact, it allows us to coherently describe networks of constructions, but also to operationalize concepts such as prototypicality and paradigmaticity in such networks. Nonetheless, it also shows the necessity of a careful theoretical and methodological discussion on the nature of objects in Construction Grammar.",

          "abstract": "Morality-as-Cooperation Theory (MAC) views moral values in terms of seven distinct domains presumably evolved to resolve conflicts in social interactions. This study aimed to examine reliability and validity of the Persian translation of Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (N = 552) and a preliminary set of MAC violation vignettes (N = 342). External scales used for convergent validity of MAC-Q included Moral Foundations Questionnaire and Liberty items, Family Values Scale, Schwartz Values Scale, Social Dominance Orientation, and Virtues in Action Scale. Both correlated seven-factor and second-order individualizing-binding two-factor models showed good fit, particularly for separate Relevance and Judgement sections of the questionnaire. Alphas were generally higher for Relevance than Judgement subscales. The majority of MAC-Q, especially Judgement, subscales correlated significantly and most strongly with their corresponding external scales. Moreover, MAC-Q, especially Judgement, also made significant improvement over MFQ in predicting most external scales. In light of present findings, MAC-Q subscales most in need of enhancing internal consistency or content refinement are highlighted and discussed.  Of the initial set of 27 vignettes developed to represent MAC violations in this study, 10 showed domain overlap as indicated by the wrongness reasons identified by respondents. Criterion validity of vignettes in predicting MAC-Q subscales was fairly satisfactory, though varying across moral domains and the two sets. Based on findings and drawing upon the recently proposed concept of moral molecules, we recommended two mini-sets of first-order and second-order moral vignettes to guide future attempts at vignette development for MAC domains.",

          "abstract": "Emotions are internal states that can be difficult to describe verbally. Worldwide, emotions are frequently conveyed, either metonymically or metaphorically, by color terms, although differences in color-emotion associations are observed cross-linguistically and cross-culturally. In this paper, we adopted a corpus-based approach to this issue and searched for collocations of basic color terms and basic words for emotions in Spanish vs. Mandarin. Results show some notable cross-linguistic similarities, as well as noticeable differences. Overall, collocations differ significantly between the two languages, with such differences being mostly driven by black, white, red, yellow, and pink. At the same time, overall, both languages associate the same colors with the same emotions, with such similarities being mostly driven by the notable similitudes in the use of black and pink, with other colors being used more differently. Cross-linguistic differences are thus more quantitative in nature than qualitative. We hypothesize that the observed similarities reflect common bodily experiences and cognitive processes involved in color-emotion association, whereas the dissimilarities can be due to differences in the cultural contexts, linguistic conventions, and social norms. Finally, we found that the associations revealed by our corpus approach resemble findings by research conducted with human participants and Large Language Models.",

They tend to define comorbidity as an accumulation of separate psychiatric diagnoses, each with its own characteristic symptom profile. If there’s more than one of them, then they’re comorbid. As a result, clinicians end up treating a variety of symptoms without considering their hierarchical structure. In fact, symptoms thought to point to an independent diagnosis often simply are expressions of or sequela to an underlying disorder – effects instead of causes. We explore the possibility space of psychiatric syndrome dynamics and propose a system of ordinary differential equations that identify which is which. We describe how sequelae emerge from primary system dynamics without acquiring separate etiological status. We offer examples throughout, provide testable empirical hypothesis implementing the model we propose and conclude with a discussion of the clinical implications of our approach.",

How do gestures facilitate learning? We tested 8- to 10-year-old children (N = 76) using fNIRS to measure neural activity as they watched gesture-based or action-based videotaped lessons. Gesture-based instruction elicited greater intersubject neural synchrony in the motor cortex and angular gyrus, a region implicated in arithmetic processing. Critically, synchrony in the right angular gyrus during gesture instruction predicted learning gains, whereas synchrony during action-based instruction did not. Our findings indicate that gestures foster shared representations in brain regions supporting arithmetic reasoning, and highlight fNIRS as a powerful tool for capturing how learning unfolds in children.",

Structured appendices transform supplementary materials from passive data dumps into machine-readable knowledge bases containing executable code, documented protocols, and FAIR data repositories. This dual-audience framework addresses current communication failures while creating infrastructure for responsible AI integration. Publishers can differentiate themselves by hosting interactive knowledge packages rather than static PDFs, enabling AI-assisted querying, translation, and analysis. The approach restructures peer review by allowing efficient evaluation of front-loaded narratives and precise auditing of computational components through executable appendices. Widespread adoption would generate a curated corpus of structured, verified research data superior to current AI training materials, thereby creating a virtuous cycle where better scientific infrastructure produces more reliable AI assistants.",

          "abstract": "The question of whether humans have free will or not is longstanding in the areas of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. While the issue has not been resolved, determinist and compatibilist frameworks have received support from the neuropsychological data. In both cases, decisions are made within a broader framework of causal determinism. If thoughts and behaviours are inevitable consequences of a continuous chain of cause-effect events, why do we feel free? Here, we propose a neuropsychological model for the experience of free will as a conditioned illusion – a misattribution of causality reinforced through operant learning. Drawing on classical findings such as the readiness potential preceding conscious intention and more recent work on active inference, we argue that the temporal contiguity of premotor and motor activations gives rise to superstitious conditioning, shaping an experience of – and belief in – free will that is compatible with determinism. Sustained by dopaminergic circuits and reinforced by sensorimotor feedback loops, our framework situates free will as an experiential phenomenon rooted in the functional neuroanatomy of learning. We discuss implications for medicine, ethics, law, and suggest conditions under which the experience of free will may be disrupted or restructured by disease, pharmacology, and reinforcement history.",

          "authors": "Thalia Vrantsidis",
          "abstract": "People often prefer simpler explanations over more complex ones, but the function of this preference remains unclear. Does simplicity serve to increase the accuracy of explanation evaluations, improve efficiency, or both? The current research investigates this question in the context of evaluating which of two competing explanations is more likely—one simple (involving a single cause) and one complex (involving two causes)—when base rate probabilities are either provided or inferred from background knowledge. Across two studies (N = 766), participants were asked to evaluate explanations under different goal conditions (accuracy vs. efficiency) and report the information they relied on. Results showed that simplicity was used more under accuracy goals than efficiency goals, was generally combined with probability information rather than used as an alternative to it, and was associated with more accurate—but slower—judgments. These findings suggest that simplicity is primarily used to promote accuracy, not efficiency, in explanation evaluation. This work provides one of the first direct empirical tests of the goals underlying simplicity preferences. It challenges the idea that simplicity primarily functions as a cognitive shortcut to increase efficiency, and instead supports the view that simplicity helps people better approximate probabilistic reasoning. These findings offer new insights into the cognitive role of simplicity and the strategies people use to evaluate competing explanations.",

Basado en estudios sobre el Complejo Principal de Histocompatibilidad (MHC/HLA), neurobiología del apego y co-regulación somática, se explica cómo la preferencia olfativa por cuerpos genéticamente distintos opera como una estrategia evolutiva para maximizar la diversidad inmunológica en potenciales descendencias (Wedekind et al., 1995), y cómo esta preferencia desencadena activaciones neuroquímicas de calma, oxitocina y resonancia límbica.\n\nSe integran hallazgos de neuroimagen (Pause, 2012), evidencia sobre reducción de cortisol mediante exposición al olor de la pareja (Hofer et al., 2018), y teorías del apego afectivo-somático (Schore, 1994; Feldman, 2012), mostrando cómo el contacto físico sintonizado no erótico en contextos olfativos agradables opera como vehículo restaurativo y memoria emocional intersubjetiva. Se enfatiza que este fenómeno, si bien empíricamente evidente, ha sido históricamente invisibilizado en la literatura clínica y académica formal, a pesar de su universalidad y validación colectiva.\n\nEste modelo se presenta como parte de la Terapia Maternal Restaurativa basada en Contacto Humano (TMR), y tiene potencial terapéutico para resignificar el contacto físico en adultos que han experimentado represión o trauma vinculado al tacto.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

These early findings provided evidence that infants may engage in social evaluation. There have now been multiple failures to replicate the original findings, and these failed replication attempts have called into question whether infants engage in social evaluation. In the present paper, we contextualize these failed replication attempts in the broader literature. We review evidence that infants and toddlers evaluate a range of social behaviors, including acts of physical harm, resource distribution, comforting, imitation, and dominance. We also review evidence that infants and toddlers have demonstrated other behaviors, beyond preferential reaching, that suggest that they engage in social evaluation. The larger body of evidence therefore supports the possibility that early social evaluation is a real phenomenon. We discuss how cognitive scientists can better study early social evaluation moving forward.",

          "abstract": "When one person is generous to another, what expectations does this act create? Experiments and theory suggest that people often expect reciprocation: at the next opportunity, the generous act will be returned by the previous recipient. Yet in daily life and in ethnographic observations, a generous act often sets a precedent: at the next opportunity, people expect the generous act to be repeated by the same person. Under what conditions, then, does a generous act create expectations of reciprocation versus set a precedent? We test the hypothesis that a key variable is the structure of the social relationship. Across six experiments, using both third-party judgments of vignettes and first-person decisions in incentivized economic games, people only expected reciprocity in equal or symmetric relationships. Otherwise, people expected generosity to set a precedent for the same person to be generous in the future, both without any relationship information and in asymmetric relationships, both up and down hierarchies, and across a variety of familiar roles, situations, and cost structures. These data suggest that prior evidence and theory concerning expectations of reciprocation, alternation, and turn-taking may be restricted to contexts in which the interacting people are strangers, peers, friends, or in other equal relationships, and do not generalize to interacting in the other kinds of social relations that characterize much of social life.",

          "authors": "Leslie Yarbrough",
          "abstract": "Matthew 27 : 52–53 preserves a brief, enigmatic notice: at Christ’s resurrection “many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised” and “appeared to many.”  Patristic writers acknowledge the event yet remain silent about the later fate of these holy ones.  By the High-Middle Ages, however, Europe teemed with tales of revenants and vampires—incorrupt corpses that rise by night, drink blood, and flee the cross.  This paper proposes that the vampire legend is a distorted cultural memory of that first-century resurrection ripple.\nStage 1 reconstructs the historical kernel: glorified witnesses briefly walking in Jerusalem.  Stage 2 traces Roman polemic that mis-construed the Eucharist as a cannibalistic “blood-feast,” merging immortality with blood-drinking.  Stage 3 follows the rumour into medieval folk religion, where plague-era corpse panic transformed reports of incorrupt saints into fear of the restless dead.  Stage 4 shows how Slavic burial customs weaponised Christian symbols (cross, holy water, Host) against these revenants, cementing an “anti-sacrament” mythology later fossilised by Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897).\nBy mapping biblical text, patristic hints, imperial slander, and ethnographic data, the study suggests that the vampire may function as a negative photograph of Christian immortality: every folkloric weakness inverts a saintly strength.  Re-examining Matthew 27 therefore invites theologians and folklorists alike to treat resurrection narratives as potential seeds of European vampire lore and to recognise how sacred memory can ossify into secular myth when refracted through fear and time.",

          "abstract": "In the past few decades, interest in children’s spatial thinking has increased substantially, and consequently, interest in spatial assessments for children has also increased. However, there are not many reliable, validated, and widely accessible spatial assessments for this segment of the population, which affects researchers' ability to conduct and interpret spatial thinking research. While some limitations of these tests relate to broader issues with spatial assessments in general (see Uttal et al., 2024), creating assessments that are appropriate for children presents unique challenges. In this chapter, we review the current state of tests of children’s spatial thinking, including mental rotation and perspective-taking. We draw on insights from psychometrics, open science, and cognitive development research. Furthermore, we examine how spatial assessments affect research on the relation between spatial and STEM abilities, particularly research aimed at leveraging spatial thinking through interventions and training that improve children’s spatial skills and, in turn, their STEM performance (i.e., Bruce &amp; Hawes, 2015; Cheng &amp; Mix, 2014; Hawes et al., 2022; Judd &amp; Klingberg, 2021; Mix et al., 2021). Lastly, we outline recommendations for improving these assessments to ultimately improve research and theory creation on the development of spatial thinking.",

          "abstract": "Memories tend to form networks that reflect relationships between experiences. These networks, or cognitive graphs, have been used to study how structural features of memory can bias decisions—analogous to how reward shapes choices by prioritizing reward-associated items in memory. However, how reward interacts with the structure of existing cognitive graphs to influence subsequent value-based decisions remains unclear. Across three experiments, participants learned a community-structured cognitive graph, reconstructed it, learned which item in the graph is associated with reward, and then made value-based decisions. Results indicated a limited retroactive spread of reward, contingent on access to an explicit representation of either the cognitive graph or reward-item associations. In their absence, participants’ choices revealed a reorganization of the cognitive graph structure. These findings suggest that explicit memory representations enable reward to spread broadly across association space; without them, reward actively reshapes associative memory structures to support value-based decision making.",

          "abstract": "Wer sich mit dem Nordfriesischen beschäftigt, stellt schnell fest, dass diese Sprache von Politiker:innen meist ‚Friesisch‘ genannt und als ‚Minderheitensprache‘ kategorisiert wird. Sprachwissenschaftler:innen nennen sie jedoch eher ‚Nordfriesisch‘ und kategorisieren sie u.a. als ‚bedrohte Sprache‘ — zumindest, wenn sie im deutschsprachigen Raum arbeiten, denn im englischsprachigen Raum gibt es wieder andere Begriffe. Im Gegensatz hierzu verwenden Muttersprachler:innen von den Nordfriesischen Inseln typischerweise die Eigenbezeichnung ihres Dialekts (z.B. „Sölring\" auf Sylt oder „öömrang\" auf Amrum) und Muttersprachler:innen vom Festland das in ihrem Dialekt übliche Wort für ‚Friesisch‘ (z.B. „freesk\" in der Wiedingharde oder „frasch\" in der Bökingharde). Des Weiteren identifizieren die Nordfries:innen sich als Volksgruppe statt als Minderheit, und sie interpretieren den Begriff ‚bedrohte Sprache‘ meist anders als er in der Wissenschaft definiert ist. Dies bedeutet, dass sie ihre Sprache tendenziell auch nicht auf die gleiche Weise kategorisieren, wie Politiker:innen oder Sprachwissenschaftler:innen es tun, sondern sie stattdessen eher als ‚Familiensprache‘ beschreiben. Und dies ist erst die Spitze des Eisbergs, was die Begrifflichkeit in Bezug auf das Nordfriesische angeht. \nIn diesem Artikel thematisieren wir die Vielfalt der Sprachbegrifflichkeit am Beispiel des Nordfriesischen. Wir thematisieren und problematisieren die vielen Begriffe, mit denen das Nordfriesische (a) bezeichnet und (b) kategorisiert wird, wobei wir jeweils drei Ebenen unterscheiden: (1) die politische, (2) die wissenschaftliche und (3) die gesellschaftliche Ebene. Den Abschluss unseres Artikels bildet eine Diskussion, in der wir schlussendlich die Wichtigkeit des Eingehens auf die relevante Zielgruppe im jeweiligen Kontext unterstreichen.",

          "title": "The Relational Universe: How Consciousness Reveals the Organizational Grammar of Reality",
          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Modern science, from physics to biology, rests on a foundational assumption: entities are primary, and the relations between them are secondary. This paper argues that this substance-first ontology is the principal barrier to a scientific theory of consciousness and proposes its inversion: relations are fundamental.\nFrom this new paradigm, termed Dynergeia, a specific, falsifiable theory of consciousness naturally emerges. It posits that experience is instantiated whenever five universal relational patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) achieve dynamic coherence within a system’s native temporal window (τ). This state is quantified by a substrate-agnostic metric, Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS), which makes high-risk predictions, including a precise collapse under anesthesia and a strong correlation with cross-species behavioral flexibility.\nThis relational framework does not merely offer a new solution; it dissolves the old problems. The \"hard problem\" is revealed as a category error. Time is reframed as an emergent architecture constructed by coordinated events. The result is a proposed unification of the physical and phenomenological worlds, grounded not in a shared substance, but in a shared universal grammar. This work presents a direct, empirical test of a new foundation for science itself.",

          "title": "Prosodic grouping in Papuan Malay, Akan and German",
          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Grouping is an important function of prosody because it helps listeners to break down the speech signal into smaller units. Specific acoustic cues, in particular duration and intensity, have been reported to determine how disyllabic units (i.e., feet) are grouped across languages (Iambic-Trochaic Law - ITL). However, previous work has shown that speakers of different languages vary in the extent to which they use the ITL. It has been proposed that the linguistic modulation of the ITL relates to cross-linguistic differences in word and phrase prosody. The present study further investigates the predictions of the ITL in two under-researched languages, Papuan  Malay and Akan, which have been reported to have no or highly regular word stress. They are compared to German, a well-researched language with variable word stress. A perceptual grouping task used in previous work is replicated with listeners from each language. The results show considerable cross-linguistic differences between the languages and are interpreted in line with the (word) prosodic properties of Papuan Malay and Akan. The outcomes reconfirm cross-linguistic variability and modulation of the limited applicability of the ITL across languages, and they provide insights into the word-prosodic structure (e.g., word stress, tone) of the respective languages.",
