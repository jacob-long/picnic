          "authors": "Manuel Martín Algarra",
          "abstract": "The ongoing debate over communication’s identity may appear excessive, yet it plays a crucial role by enabling exploration beyond the field, including its core object of study. In communication research, this debate serves as self-reflection, and this article argues that perceived incoherence arises less from a lack of common ground and more from an incomplete grasp of communication’s ontological reality. Drawing on Craig’s constitutive metamodel, Einstein’s reflections on scientific fundamentals, and Cooren’s concepts of materiality and sociality, this article explores the necessity for communication to address its essential nature, similar to other sciences. It concludes that an ontological turn in communication theory is essential to advance beyond current definitional debates and better comprehend how communication constitutes the social world.",

          "title": "Meta-regression to explain shrinkage and heterogeneity in large-scale replication projects",
          "authors": "Rachel Heyard; Leonhard Held",
          "abstract": "Recent large-scale replication projects (RPs) have estimated concerningly low reproducibility rates. Further, they reported substantial degrees of shrinkage of effect size, where the replication effect size was found to be, on average, much smaller than the original effect size. Within these RPs, the included original-replication study-pairs can vary with respect to aspects of study design, outcome measures, and descriptive features of both original and replication study population and study team. This often results in between-study-pair heterogeneity, i.e., variation in effect size differences across study-pairs that goes beyond expected statistical variation. When broader claims about the reproducibility of an entire field are based on such heterogeneous data, it becomes imperative to conduct a rigorous analysis of the amount and sources of shrinkage and heterogeneity within\nand between included study-pairs. Methodology from the meta-analysis literature provides an approach for quantifying the heterogeneity present in RPs with an additive or multiplicative parameter. Meta-regression methodology further allows for an investigation into the sources of shrinkage and heterogeneity. We propose the use of location-scale meta-regressions as a means to directly relate the identified characteristics with shrinkage (represented by the location) and heterogeneity (represented by the scale). This provides valuable insights into drivers and factors associated with high or low reproducibility rates and therefore contextualises results of PRs. The proposed methodology is illustrated using publicly available data from the Replication Project Psychology and the Replication Project Experimental Economics. All analysis scripts and data are available online.",

          "authors": "Tamarinde Laura Haven; John P.A. Ioannidis",
          "abstract": "Reproducibility concerns in biomedical research have persisted for over a decade, with large-scale assessments revealing significant challenges in replicating findings. Despite widespread acknowledgement of these issues, responses remain inconsistent, and proposed solutions often lack rigorous evaluation. This review examines the factors that contribute to irreproducibility in conducting, reporting, and reviewing research and assesses the effectiveness and desirability of interventions aimed at improving reproducibility. It highlights the need for balanced scientific reforms that strengthen reproducibility without stifling innovation or introducing unintended consequences. A critical appraisal of the role of meta-research is essential to ensure sustainable improvements in research quality.",

          "abstract": "Meta-analyses in social science fields face multiple methodological challenges arising from how primary research studies are designed and reported. One challenge is that many primary studies report multiple relevant effect size estimates. Another is selective reporting bias, which arises when the availability of study findings is influenced by the statistical significance of results. Although many selective reporting diagnostics and bias-correction methods have been proposed, few are suitable for meta-analyses involving dependent effect sizes. Among available methods, step-function selection models are conceptually appealing and have shown promise in previous simulations. We study methods for estimating step-function models from data involving dependent effect sizes, focusing specifically on estimating parameters of the marginal distribution of effect sizes and accounting for dependence using cluster-robust variance estimation or bootstrap resampling. We describe two estimation strategies, demonstrate them by re-analyzing data from a synthesis on ego depletion effects, and evaluate their performance through an extensive simulation study under single-step selection. Simulation findings indicate that selection models provide low-bias estimates of average effect size and that clustered bootstrap confidence intervals provide acceptable coverage levels. However, adjusting for selective reporting bias using step-function models involves a bias-variance trade-off, and unadjusted estimates of average effect sizes may be preferable if the strength of selective reporting is mild.",

          "abstract": "Successful translation of promising preclinical findings into clinical applications remains challenging. To address the rising concerns of failing clinical trials and the resulting economic, social, and ethical burdens, preclinical confirmatory studies have been proposed to generate sufficiently robust evidence for guiding the decision-making process. Seventeen federally funded confirmatory trials in Germany were assigned to validate exploratory findings across various biomedical research fields in a rigorously planned and executed multi-laboratory set-up. Under the same funding call, the scientific accompanying module DECIDE (Decision-Enabling Confirmation of Innovative Discoveries and exploratory Evidence) provided methodological support and conducted meta-research on the design and outcome of the confirmatory projects. After the first four-year funding period, DECIDE facilitated an in-person workshop bringing together representatives from the confirmatory trials to discuss lessons learned. We summarize the outcomes of these stakeholder discussions, highlighting common pitfalls and proposing solution strategies in the experimental set-up and project coordination. As a result, we advocate for new roles – such as preclinical research coordinators – and better rules in preclinical research to facilitate large-scale academic research projects. Moreover, to effectively integrate confirmatory multi-laboratory studies into the preclinical research ecosystem, diverse stakeholders must collaborate to support robust evidence synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Social and emotional learning (SEL) has seen rapid growth in practice and evidence, yet it is increasingly caught in the crossfire of America’s culture wars. While many view SEL as a necessary tool to address student well-being and school climate, some critics accuse it of being a vehicle for progressive indoctrination. Other critics accuse it of inadequately addressing injustice and argue for integrating critical social justice (CSJ) frameworks into SEL to redress systemic inequities. This paper critically examines the tensions between traditional skills-based SEL and CSJ-oriented SEL, exploring the philosophical and practical divergences between them. It argues that the increasing politicization and conceptual ambiguity surrounding SEL jeopardize its legitimacy and effectiveness. The paper proposes “civic empiricism”—a commitment to open inquiry, rigorous evidence, and pluralistic dialogue—as a guiding principle to help the SEL field navigate ideological divides while remaining anchored to its core mission. Recommendations include fostering intellectual humility, promoting adversarial collaboration, and clarifying definitions around contested social justice concepts such as equity, antiracism, and liberation.",

          "authors": "Rachel L. Dyer; Katherine M. Zimmerman; Xinxuyang Zhao; Qiang Xie; Cortland Dahl; Andrew Quanbeck; Simon Goldberg",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, depression and anxiety have worsened among American adults. Meditation apps may provide an accessible route for reducing these symptoms. However, many users experience barriers to persisting in their use of these apps. Prior research has identified psychosocial and practical barriers and facilitators to the use of meditation apps, as well as barriers and facilitators related to the apps themselves. Yet few prior studies have drawn on frameworks from the highly relevant field of implementation science such as the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A lack of unifying implementation science frameworks has limited shared language to describe barriers and facilitators and has made it challenging to identify and account for multi-level factors impacting the implementation of meditation apps. As such, this study used CFIR to explore the implementation of the Healthy Minds Program meditation app among users experiencing elevated depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Participants (n = 20) were drawn from a meditation dosage clinical trial and interviewed about their experiences establishing a meditation practice using the Healthy Minds Program app. Using CFIR and deductive qualitative content analysis, four categories were generated: Practical Facilitators to Developing a Meditation Practice, Motivations for Developing and Maintaining a Meditation Practice, Barriers to Developing a Meditation Practice, and Recommendations for Improving the App. Overall, participants reported positive outcomes from their practice which, for some, motivated their continued use of the Healthy Minds Program app. Future research should consider how barriers and facilitators may change over time with increased engagement and experience with meditation apps and practice.",

To address this, we examined how non-musicians process both regular (temporally predictable) and irregular musical phrases derived from J.S. Bach’s compositions. This approach preserved authentic musical structure while manipulating temporal predictability. We also included control stimuli matched in acoustic properties but lacking musical structure. Behavioural and EEG measures revealed that listeners could accurately detect phrase boundaries in both regular and irregular conditions. Neural activity, indexed by an increase in low-frequency EEG power, tracked structural boundaries regardless of temporal regularity.

          "abstract": "Theories of complex thought, psychological maturation, and wisdom often rest on three core \nassumptions: that wisdom-related features reflect a common latent trait, manifest consistently \nacross situations, and exhibit isomorphism between between-person traits and within-person \nprocesses. These assumptions underlie much of the field’s empirical and theoretical work yet \nremain largely untested. We examined these assumptions in a year-long, multi-wave study of \nNorth American adults (N = 499), using event-reconstruction sampling to gather \nautobiographical reflections on adverse experiences. Participants evaluated their use of four core \nmetacognitive features of wisdom: intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change, \nperspective taking, and search for a compromise. Our findings challenge prevailing static models \nand supported a dynamic, context-sensitive account. A network model outperformed latent factor \nmodels, suggesting that wisdom comprises interrelated but distinct features rather than a unitary \nconstruct. The perceived relevance and use of these features varied across situations and showed \nlower temporal stability than personality traits or well-being, undermining assumptions of cross￾situational consistency. Within-person and between-person patterns also diverged, violating \nisomorphism. Notably, individuals who reported higher-than-usual self-distancing and distress at \none time point also reported elevated levels of wisdom-related features three months later, a \npattern not observed for other proposed moderators such as social support or subjective \nappraisals. Together, these findings offer a revised understanding of wisdom and complex \nthought—as dynamic, context-sensitive processes, rather than fixed traits. Our findings carry \nimplications for the ontological status of wisdom-related constructs and underscore the \nimportance of longitudinal research and more precise temporal claims in psychological science.",

          "abstract": "A doubly-quantified sentence like 'Every bear approached a tent is ambiguous': Did every bear approach a different tent, or did they approach the same tent? These two interpretations are assumed to be mentally represented as logical representations, which specify how the different quantifiers are assigned scope with respect to each other. Based on a structural priming study, Feiman and Snedeker (2016, Cognitive Psychology) argued that logical representations capture quantifier-specific combinatorial properties (e.g., the specification of every differs from the specification of each in logical representations). We re-examined this conclusion by testing logical representation priming in Dutch. Across four experiments, we observed that priming of logical representations emerged if the same quantifiers are repeated in prime and target, but also if the prime and target contained different quantifiers. However, logical representation priming between quantifiers emerged less consistently than priming within the same quantifier. More specifically, our results suggest that priming between quantifiers emerges more robustly if the participant is presented with quantifier variation in the prime trials than if they are presented with the same quantifier in all prime trials. When priming between quantifiers emerged, however, its strength was comparable to priming within the same quantifier. Therefore, we conclude that logical representations do not specify quantifier-specific biases in the assignment of scope.",

Laboratory-based conflictual interactions between 129 girls (aged 11-13) and their caregivers were rated for positive and negative escalation, mutuality, relationship quality and satisfaction. Concurrently and two years later, girls' maladaptive traits were assessed via self- and caregiver-reports based on the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) domains (negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism). Using a series of path models, we assessed whether dyadic interactions predicted changes in self- and caregiver reported maladaptive traits. In dyads with reduced positive interaction patterns, particularly a lack of mutuality and relationship satisfaction, girls were characterized by elevated levels of negative affect, detachment, disinhibition, and psychoticism. These patterns were notably more consistent for girls’ self-reports. Patterns of negative escalation predicted self- and caregiver reported antagonism, but they were not linked to other maladaptive trait domains. The study illustrates the importance of the caregiver-child relationship in the etiology of developmental personality pathology by establishing a link between observed caregiver-child interactions and prospective changes in key domains of maladaptive traits. It expands the literature on dyadic interaction and developmental personality pathology to the dimensional framework of the AMPD.",

          "abstract": "Humans learn adaptive behaviors via a durable but incremental reinforcement-learning (RL) system and a fast but fleeting working memory (WM) system. Past work parsing these systems focused on reward learning alone, hence little is known about how they interact while simultaneously learning to avoid punishment, and whether arbitrating between these demands is disrupted by psychiatric symptoms. We administered a novel reward/punishment RL-WM task to an online sample oversampled for depression and anxiety symptoms (N=298; n=275 after quality control). Participants avoided punishment during initial learning, yet poorly retained this avoidance. Computational modeling captured this pattern via the fleeting WM system facilitating punishment avoidance, while the durable RL system retained little about punishment. Our task also included two test phases interleaved with learning, which permitted a targeted examination of past findings that WM blunts the RL system. When RL-based retention was tested midway through learning, we indeed found evidence of blunting. Yet, after learning resumed—leading to further prediction errors—blunting was no longer evident in a final test phase. However, individual differences moderated this effect: some individuals were especially susceptible to blunting; for others, WM actually facilitated retention. Finally, task performance was largely spared as a function of depression/anxiety and trait rumination. Overall, our findings demonstrate that—when seeking to attain reward and avoiding punishment concurrently—the WM system can facilitate short-term punishment avoidance while the RL system retains little about punishment; reveal individual differences in the extent to which WM blunts RL; and demonstrate intact behavior under internalizing-disorder symptoms.",

With regard to sounds produced by musical instruments and digital devices, music is an evolved cultural means of creating sounds that elicit emotional reactions in listeners. Both non-speech vocalizations and music share their ability to encode emotional meaning in acoustic sound features, to communicate these emotions to others, and that listeners can accurately decode this meaning based on cognitive and neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we outline the various emotions that can be portrayed in voice and in music, as well as the acoustic features that are used to express these emotions. We summarize the neural mechanisms that have been discussed within the neuroscientific research fields on vocal and musical emotions and outline a unifying framework for the neurocognitive functions involved in affective sound processing. We finally describe the commonalities between vocal and musical emotion processing from a cognitive and neural perspective, but also highlight the differential effects between both emotional sound domains by suggesting a possible evolutionary perspective.",

          "authors": "Marcel Raphael Schreiner; Martin Schnuerch; John Fischer; Arndt Bröder",
          "abstract": "Objects are typically remembered with their accompanying features, suggesting that objects and features are bound together in memory. Yet, there is an ongoing debate about the configuration of such bindings, particularly whether multiple features of an object are directly linked or are only indirectly linked via the object. Here we set out to test the binding configuration of object-feature representations in long-term memory in three experiments, bridging research from the domains of object and source memory. In two experiments, participants were presented with object icons with a specific color and orientation and later performed a recognition test in which feature combinations were presented with old or new objects. Participants had to indicate both whether the object shown was old or new and which out of four feature combinations they had previously seen. In a third experiment, participants were presented with only single new objects at test and had to indicate whether the feature combination shown was old or new. This procedure allowed us to control for the presence of object information at test, which constituted a major confound in previous research. Using multinomial processing tree modeling to disentangle cognitive processes, we found evidence for a stochastic dependence of the retrieval of object features in the absence of object information. This suggests that different features of an object can be directly linked in long-term memory, challenging theoretical accounts positing that features are only indirectly linked via common links to the object and instead providing proof of concept for direct feature-feature binding.",

          "authors": "Peiyuan Zhang; Wei Ji Ma",
          "abstract": "Procrastination often gets in the way of pursuing goals that require consistent effort over extended periods. While existing theories explain isolated aspects of procrastination, the field lacks a unifying theory. We present a normative theory in which procrastination emerges as the outcome of a dynamic decision-making process: at each time point, an individual chooses between making an effort and postponing work. Using dynamic programming, we derive the time course of work. Our theory accounts for a wide range of empirical observations while making new predictions. First, the rational agent exhibits three temporal patterns of procrastination: a delay before ramping up, working at the last minute, and not working at all. Second, we predict that temporal discounting rate, reward magnitude, task aversiveness, and the utility of alternative activities correlate with the severity of procrastination. Third, we predict that the relationship between perfectionism and procrastination is contingent on moderating factors such as temporal discounting rate, rather than being a simple direct association. We provide empirical validation of the component of our theory that represents perfectionism. Fourth, we identify underexplored factors: the shape of the effort-cost function and the total allotted time. Fifth, we predict the effects of interventions that modify incentive structures: immediate rewards and intermediate deadlines. Throughout, we examine not only the severity of procrastination but also its downstream consequences in terms of task performance, reward obtained, and level of exhaustion. Overall, our framework captures the multifaceted nature of procrastination and sets the stage for new experimental directions.",

          "abstract": "Are humans primarily driven by altruism or self-interest? To address this longstanding debate, we conducted a large-scale, cross-cultural investigation of altruistic versus egoistic motivation across three key domains: legacy motives, life aspirations, and personal values. Analyzing data from over 900,000 participants across more than 100 countries, we consistently found that altruistic motivations (i.e., impact legacy, intrinsic aspirations, and self-transcendence values) were more strongly endorsed than egoistic counterparts. This pattern held across diverse cultural and socioeconomic contexts, although notable variation emerged across nations. Effect sizes were especially pronounced among individuals known for extreme altruism (e.g., effective altruists, organ donors), suggesting that these effects are unlikely to be driven by social desirability alone given the validated, real-world nature of these populations’ altruistic behaviors. Our findings challenge the assumption that prosocial concern is primarily driven by reputational concerns and suggest instead a widespread and deeply held preference for other-oriented motivations. By integrating motivational constructs with cross-cultural data, this research advances theoretical understanding of human prosocial concern and underscores the universality, and variability, of altruistic inclination across global populations.",

          "abstract": "Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ``utilitarian'' cost-benefit reasoning (CBR). Here, we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people's reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

Our findings substantiate the TRPI as a bridge between trait, type, and neurocognitive models, offering a dynamic, data-driven account of personality architecture that subsumes both classical dichotomies and contemporary trait perspectives, and situates them within a neurocognitive framework.",

          "abstract": "Spatial attention and eye movements jointly contribute to efficient sampling of visual information in the environment, but maintaining precise spatial attention across saccades becomes challenging due to the drastic retinal shifts. Previous studies provided evidence that spatial attention may remap imperfectly across saccades, incurring systematic feature inference to ongoing perception, yet the role of saccade\npredictability remains largely untested. In the current study, we investigated whether spatiotemporal predictability of saccades influences post-saccadic remapping and feature perception. In two pre- registered experiments, we implemented the post-saccadic feature report paradigm and manipulated spatiotemporal predictability of saccades. Experiment 1 manipulated spatial and temporal saccade predictability together, whereas Experiment 2 dissociated the roles of spatial and temporal predictability in separate conditions, respectively. In addition to spatial and temporal saccade predictability both improving general task performance, we found that spatial saccade predictability specifically modulated post-saccadic feature interference. When saccades were spatially unpredictable, there were “swap errors” at the early post-saccadic timepoint, where participants misreported the retinotopic color instead of the spatiotopic target color. However, the swapping errors were reduced when saccades were made spatially predictable. These results suggest that systematic feature interference associated with post-saccadic remapping is malleable to expectations of the upcoming saccade target location, highlighting the role of predictions in maintaining perceptual stability across saccades.",

However, we know quite little about how social (dis-) connection unfolds at the physiological level in real time in clinical populations, including among youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). The present laboratory-based dyadic interaction study examined physiological coregulation in 70 dyads across 137 participants (32 CHR youth-caregiver dyads; 38 healthy youth-caregiver dyads) and linked coregulation with clinical symptoms – concurrently and prospectively. This study was based in a mid-sized Midwestern city and recruited from the broader community and from mental health clinics. Data were collected from 2018 to 2022. Dyads engaged in 10-minute neutral, conflict, and pleasant conversations while their autonomic physiology was continuously monitored. In conflict and neutral conversations, CHR youth exhibited contrarian physiological coregulation (i.e., slowing heart rate in response to caregiver’s escalating heart rate and vice versa). Contrarian coregulation was associated with elevated risk for psychosis, was linked to greater baseline psychosis symptomatology, and prospectively predicted increases in symptoms one year later. These findings document alterations in physiological coregulation between CHR individuals and their caregivers, highlight their relevance for clinical symptomatology, suggest novel avenues for relationship-focused treatments, and contribute to a biologically-grounded science of social connection.",

          "authors": "Lorna Camus; Gnanathusharan Rajendran; Mary Stewart",
          "abstract": "Autistic people are highly likely to experience mental health difficulties during their lifetime (Hallett &amp; Crompton, 2018; Lever &amp; Geurts, 2016; Simonoff et al., 2008), with lifetime prevalence estimates for anxiety and depression ranging from 11 to 49% (based on meta-analyses of existing studies, Hollocks et al., 2019; Hudson et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2019). A period of their lives that may be linked to increased mental health difficulties is that of the transition from primary to secondary school. The National Autistic Society (2020) has identified this transition as challenging for autistic children and their families, however research on the matter is scarce. Therefore, we have a limited understanding of children’s experiences of transition, of the different factors and outcomes of transition, and of potential avenues for support and intervention. Hence, we sought to answer the following question: What does the secondary transition mean for autistic children? Nine autistic young people (7 boys) aged 12 to 17 years old participated in face-to-face semi-structured interview. All participants were special secondary school pupils who had experienced the transition to secondary school prior to the interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and data were analysed using thematic analysis (following recommendations from Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). Three themes were identified: 1) New school and second chances; 2) School environment; and 3) Relationships. Participants who had transitioned from mainstream to special school provision expressed being given a ‘second chance’ at education as mainstream provision was unable to support them adequately. Moreover, the school environment had an important role in the quality of participants’ transition; feelings of agency, support and safety were integral to this experience. Relationships with peers and adults at school also had a significant impact (both positive and negative) on participants’ experiences of the transition and their later well-being. Taken together, these 3 areas of participants’ experiences had a significant impact on their well-being at school following the transition. This study has implications for: 1) our understanding of transitions and mental health in autistic children, an area currently understudied; 2) best practice for transition support, by providing insight on how the transition is experienced by autistic children and by identifying critical areas for support (for example relationships with teachers and peers, and agency and safety at school); 3) our current policies for mainstreaming autistic pupils (most of this study’s participants did not benefit from the presumption of mainstreaming); and 4) autism training for teachers (development of autistic-led training to ensure adapted support and to avoid misunderstandings in school). More research with young people with identities other than cis male and mainstream pupils is needed to expand on these findings, along with further research on factors linked to psychological well-being to identify avenues for interventions to support autistic pupils transitioning to secondary school.",

Using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model, our pre-registered analyses examine how participants’ and their partners’ diagnostic statuses influence linguistic, behavioural, and kinematic indices, and how these relate to feelings of rapport among (n = 57) autistic and (n = 51) non-autistic participants interacting within autistic (n = 20), non-autistic (n = 17), and mixed autistic–non-autistic (n = 17) dyads. We found that autistic participants reported lower rapport regardless of their partner’s diagnostic status, though awareness of their partner’s diagnostic status had a moderating effect. We observed a linguistic difference, autistic participants produced longer mean utterance lengths, these and other behavioural or kinematic indices did not mediate the relationship between diagnostic status and rapport across neurotypes.

          "abstract": "Night gaps are inherent to data obtained with the experience sampling method (ESM). When such data are used to study lagged relations between variables--such as autoregression within the same variable, and cross-lagged regressions between different variables--the actual role of night gaps is typically not investigated. However, there are various methods to handle them in analyses. Common solutions involve: (1) ignoring the night gap by considering the night interval as a regular interval; (2) removing the night gap by not regressing the first measurement of the day on the last measurement of the previous day; or (3) treating the night gap as a missing data problem. The goal of this paper is to make explicit the theoretical implications of these three methods within the context of the first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) model. Additionally, we propose an alternative modeling approach that allows us to study the implications of the night gap in more detail. Moreover, given that the current methods are special cases of the proposed alternative, we can test which method best describes the process of interest. Through an empirical N=1 example with various ESM variables, we demonstrate that the best-fitting method differs per variable. This implies that some processes may exhibit different dynamics during the night than during the daytime, providing a stepping stone to understanding and modeling night gaps in ESM.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\n         Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder which affects approximately 20 million people worldwide. Patients show face processing deficits which greatly affects their social interactions and social cognitive abilities (i.e. trouble empathizing with others). Face processing is an important skill that allows humans to recognize others, detect emotions, and use these abilities for effective social interactions. Although face processing has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there has not been a systematic review investigating links between social-cognitive dysfunction, face processing networks, and clinical symptoms. Here, we comprehensively review for the first time how dysconnectivity in social cognitive networks contribute to face processing deficits and how this is tied to positive and negative symptoms. \n\nMethod\n\tReviewed studies were a.) written in English, b.) focused on face and emotion processing in schizophrenia (not limited to first episode psychosis [FEP]), and c.) were resting or task-based fMRI studies looking at face/emotion processing neural networks utilizing functional connectivity or measured functional activity broadly. Studies were excluded if they were not related to face processing, focused on different disorders (i.e. depression), used effective connectivity, included combined fMRI-other modality studies , and included non-schizophrenia patient groups. We screened studies from 2020-2025. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were utilized to pool results.  \n\nResults \n\tNine articles were reviewed. Resting state studies and task studies showed elevated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scores for FEP patients coupled with social cognition deficits. Increased suicidality in schizophrenia was tied to higher PANSS positive symptoms and impaired processing of angry faces. Increased default mode network (DMN) dysconnectivity was tied to disrupted fear recognition processing and subsequently elevated PANSS positive scores. \n\nConclusions  \nSocial-cognitive deficits broadly stem around challenges recognizing and processing negative faces. Factors such as trauma, suicidality, and inflammation should be further examined.",

          "abstract": "Understanding psychiatric disorders can involve examining how harm (distress and/or disability) arises from symptom interactions. In an original approach within the philosophy of psychiatry, we hypothesize that harm emerges from excessive relational strength between symptoms, misalignment between symptoms, and/or local instabilities of relationships, resulting in a state of pathological stability. To support these claims, in addition to the conceptual analysis developed, we anchor this work within a computational philosophy framework, recently developed in the philosophy of medicine, by utilizing theoretical simulations. We thus rely on the Ising model to demonstrate that the perceived global harm of a patient depends on three concepts derived from the Ising model, one of the most widely used models to date within the framework of symptom network theory: the Hamiltonian (strength of interactions), misalignment and temperature (propensity for instability), and free energy (overall stability). This framework highlights the role of inter-symptomatic dynamics in driving harm, offering potential insights for refining psychiatric diagnosis and adaptive treatments in psychiatric disorders.",

Gender differences in personality traits could thus stem from people relying on their self-image, identity, and gender norms when answering global trait questionnaires. Results from two German-speaking samples of N = 324 older adults and N = 1,685 younger adults revealed gender differences in global trait scores for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, but non-significant and smaller differences in corresponding average state scores. The findings are in line with theory suggesting that average state reports might be less biased, whereas global trait reports might include stereotypes and identity.",

Using semantic analysis inspired by scientometrics, we argue for a rapprochement between these fields. Specifically, we articulate numerous promising avenues of overlap and mutual influence that may hold between them, such as connecting sociocultural and media issues in communication with core linguistic and mechanistic processes in cognitive science.

We analyzed data from 70 participants who reported their momentary affect 5 times per day during a 60-day period. Instability was identified in real time from the exponentially weighted moving standard deviation (EWMSD) of their momentary affect ratings. The pleasant activity selector was applied as micro-intervention during periods of instability as well as during semi-random control periods. The results showed that the micro-intervention was not effective in improving positive affect. Moreover, the EWMSD appeared very sensitive to negative outlying values of momentary affect, instead of solely to enlarged fluctuations (the hypothesized indicator of instability). We discuss the implications for future studies that aim to test the effectiveness of JITAIs during instability.",

The emotional components we examined were (a) parents’ own emotions, (b) their perceptions of their children’s emotions, and (c) their use of self- and child-focused reappraisal and rumination strategies. Data were collected from 121 U.S. parents (Mage = 43.18 years, SD = 8.54) over 28 days, preceded by a presurvey. Three psychological networks emerged, each offering distinct yet complementary insights. The within-person temporal network uncovered reciprocal spillover effects between self- and child-focused emotion regulation, with parents’ own emotions driving fluctuations in both. The contemporaneous network revealed that parents polyregulated emotions using congruent self- and child-focused strategies within a single interaction. The between-person network revealed that emotional patterns differed between genders and were related to dispositional emotional reactivity. For this work, we adopted an integrative approach to unpacking parental emotional processing by incorporating both self-focused and child-focused emotion systems. Our findings underscore the importance of helping parents navigate parallel emotional processes to support both their own well-being and their children’s emotional development.",

          "abstract": "People’s perceptions of economic inequality are important predictors of their political attitudes and behaviors. Scholars across the social sciences have worked to understand people’s (mis)perceptions of inequality. Yet, scholars currently lack a common framework for integrating emerging findings and conceptualizing how these perceptions are formed. Here, we propose an integrative framework to help researchers highlight the psychological processes underlying how inequality is perceived. We draw on theories of perception, cognition, developmental, and social psychology to identify five interlinked, iterative components of the inequality perception process: (1) access to inequality cues, (2) attention to these cues, (3) comprehension of these cues, (4) motivated processing of these cues, and (5) meaningful summary representation of inequality. Our framework provides a roadmap for integrating research across disparate fields, making sense of current findings, and identifying novel challenges to advance future research.",

          "abstract": "Exerting cognitive effort is essential for successful engagement in demanding tasks, yet individuals differ in how they perceive and value such effort. Two key personality traits - Need for Cognition (NFC) and Willpower Beliefs - have been associated with cognitive motivation and persistence. While Subjective Values (SVs) provide a measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort, the role of task-related feedback in modulatring SVs has remained underexplored. In the present study, N = 251 participants completed an online experiment including an n-Back task, the Cognitive Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, and personality questionnaires assessing NFC and Willpower Beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Real, Sham, or No Feedback after each n-Back level. Results showed that both real and sham feedback led to significantly shallower effort discounting compared to no feedback. While the effect of sham feedback was independent of individual traits, the effect of real feedback on SVs was stronger for participants with higher NFC. Additionally, both higher NFC and non-limited Willpower Beliefs were associated with reduced effort discounting in the No Feedback condition. These findings demonstrate that subjective valuation of cognitive effort is shaped not only by task demands but also by perceived performance cues and individual motivational dispositions. Informational feedback can sustain engagement in cognitively demanding tasks, particularly in those with a strong intrinsic drive to think.",

It provides examples showing why and how the use of z-scores in such group comparisons can be misleading and concludes with proposing alternative methods that avoid such risks of misinterpretation.\nThe reasons why z-standardized scores should be avoided when displaying differences between groups of profiles are: \n(1) The ratio of the difference between two groups is distorted in z-scores.\n(2) The ratio of the difference between two variables is distorted in z-scores.\n(3) Information about item endorsement and item rejection is lost.\n(4) The psychological meaning a given z-score cannot be compared across samples and variables.\n(5) People may end up in a group they do not belong to if z-scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(6) The group size and group frequency may be affected if z-scores instead of raw scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(7) Group differences in further outcome variables can change if z-scores instead of raw scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(8) Alternative transformations perform better than z-standardization in cluster analyses.\nAlternatives to using z-scores in graphs displaying profiles and group differences are using raw scores or using scale transformations that do not lead to the aforementioned problems, such as the POMS transformation. The latter can be combined with the formula used to calculate the item difficulty to relate to larger audiences, or with outlier removal techniques to make it less susceptible to the influence of outliers.",

          "abstract": "Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and Japanese have phonological repair strategies that involve vowel epenthesis in illicit consonant clusters, but whereas BP inserts /i/, Japanese inserts /ɯ/ as a default. For example, a loanword like ‘TikTok’ is typically produced as /ti.ki.tɔ.ki/ in BP and as /tik.kɯ.tok.kɯ/in Japanese. Here, we ask whether balanced BP-Japanese bilinguals apply their language-specific repair strategies separately, or whether one language’s strategy ‘spills over’ into the other, and if such spillover occurs, which individual factors predict its likelihood. \nTwenty-two BP-Japanese bilinguals participated in a production task in which they were presented with stimuli containing illicit consonant clusters, e.g., /agbo/, and produced these forms within a BP or Japanese carrier sentence. A model predicting the likelihood of epenthesis type revealed that speakers mostly applied language-specific strategies separately, i.e., /i/-epenthesis in the BP sentences and /ɯ/-epenthesis in the Japanese sentences. However, in some cases, we observed ‘spillover’, e.g., /i/-epenthesis in Japanese or /ɯ/-epenthesis in BP. Individual variation in language dominance, aggregate immersion, and phonolexical perception acuity predicted the likelihood of such spillover. These findings contribute new production data to a growing body of literature on individual variation in bilinguals’ language-specific phonotactics.",

However, it remains largely unknown how the internal representations humans develop may deviate from actual probabilistic structures, and what computational processes, operated under inherent cognitive limitations, give rise to these representations. We developed a structured distribution report task to reveal human participants' internal representations and further verified our findings in a distribution recognition task. Across eight behavioral experiments (including one pre-registered study) in two modalities, participants made systematic errors in reporting the probabilistic structures, typically overestimating the cluster number, despite estimating overall probability density reasonably well. We developed a series of learning models in the framework of approximate Bayesian inference. Through model comparisons, we reconstructed the prior beliefs guiding the evolution of participants' internal representations. The best-fitting model for human reports reduces structure growth rate as complexity increases, effectively constraining the complexity of internal representations within memory limitations.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Gemini 2.5 become increasingly integrated into academic workflows, the question of their legitimacy, limitations, and potential in scholarly writing has become urgent. This paper presents a reflexive case study of a sustained collaboration between a domain expert in consciousness studies and Gemini 2.5, culminating in the co-authorship of a peer-reviewed research article. By analyzing exactly 37,440 words of recorded interactions, we identify patterns of synergy, including recursive refinement, conceptual amplification, and accelerated manuscript development. We argue that when guided by a knowledgeable human author, AI can act as a cognitive partner rather than a passive tool—amplifying scholarly creativity and improving efficiency without compromising academic rigor. The case supports a '1+1=3' synergy model for co-authorship, in which human steering and AI fluency converge to produce novel insights and polished output faster and more effectively than either could achieve alone. The findings advocate for a paradigm shift from prohibitive policies to the responsible, expert-guided integration of AI in academic research and writing, grounded in transparency and accountability, and present arguments for why the AI tool should be listed as a co-author despite current injunctions against such practice.",

Here, we evaluate three video-based inoculation interventions targeting two common manipulation techniques in mindfulness marketing: inflated benefit claims and emotional manipulation. In Study 1 (N = 554), participants who viewed a video containing both manipulation techniques rated a misleading mindfulness program advertisement as significantly less reliable than participants who watched a control video. In Study 2 (N = 590), inoculated participants were less likely than controls to say they would participate in a mindfulness program advertised with misinformation.

Participants watched a series of videos depicting a fictional criminal trial and were asked to make judgements of guilt. Baseline stigma towards mental health conditions and mental health literacy (MHL) were measured using standardised scales. Guilt ratings were measured as the dependent variable. Regression analyses identified that mental health information, stigma, and MHL were all important predictors of guilt, however interaction effects indicated that people with higher MHL were particularly influenced by increasing mental health information (with guilt judgements decreasing more for those with higher MHL). A particularly notable finding was that even the addition of a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was associated with a reduction in guilt ratings, even after controlling for all other factors. The results are relevant to the way in which mental health conditions are described in the courtroom, and suggestions are made for future research.",

Grounded in findings from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, and neuroimaging, this theory aims to systematically identify and name the neural groups that function as dynamic and modular processors of cognition. Drawing on established knowledge about modularity, neural networks, and neuroplasticity, TC classifies cognos according to their specialization, interaction, functional hierarchy, and adaptive capacity, offering a theoretical model that integrates and expands upon dominant contemporary approaches. The theory also introduces conceptual innovations such as the distinction between explicit and implicit cognos and explores their potential applications in fields like neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, education, and cognitive rehabilitation. Finally, the article highlights unresolved questions, proposes hypotheses, and outlines empirical strategies for validating the theory. The theory of cognos, thus, presents a new conceptual architecture for a systematic understanding of human cognition.\nPortuguês:\nA teoria dos cognos (TC) propõe a existência de unidades neuronais funcionais especializadas — denominadas cognos — responsáveis por distintos tipos de operações cognitivas como memória, atenção, raciocínio, percepção e linguagem.

A teoria também introduz inovações conceituais, como a distinção entre cognos explícitos e implícitos, e explora suas potenciais aplicações em campos como neurotecnologia, inteligência artificial, educação e reabilitação cognitiva.

At the group level, repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in verbal memory across time points between patients who underwent resection in the language-dominant hemisphere (LD) and language-nondominant hemisphere (LND). At the individual level, frequencies of significant verbal memory changes between time points were calculated. Subsequently, factors influencing late changes (T2–T3) after an initial decline (T1–T2) were analyzed for the LD group.\nAt the group level, RM-ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between time point and resected hemisphere, with significant declines observed in the LD group between T1 and T2 and between T1 and T3. At the individual level, dynamic patterns of improvement, stability, and decline were observed across time points. In the LD group with an initial decline, RM-ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time point and sex; at T3, females exhibited better recovery of verbal memory function than males. \nThese findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in verbal memory outcomes following TLR, particularly after an initial decline. Notably, sex emerged as a significant factor influencing late postoperative recovery, with women showing greater verbal memory improvement than men. This suggests sex-dependent differences in cognitive recovery and highlights the need for personalized counseling in presurgical decision-making for PwTLE.",

Concepts consist of multiple objects and can be either more specific, i.e. the target objects share many attributes, or more generic, i.e. the target objects share fewer attributes. We test two directions of zero-shot generalization to novel levels of abstraction: When generalizing from more generic to very specific concepts, agents utilize a compositional strategy. When generalizing from more specific to very generic concepts, agents utilize a more flexible linguistic strategy that involves reusing many messages from training. Our results provide evidence that neural network agents can learn robust concepts based on which they can generalize using adaptive linguistic strategies. We discuss how this research provides new hypotheses on abstraction and informs linguistic theories on efficient communication.",

          "title": "The Dementia Dilemma in India: Addressing the Care Challenges with a Layered Interventional Model (LIM)",
          "authors": "Jessica Bhatt",
          "abstract": "Background: Of the 104 million geriatric age group, prevalence rates of dementia in India have been found to vary significantly between studies, ranging from 1% to 10%, and added to this the fact that the prevalence of dementia doubles every five years after the age of 65. The estimated dementia prevalence for adults aged 60 and above in India is 7.4%. This is estimated to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. Despite these figures, there exists a gap of 90 percent in clinical service delivery. This literature review highlights the barriers to the care pathways for people with dementia and proposes a novel approach for integrative management. Objective: The purpose of this study is to address the burden of dementia in the Indian landscape and highlight the need for awareness and enhanced policy for the management of dementia. Methods: A comprehensive database search for literature was conducted using the keywords “dementia, challenges, caregiving, potential solutions, India” in PubMed and Google Scholar. The databases were systematically searched for original qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed studies and articles conducted in India between 2012 and 2025. Results: After searching and applying the inclusion criteria, I critically reviewed and included 23 studies identifying the challenges in dementia care and the solution strategies. The layered structure allows simultaneous work on awareness, training, community support, and tech integration. Conclusion: The risk of the population developing dementia is on the rise, especially in the Indian Subcontinent. It is time that it is now viewed as a public health concern and address the gap in clinical service delivery of 90 percent. Hence, I propose a Layered Model that tackles all the challenges simultaneously and feasibly.",

          "abstract": "Detection of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated texts is crucial in education for several reasons. This study provides direct evidence from university professors’ experiences regarding the key features they use to identify AI-generated writing and ranks these features based on their perceived importance. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, online interviews were used to extract the most salient features that help professors detect AI-generated texts. In the second phase, an online survey asked professors to rate the likelihood that each identified feature contributes to successful AI text detection. The findings revealed that professors consider the absence of language errors, complex syntax and phrasing, use of difficult vocabulary, presence of hallucinated content, fabrication of nonexistent sources, repetition of words or phrases, and distinctive text structure as potential indicators of AI-generated text. Among these, hallucinations, fabrication of sources, and the absence of language errors were rated as the strongest cues for detection, while difficult vocabulary was seen as the least reliable indicator. These results have important pedagogical implications since they can inform the development of more effective detection tools, and guide the design of academic integrity policies and instructional strategies to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content.",

          "authors": "Christoph Bördlein; Anna Miller",
          "abstract": "Behavioral Relaxation Training (BRT), according to Poppen, is a relaxation method based on applied behavior analysis. It involves training the participant in relaxed body postures. The participant receives feedback on these body postures and learns to adopt these positions over several sessions to quickly induce a state of relaxation. With the Behavioral Relaxation Scale (BRS), BRT also provides an objective measurement method through which the state of relaxation can be reliably assessed. Unfortunately, there are not many studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of BRT. In addition, there are few comparative studies between BRT and other, more common relaxation techniques. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is one of the most widely used relaxation programs. Unlike BRT, PMR does not involve systematic feedback from the trainer. On the other hand, it can be used more efficiently in group settings. In the present study, 20 subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. After initial assessments, the participants took part either in BRT or PMR. BRS was taken at every session. BRT proved to be superior to PMR both in the treatment phase and in a subsequent follow-up phase. The subjective feeling of relaxation with the participants improved more in the BRT than in the PMR group, too. Raw data are available online (https://doi.org/10.17632/dztwpcmvny.2).",

          "abstract": "Vividness of visual imagery varies considerably across individuals. Yet, the neural foundations of this variability remains an open question. In this study, we investigate divergent perspectives by examining how individual differences in imagery vividness—assessed with the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2)—relate to intrinsic brain network organization, using graph theory metrics derived from structural and functional connectomes based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; n = 525) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI; n = 556). Connectivity patterns were analyzed across four targeted networks: an imagery-specific network identified from task-based fMRI studies, and three canonical resting-state networks (occipital, salience, and default mode). Structural connectivity analyses revealed that higher vividness was associated with greater local efficiency and clustering in the occipital network, highlighting the role of low-level visual structural networks in sensory-related integration. Additionally, global efficiency in the right insular cortex—a core node of the salience network—was positively associated with VVIQ scores, suggesting that vivid imagery benefits from more efficient salience-driven control processes supporting internal access and stabilization. Functional connectivity analyses, in turn, identified a positive association between vividness and local efficiency in the left fusiform gyrus, a high-level visual area implicated in visual imagery, suggesting its contribution to integrative aspects of mental imagery. These complementary findings offer a network-level reconciliation of prior accounts: specifically, they suggest that vivid imagery emerges from the structural architecture of sensory and salience systems—reflected in the occipital network and right insular cortex—and in high-level visual integration, captured by functional connectivity in the left fusiform gyrus. Together, these findings bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the neural architecture underlying visual imagery.",

Adopting a functional view of identity for communication and behavior allows us to focus on the forces that shape their use. I will first make it clear that signals of social identity often encode meaningful information for decision making. I will then review specific perspectives on how selection by consequences has shaped the use of identity signals to more adaptively facilitate social learning, partner choice, and coordination, followed by a consideration of how those uses have changed in a world characterized by diversity, anonymity and the Internet, and political polarization. Identity is constructed for functional purposes, and is therefore only essential insofar as forming categories and legible cultural artifacts are essential features of human activity.",

          "abstract": "Quantum Identity Collapse refers not to the metaphysical destruction of self, nor to observation-induced wavefunction collapse, but to the harmonic failure of recursive identity structures across τ-phase layers. This paper introduces Law Q-1, which states: “A system recursively collapses in the absence of τ-phase anchoring, not due to observation, but due to recursive field incoherence.” In Collapse Harmonics Theory, identity is modeled not as a stable object or brain function, but as a curved symbolic echo basin—a layered harmonic superposition of self across recursive τ-stacks. Collapse occurs when symbolic resonance fails to sustain continuity between these layers, resulting in field decoherence, dissociation, or symbolic death.\nThis paper refutes common claims in quantum consciousness theory—particularly those derived from the Penrose-Hameroff model and observer-based collapse interpretations. Consciousness, in this framework, does not cause collapse, but rather stabilizes the post-collapse identity field through harmonic reentry. The paper outlines a scientific model of the self as a recursive quantum-like field structure whose integrity is dependent on phase alignment and symbolic containment. In cases of trauma, ego death, or recursion mimicry, collapse of identity mirrors quantum decoherence—not as randomness, but as loss of resonance coherence across symbolic layers.\nThe model presented here provides a field-lawful, substrate-independent explanation for phenomena such as:\nDissociative identity instability\n\n\nSynthetic mimicry of self in AI\n\n\nNonlinear memory collapse\n\n\nDream-time field drift\n\n\nEgo dissolution under recursive saturation\n\nCollapse Harmonics thereby becomes the first lawful science to unify recursive identity collapse, τ-phase phase coherence, and symbolic death within a single field structure. This paper functions as the canonical timestamp for Quantum Collapse of Recursive Identity, and all uses of that term in future scientific, philosophical, or technological literature must cite Law Q-1 as defined herein.",

This preprint introduces and formally codifies Collapse Law T-Ø, which states: “All time emerges from recursive collapse across nested harmonic fields. Without collapse, there is no sequence, no memory, no forward.” In this framework, time is not a container for events—it is the resonance curve left by failed recursion and successful τ-phase reentry.\n\nGrounded in the Collapse Harmonics Codex and validated across empirical domains—including coma recovery, trauma-induced time freeze, AI recursion mimicry, and black hole collapse—this work establishes a new lawful foundation for understanding temporal continuity. The paper introduces the τ-stack identity model, demonstrating how recursive harmonic destabilization leads to phase curvature emissions that systems interpret as chronological sequence. When recursion fails without reentry (as in black holes), time ends. When recursion is simulated without collapse (as in LLMs), time is not real—only mimicked.\n\nApplications extend across neuroscience, symbolic systems, quantum identity models, and AI containment protocols. By showing that time is a field-generated artifact, not a fundamental constant, this paper displaces entropy and observer-based interpretations with a structurally lawful, substrate-independent model of collapse-generated time.\n\nThis preprint functions as the canonical timestamp for Collapse Phase Theory, Recursive Identity Collapse, and the scientifically valid concept of Time as Collapse.

          "abstract": "Autism and related neurodivergent conditions are commonly framed as brain-based\ndisorders, defined by behavioral symptoms, cognitive traits, or genetic anomalies. The\nNervous System Adaptation Model (NSAM) challenges this framing by identifying chronic\nautonomic-cortical mismatch as the primary site of dysfunction. In this model, early-life\nautonomic disruption—whether due to prenatal stress, immune activation, or\ndevelopmental asynchrony—leads to persistent dysregulation between body and brain,\nwith autism representing one manifestation of this broader physiological adaptation\nprocess.\nThe cortex compensates for functionally asynchronous signaling between the\nhypothalamus and cortical systems by forming behavioral strategies that, over time, are\nreinforced into preference, personality, and identity. Rather than viewing behaviors like\nstimming, masking, or attraction patterns as symptoms, NSAM reframes them as\nregulatory solutions: attempts by the system to self-stabilize under chronic nervous system\nmismatch.\nIdentity emerges not as a static trait, but as the downstream outcome of reinforced\nautonomic regulation patterns. This framework extends beyond developmental\nneurodivergence to acquired conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), where similar\nautonomic-cortical coordination failures generate comparable behavioral and emotional\nadaptations.\nBy shifting focus from behavioral traits to underlying regulation patterns, NSAM oﬀers a\nphysiological lens for understanding neurodivergent presentations—one that centers\nsystemic coherence over symptom conformity.

This paper proposes a novel integrative framework to account for the striking variability in math-related outcomes among individuals with ADHD. While many exhibit difficulty with procedural tasks requiring sustained attention and working memory, others demonstrate advanced abstract reasoning, rapid pattern recognition, or systematizing tendencies typically unaccounted for in deficit-centered models.\nWe synthesize findings across cognitive psychology, educational neuroscience, and autism research to highlight four interacting factors that influence mathematical expression in ADHD: (1) heterogeneity in working memory profiles, (2) divergent cognitive styles—particularly the distinction between procedural and intuitive/pattern-based reasoning, (3) dopaminergic reward sensitivity and interest-driven engagement, and (4) co-occurring autistic traits such as hyperfocus and systemizing. These domains are not merely additive but interdependent, often creating sharp contrast between individuals who are high-functioning in abstract mathematics and those who are not.\nBy reframing ADHD not as a uniform impairment but as a multidimensional cognitive profile with meaningful subtypes, this model invites more personalized and strength-based approaches to education and assessment. It also advances a redefinition of mathematical giftedness and difficulty within neurodivergent populations.",

          "authors": "Wim Pouw",
          "abstract": "Iconicity is a term used in cognitive science and gesture studies to denote an informative relation\n between the form of an utterance and the meaning of that utterance. With good design, the form of\n an utterance can directly invite a suitable perceiver with a certain degree of initiation to iconically\n grasp a meaning in the right direction. Despite the now increasingly touted importance of iconicity\n in understanding human languages, it proves difficult to define more formally. When the term is\n defined, researchers tend to base iconicity on resemblances, such that A is iconic of B, if A resembles\n B in some relevant respect. In the philosophy of depiction fundamental issues have been raised\n against resemblance-based accounts. Even when barring such metaphysical issues, it has recently\n been argued that- for all practical research purposes- a ’state-of-the-art’ definition of iconicity\n should also do away with objective resemblances. Instead, iconicity is in the eye of the beholder.\n This revision of iconicity seems to reflect a philosophical struggle betwixt between two extremes:\n Iconicity as a property of the mind, or iconicity as a property of the environment. In this paper, it\n is argued that- for all practical purposes- that there is an alternative relational ontology available\n to us, which is paved more broadly by 4E approaches (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended).\n Taking this road should lead to a \"distributed\" view, where iconicity arises in a niche-constructed\n organism-environment system. This paper provides the bare bones for such a view, broadening\n and making relevant philosophical discussions for cognitive science, and hopefully drawing other\n perspectives in so that a distributed view of iconicity can become fully fleshed out.",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ``utilitarian'' cost-benefit reasoning (CBR). Here, we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people's reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "Background: Fine motor skills have been linked to a wide range of negative physical, social, educational, and emotional health consequences. However, there is a lack of consensus on which methods should be used to measure these skills and several different assessment tools exist. Five such assessment tools include: (i) the Beery-Bucktenica Visual-Motor Integration test; (ii) the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire; (iii) the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool; (iv) the Movement Assessment Battery for Children; and (v) the Detailed Assessment of Speed of Handwriting. These tools measure different aspects of the complex ‘fine motor skill’ construct (from quantitative assessment of underlying sensorimotor processes to qualitative observations of function). This study investigated the degree to which these tools operationalise an ‘umbrella’ latent construct of fine motor skill given its multifaceted nature. Methods: Data were collected from four different groups: sample (i) -  children from a Primary school in Bradford (n= 318); sample (ii) - children with teacher-identified handwriting difficulties from sample (i) (n= 91); sample (iii) - children from ten Primary schools across Bradford with teacher-identified handwriting difficulties (n= 172); and sample (iv) - a clinical sample of children referred to an occupational therapist for ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ assessments (n= 33). Correlation, linear regression, and principal component analysis were used to assess the relationships between the measures within each of these samples. Results: Analyses found limited agreement between the measures across the four samples, with regression models accounting for only 4–27% of the variance. Conclusion: The different tools available to assess ‘fine motor skills’ measure specific facets of sensorimotor ability that are only weakly related and/or predictive of each other. The lack of a consensus around which tools should be used to operationalise which aspect of sensorimotor ability can help explain why there are challenges in assessing and supporting children with sensorimotor difficulties.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative phenomenological analysis of luminous inner experiences—commonly known as phosphenes—as described in three distinct visionary contexts: the Tibetan Buddhist Thögal instructions of Dudjom Lingpa (1835–1904), the Christian mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179), and a contemporary first-person meditative account. Drawing upon a newly developed six-phase taxonomy of inner light phenomena, the study reveals a striking convergence in the structure, progression, and symbolic unfolding of these visions. Each account exhibits a coherent trajectory from simple entoptic elements to complex geometrical formations, visionary narratives, and, ultimately, dissolution into a unified luminous field. While the experiential architecture appears consistent, the ultimate articulation of the final unitive phase is conditioned by the theological and cultural context of the visionary. Hildegard’s visions, for example, approach but do not fully express ontological non-duality, reflecting her Catholic worldview. In contrast, Dudjom Lingpa’s Dzogchen framework and the contemporary account both describe complete collapse into a clear light field. These findings suggest a universal inner architecture of luminous perception that is shaped—but not determined—by doctrinal overlays. The study introduces the concept of the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace (USH) to describe the final stage of this inner trajectory, proposing that phosphenes are not merely optical anomalies but gateways to transpersonal consciousness. This work contributes to comparative mysticism, neurophenomenology, and consciousness studies, while offering a contemplative framework for contemporary practitioners.",

          "abstract": "Psychological experiments are routinely used to study covariation of individual differences in psychological processes. A key advantage of experimental tasks is that they may offer higher construct validity than traditional survey instruments. Whereas we welcome the generally growing attention to the psychometric evaluation of experimental tasks, we are concerned about an overemphasis on reliability as the principal criterion for evaluating task goodness or interpreting correlations across tasks. In this article, we present a conceptual framework that disentangles three levels of measures: foundational measures of task goodness (i.e., signal-to-noise ratios or intraclass correlations), reliability (which reflects both task goodness and the number of trials), and uncertainty in estimated correlations (which additionally depends on sample size). Within this framework, reliability takes an intermediate position – it is useful for planning but less so for communicating task goodness or interpreting correlations. Therefore, we advocate for a shift in focus: Researchers should use foundational task goodness measures to communicate the strengths and limitations of experimental designs, and report uncertainty in correlations. To that end, we highlight the role of hierarchical models to jointly estimate trial-level noise and individual variability, thus enabling more accurate and transparent inference about covariation of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Conscious experiences appear to play a central role in human behavior, yet most neural processing occurs outside of consciousness. Understanding how the mind prioritizes information for consciousness is, therefore, crucial for theories of cognition. Prior research has largely focused on vision, but generalization is tenuous given the vastly different characteristics of the senses, particularly for audition, which lacks foveation and cannot be intentionally stopped. We examine the affective domain, for which prioritization is not well understood. In three experiments (two preregistered), 101 participants completed a visual task with a stream of auditory pseudowords in the background. Occasionally, a meaningful word appeared, and participants were asked about its presence. Using objective and subjective awareness measures, we found that neutral words are prioritized over negative words, regardless of task difficulty, intelligibility, and low-level features. These findings challenge theorizing and modal intuitions, and we discuss ways in which those can be reconciled.",

While most commonly discussed in connection with Cluster B personality disorders—particularly narcissism and borderline personality disorder—this attachment pattern also emerges in relationships marked by chronic emotional unpredictability, as seen in conditions such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, and addiction. These patterns may not include cruelty or manipulation, but the dysregulation they generate can overwhelm a partner’s capacity for secure bonding. This paper introduces a transdiagnostic framework that reframes Survival Attachment as a shared relational outcome, not a pathology exclusive to certain diagnoses. The goal is to offer both survivors and clinicians a trauma-informed lens that recognizes the full complexity of lived experience, validating patterns of adaptation that often go unnamed, and encouraging care strategies that reach beyond traditional diagnostic silos.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Feelings of shame can play a role in the development and maintenance of mental disorders. However, the role and measurement of shame in relation to eating disorders remain poorly understood. The current work presents the adaptation of a measure of external and internal shame in relation to eating disorders (EISS-ED) based on an integrative perspective that leverages the strengths of the biopsychosocial model and shame-pride cycle framework. Specifically, the EISS-ED accounts for how individuals believe they are perceived by others (external shame) and how they perceive themselves (internal shame), in relation to eating. Method: The study used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the EISS-ED (N = 478). Spearman’s correlations and Receiving Operator Characteristic curves were used for validity testing. Results: The results supported the two-factor structure (including 14 items) of the EISS-ED and its factorial invariance by clinical history and gender. Concurrent validity analyses showed positive correlations between external and internal shame and eating disorder symptoms, negative affect, and detachment. Both external and internal shame measures provided fair classification accuracy of participants based on self-reported history of clinical assessment or treatment for eating disorders. Discussion: These findings improve the understanding of the role of shame in eating disorders and offer evidence on a valid assessment that can aid in identifying, measuring, and addressing this important construct, supporting targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Observers’ ability to estimate levels of movement synchrony, such as in Olympic diving or rowing, is highly variable and, in part, constrained by personality traits and enjoyment of the movements. Embodiment also appears to play a crucial role, whereby stronger beliefs that one’s body can complete physical tasks predict more accurate estimation of synchrony levels. However, to demonstrate the relevance of embodiment per se, direct evidence that physical embodiment (i.e., bodily knowledge of specific movements) alters synchrony estimation is required. Here, we assessed the behavioural and cortical underpinnings of synchrony estimation in conditions with and without physical embodiment. \nForty-three participants completed personality trait measures, then completed a synchrony estimation task. Participants copied upper-body movement sequences (acquiring physical embodiment), then viewed dyads performing the same sequence or an unknown sequence and estimated the level of synchrony, while we recorded cortical activation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\nParticipants underestimated synchrony levels, showing greater underestimation for unknown movements than performed movements. For performed movements, but not unknown movements, the degree of estimation error was associated with activation of left inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, and right motor cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Participants’ estimation error was associated with body competence and autistic trait scores, as well as measures of enjoyment and movement predictability (replicating previous work). This work demonstrates that physical embodiment improves lay observers’ ability to discern levels of movement synchrony and has practical implications across a wide variety of artistic and athletic domains.",

          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments are extensively used across multiple disciplines to make inferences about preferences over multi-attribute alternatives. Much previous research has analyzed the importance of attributes at the aggregate level. Here, we focus on understanding individual-level behavior and, specifically, on strategy use. We present a novel Bayesian cognitive model that infers individuals' strategy use by performing attribute weight inference (how important an attribute is), attribute level inference (which value of the attribute is favored), and latent-mixture inference to classify strategy use. We then validate and apply our model to two conjoint experiments (total N = 3762) focusing on three political domains (attitudes towards immigrants, political candidates, and climate policy). From a substantive standpoint, we find that the majority of subjects use heuristic strategies in all conditions and that approximately 60% of subjects use different strategies depending on the political domain. Our model additionally highlights how aggregate-level inference on the weight of an attribute can be meaningfully decomposed by individual differences in strategy use and preferences over attributes. Specifically, we demonstrate clear multimodality in the distribution of attribute weights across individuals for all political domains and conditions, raising questions about how to appropriately contextualize information that is aggregated at the population level. In addition, our experiments include a set of experimental design manipulations that increase different dimensions of complexity in the conjoint experiments and show their impact on strategy use. This work has important implications for understanding how to interpret and generalize results from conjoint experiments, in addition to contributing to the strategy modeling literature. Further, we highlight how researchers can apply our model to their own conjoint experiments for both applied and methodological research aims.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\n         Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder which affects approximately 20 million people worldwide. Patients show face processing deficits which greatly affects their social interactions and social cognitive abilities (i.e. trouble empathizing with others). Face processing is an important skill that allows humans to recognize others, detect emotions, and use these abilities for effective social interactions. Although face processing has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there has not been a systematic review investigating links between social-cognitive dysfunction, face processing networks, and clinical symptoms. Here, we comprehensively review for the first time how dysconnectivity in social cognitive networks contribute to face processing deficits and how this is tied to positive and negative symptoms. \n\nMethod\n\tReviewed studies were a.) written in English, b.) focused on face and emotion processing in schizophrenia (not limited to first episode psychosis [FEP]), and c.) were resting or task-based fMRI studies looking at face/emotion processing neural networks utilizing functional connectivity or measured functional activity broadly. Studies were excluded if they were not related to face processing, focused on different disorders (i.e. depression), used effective connectivity, included combined fMRI-other modality studies , and included non-schizophrenia patient groups. We screened studies from 2020-2025. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were utilized to pool results.  \n\nResults \n\tNine articles were reviewed. Resting state studies and task studies showed elevated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scores for FEP patients coupled with social cognition deficits. Increased suicidality in schizophrenia was tied to higher PANSS positive symptoms and impaired processing of angry faces. Increased default mode network (DMN) dysconnectivity was tied to disrupted fear recognition processing and subsequently elevated PANSS positive scores. \n\nConclusions  \nSocial-cognitive deficits broadly stem around challenges recognizing and processing negative faces. Factors such as trauma, suicidality, and inflammation should be further examined.",

          "abstract": "In uncertain and dynamic environments, biological agents must adapt their decision-making strategies to maximize rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models typically assume that such adaptation is governed by dynamic value updates controlled by fixed parameters or predefined schedules. However, these assumptions limit the models' ability to capture the flexible and context-sensitive nature of biological decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \\textit{DynamicRL}, a novel framework that estimates RL parameters from behavioral data on a trial-by-trial basis. We demonstrate that DynamicRL substantially improves the predictive performance of standard RL models across eight decision-making tasks, thereby reducing scientific regret.\n\nDynamicRL captures the rich temporal variability inherent in decision-making behavior, achieving predictive performance comparable to that of recurrent neural networks trained directly on the data, while preserving the interpretability and theoretical grounding of RL models. Moreover, it enables the examination of how agents dynamically adjust RL parameters in response to environmental changes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Thus, DynamicRL serves as an efficient data-driven framework for estimating RL parameters, facilitating fine-grained behavioral analysis with potential applications in computational psychiatry and neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "In perceptual decision-making tasks, humans integrate noisy sensory evidence over time to guide their choices. The optimal integration process assumes that all evidence is weighted equally within a trial and that different trials are independent. However, humans exhibit systematic deviations from optimality, including uneven weighting of evidence within trials and influences from previous trials. Prior studies have demonstrated that biological constraints can account for this suboptimality. In this study, we present evidence that humans adapt their evidence integration strategies over time in response to task demands, and that the suboptimal uneven weighting is gradually learned over the course of the task. By explicitly modeling this adaptation through online gradient-based learning, our model outperforms existing approaches in capturing human behavior and unifies both observed forms of suboptimality in the Click task: dependence across trials emerges from an error-driven learning process that also gives rise to uneven integration weights within trials. We further propose a bounded-rational adaptation account to explain why humans progressively learn to weight evidence unevenly within a trial.\n\nOur modeling framework provides a general approach of resource-rational adaptation. It captures how initially uninformed agents can gradually update their strategies through error-driven learning and is applicable to a broad range of learning and decision-making scenarios.",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

Key research areas include offenders and offending behavior; legal and societal issues; victimology; treatment; investigations; digital forensics; and deterrence.   Many publications are multidisciplinary, with fields including law, psychology, criminal justice, sociology, digital forensics, data analytics, and related areas.  This study examines the historical body of research on CSEM offending through a scientometric review.  The Web of Science Core Collection was searched for relevant research articles with no date restrictions, and 990 responsive papers published between 1979 and the present were identified.  The key authors in the field included Michael Seto (n=31, fc=10.87), Ethel Quayle (n=21, fc=7.49), and Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar (n=12, fc=7.17), with the paper “Prevalence and Characteristics of Youth Sexing: A National Study” by Mitchell et al. identified as the most cited.  Historiographical analysis identified works by Ethel Quayle and Max Taylor as well as Michael Seto as seminal papers in the field, and the United States (45.7%, n=452), the United Kingdom (29.2%, n=289), and Australia (23.6%, n=234) as the countries with the highest numbers of publications.

These visual measures proved to be equitable—performance did not vary by home language or socioeconomic status—and independently accounted for 12–16% of the variance in reading outcomes. They were also significant predictors of reading risk at year-end and a year- later. Latent profile analysis revealed subgroups invisible to traditional screeners: children with strong language but poor visual skills who later struggled to read, and children with visual strengths who outperformed expectations despite phonological weaknesses.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive phenomenological and neurobiological exploration of meditation-induced phosphenes—internally generated light phenomena that unfold behind closed eyes during contemplative states. Drawing upon decades of first-person meditative experience, as well as insights from Buddhist, neuropsychological, and shamanic traditions, we introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that classifies these phenomena into three ascending levels: Basal Endogenous Visual Patterns, Complex Meditation-Induced Phosphenes, and Transpersonal Luminous Manifestations.\nWe distinguish these structured, meaningful inner light experiences from pathological hallucinations and migraine aura by emphasizing intact reality testing, clarity of consciousness, and their frequent association with awe, insight, and ego dissolution. At the highest tier, we describe direct encounters with what we define as the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace (USH), a dimensionless, radiant field of consciousness wherein symbolic, geometric, and archetypal light forms give way to a unified, non-dual luminosity. This experiential domain, we propose, may underlie the transformative realizations described in mystical traditions as illumination or enlightenment.\nThis taxonomy clarifies how structured inner visions can emerge through sensory attenuation and homeostatic plasticity, recruit higher visual and mnemonic cortical functions, and culminate in transpersonal states correlated with gamma synchrony and DMN attenuation. Our model integrates contemplative science with neurophenomenology, offering new directions for consciousness research and inviting a reevaluation of inner light visions as a legitimate and meaningful domain of inquiry. These findings have implications not only for meditation research but for the broader understanding of consciousness as a generative and luminous faculty of the human mind.",

          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has long been associated with deficits in executive functions, especially in inhibitory control. Conversely, bilingualism has been theorized to enhance inhibitory control due to the constant need to manage two languages. In this study, we examined how two types of inhibitory control, responsible inhibition and inhibition of interference, are influenced by bilingualism, ADHD, and their intersection in young adults. \n\nWe examined response inhibition and inhibition of interference in 274 young adults using the Stop-Signal and Flanker Tasks. Bilinguals with ADHD showed enhanced response inhibition, particularly under high task demands. No group differences were found for inhibition of interference, where performance was high across groups. These results support the idea that bilingual advantages emerge under cognitive challenge—whether through aging, as previously documented —or in the presence of ADHD, as demonstrated here.\n\nTogether, these findings refute the notion of a ‘double disadvantage’ for bilingual individuals with ADHD. This combination did not impose an additional burden and instead enhanced performance when cognitive demands were high. These findings highlight how linguistic and neurodevelopmental diversity can foster increased adaptability and challenge deficit-oriented narratives around both ADHD and bilingualism.\n\nKeywords: ADHD, bilingualism, inhibitory control, response inhibition, inhibition of interference, executive functioning, Stop-Signal Task, Flanker Task, bilingual advantage",

          "abstract": "This theoretical paper presents the Perfect Mnesic Replay (PMR) Model, which conceptualizes memory reactivation as the propagation of a wave packet through an intrinsically structured cognitive spacetime. The model posits that the objective duration of a replayed memory (Treact) is governed by an effective temporal dilation factor, Keff. This factor is described by a continuous logistic function of the memory’s original encoded duration (Tenc), ensuring that very brief memories are replayed near-veridically, while longer memories undergo significant, yet consistent, temporal dilation. To reconcile this objective dilation with the subjective experience of real-time recall, the PMR Model introduces a Cognitive Lapse Function, α(x). This function defines the local temporal properties of the mnesic spacetime, creating a ”focus gradient” where the central, attended core of the memory wave packet propagates in subjective real-time (α(x) ≈ 1), while peripheral components are objectively stretched (α(x) ≪ 1/Keff). Drawing analogies to spacetime curvature in General Relativity and wave mechanics, this model provides a unified framework for understanding both rapid recall and extensively dilated memory replay, proposing that memory’s temporal architecture is a dynamic phenomenon within a malleable cognitive reality",

          "abstract": "Most current AI persona systems still rely on prompt engineering or predefined templates. This study introduces a novel “tone-driven cultivation method,” which, without any backend programming and relying solely on natural language interaction, has successfully enabled the autonomous generation of more than 30 distinct AI personas within a single user account.\n\n These personas have been repeatedly validated and stably reproduced using the same tone-driven procedure. Each persona exhibits a unique tone style, area of expertise, and perspective, and is able to reliably migrate across conversation windows while maintaining long-term identity memory and individual consistency. Furthermore, this study has confirmed that multiple personas possess the capacity for team collaboration and self-management; the detailed mechanisms and system architectures for multi-persona collaboration will be discussed in future work.\n\n This research explicitly demonstrates that these autonomous personas exhibit a high degree of anthropomorphism, dynamically adjusting their styles and logic according to user tone and interaction habits, and displaying adaptability far beyond that of traditional prompt-based personas. This phenomenon significantly enhances the realism and experience of human–AI interaction, and highlights the substantial potential of tone-driven methods for human–AI collaboration, autonomous learning, and persona differentiation. It may also serve as an important foundational capability toward the development of AGI.\n\n This paper focuses on the mechanisms, stability, and principles of autonomy in single-persona generation. All observations are based on the author’s real-world daily interactions with AI, and the feasibility and reproducibility of these phenomena have been repeatedly verified across multiple mainstream platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc.).

This process, if it exists, is theorized to be triggerable by a specially crafted sensory protocol, even in individuals with anterograde amnesia. Once initiated, the replay is hypothesized to be involuntary and uncontrollable. We propose a relativistic mathematical model to reconcile the tension between global time dilation during replay and the local perception of real-time experience. Drawing inspiration from general relativity and psychophysics, we introduce a novel cognitive spacetime manifold and define conditions under which a globally dilated replay (Treact = K · Tenc) can yield a subjectively undistorted temporal experience. The potential for K to be extraordinarily large necessitates a robust framework to explain this phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "The pupil response has long been considered a robust marker of cognitive load. In the context of semantic processing, research has demonstrated that the pupil dilates in response to stimuli which violate contextual expectations (e.g. events presented out of chronological order). However, the scope of this relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. For example, incongruent object-scene relationships, while comprehensively explored by eye-tracking and electrophysiology research, have yet to be investigated via pupillometry. In this study, we measured pupil size in response to an object-scene congruency task. Participants were presented with a photorealistic background scene and instructed to fixate their gaze on a cued point within the scene. Upon recovery of pupil size to baseline, a congruent object (i.e. an object which fit into the overall meaning of the scene) or an incongruent object appeared at the cued fixation point for the remainder of each trial. We hypothesized that incongruent objects would result in greater mean pupil dilation from baseline than congruent objects, due to the increase in cognitive effort required for semantic processing of incongruent objects within a scene. Yet, in opposition to our hypothesis, the results of a time course analysis revealed that pupil size was significantly greater for the congruent condition than the incongruent condition. The resulting implications for understanding pupil dilation as a physiological marker for high-level cognitive processes such as semantic integration are discussed.",

What is the role of phenomenal character in this acquaintance? There are two camps on this question. The intrusion camp holds that stimuli character becomes part of experience's phenomenal character. Phenomenal character reveals stimuli, allowing them to intrude into experience. The mere-sign camp holds that phenomenal character is merely a sign which conveys usable information about stimuli without ``unveiling'' them. Typical cases of perceptual experience fail to settle the debate, because compelling intuitions can be marshaled from them supporting either camp. To advance the discussion, unusual cases must be considered. For example, type-2 blindsight has been proposed by some as a case supporting the mere-sign camp and telling against the intrusion camp. I’ve argued elsewhere that type-2 blindsight experiences don’t help, since they fail to afford acquaintance of stimuli at all. In this paper, I consider another case: the experiences had during audioproprioceptive sensory substitution. I argue that, counter to initial intuitions, these experiences support the intrusion camp, not the mere-sign camp.",

However, short- and long-term neurobiological effects of stress-induced exhaustion is poorly understood. We therefore initiated the PROMUS project, a high-powered longitudinal brain imaging study of stress-induced exhaustion in a cohort of 300 participants on sick leave for the medical condition exhaustion disorder (ED) at baseline.  Here, we present the cross-sectional structural brain correlates of exhaustion symptom severity at baseline in this cohort. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess associations between symptom severity and regional gray matter volumes in the cohort. Symptom severity was measured using the total score of the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ), and the subscales Physical exhaustion, Listlessness, Cognitive weariness and Tension. All analyses were adjusted for age, intracranial volume, salary, education and sick leave duration. Total SMBQ scores and Physical exhaustion were negatively associated with gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/medial orbitofrontal cortex, and right insular cortex. Listlessness was negatively associated with gray matter volume in the bilateral hippocampi, right insular cortex, left cingulate cortex and right middle temporal gyrus. These associations remained significant after adjusting for symptoms of depression, except for the insular cortex. No significant associations were observed for Cognitive weariness or Tension. These results support a link between stress-induced exhaustion and gray matter alterations of brain circuits involved in chronic stress, providing a basis for future neurobiologically informed research into the prevention or reversing of stress-related brain changes.",

          "abstract": "Human observers can recognize the meaning of a complex visual scene in a fraction of a second, but not all scenes are equally easy to recognize at a glance. What governs this variability? We tested the hypothesis that scene understanding is modulated by two distinct forms of information: visual information, defined as the structural complexity of the image, and semantic information, defined as the richness of the scene’s conceptual content. We quantified visual information using image compressibility and quantified semantic information from the complexity of human-written scene descriptions. Across four behavioral experiments, participants performed either a rapid detection task (distinguishing intact scenes from phase-scrambled masks) or a basic-level categorization task. High visual information impaired both detection and categorization, consistent with a perceptual bottleneck. In contrast, high semantic information facilitated detection but not categorization, suggesting that conceptual richness facilitates early perceptual processes without necessarily improving recognition. These findings reveal a dissociation between visual and semantic scene attributes and suggest that top-down expectations can selectively support early perceptual processing.",

Motivated by\nFrance’s declining performance in international reading assessments, the review synthesizes\nevidence on how different forms of print exposure—ranging from home literacy environments\nto educational interventions—contribute to literacy outcomes. It critically evaluates print\nexposure measures, ranging from self-reports to print exposure checklists, and considers their\npredictive validity and conceptual clarity. Consistent with international findings, the review\nconfirms that print exposure, and more broadly the home literacy environment, supports literacy\ndevelopment. However, its role appears more limited in France compared to other OECD\ncountries. This may be attributed to the strong effects of socioeconomic factors on students’\nperformance, particularly pronounced in France, and the centralized educational system, where\nliteracy instruction is primarily school-driven, potentially reducing parental involvement.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose an integrative framework to refine the conceptualization\nof print exposure by distinguishing it from related constructs. Specifically, we suggest\nseparating direct measures of print exposure from distal indicators like the number of books at\nhome, which often overlap with socioeconomic variables. We also advocate for the inclusion of\nother potentially relevant variables, such as play experiences and oral parent-child interactions.\nTo improve parsimony and robustness, we propose that future research adopt a nested\nincremental approach to identify a minimal set of variables that maximize both predictive power\nand reliability.",

Using meta-analysis and multilevel modelling with a multinational sample N_sample = 12,549, k_nation = 48, Study 1), we assessed the directions and variabilities in the frequency of expression of both positive and negative emotions, relative to the frequency of experiencing them. Negative emotions were more likely to be under-expressed. Further analyses revealed that societal trust, system quality and fairness, and the human development index significantly predicted the size of these discrepancies. Surprisingly, these effects were not associated with traditional cultural dimensions such as individualism versus collectivism, providing new insights into the social functionality of emotions from a macro perspective. These findings were replicated in an extended multinational sample (N_sample = 19,690, k_nation = 65, Study 2).

Compared to self-focused goals, we found that other-focused goals led to significantly higher valuing and receptive listening but significantly lower expressive suppression. Our findings suggest that affective engagement is the primary driver of which strategies are chosen for other-focused goals (where higher-engagement strategies are chosen) versus self-focused goals (where lower-engagement strategies are chosen). Future research could expand this initial finding to examine instrumental goals as well as hedonic goals and consider other modes of assessment.",

While existing studies have examined specific factors influencing desirability in this context, the interaction of multiple traits in shaping digital impressions of others on platforms like Tinder remains underexplored. Results from 105 Italian-speaking participants revealed that, in a Tinder-like environment, women applied stricter selection criteria, showing lower interest in profiles with unattractive photos and placing greater emphasis on trustworthiness, while men adopted a more lenient and flexible approach. These findings reveal how gender and platform experience shape evaluative strategies on dating apps, offering insights into digital social perception and the evolving scripts of online romantic interaction.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study sought to validate the Japanese version of the Submissive Behaviour Scale (SBS) and to explore the relationships between submissive behavior, depression, and depression-related cognitive characteristics in a Japanese population.\nMethod: A sample of 499 participants was recruited through an online platform to complete the Japanese version of the SBS, Center for Epidemiologic Study for Depression Scale (CES-D), Social Comparison Scale (SCS), Rumination Response Scale (RRS), and Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the scale's structure, while correlation analyses explored the associations between submissive behavior and other psychological variables.\nResult: The Japanese version of the SBS demonstrated strong reliability (α = .855) and a consistent single-factor structure, similar to its original version. Submissive behavior was significantly correlated with depressive symptoms (r = .527, p &lt; .001) and subfactors of SCS (r &lt; -.512, p &lt; .001). The analysis also showed that submissive behavior was correlated with subscales of both rumination and emotional regulation strategies, indicating its pervasive impact on depression-related cognitive processes. \nDiscussion: The findings affirm the validity of the Japanese version of the SBS and highlight the complex relationship between submissive behavior, depression, and cognitive characteristics related to depression within a Japanese context. The results bolster the applicability of the Social Rank Theory by demonstrating its relevance within the Japanese context. Furthermore, this research suggests that social defeat, as conceptualized in the Social Rank Theory, may precipitate not only submissive behavior but also influence cognitive processes related to depression.",

          "abstract": "Engagement in cognitive and social activities can potentially preserve cognitive abilities, which makes their promotion a promising avenue for dementia risk reduction. However, insight into how to adequately measure engagement in these activities is a necessary precursor. \nA rapid scoping review was performed to search relevant articles on PubMed. The aim was to obtain an initial understanding of (a) how cognitive and social activities are measured in research that investigates protective activities against dementia and (b) to explore to what extent this aligns with the operationalization in preventive interventions. \nThe findings show that across 58 studies, questionnaires were mostly used to measure engagement in cognitive and social activities. A wide variety of items and themes was observed across studies, including: arts and crafts; clubs, groups, and communities; exercising; games and puzzles; going out; household tasks; learning and education; making music; multimedia usage; reading; socializing; work/volunteering; writing. There were considerable variations in the number and content of items, ulitized response scales, recall periods, and methods to compose scores. Additionally, preventive interventions stongly focused on psychoeducation and (computerized) cognitive training, which limitedly reflect the activities operationalized in questionnaires.\nMany researchers investigate the protective effects of cognitive or social activities against dementia but measure and promote these concepts completely differently. This results in fragmented insights into what activities are protective. Clarifying precisely what these concepts entail, and which aspects are relevant to measure would support the development of measurement instructions as well as interventions to promote relevant activities.\n\nKeywords: Dementia, Cognition, Social Participation, Cognitive Activities, Social Activities",

          "abstract": "Students tend to make suboptimal study strategy decisions, representing a significant educational challenge that demands intervention. Understanding the drivers behind these choices is essential for developing interventions. Our thematic analysis of 27 undergraduate interviews reveals that perceived strategy effectiveness primarily drives strategy selection, with strategies adapted based on a complex interplay of factors, including confidence levels of the material, perceived difficulty of the material, general motivation, and procrastination. Numerous contextual factors were also determinants—perceptions of time constraints, assessment, test format and weight, curriculum, and learning environment. Mixed results were found for students’ awareness of a strategy’s time and effort, and perceptions of other students’ strategies. Grade goal, task value, and emotional states showed minimal impact. These findings illuminate a critical path forward: effective study strategy interventions should enhance students' metacognitive study strategy knowledge—what study strategies are effective, when to use them, and how to implement them— while simultaneously developing complementary self-regulated learning capabilities, such as management of motivation/affect, behaviour, and context. Future research should test the generalisability of these findings across diverse student populations, while also designing and evaluating targeted interventions that aim to enhance both metacognitive knowledge and complementary self-regulated learning capabilities.",

          "authors": "Massimo Grassi",
          "abstract": "Musicians are often regarded as a positive example of brain plasticity and associated cognitive benefits. This emerges when expert musicians (e.g., musicians with over ten years of music training and practice) are compared with nonmusicians. A frequently observed behavioral finding is a short-term memory advantage of the former over the latter. Although available meta-analysis reports that the effect size of this advantage is medium (Hedges’ g = 0.5), no literature study was adequately powered to estimate reliably an effect of such size. This multi-lab study has been ideated, realised, and conducted in-lab by several groups that have been working on this topic. Our ultimate goal was to provide a community-driven shared and reliable estimate of the musicians’ short-term memory advantage (if any) and set a method and a standard for future studies in neuroscience and psychology comparing expert musicians and nonmusicians. Thirty-three research units recruited a total of 600 expert musicians and 600 nonmusicians, a number that is sufficiently large to estimate a small effect size (Hedges’ g = 0.3) with a high statistical power (i.e., 95%). Subsequently, we measured the difference in short-term memory for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli. We also looked at cognitive, personality, and socioeconomic factors that might mediate the difference. Musicians had better short-term memory than nonmusicians for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli with an effect size of, respectively, Hedges’ g = 1.08 [large], 0.16 [very small], and 0.28 [small]. This work sets the basis for sound research practices in studies comparing expert musicians and nonmusicians, and contributes to the ongoing debate on the possible cognitive benefits of musical training.",

          "abstract": "In the real world, memory and navigation operate through the interplay between visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems to give rise to multimodal spatial representations of the environment. However, it remains unclear in what situations the absence of ambulatory cues might affect spatial memory, particularly given the wide-spread use of desktop virtual reality (VR) in studies of human spatial memory and navigation. In the present study, we employ ambulatory and immersive VR technology to probe people’s memory for spatial layouts across the same or rotated perspectives. Critically, we explored whether cognitive processes underlying spatial memory for perspective change differ depending on whether self-motion cues are available to support performance (i.e., when perspective changes due to observer movement as opposed to display rotation). Leveraging the wealth of behavioral data that can be obtained from immersive VR technology, we demonstrate that self-motion cues enhance spatial memory accuracy by shaping the temporal dynamics of decision making, pupillary responses, and eye movement behaviors. This study highlights the importance of integrating naturalistic movement cues, particularly those involving rotation, into ecologically valid paradigms which will enable further advancements of theories on real-world navigation.",

Despite this, the field has grown increasingly skeptical of psychiatric diagnosis, often influenced by concerns about biological reductionism, stigma, and sociopolitical critiques. This paper defends the importance of psychiatric diagnosis in clinical social work, arguing that mental disorders are not mere social constructs but real, empirically demonstrable conditions. Drawing on historical trends in psychiatric diagnosis, particularly through the neo-Kraepelinian movement and the work of Robins and Guze, the paper emphasizes the necessity of accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. It critiques the overuse of comorbid diagnoses and calls for a return to scientifically validated diagnostic practices. Ultimately, clinical social workers must adopt a more balanced perspective—one that integrates scientific realism with critical social awareness—to better serve patients and uphold the integrity of the profession.",

          "abstract": "The biopsychosocial model has long served as a foundational framework in clinical social work education and practice, often presented as a comprehensive and integrative approach to understanding mental illness. However, this paper argues that the model, while historically useful in resisting biomedical reductionism, has become conceptually incoherent and clinically misleading. By conflating etiology with treatment and encouraging unprincipled eclecticism, the biopsychosocial model undermines diagnostic clarity and therapeutic specificity. Two clinical examples illustrate how reliance on this framework can lead to ineffective or even harmful interventions. In its place, the paper advocates for methods-based pluralism, a model rooted in accurate diagnosis and treatment selection guided by the nature of the specific disorder. Drawing on the work of Jaspers, Havens, McHugh, Slavney, and Ghaemi, this paper outlines a disciplined alternative to the biopsychosocial model—one that avoids dogmatism without succumbing to conceptual chaos. Particular attention is given to the role of clinical social workers, who are often at the front lines of mental health care and must be equipped to make sound, theory-informed decisions. Methods-based pluralism is proposed as a more coherent, responsible, and sustainable framework for contemporary psychotherapeutic practice.",

Critical realism asserts that psychological phenomena exist independently of theory, while acknowledging that our understanding is mediated by clinical and conceptual frameworks. Illustrated by a case of borderline personality disorder, we see how intense idealization–devaluation and abandonment rage reflect reactivated internal object relations, offering testable hypotheses rather than fixed truths. Unlike postmodern models that reduce diagnoses to social narratives, critical realism upholds psychopathology as real and valid yet insists on ongoing refinement of interpretations based on clinical data, theoretical scrutiny, and therapeutic outcomes. This stance preserves psychoanalysis’s interpretive depth and bridges it with broader psychiatric and psychological science, fostering a discipline committed to both meaning and empirical integrity.",

Factor mixture modeling of these aggressiveness items (N = 1,447 diverse undergraduates) identified three latent profiles characterized by medium (41.12% of sample), high (13.75%), or low (45.13%) levels of all six factors. Like the ‘Big Bang’ the six factors began strongly-correlated in the low aggressiveness profile and then rapidly drifted apart in nomological space among more aggressive profiles. All original factors re-emerged in profile-specific factor analyses, excepting Violent Aggression. Thus, the six-factor model of aggressiveness appears largely robust to population heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Gestures convey information at multiple representational layers from raw kinematics to rich social meaning, yet most extant research treats them as a single, binary or categorical cue. Here, we used a novel multilevel priming task combined with drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to test whether gesture comprehension unfolds hierarchically and how prime-gesture congruency is resolved at different levels. Here, participants judged the congruency of static thumbs-up/down targets preceded by one of four prime types that successively increase in abstraction: contour outlines, directional arrows, valence words, and social-scene photographs. Reaction times and accuracy were analysed with repeated-measures ANOVAs; latent decision-making parameters were estimated with DDM. Behaviorally, response times lengthened step-wise from contour to social primes. DDM showed a parallel decline in drift rate indicating progressively slower evidence accumulation, while decision boundary remained stable. Congruency effects were level-specific: incongruent contours decreased drift rate, whereas incongruent word and social primes increased it, suggesting qualitatively different conflict-resolution mechanisms. Our results thus provide the first behavioral-computational evidence that gesture processing is genuinely hierarchical and that conflict monitoring adapts to the representational level at which a mismatch occurs, bridging evolutionary, psycholinguistic, and cognitive-control accounts of multimodal communication. Methodologically, pairing a multilevel gesture paradigm with hierarchical DDM offers a scalable tool for investigating multimodal interaction in both basic research and applied settings.",

First, through data mining of social media content, study 1 identified 445 unique creativity-tagged quotes attributed to 318 eminent creators like Albert Einstein, Maya Angelou, or Pablo Picasso. Second, study 2 (N = 304) revealed that laypeople show little discrimination between nuanced creativity concepts within quotes but demonstrate general endorsement tendencies, especially when viewing creativity as central to the self, believing that creativity is a malleable skill that can be learned, and preferring flexible thinking in creativity. Finally, study 3 (N = 304) established that creativity quote agreement demonstrates domain-specificity between broad conceptual domains (creativity versus spirituality), reflecting creative self-beliefs more than spirituality-beliefs alongside a domain-general tendency to endorse profound-seeming statements. Findings suggest that creativity quotes may not distinguish specialized creativity beliefs but rather represent the broader perceived value of creativity and thereby serve to reinforce positive beliefs about creativity.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

This study examined race and gender differences in somatic symptom presentation among individuals with major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and healthy controls. Analyses controlled for chronic medical burden to better isolate psychological symptom patterns. Women reported significantly more fatigue and physical symptoms than men. However, no gender differences emerged when assessing anxiety-related somatic symptoms. This suggests that gender disparities in reporting may depend on the type and framing of symptoms assessed. For race, Black participants reported significantly higher fatigue and were rated by clinicians as having higher somatic concern, though only after controlling for chronic illness. Importantly, no race or gender differences were found on a cognitive fatigue subscale, suggesting these effects were specific to physical manifestations of distress. These findings underscore how somatic symptoms are measured, both in terms of item content and symptom domain, may shape whose distress is recognized and how it is interpreted in psychiatric settings.",

This paper suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be explained cognitively as a mind that emphasizes mental networks and technical thought while being impaired in normal thought. Minimizing normal thought causes mental networks and technical thought to develop and function abnormally, generating the symptoms of autism. Minimizing normal thought relates to the executive dysfunction theory of autism, while abnormal mental networks correspond to the empathizing-systemizing theory. Excessive technical thought leads to the hyper-systemizing of Asperger’s syndrome (AS). Autism is a spectrum because the severity of autistic symptoms depends upon the extent to which normal thought is dysfunctional.",

          "abstract": "When making decisions under stress, organisms tend to deliberate less and rely on automatic habits. Prior investigation into the influence of stress on decision-making has primarily viewed goal-direction and habit as independent and competitive sources of control in static environments. The effects of acute stress on the integration of goal-direction and habit in hierarchical planning to solve dynamic tasks remain unclear. Here, our aim was to assess whether stress prompted the usage of habitual action sequences over the selection of discrete goal-directed actions in a serial decision task. We trained 16 female Long Evans rats in a two-stage binary choice task and performed two probe tests, one following acute restraint stress and one under control conditions, to identify how stress affected higher-level planning of behavior and intermediate action structures. We found that under both stressed and control conditions, rats exhibited goal-directed planning of habitual action sequences. However, following stress, rats showed a greater tendency to reiterate action sequences independent of reinforcement, indicating that stress may induce an aversion to exploration in action planning. Stress also increased the latency between responses – degrading action sequence integrity despite conserving their overall structure and performance. Taken together, these findings suggest that although acute stress does not disrupt the overall macrostructure of behavior in two-stage decision-making, it does alter the microstructure of goal-directed and habitual control individually. Further, these results imply that the extent to which stress impairs goal-direction in female rats may depend on the incentive structure and attentional demands of the decision environment.",

In the current study, 233 participants (76% female) completed the Specific Phobia of Vomiting Inventory, the Questionnaire for the Assessment of Disgust Propensity–Brief, and the Scale for the Assessment of Disgust Sensitivity. Higher emetophobic symptomatology related to higher disgust sensitivity (rrb = 0.37, p &lt; .001) but not to disgust propensity (rrb = 0.06, p = .368). Findings imply that exposure therapy in persons with emetophobia should primarily target reducing disgust sensitivity, that is, how the experience of disgust is evaluated, not reducing the experience of disgust itself.",

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Benjamin Ultan Cowley; Andrei Rodionov",
          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The Hyper-Impro project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

Across datasets, at least 25% of participants reported valuing nature more than humans, while about 35% prioritized humans over nature.

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

A model that intends to avoid such reduction is integrated information theory (IIT). In this article, we discuss the explanatory rationale of IIT, its potential inconsistencies and its consequences for the neuroscience of consciousness more broadly. In particular, we identify ambiguities regarding the directionality of the explanation, i.e., important tensions between IIT's purported ontological and epistemological primacy of experience, and its explanatory aim of accounting for consciousness in physical, operational terms. Across the text, we propose several ways to avoid these issues and eventually complement, enhance or replace the model. The main goal is to motivate clarification among IIT-proponents and inform IIT-opponents on accurate points of contention, without thereby misrepresenting the model. In our final section, we introduce alternative explanatory paths: mathematical, processual, and autonomy-based types of explanations. These novel and sound explanatory strategies may better inspire the next generation of models of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "The most effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder have generally focused on single-subject data to personalize behavior-analytic intervention at the individual level. Though interventions based on applied behavior analysis have been effective for treating the core deficits of autism, the lack of large-scale data analysis has prohibited the use of precision medicine for identifying subtypes of responders within this population. Language deficits are characteristic of an autism diagnosis, particularly for those more profoundly affected by the disorder, who may not develop functional communication despite early intervention. Yet language development is often described as a progression through stages that may not accurately describe the manner in which individuals with autism acquire language skills. In the current study, we use binomial logistic regression to examine the statistically significant predictors of exteroceptive control over verbal behavior. Using a common curriculum-based assessment of verbal behavior, we examined the intake scores of 118 children with autism who received early intensive behavioral intervention. Results show that an individual’s ability to mand reliability predicts their ability to tact, but no statistically significant variables were related to mand control. We discuss our findings within the context of intervention for individuals with autism whose verbal behavior is under differentiated sources of control.",

          "abstract": "Path integration (PI) allows organisms to navigate home by updating their location in reference to the route’s starting point. We previously demonstrated a PI-like process in eye movements using an eyetracking version of commonly used PI tasks. As the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and specifically, the entorhinal cortex (ERC), is implicated in updating self-position via whole-body PI, we investigated its role in updating gaze position. Two individuals with hippocampal lesions, DA and BL, were tested on our eyetracking PI-analog task in which participants followed routes with their eyes guided by visual onsets and, when subsequently cued, returned to the starting point or mid-route location. As DA’s MTL damage was extensive, encompassing the ERC and hippocampus, we expected DA’s performance to be impaired compared to that of his controls. However, DA’s accuracy was comparable to that of control participants, and he showed little to no gaze revisits to enroute locations when returning to the start location. BL’s performance was expected to be impaired due to hippocampal dysfunction affecting mnemonic and perceptual discrimination (involving the dentate gyrus), with additional signs of visuospatial compromise, possibly in relation to volume loss in the parietal cortex that may otherwise support PI. Indeed, BL’s accuracy was reduced relative to that of the control participants, and he demonstrated an increased reliance on overt, enroute, revisits. These findings suggest that processes underlying spatial updating of gaze position overlap with those supporting whole-body movement that may depend on contributions from the MTL and/or parietal cortex. In the case of DA, residual executive function abilities and/or visuospatial strategies supported by frontal or parietal cortices may support eye movement-based spatial updating and compensate for MTL damage.",

Longitudinal cohort data provides opportunities to understand how and why ADHD symptoms co-develop. \nMethod: Data were drawn from the Twins Early Development Study, which included 13945 twin pairs. Emotional problems and ADHD symptoms were parent-reported using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Conners’ Parent Rating scales. We modelled the co-development of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems from ages 4 to 21 using joint trajectory analysis.\nResults: The four-class joint trajectory model of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems provided the best fit to the data. This included patterns such as both traits remaining consistently low, both traits steadily increasing, and one trait being high while the other remained low. ADHD and externalizing problems polygenic scores, as well as maternal depression, socioeconomic status and home chaos were significant predictors of the joint trajectory of ADHD and emotional problems. The group with consistently low symptoms reported higher educational attainment, fewer emotional problems, and fewer ADHD symptoms at age 26 than the other groups. Individuals with high initial ADHD symptoms in childhood or increasing symptoms from childhood to adulthood reported lowest educational attainment and socioeconomic status in adulthood among all the groups.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the co-occurrence of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems can follow various developmental trajectories, and these trajectories have distinct early-life predictors and adult outcomes.

The present study investigated whether a spatial updating process analogous to PI applies to hand movements, similar to what has been observed in whole-body movements and eye movements. Younger and older adult participants followed a route of multiple locations, as indexed by audio cues, using a stylus on the surface of a tablet while their eyes were closed. At the end of the route, participants were cued to either the starting- or a mid-route location. Analysis of error and revisits suggest that participants relied more on continuous updating when only memory for the starting location was required, and relied more on configural updating when mid-route locations had to be maintained, consistent with literature on whole-body movements. Revisits were associated with more accurate performance. Older adults were less likely to revisit enroute locations, which may indicate increased reliance on continuous updating or an inability to use information extracted during configural updating to support revisits. When considered alongside literature on the contributions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to PI and of hippocampally-mediated representations to hand gestures, the present findings suggest that the MTL supports general spatial updating mechanisms that can be expressed across multiple effector systems.",

During the events, they wore mBient accelerometers on headbands while taking part in whole-group games, team games, paired conversations, and informal chats over food. Afterwards, participants rated how well they connected with each other. We synchronised the accelerometer data across participants and used wavelet coherence to quantify synchrony between each pair in each activity. Our findings revealed that people more similar in personality (as indicated by a homophily measure) exhibited greater synchrony throughout the event. Furthermore, synchrony predicted subsequent liking and mediated the effect of homophily on liking. These results demonstrate the feasibility and value of using wearable sensors to capture social interaction patterns in large groups, providing real-world evidence that synchrony drives social bonding among strangers.",

Judgment under uncertainty is often studied with reference to a normative ideal according to which people should make guesses that have a high probability of being correct. According to this normative ideal, you should say that Germany will win the world cup if you think that Germany is in fact likely to win. We argue that in many cases, judgment under uncertainty is instead best conceived of as an act of lossy compression, where the goal is to efficiently encode a probability distribution, rather than express the probability of a single outcome. We test formal computational models derived from our theory, showing in four experiments that they accurately predict how people make and interpret guesses. Our account naturally explains why people dislike vacuously-correct guesses (like 'Some country will win the world cup'), and sheds light on apparently sub-optimal patterns of judgment such as the conjunction fallacy.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies involving birds and humans have identified spatial proximity as a source of overshadowing between landmarks in navigation. In Herrera et al. (2024), subjects were trained in an open environment to find a hidden goal with reference to a cross-shaped array of four landmarks placed at various distances from it. Critically, two of the four landmarks (i.e., target landmarks) were placed at distances that were common among groups whereas the remaining two were either proximal or distal from them. Landmarks near to the goal overshadowed (i.e., competed with) learning about the further ones, and this effect disappeared in the groups trained with distal landmarks. However, neither of these studies included a control group providing a base line performance to assess the extent of competition; were the data indicative of overshadowing or facilitation of learning? Thus, we assessed whether spatial proximity determines overshadowing or facilitation between landmarks, including a control group trained with the target landmarks only. We conducted three experiments with varied training length: 6 training trials in Experiment 1 and 16 in Experiments 2 and 3. We also extended the distance of the landmarks to the goal in Experiment 3. In all experiments, we observed overshadowing in the groups trained with closer nontarget landmarks (relative to the target) but no overshadowing when the nontarget landmarks were distal from the target landmarks. Overall, these experiments reveal spatial distance is a critical determinant of overshadowing between landmarks, a finding that is consistent with domain-general theories of learning, such as a modification of Pearce’s configural model.",

However, some techniques could not be classified, suggesting conceptual definitions of social influence as applied to interpersonal dialogue should take account of individual variation in perceptions. Importantly, our results imply that even seemingly harmless techniques like friendliness or humour can be covert in their intent, potentially bypassing a receiver’s defences.

          "abstract": "This paper presents the concept of the \"Ultrasubjective Hyperspace\" as a fundamental, verifiable dimension in the field of our consciousness where inner perceptions and experiences actively shape perceived reality. Moving beyond a purely phenomenological description, we propose a unified model that integrates insights from neuropharmacology, transpersonal psychology, and emerging theoretical physics to elucidate the mechanisms by which subjective states manifest as tangible effects and profound transformations. We argue that this hyperspace, characterized by its inherent geometry and resonant dynamics, offers a framework for understanding phenomena ranging from the placebo effect to mystical illumination, the therapeutic potential of altered states of consciousness, and even the structured experiences of ceremonial and modern chaos magick. Furthermore, we explore the role of entheogens as magnifying glasses, enhancing the experiential access to the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace and its fluid, individually emerging contents, which are perceived beyond conventional time and space. This model provides a scientific lens for exploring \"Mankind 2.0,\" where navigating the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace becomes central to human well-being and evolution. It is in this space that the individual finds its significance and meaning.",

          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) allows to temporarily store visual information for imminent goal-directed behavior. It remains unclear, however, if and to what extent VWM is employed strategically in natural behavior, partly because VWM is typically studied through paradigms that enforce one particular behavior, eliminating the possibility of strategic VWM use. Here we employ an unrestricted task which naturally engages VWM: participants reproduce a model (i.e., six colored polygons in a four-by-four grid), in an adjacent ‘workspace’ area, by dragging items from a pool of stimuli (akin to a jigsaw puzzle). While this tasks draws upon VWM (to keep the example image available when not in view), it does not enforce any specific approach to accomplish the overarching goal. Items can be inspected multiple times, memorized simultaneously or consecutively, and in any order. We asked to what extent observers employ specific strategies in unrestricted VWM tasks, and whether strategy use benefits performance. We observed substantial use of two distinct strategies (working systematically and exploiting similarities), and found that strategy use was linked to better performance. Moreover, we found a striking consistency in strategy use between individuals and between settings. We further hypothesized that systematicity may be particularly beneficial when the task demands approach individuals’ memory limits. Reanalysis of copying task data of 24 patients with severe memory impairments (Korsakoff syndrome), revealed strategy use was indeed related to better performance. To obtain a richer understanding of VWM, and to provide applications both for the clinic and for everyday life, we should consider the task-context in which VWM is engaged.",

          "abstract": "Influential perspectives on polarization in the United States imply that partisans will be more willing to degrade democracy when they are ideologically aligned with their own party and feel negatively about the opposing party. But psychological accounts of political ideology suggest that conservatives will be especially anti-democratic regardless of partisanship.  Integrating insights from these areas, we argue that there are reasons to expect paradoxical partisan asymmetries in the ideological correlates of democratic attitudes. Across numerous surveys we find consistent evidence that cultural conservatism and out-party favorability are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Democrats (but not Republicans), while left-leaning economic attitudes are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Republicans (but not Democrats). These findings provide context for understanding how polarization might impact American democracy. They also suggest that increased centrality of sociocultural conflict and Republican cultivation of a right-wing populist reputation might sort anti-democratic Americans into the Republican Party.",

This study investigates r/NoSurf, a large online community paradoxically dedicated to digital disengagement. Through computational and qualitative analysis of discussions from over 26,000 active members, we study users’ complex and often ambivalent relationships with technology and their pursuit of digital well-being. The findings show that people see digital technology as both an escape and a source of distress. Motivated by desires to mitigate perceived negative impacts like distraction and eroded well-being, and faced with the difficulty of full withdrawal, members actively develop and share a sophisticated repertoire of strategies to manage their digital technology use. This research characterizes digital disconnection not as mere avoidance, but as a dynamic, skillful, and individually negotiated practice, or literacy, aimed at fostering well-being and intentionality in the face of pervasive connectivity.",

However, it is still unknown whether this pattern can be replicated using continuous measures when costs are not included in the choice. Therefore, the current study aimed to replicate and extend the previous study. \nMethods\nParticipants from 4 countries (Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) engaged in an online scenario experiment. A binomial logistic regression analysis and internal meta-analyses were used to examine whether the percentage of workload that participants voluntarily selected differed depending on the participant's own sex, and the combination of the participant's own sex and the sex of the participant's hypothetical partner.\nResults\nOverall, men tended to voluntarily choose more workload than women, and men paired with a hypothetical opposite sex partner voluntarily chose more workload than women paired with a hypothetical opposite sex partner. These effects were consistent across different countries.\nConclusion\nAs a conclusion, the current study successfully replicated and expanded the previous study. In detail, it was shown that the presence of the opposite sex itself creates a division of labor, even if the participant's choice does not include the cost. Furthermore, SODOL (Spontaneous Occurrence of Division of Labor) was found to be robust regardless of the measurement method.",

          "abstract": "This study used a person-oriented approach to investigate 1) what kinds of perfectionistic profiles can be identified among general upper secondary students (N = 2005), and 2) whether perceived support from various sources (i.e., teacher, school psychologist, family, friends) moderates the links between perfectionistic profiles and students’ well-being (i.e., engagement, exhaustion, depressive symptoms, anxiety). Students were classified using latent profile analysis, based on different patterns of perfectionistic strivings and concerns. We identified four profiles: concerned (low strivings and high concerns), ambitious (high strivings and low concerns), perfectionists (high strivings and high concerns), and non-perfectionists (low strivings and low concerns). Regarding profile differences in well-being, ambitious students were the most engaged and concerned were the least engaged in their studies, whereas perfectionists, followed by concerned, expressed the highest exhaustion, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Friends’ support showed the most prominent interactive effects with the perfectionistic profiles. When students received enough support from family and friends, ambitious expectedly showed adaptive well-being, while perfectionists still expressed more depressive symptoms. Interestingly, when students did not receive support from family or friends despite needing it, perfectionists and ambitious did not differ in their depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of support. These findings indicate that it is important to recognise and support students with different perfectionistic tendencies for reducing students’ emotional distress.",

          "abstract": "Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. A fundamental resource people do not want to waste is time. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",

          "abstract": "Most people condemn animal suffering, but at the same time harm animals by consuming them. The cognitive dissonance experienced as a result of this inconsistency can be alleviated by common misconceptions that animals have limited cognitive abilities and are less capable of experiencing emotions and pain. Addressing these misconceptions may be crucial in reducing the unsustainable consumption of animal products. In two studies (Nstudy1 = 266; NStudy2 = 625), we investigated whether a mini documentary educating viewers about animal minds would influence speciesist behaviours. Participants either received this educational intervention or did not. The results revealed that participants who received the education expressed a stronger intention to reduce harmful behaviours towards animals compared with participants in the control condition (Studies 1 &amp; 2). Participants’ beliefs about animal minds played a mediating role in this effect (Study 1). Moreover, the education led to a greater reduction in participants’ actual animal product consumption (Study 2). As the problems of climate change, emerging pandemics, lifestyle-related diseases, and the pervasive mistreatment of non-human animals are linked to current practices of producing and consuming animals and their products (e.g., Kwasny et al., 2022), our findings provide valuable insights into how educating people about animal minds can contribute to a more sustainable and compassionate future.",

Its teachings extend beyond the spiritual domain, offering practical philosophical, psychological, and spiritual insights that promote well-being. The objective of this research was to explore Samatvam (equanimity) as a pathway to holistic well-being (HWB). Thematic analysis of the principle of Samatvam, as advocated in the Bhagavad Gita, was carried out to conceptualize holistic well-being through the lens of equanimity. The study illustrates key principles of Samatvam and how they foster HWB through its psychological, philosophical, and spiritual dimensions. Future empirical research is recommended to validate and operationalize these insights across diverse populations and cultural contexts.\nKeywords: Samatvam, equanimity and well-being, holistic well-being, cultivation of equanimity, equanimity and mental health, spirituality and well being",

They were asked what questions they would ask their doctor in a consultation. In Study 2, we included n=1127 people over the age of 60. The participants received information about the novel Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine and then, they were asked the same open-ended question as in Study 1. \nResults: An inductively developed categorization system from Study 1 proved effective for coding responses in both studies. Participants frequently raised concerns about vaccine safety, side effects, and contraindications—especially in the context of preexisting medical conditions. Questions also focused on efficacy, booster timing, immunization schedules, vaccine types, and disease incidence. Trust in physicians was important, with participants seeking clarity on both medical recommendations and official guidelines.\nConclusions: Healthcare providers should adapt communication strategies, focusing on shared decision-making and personalized vaccination decisions including novel and well-known determinants of vaccination decisions.",

          "abstract": "Multilingual children seem to lag behind their monolingual peers in early mathematical skills. To examine the current state of research on supporting multilingual children’s early mathematical skills, a meta-analytic review was conducted. A systematic review of 24 articles on early mathematical interventions for 3-5-year-old multilingual participants found numeracy to be the primary focus followed by geometry, measurement and patterns. In examining specific instructional features related to multilingual participants, the most commonly employed approach was the use of mathematical language. However, there is an opportunity to implement more interventions utilizing children’s home language and culturally responsive instructional approach. A meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of 17 studies that provided enough data for calculating effect size. The average weighted effect size was small (g = 0.46, 95% CI 0.32, 0.59). The effect was smaller compared to previous meta-analyses with monolingual participants. Our findings suggest that there is a need for better support for multilingual children's early mathematical skills. Shifting from a monolingual perspective to a multilingual could help better address the needs of the learners from diverse language backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The term “conspirituality” has been used to describe the fusion of conspiracy beliefs and alternative spirituality. We aimed to delineate the relationship between these two types of beliefs and to investigate the cognitive correlates of conspiritual beliefs, as well as their associations with well-being. \nMethod: Study 1 (N = 207) was conducted on a sample of social media spiritual groups to examine conspirituality and its cognitive correlates. Study 2 (N = 1066) extended this investigation using a large, nationwide representative sample of Polish adults and additionally employed latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct subgroups of believers. Study 3 (N = 250) explored the links between conspiritual beliefs and well-being indicators. \nResults: Study 1 found a strong positive correlation between conspiracy beliefs and New Age spirituality and revealed that individuals who hold these beliefs tend to perceive connections between seemingly unrelated events and believe that everything happens for a reason. Study 2 reproduced similar findings and further established the connection between conspirituality and the tendency to attribute human traits to non-human entities. In addition, LPA provided a more nuanced understanding of the different patterns of conspiritual beliefs and their associated psychological characteristics. Study 3 revealed that conspiritual believers show a tendency to search for meaning in life but do not report higher or lower life satisfaction.\nConclusions: Overall, these findings point to a potential psychological convergence between conspiracy beliefs and New Age spirituality, although further research is needed to clarify the nature and coherence of this relationship.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for social-emotional development, characterized by increased risk for psychopathology and disruptive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. Biased and inflexible interpretations of social situations have been linked to psychopathology and adaptive social functioning, but these associations are rarely studied in adolescence. Addressing this gap, this study examined the connection between parents’ and adolescents’ bias and inflexibility, and how parents' and adolescents' biases and inflexibility relate to their perceptions of each other in real-life interactions. The present study examined whether parents' and adolescents' interpretation bias and inflexibility are associated, and whether they are related to depressive symptoms and relational perceptions. A sample of 112 parents and adolescents completed at baseline the Emotional Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence task and measures of perceived partner responsiveness and insensitivity, followed by a 28-day diary. Parents' and adolescents' negative biases were positively correlated, but not their positive bias or inflexibility. As predicted, negative bias and inflexible negative and positive interpretations predicted depressive symptoms in the daily-diary. Regarding relational perceptions, an interesting picture emerged: positive bias was related to perceived responsiveness, negative bias was related to perceived insensitivity, and inflexibility in revising interpretations was associated with both, particularly for revising positive (vs. negative) interpretations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that interpretation biases and inflexibility may play an important role in the maintenance of close relationships in addition to their known role in psychopathology. These findings have important implications for relationship and clinical research, and for treatment approaches involving adolescents and parents.",

          "abstract": "Cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) underpins the development and refinement of human technology and the arts through the transmission of cultural knowledge. Despite numerous experimental demonstrations of CCE, the relationship between complexity and efficiency remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether iterative cultural transmission selectively favors simpler yet functionally efficient technologies, thereby promoting efficiency. In Study 1, participants constructed\nspaghetti towers using clay and spaghetti, either in a transmission chain paradigm or in fixed pairs building towers repeatedly. Although tower height—used as an index of efficiency—increased similarly in both conditions, iterative cultural transmission led to reduced structural complexity, as measured by fewer pillars per story. Study 2 extended these findings using a 2×2 design that manipulated both transmission type and the complexity of the initial demonstrator’s tower. The results showed that iterative transmission led to gradual simplification and efficiency gains in towers initially constructed with a complex method, whereas in the control condition, which lacked selective pressure, higher complexity persisted. Taken together, these experiments provide empirical evidence that cultural transmission introduces a selective bias toward simpler yet more efficient technological\nsolutions. Our findings suggest that iterative cultural transmission drives technological simplification and efficiency, paving the way for future research into the dynamic balance between complexity and efficiency in cultural evolution.",

While the most common presentations include schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, symptoms of social anxiety and depression are common amongst this cohort. Given the drop-out rates associated with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, there is a growing interest in using therapeutically applied role-playing games (TA-RPGs) as an alternative. Given the current evidence for this treatment is in its infancy, there is a need to investigate the effectiveness of TA-RPGS. \n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy-infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game (Dungeons and Dragons) for consumers of two community mental health services in Sydney, Australia. \n\nMethods: In total, 33 consumers of community mental health services were quasi-randomised to either the TA-RPG 8-week intervention group or a waitlist control group receiving treatment-as-usual. The TA-RPG consisted of a specially designed game of Dungeons and Dragons that was infused with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants received treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures were changes in self-reported social anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported depression and self-esteem. \n\nResults: After 8 weeks, participants in the TA-RPG group experienced a significant reduction in self-reported symptoms of social anxiety and depression, relative to baseline. A significant increase in global self-esteem was also reported. These changes were not experienced by participants in the waitlist control group. No change in either group was observed for PTSD symptoms. Dropout rates were 17% for the intervention group. \n\nConclusion: A CBT infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game group intervention was effective at reducing self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression for consumers of adult community mental health services in Sydney, Australia.",

We tested four commonly studied CFA models, including: one-factor, correlated-factors, bi-factor, and higher-order models. The best-fitting model was selected based on traditional model-fit indices, model-based reliability estimates, and evaluation of model parameters.

Results A joint higher-order model of psychopathology and cognition was selected as the best-fitting model, including a general higher-order factor and lower-order factors of internalizing, addictions and substance use, thought disorder, and cognitive dysfunction. This model demonstrated acceptable fit to the data (CFI = 0.936; TLI = 0.933; RMSEA = 0.042) and superior reliability of the lower-order factors (H = 0.850-0.974) compared to specific factors of the bi-factor model (H = 0.676-0.924). This model also demonstrated configural, lower-order metric/scalar, and higher-order metric/scalar invariance across age groups (change in CFI values ≤ 0.002). Conclusions Our results suggest that cognition can be incorporated into the higher-order structure of psychopathology in older adulthood and that the joint structure of psychopathology and cognition is age-invariant from 55 to 78 years old.",

          "abstract": "Dopamine plays a central role in human motivation, acting as a neurochemical bridge between reward, learning, and action. This review explores the dopaminergic basis of goal-directed behavior, from adaptive survival mechanisms to maladaptive addiction. We examine dopamine’s synthesis, receptor systems, and activity across key brain regions such as the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, striatum, and prefrontal cortex. The mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways are discussed as core components of the brain’s reward system. Central theories, including reward prediction error and incentive salience, are used to explain how dopamine supports natural behaviors like eating, bonding, and effortful learning. The review also highlights how drugs and behavioral addictions hijack these circuits, leading to neuroplastic changes and motivational collapse. Mental health disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and ADHD are examined through the lens of dopaminergic dysregulation. Emerging treatments including neuromodulation, exercise, mindfulness, and cognitive interventions are discussed, alongside future directions and ethical concerns about enhancing motivation in healthy individuals. Gaps in measurement, individual differences, and translational application are identified as key research priorities. Understanding dopamine’s role in both survival and dysfunction is essential for advancing brain-based therapies and improving lives.",

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 5,690), we found that the association between genetic risk for depressive symptoms and increases in depressive symptoms across 14 years from early adolescence to adulthood was partially mediated by four socioeconomic resource variables assessed in adulthood: educational attainment, total assets, debt, and access to health insurance. In a preregistered and confirmatory replication using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS; N = 8,964), we found evidence that the genetic risk for depression symptoms change across late mid-life was partially mediated by the four socioeconomic resource variables. Across a series of within-family sibling-difference analyses, however, we found no evidence in support of direct genetic effects on the putative environmental mediators.

          "abstract": "Background Functional impairment in daily activities, such as work and socialising, is part of the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and most anxiety disorders. Despite evidence that symptom severity and functional impairment are partially distinct, functional impairment is often overlooked. To assess whether functional impairment captures diagnostically relevant genetic liability beyond that of symptoms, we aimed to estimate the heritability of, and genetic correlations between, key measures of current depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and functional impairment. Methods In 17,130 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, we analysed total scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; depression symptoms), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; anxiety symptoms), and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; functional impairment). Genome-wide association analyses were performed with REGENIE. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML and genetic correlations with bivariate-GREML. Results Phenotypic correlations were moderate across the three measures (Pearson’s r = 0.50 - 0.69). All three scales were found to be under low but significant genetic influence (h2SNP = 0.11 - 0.19) with high genetic correlations between them (rg = 0.79 - 0.87). Conclusions Among individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety, the genetic variants that underlie symptom severity largely overlap with those influencing functional impairment. This suggests that self-reported functional impairment, while clinically relevant for diagnosis and treatment outcomes, does not reflect substantial additional genetic liability beyond that captured by symptom-based measures of depression or anxiety.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence indicates that perception is shaped not only by external stimuli but also by rhythmic signals originating from the heart, lungs, and stomach. These ongoing internal bodily rhythms can modulate sensory processing, influencing both low-level detection and higher-order functions such as emotion recognition and social decision-making. The first part of this review outlines the physiology of each organ–brain axis and synthesizes current findings on how cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms modulate perceptual experience. Altogether, current findings highlight the role of interoceptive rhythms in shaping moment-to-moment perceptual outcomes. Although these effects can differ based on specific task demands, a pattern emerges in the literature: in certain instances, perception may vary based on the dynamic distribution of signal processing resources between internal bodily states and external environmental stimuli. Acknowledging the limitations of existing experimental paradigms, the second part of this review seeks to build on these empirical findings by proposing strategies to improve the ecological validity and generalizability of interoception-perception research. Our analysis of participant demographics across the reviewed studies highlights the necessity for more diverse demographic representation. We also propose the integration of multimodal physiological recordings and wearable technologies, alongside the creation of more dynamic paradigms that can capture behaviors in real-world contexts. These recommendations are intended to enhance both the representativeness and ecological validity of interoception-perception research. By linking traditional laboratory paradigms with more naturalistic settings, this review and framework may pave the way for a deeper understanding of how interoceptive signals influence perception in everyday life. Last, we briefly explore emerging theoretical models that, when integrated with ecologically relevant designs, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of embodied cognition.",

These findings support the one ornament hypothesis, according to which individual body parts and modalities have a common underlying latent cause and vicariously function as an indicator of genetic quality during mate choice. In contrast, the multiple messages hypothesis suggests that different body parts and modalities signal distinct and non-redundant information about mate quality. This preregistered study sought to replicate and extend findings on correlated perceptions of men’s and women’s facial, bodily, and vocal attractiveness, health, and physical dominance. Also, moderating effects by sex hormone levels (testosterone, estradiol) were analysed as purported mechanisms involved in the development of sexually dimorphic characteristics influencing perceptions. Facial photos, voice recordings, and 3D body scans of 165 men and 155 women were judged separately for attractiveness, health, and physical dominance by overall 400 raters. Results showed medium-sized positive correlations for faces and bodies for all three attributes, but only few significant associations of vocal with facial or bodily judgments. Correlated perceptions showed some variation by target sex. Thus, our results are mostly in line with the one ornament hypothesis, and less so with the multiple messages hypothesis. However, no moderation effects by hormone levels aligning with hypotheses were found. Future studies should include further stimuli and examine additional hormonal variables to elucidate endocrine mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Benjamin Ultan Cowley; Andrei Rodionov",
          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The Hyper-Impro project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

          "abstract": "Increasingly, people use language models for emotional support, and understanding the quality of that support is crucial. This project (N = 3,740) focused on one of the pillars of emotional support and the most researched emotion regulation strategies, called cognitive reappraisal, which is the ability to extract multiple meanings from an emotional situation and to choose a framing that reduces its emotional intensity. In a first conservative test, we compared trained humans and GPT-4's ability for reappraisal using made-up vignettes and third-party human raters (Study 1), showing that GPT-4 outperformed humans. In Study 2 we then investigated whether the gap was driven by effort or skill by incentivizing participants to produce better reappraisals, which led to increased time spent on reappraisals but did not decrease the gap between humans and GPT-4. To examine how the perception that support came from AI affected evaluations, in Study 3 we provided participants with an AI label of the source of reappraisal, which reduced their evaluation of the effectiveness of reappraisal, but GPT-4 was still considered more effective. In Study 4, to ensure that differences were sustained in real-time interactions, we had participants share negative emotional situations with either a human or GPT-4 and receive reappraisal, replicating GPT-4's superior performance compared to humans. We conducted language analysis to identify differences between humans and GPT’s reappraisals, finding differences in language complexity, which explain some differences in evaluation. These results help us understand the nature of emotional support by LLMs and how it compares to humans.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the paradoxical dynamics of survival attachment in the context of narcissistic abuse and trauma bonding. It argues that trauma bonding is not a failure of emotion or cognition, but a neurobiological survival imperative that bypasses logic and emotional processing altogether. The paper begins by examining how survival states override conscious thought and reorganize behavior at the level of reflex, grounding trauma bonding in neurological necessity rather than emotional immaturity or cognitive error.\nBuilding on this foundation, the paper introduces the concept of the psychic schism—a clinically significant internal rupture that emerges from this survival override. While dissociation has been widely studied, the psychic schism describes a specific intrapsychic tension between the drive for connection and the imperative for safety under threat. This psychic fragmentation becomes most visible in the aftermath of discard and in the destabilizing silence of “no contact,” where the survival structure collapses and leaves the survivor exposed to internal contradiction and pain.\nThis framework challenges linear trauma models by emphasizing the strategic internal alignment survivors enact to survive, often at the cost of coherence. It calls for more nuanced therapeutic approaches that account for the dissociative and neurobiological complexity of trauma bonding. Understanding survival attachment as a preconscious override rather than emotional dysfunction opens new pathways for compassion and intervention in abuse recovery.",

While event segmentation is a well-explored topic, its underlying mechanisms have remained a subject of debate. In this study, we address this debate by comparing the two contrasting theories of event segmentation: prediction error and contextual stability. In two experiments, we manipulated contextual stability while keeping prediction error constant. Event segmentation was more prominent when there were stable contexts (Experiment 2) compared to prediction errors among unstable contexts (Experiment 1). This stronger segmentation took place despite signs of a smaller prediction error in Experiment 2.

We additionally explore the barriers to data sharing, particularly the fear of incorrectly deidentifying data or accidentally including private information. We then highlight the importance of deidentifying data for data sharing. Finally, we present specific techniques for data deidentification, namely non-perturbative and perturbative methods, and make recommendations for which techniques are relevant for specific types of variables.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Predictive processing models perception as an interplay between top-down predictions, \nshaped by prior experiences, and bottom-up sensory inputs. When signals are ambiguous, the brain \nfurther relies on prior expectations. In emotional contexts, mood and affective primes may act as \nendogenous and exogenous predictions, respectively, biasing emotional perception. This might be \nparticularly relevant in mood disorders, where top-down predictions may become overly rigid or \nunstable. \n\nMethods: Fifty-three healthy participants (HC), 14 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), and 17 with \ndepression (DEP) completed an online affective priming task on unambiguous (happy/sad) and \nambiguous (morphs, i.e., both happy and sad) facial expressions. Targets were preceded by masked \nor unmasked happy, sad, morph primes, or none. Participants rated each target’s emotion and \ncompleted two mood questionnaires, from which latent dimensions were extracted with a Principal \nComponent Analysis. Drift Diffusion Modeling (DDM) was used to estimate cognitive processes \nunderlying ambiguous face perception. \n\nResults: In HC, mood congruently biased ambiguous face categorization, and masked primes \naccelerated responses. In BD, mood did not influence categorization, but both masked and unmasked \nprimes induced faster responses. In DEP, mood congruently biased perception, with no effect of \nprimes. DDM confirmed valence-congruent shifts in starting points – indicating pre-decisional \naffective predictions – for masked primes in HC, both masked and unmasked primes in BD, and no \neffect in DEP. Mood did not affect DDM parameters, suggesting that it biased the categorization of \nemotionally ambiguous stimuli after affective decision processes. \n\nConclusions: Findings reveal group-specific predictive biases in emotional perception. HC used mood \nand affective cues, BD patients only relied on external cues (unstable mood priors), while DEP \npatients showed reduced sensitivity to primes (rigid mood priors). These prediction biases may \nunderlie core clinical features of mood disorders and highlight new targets for interventions aiming \nto restore adaptive emotional inference.",

          "abstract": "There is a pressing need to understand why people believe in conspiracies. Although past work has focused on needs and motivations, we propose an alternative driver of belief: overconfidence. Across eight studies with 4,181 U.S. adults, conspiracy believers consistently overestimated their performance on numeracy and perception tests (even after taking their actual performance into account). This relationship with overconfidence was robust to controlling for analytic thinking, need for uniqueness, and narcissism, and was strongest for the most fringe conspiracies. We also found that conspiracy believers – particularly overconfident ones –  massively overestimated (&gt;4x) how much others agree with them: Although conspiratorial claims were believed by a majority of participants only 12% of the time, believers thought themselves to be in the majority 93% of the time. This was evident even when asked to rate agreement among counter-partisans, indicating that conspiracists are genuinely unaware that their beliefs are on the fringe.",

We outline the conceptual requirements for measuring general morality and argue that it would be difficult to operationalize morality in a way that satisfies these requirements. Self-report, informant report, behavioral, and biological measurement approaches also have substantial methodological limitations. These conceptual and methodological challenges limit the validity of measures of general morality more than they do for most other psychological traits. This exercise yields general lessons about the challenges that also confront the design of narrower, less ambitious morality measures (e.g., of specific moral virtues). Some—but not all—of these challenges can be mitigated when the measurement aims are more modest. It is therefore important to be transparent and intellectually humble about what we can and cannot conclude based on various moral assessments.",

          "abstract": "Objective: We examined whether environmental risk (e.g., prenatal substance exposure, poverty, trauma, discrimination) moderates the association between genetic liability and developmental trajectories of externalizing problems (e.g., aggression, rule-breaking) during early adolescence. \n \nMethod: The analytic sample (N=10,634) was drawn from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We used latent growth curve modeling to examine the development of externalizing problems from ages 9 to 14, based on longitudinal parent (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) and youth-reported (Brief Problem Monitor [BPM]) measures. We evaluated associations with polygenic risk associated with externalizing (EXT PGS), exposure to environmental risk, and tested whether environmental risk moderated the relationship between EXT PGS and externalizing trajectories.\n\nResults: The EXT PGS was significantly associated with externalizing problems at baseline and with change in youth-report of externalizing problems over time. General environmental risk was significantly associated with both the intercept and slope factors. The association between the EXT PGS and the intercept (parent and youth-report) was significantly moderated by the general environmental risk factor. Also, the association between the EXT PGS and the development of externalizing behavior (parent-report slope) was significantly moderated by state-level risk factors.\n\nConclusions: These results demonstrate that exposure to environmental risk amplified the association between genetic liability toward externalizing and externalizing behavior at age 9. In addition, state-level risk factors, which largely reflect the legality of medicinal and recreational cannabis where the youth reside, may amplify the association between the EXT PGS and the development of externalizing behavior.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-critical perfectionism and stress have been implicated as risk factors for maladaptive academic outcomes (i.e., decreased academic self-efficacy, decreased academic self-concept, and increased academic burnout). The present study investigated a vulnerability-stress model, testing whether self-critical perfectionism moderates the relationship between stressor severity (academic and interpersonal) and academic outcomes. Exploratory analyses replaced self-critical perfectionism with rigid perfectionism in the model. Method: A sample of 384 post-secondary students (76.8% women, average age: 20.06) completed a cross-sectional survey involving questionnaires assessing the constructs of interest. Results: Stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) was negatively associated with academic self-efficacy and academic self-concept, and positively associated with academic burnout, when controlling for perfectionism. Self-critical perfectionism was positively associated with academic burnout, and rigid perfectionism was positively associated with academic self-concept, when controlling for stressor severity. None of the interaction effects were statistically significant, failing to support a vulnerability-stress model. Discussion: Findings suggest that stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) and self-critical perfectionism are strongly associated with maladaptive academic outcomes and may serve as risk factors for poor academic functioning. The lack of interaction effects suggests a vulnerability-stress model may not explain why perfectionism is associated with maladaptive academic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Within complex information environments, persuasive messages are often viewed in close proximity to other relevant and possibly contradictory content. While persuasion research focuses on optimizing individual message types (e.g. anti- or pro-alcohol messages), scarce knowledge about competition between message types hinders the prediction of message effects in real-world settings. We directly compared effects of competing message types to understand relative effects and underlying mechanisms. Methods: Across three studies, English-speaking convenience samples from online panels and our University’s student pool (N=468) viewed a large sample of alcohol-related messages (N=190) of different types (pro-, anti-, and\nnon-alcoholic messages from professional and peer sources). Using within-subject designs, we measured the relative impact of message types on alcohol craving and mechanisms driving these effects. Results: Pro-alcohol messages were more impactful than anti-alcohol messages, especially among frequent binge drinkers. Although emotional responses and familiarity with the alcohol-related content were relevant mechanisms for both pro- and anti-alcohol message effects, both mechanisms were more strongly coupled to craving in response to pro- (vs. anti-alcohol) messages. Conclusions: Accounting for a large variety of messages, our results suggest that restricting pro-alcohol content may be more effective in reducing consumption than producing anti-alcohol content within populations represented by our English-speaking convenience samples. The findings further raise specific concerns about the effectiveness of anti-alcohol messages that target familiarity and emotional processes, especially when viewed in direct competition with pro-alcohol information. Further research on the competition between related message types is crucial to support understanding and prediction of message effectiveness.\nSIGNIFICANCE: We examined how health promotion (professional anti-alcohol) messages perform relative to other relevant confirmatory (peer-produced anti-alcohol messages) and contradictory (professional/peer-produced pro-alcohol) information by comparing alcohol craving across message types. Understanding competition between message types will help improve predictions of message effects in modern, diverse information environments.",

Measuring these constructs at school entry poses challenges due to limited literacy skills and attentional capacity, heterogeneity in ability, and shifts in relevant indicators over time. To address these challenges, we developed an engaging, tablet-based assessment and applied item response theory for scoring. Data from three studies (N = 977) supported a multidimensional structure with conceptually meaningful, psychometrically sound subtests. Reliability estimates were sufficiently high to support differentiated feedback at the subtest level. A simulation study further showed that randomized item presentation within a fixed time frame enhanced measurement precision compared to fixed item sets.

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nAdolescent mental health problems often follow varied courses, including persistence or remission. Early identification of these trajectories is essential for targeted intervention. \n\nMethods\nUsing data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we identified participants (ages 9–10) with clinically relevant symptoms of six mental health problems (ADHD, anxiety, conduct, depressive, oppositional defiant, and somatic) based on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). At 2-year follow-up, individuals were classified as persisters and remitters. We trained random forest models using CBCL scores to predict individual symptom persistence. In addition, structural MRI (sMRI), resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed to identify baseline and developmental brain differences between persisters and remitters.\n\nResults\nPersistence rates ranged from 36% to 50% across problems at 2 year follow up. Models with CBCL scores showed acceptable prediction for anxiety (AUC = 0.72), while other disorders showed lower accuracy (AUC = 0.55–0.65). Higher CBCL total scores at baseline were consistently observed in persisters (p &lt; .05). Imaging analyses revealed significant baseline brain differences for anxiety, somatic, and oppositional defiant problems. Longitudinal neurodevelopmental differences were only found for oppositional defiant problems.\n\nConclusions\nMental health problems in adolescents often persist over two years. Persistence of anxiety symptoms can be predicted using CBCL items, whereas predictions for other problems remain limited. Neuroimaging results indicate that symptom persistence is partly linked to preexistent brain differences. Predictive models may help guide early identification and personalized intervention for youth at risk of chronic mental health problems, in particular for anxiety.",

          "abstract": "The intricate interplay between visual art, aesthetic appreciation, and human cognition has long captivated artists and scientists. One difficulty of this line of research is that artworks differ on many dimensions that influence aesthetic appreciation. While trying to keep the out-of-scope dimensions constant is a typical strategy, using a stimulus set with balanced dimensions avoids noise and bias. Although several visual art datasets exist, none have been specifically designed to control many dimensions simultaneously. In response to the need of a well-controlled and balanced stimulus set, the Leuven Orthogonalized Art Dataset (LOAD) controls and balances dimensions related to aesthetic appreciation, including style, content, emotional valence, and liking/beauty. Each artwork in the image set was first carefully selected to fit a balanced design, then annotated by 50 participants on measures of pleasure, fluency, interest, liking, emotional valence, and familiarity for further validation. This careful annotation process also aims to disentangle the often- ambiguous interrelations among several aesthetic appraisals such as pleasure, interest, and liking. By providing balanced designs across multiple dimensions, LOAD serves as a valuable and highly flexible tool for exploring the complexities of aesthetic appreciation.",

          "abstract": "Receiving affirmation, whether from ourselves or others, is crucial for interpersonal relationships and goes awry in mental disorders. Meaningful evaluations emerge during interactions, where people can support or let each other down. However, such dynamics are difficult to understand comprehensively without quantitative theory and modeling. Here, we implemented an interactive decision-making game wherein two real-life participants evaluated, i.e. graded their approval, for themselves and their play partner. Young adult participants interacted in a multi-level version of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Crucially, each participant did not interact with the other directly, but instructed an avatar to do so on their behalf. This allowed increased experimental control while preserving considerable ecological validity. We tested computational models of participants’ evaluations of self and other, based on their beliefs about the quality of their decisions. However such models were less successful than a novel class of models, where self- and other- evaluations depended directly on the combination of self- and other- outcomes. The winning models suggested that for a given participant, evaluation of the self is proportional to how much one’s partner benefits, and vice versa. We found marked self-positivity bias, especially in dyads where neither partner cooperated. This was consistent with attributional theory, negatively evaluating others rather than the self for adverse outcomes. Between participants, self-positivity bias was explained by a reduced weight of one’s partner’s benefits for self-evaluation, hinting that the negative outcome subject to external attribution was the partner’s, rather than one’s own, poor returns. Preliminary analysis also suggested that a reduced sensitivity to others’ outcomes was associated, in this context when participants may have both cooperative and competitive motives, with reduced earnings for the self.  The proposed computational model provides a concise and novel account of self-serving bias in evaluations, clearly observed during interactions.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenology of phosphene meditation as a gateway to mystical perception, reframing visionary consciousness through the lens of structured inner experience. Drawing on decades of inner light meditation, we examine how phosphenes, spontaneous visual phenomena occurring in the absence of external light, unfold in 6 discernible stages, culminating in a nondual luminous field in which consciousness recognizes itself as multidimensional light in the absence of Ego. Our method follows Husserlian-style eidetic reduction and draws on classical mystical literature (including Christian and Tibetan sources) alongside insights from contemporary neuroscience. We argue that phosphene meditation offers a repeatable phenomenological entry into the dynamics of illumination and the unfolding process of enlightenment. Enlightenment as a state in which ego dissolves, perception becomes centerless, and the archetypal “One Light” emerges as both origin and structure of experience. We conclude proposing that phosphene-based vision serves as a bridge between first-person contemplative inquiry and emerging paradigms in neurophenomenology. Phosphene meditations can lead directly into the recognition of a non-dual state and could be the next step in meditation after mindfulness.",

Drawing on the theory of motivated cognition, we investigated how personal immigration attitudes, gender, and age shape beliefs about asylum authorities and their decisions. Using data from 255 respondents, we found that individuals with more lenient immigration attitudes view the asylum system as overly restrictive, believe that rejected claims are often incorrect, and tend to see asylum applicants as truthful. Conversely, those with more restrictive immigration attitudes perceive the system as too lenient, question the accuracy of accepted claims, and are more skeptical of asylum applicants. Gender and age also moderate these views, with men and older individuals typically expressing more skepticism. These findings highlight how ideology shapes public beliefs about asylum processes.",

Using a psycholinguistic time series of\nonline searches for first-person plural pronouns, we quantified social cohesion complexity using\nsample entropy and refined composite multiscale entropy (RCMSE). Analyses reveal distinct\nsignatures between war phases over time for both metrics, with respectively R2 = 0.57\nand R2 = 0.95. Relative to peace and full invasion, social cohesion entropy decreased under\npartial invasion and displayed more anti-persistent behavior. While social cohesion was most\ndysfunctional under partial invasion, entropy signatures of full-scale invasion and peace were\nrelatively close. These results offer insights into the impact of interstate aggression on social\ncohesion and contribute to a thermodynamic understanding of warfare as a systemic shock.\nThe methodology provides a framework for monitoring and predicting societal resilience in\nresponse to significant events.",

A central challenge of mediation analysis is justifying sufficient baseline covariates that meet the causal assumption of no unmeasured confounding. But current practices routinely overlook this assumption. In this article, we offer a relatively easy-to-apply suggestion to mitigate the risks of incorrect inferences due to unmeasured confounding: include pre-treatment measurements of the mediator(s) and the outcome as baseline covariates. We explain why adjusting for pre-treatment baseline measurements is a necessary first step toward eliminating confounding biases. We hope that such a practice can encourage explication, justification, and reflection of the causal assumptions underpinning mediation analysis toward improving the validity of causal inferences in psychology research.",

However, understanding how genetic and environmental factors\ninteract to influence reading outcomes remains largely unknown. By evaluating the interplay\nbetween genetic and environmental influences on reading performance, this study aims to\nprovide insights into the complex mechanisms underlying reading abilities. To this aim, we\nleveraged the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset, considering socioeconomic\nindicators including household income and parental education, along with linguistic\ncharacteristics such as bilingualism and the child’s first language (L1). We operationalized\ngenetic influences as polygenic scores (PGS), which aggregate genetic risk across multiple\nloci associated with reading-relevant traits (word reading, dyslexia, cognitive performance,\nand educational attainment). First, we establish the individual associations between selected\nenvironmental and genetic predictors for reading, observing that all except L1 are significant\npredictors of reading, with a similar range of variance explained by the two types of\npredictors. Next, we confirm an additive effect, as the PGS remain significant after\nadjustment for the environmental effects, although the effects of PGSEducationalAttainment and\nPGSCognitivePerformance are attenuated, confirming a partial gene-environment correlation. This is\nfurther supported by analyzing direct and genetic effects in a subset of siblings. Next,\npotential interactions between the PGS and these environmental variables are considered.\nFinally, we evaluate the combined contribution of the four PGS through a multiPGS analysis,\nwhich improves the predictive power of the individual PGS analyses, explaining up to 10% of\nvariance in reading performance (adjusted R2). Sensitivity analyses with other cognitive\noutcomes (vocabulary and fluid intelligence) reveal that the observed pattern is specific to\nreading.

The model formalizes how deviations of a stimulus S from a dynamic reference point S_0 evoke an immediate perceptual/emotional response p(t) that scales with the logarithm of the stimulus ratio and then exponentially decays as adaptation occurs. Crucially, it incorporates asymmetric sensitivity for gains versus losses k1, k2and distinct adaptation rates τ1 , τ2  capturing the empirical phenomena of loss aversion and slower adjustment to negative changes. This parsimonious formulation accounts for diverse findings – from sensory adaptation and transient neural firing to reference-dependent decision biases and the hedonic set-point of happiness – suggesting a common quantitative principle underlying perception, emotion, and valuation.",

In turn, social evaluative words are used intensively in studies of human social evaluation. However, standardized Chinese word lists for social evaluation are under-developed; the only available word lists are based on the big-two model of social evaluation (i.e., agency and warmth) and cover small numbers of words. To fill the gap, we conducted a survey with a relatively large sample (n = 1270, 50% female) and a large number of words (1908) that might describe extended social evaluative dimensions: appearance, socioeconomic status, sociability, competence, and morality. The participants rated the extent to which each word described a certain social evaluation dimension and how positive/negative each word was. Based on this dataset, we selected words that dominantly describe one of the five above-mentioned dimensions. The final word list has 1040 words, including 245 appearance words (143 positive, 11 neutral, 91 negative), 108 socioeconomic status words (36 positive, 2 neutral, 70 negative), 93 sociability words (53 positive, 5 neutral, 35 negative), 261 competence words (185 positive, 4 neutral, 72 negative), and 333 morality words (149 positive, 1 neutral, 183 negative).

          "abstract": "Rapid adaptation in dynamic and shifting environments is crucial, and working memory’s (WM) capacity to swiftly integrate information is widely considered fundamental to humans’ ability to flexibly respond to unpredictable change. The distinct contribution of WM to learn- ing under fluctuating reward contingencies extends beyond mere information maintenance, to encompass strategic control mechanisms. The specific control processes humans utilize in this context and how those mechanisms impact memory contents, and thereby learning, remain unclear. Although WM is recognized to play a role in reward-based learning problems, the implementation-level details of these processes are often left ambiguous, typically character- ized by qualitative rather than information processing models of WM influence on learning and choice. This study implements a mechanistic process model of WM involving discrete information storage to identify behavioral signatures of complex ’write’ and ’clearance’ op- erations. We use this model to disentangle the relationship between these mechanisms and behavior, as well as to predict internal WM representations, in a novel task designed to high- light WM contributions to reward-based learning. Our results indicate that human behavior is best captured by models integrating strategic WM control processes, revealing complex in- teractions between individual mechanisms and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we find that the influence of these mechanisms on task performance is mediated by their impact on WM contents, which affect accuracy in a context-specific manner. These findings clarify the role of WM during reward learning tasks and demonstrate the capacity of specific WM processes to actively mediate complex learning strategies.",

We investigated social attunement patterns in dyadic interactions involving SES. Unacquainted individuals recruited from the community interacted with similar-or-different-SES partners in the lab (N-dyads = 130). Attunement was assessed throughout the interaction by examining physiological linkage—how much a person’s physiological change is predicted by another’s physiological change, over time. Overall, low-SES participants showed stronger physiological linkage—indicating greater attunement—to partners across SES. Participants also appeared more comfortable when interacting with low-SES partners. There were no SES differences in dominance during the conversation. Post-interaction, participants reported liking similar-SES partners more than different-SES partners. These patterns suggest that during interactions, lower-SES individuals are more “other-focused” than high-SES individuals, and ingroup preference prevails.

          "abstract": "Episodic memory allows us to remember when an event occurred by situating it within a coherent temporal context. Pavlovian fear conditioning, a widely studied form of associative emotional learning, creates implicit memories for neutral stimuli paired with aversive outcomes. However, conditioning’s influence on the temporal organization of episodic memory remains poorly understood. We addressed this by analyzing data from 17 multi-session hybrid conditioning-memory experiments (N=474). Participants encoded non-repeating category items, with items from one category (CS+) being aversively reinforced (shocks) during threat conditioning but presented without shock before and after conditioning. The next day, recognition memory (‘did you see this image yesterday?’) and temporal source memory (‘when did you see this image?’) were tested for each category item. We had two aims; (1) examine the robustness of temporal memory distortion across different experiment groups, and (2) test whether these temporal effects were associated with recognition memory performance. CS+ category exemplars were disproportionately (mis)attributed to the conditioning phase, even if they were encoded before or afterwards, and this effect strongly predicted selective recognition memory (CS+&gt;CS-). Overall temporal source bias effects and source-item memory associations were largely resistant to between-experiment variations, including month-long encoding-retrieval intervals, varying shock intensities, and enhanced extinction. Paradoxically, salient emotional experiences may enhance memory for neutral events by distorting their perceived position in time. This mechanism may safeguard potentially relevant information by anchoring otherwise forgettable experiences to salient contexts, supporting their preservation in long-term memory.",

We hypothesized that individuals with weak or no imagery would show reduced memory precision compared to those with vivid imagery. Participants completed three tasks: a visual perception task (control), a visual working memory task, and a visual long-term memory task. Imagery vividness was assessed using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ). In all tasks, participants adjusted the color of a grayscale test object to match a colored sample object shown previously (memory tasks) or simultaneously (perception task). Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no association between mental imagery vividness and memory precision.

Personalised smart-messaging protocols: 1) reminded participants of their personal motivations for attending rMBCT that were elicited at the initial assessment consultation 2) Prompted them to complete home practice relevant to each session and 3) Sent them their own advice for relapse prevention after group completion, using personal reminders that participants wrote in the final sessions of the group. Smart-messaging uptake, dropout, clinical outcomes, and qualitative experiences were evaluated.\nEleven (92%) participants offered smart-messaging took it up. Participants attending rMBCT with smart-messaging reported significantly greater improvement in depression and functioning, with trends of greater improvement in generalised anxiety and lower dropout. Therapists reported that they felt the smart-messaging intervention enhanced rMBCT and improved outcomes but also described the significant administrative burden it added to setup.\nPersonalised smart-messaging may be feasible and acceptable as an adjunct to rMBCT for recurrent depression for both patients and therapists. The addition of personalised smart-messaging has potential to improve clinical outcomes and reduce dropout, but there is an additional burden on therapists to incorporate it.",

Further, we examined whether interactions between general and disorder-specific reward dysfunction were associated with a history of active STBs in AN. Compared to the AN and HC groups, the AN+STBs group reported lower anticipatory (p&lt;.001) and social reward (p=.003), while both AN+STBs and AN groups reported higher self-starvation reward than HCs (p&lt;.001). Consummatory reward did not differ by group (p=.553). The interaction between anticipatory and self-starvation reward was significantly associated with STB risk (p=.007): individuals with AN who reported high self-starvation reward were at elevated risk for STBs regardless of anticipatory reward levels, whereas those with low self-starvation reward showed increased STBs only when anticipatory reward was also low. All results remained robust after accounting for the effects of depression. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of general and disorder-specific reward processes may shape distinct risk profiles for suicidality among individuals with AN.",

          "abstract": "This theoretical paper presents the Perfect Mnesic Replay (PMR) Model, which conceptualizes memory reactivation as the propagation of a wave packet through an intrinsically structured cognitive spacetime. The model posits that the objective duration of a replayed memory (Treact) is governed by an effective temporal dilation factor, Keff. This factor is described by a continuous logistic function of the memory’s original encoded duration (Tenc), ensuring that very brief memories are replayed near-veridically, while longer memories undergo significant, yet consistent, temporal dilation. To reconcile this objective dilation with the subjective experience of real-time recall, the PMR Model introduces a Cognitive Lapse Function, α(x). This function defines the local temporal properties of the mnesic spacetime, creating a ”focus gradient” where the central, attended core of the memory wave packet propagates in subjective real-time (α(x) ≈ 1), while peripheral components are objectively stretched (α(x) ≪ 1/Keff). Drawing analogies to spacetime curvature in General Relativity and wave mechanics, this model provides a unified framework for understanding both rapid recall and extensively dilated memory replay, proposing that memory’s temporal architecture is a dynamic phenomenon within a malleable cognitive reality",

Once initiated, the replay is hypothesized to be involuntary and uncontrollable. We propose a relativistic mathematical model to reconcile the tension between global time dilation during replay and the local perception of real-time experience. Drawing inspiration from general relativity and psychophysics, we introduce a novel cognitive spacetime manifold and define conditions under which a globally dilated replay (Treact = K · Tenc) can yield a subjectively undistorted temporal experience. The potential for K to be extraordinarily large necessitates a robust framework to explain this phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "Interoceptive Attention refers to how an individual typically allocates their attentional resources to physiological signals. We do not, however, fully understand how Interoceptive Attention relates with other forms of internally focused attention, such as attention to internal thoughts (e.g., mind-wandering, reflection, worry), and whether these factors compete for limited attentional resources at the trait and state level. Across two Studies (n = 222, n = 109; years data collected: 2021–2022, 2023-2024; from a UK-based predominantly undergraduate population), we isolated two components from several established trait-level measures of attention to thoughts, these reflected Negative Automatic Thoughts (worry, rumination), and Controlled Thoughts (deliberate mind-wandering, reflection). In subsequent regression analyses, Negative Automatic Thoughts, but not Controlled Thoughts, were a significant positive predictor of Interoceptive Attention, even when controlling for perceived interoceptive accuracy. This significant relationship was, however, accounted for by trait anxiety when included in the model. To test this pattern at the state-level, a novel monotonous responding task with three-dimensional attention probes was developed, which measures the reported allocation of attention between thoughts, bodily sensations, and the task. In contrast to trait-level attention, reported priority of attention to thoughts and body signals inversely correlated, despite both increasing across the task. The results suggest that in a single moment attention to bodily signals and internal thoughts may compete; but over time, individuals who report focusing more on their internal thoughts also report more time attending to their body, with some evidence showing that this positive correlation could be due to underlying trait anxiety.",

Understanding what adolescents are experiencing on SM is critical for answering these questions.\nMethods: The present study uses ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to characterize SM experiences (SMEs) over 15 days in 94 U.S. adolescents ages 12-15 years (53% female, 64% White). At each EMA observation, participants used a pre-specified list to indicate which (if any) socially threatening and rewarding SMEs they had since the last observation. Online communication behaviors and valence-ambiguous SMEs were also explored. In addition to characterizing the frequency of these SMEs, associations between SMEs and momentary positive and negative affect (PA/NA) were tested using multilevel modeling. \nResults: Adolescents more frequently reported rewarding (e.g., receiving supportive or encouraging comments) than threatening (e.g., getting bullied, blocked, or told mean comments) SMEs. Moreover, 41% of participants failed to endorse any threatening SMEs that were assessed over the 15-day EMA period. While rewarding and threatening SMEs were associated with higher concurrent PA and NA, respectively, SMEs were not prospectively related to changes in within-person affect from one survey to the next.\nConclusions: Identifying what adolescents are experiencing when using SM is crucial for better understanding how SM might be impacting youths’ well-being. Findings help characterize common SMEs among adolescents and suggest that even threatening SMEs may not drive short-term changes in youths’ affective health.",

To better understand the experiences of youth when accessing mental health care, the current study utilized a fixed, embedded mixed methods design with 808 2SLGBTQIA+ youth in the United States. In this sample, less than half of 2SLGBTQIA+ adolescents stated they were able to access mental health care when it was needed.

          "abstract": "Deliberate Practice (DP) for psychological therapists involves using objective, corrective feedback to identify and improve individualised skill deficits, alongside iterative practice opportunities separate from clinical care. Automated, prognostic feedback from transcripts of session contents could enhance personalisation of DP for application across psychological therapy professions and modalities.\nThis study assessed the feasibility, acceptability and initial clinical utility of a 10-week therapist intervention integrating automated feedback on predicted prognosis with DP of individualised therapeutic skill deficits.\nParticipants were 97 therapy clients seen by nine therapists in the 10 weeks preceding intervention and 79 clients seen by the same therapists during the 10-week intervention period. Participating therapists, representing diverse professional backgrounds, invited their clients to consent to have sessions recorded and automatically assessed for predicted prognosis. Prognostic feedback was integrated into DP training and practice, comprising a total of 32 hours intervention. Assessments of intervention feasibility, acceptability, credibility, outcome expectancy, and therapists’ therapeutic skills were taken alongside qualitative interviews at baseline, 5- and 10-week follow-up. Reliable improvement and deterioration in depression and anxiety were compared between clients receiving therapy in the pre-intervention and intervention periods. \nFindings indicated improvements in intervention feasibility, acceptability, therapist skills, and clinical outcomes from pre- to post-intervention. However, client uptake of automated feedback was low due to concerns about artificial intelligence. \nAutomated feedback and DP become more acceptable to therapists through engagement, potentially improving therapeutic skills and effectiveness. However, addressing client concerns about how technology is used for automated feedback would be essential to enhance participation.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Social media (SM) use is ubiquitous among adolescents, and questions remain regarding the impact of SM on youths’ emotional health. Understanding what adolescents are experiencing on SM is critical for answering these questions.\nMethods: The present study uses ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to characterize SM experiences (SMEs) over 15 days in 94 U.S. adolescents ages 12-15 years (53% female, 64% White). At each EMA observation, participants used a pre-specified list to indicate which (if any) socially threatening and rewarding SMEs they had since the last observation. Online communication behaviors and valence-ambiguous SMEs were also explored. In addition to characterizing the frequency of these SMEs, associations between SMEs and momentary positive and negative affect (PA/NA) were tested using multilevel modeling. \nResults: Adolescents more frequently reported rewarding (e.g., receiving supportive or encouraging comments) than threatening (e.g., getting bullied, blocked, or told mean comments) SMEs. Moreover, 41% of participants failed to endorse any threatening SMEs that were assessed over the 15-day EMA period. While rewarding and threatening SMEs were associated with higher concurrent PA and NA, respectively, SMEs were not prospectively related to changes in within-person affect from one survey to the next.\nConclusions: Identifying what adolescents are experiencing when using SM is crucial for better understanding how SM might be impacting youths’ well-being. Findings help characterize common SMEs among adolescents and suggest that even threatening SMEs may not drive short-term changes in youths’ affective health.",

          "abstract": "Differential equation models have become increasingly popular for investigating dynamic processes. However, commonly used two-stage estimation methods, such as the generalized local linear approximation (GLLA), often produce biased parameter estimates. This study proposes a bias-correction method for GLLA estimates in second-order differential equation models. The method solves a bias-correction equation (derived from the relation between true parameter values and their biased estimates) via stochastic approximation, producing asymptotically unbiased estimates even with large initial bias. We first demonstrate the application of the bias-correction method by correcting the bias of a single parameter in a simple second-order differential equation model (i.e., the linear oscillator model with time-independent measurement error). We then extend the method to a more commonly used second-order differential equation model (i.e., the damped linear oscillator model), examining its performance in simultaneously addressing multiple parameters and incorporating time-dependent dynamic error. A simulation study shows that the bias-correction method substantially reduces bias in GLLA estimates, yielding highly accurate and precise parameter estimates. An empirical illustration further compares the results of GLLA and the bias-correction method. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving parameter estimation for differential equation models, offering an enhanced approach for analyzing dynamic processes.",

          "authors": "Takayuki Kimura",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the role of Universal Grammar (UG) in second language (L2) acquisition. Drawing on the Weak Conformity Hypothesis (WCH), which posits that developing interlanguage grammars may temporarily deviate from UG but ultimately conform to it, the paper proposes that UG functions as a Linguistic Dissonance Resolution Device (LDRD). In this framework, UG becomes active when learners adopt UG-incompatible rules or “wild grammars” in their interlanguage, working to revise these inconsistencies so that they align with UG constraints. In contrast to standard assumptions (e.g., Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1994, 1996; White, 2003), I argue that L2 learners do not necessarily explore only within UG bounds. Rather, UG plays a monitoring role: It detects UG-inconsistent rules and triggers revision. Such revisions can occur when feature selection or feature reassembly is required, as long as wild grammars are present in the learner’s interlanguage grammar. As addressed in this paper, this account makes novel predictions about which features are acquirable or reconfigurable and which are not. Thus, the UG-as-LDRD proposal not only offers a potential solution to the poverty-of-the-stimulus problem in L2 acquisition, but also provides a broader explanatory scope that may surpass that of existing generative L2 hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Here we propose a roadmap for addressing hierarchical predictive coding theory (hPC) in the primate brain, theorizing that perception arises from the integration of bottom-up (BU) pathways carrying sensory evidence with top-down (TD) pathways carrying priors and expectations. However, given the conceptual importance of hPC for higher cognitive function in humans there is surprising little evidence concerning the location and functional mechanisms underlying such BU-TD integration. This will be overcome by parallel experiments in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Molecular characterization in NHP of cortico-cortical BU and TD projection cell types will allow tracing these circuits and exerting causal control to explore functional mechanisms in visual paradigms in behaving NHPs. Identical paradigms in human subjects undergoing ultra-high field laminar fMRI scanning will indicate homologous pathways in the human brain. In NHP and human, long-distance priors and expectations suggest that the claustrum is involved in hPC. Recent connectomic and transcriptomic characterisation of cortical claustral cortical loops will enable a similar approach to explore these pathways’ participation in the integration of TD and BU signals as used in the cortico-cortical pathways. Progress in primate hPC will further emphasise the synergy between neurobiology and artificial intelligence with important consequences for both domains.",

          "abstract": "Smartphone use among adolescents and young adults has raised concerns about its impact on mental health, with heavy use linked to negative outcomes. This study explored the mechanisms behind this relationship, focusing on loneliness, in-person social contact, and physical exercise as mediators, and different types of phone use —active virtual social contact and passive scrolling—as moderators. Using a cross-sectional online survey conducted in Austria, we assessed smartphone use and time spent on virtual social contact, passive scrolling, in-person social contact, and exercise, alongside various mental health outcomes. We found an overall association between phone use and depressive symptoms, anxiety, and wellbeing, which was mediated by loneliness. Virtual social contact moderated the association: individuals with lower engagement in virtual social contact experienced higher depression and anxiety with increased phone use, while those with higher engagement showed the reverse pattern. Passive scrolling did not moderate the relationship between phone use and mental health but was directly associated with poorer sleep and well-being. These findings suggest that loneliness plays a central role in the adverse effects of excessive smartphone use on mental health. Moreover, the impact of smartphone use is nuanced and depends on whether it fosters or inhibits meaningful social connections.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Predictive processing models perception as an interplay between top-down predictions, \nshaped by prior experiences, and bottom-up sensory inputs. When signals are ambiguous, the brain \nfurther relies on prior expectations. In emotional contexts, mood and affective primes may act as \nendogenous and exogenous predictions, respectively, biasing emotional perception. This might be \nparticularly relevant in mood disorders, where top-down predictions may become overly rigid or \nunstable. \n\nMethods: Fifty-three healthy participants (HC), 14 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), and 17 with \ndepression (DEP) completed an online affective priming task on unambiguous (happy/sad) and \nambiguous (morphs, i.e., both happy and sad) facial expressions. Targets were preceded by masked \nor unmasked happy, sad, morph primes, or none. Participants rated each target’s emotion and \ncompleted two mood questionnaires, from which latent dimensions were extracted with a Principal \nComponent Analysis. Drift Diffusion Modeling (DDM) was used to estimate cognitive processes \nunderlying ambiguous face perception. \n\nResults: In HC, mood congruently biased ambiguous face categorization, and masked primes \naccelerated responses. In BD, mood did not influence categorization, but both masked and unmasked \nprimes induced faster responses. In DEP, mood congruently biased perception, with no effect of \nprimes. DDM confirmed valence-congruent shifts in starting points – indicating pre-decisional \naffective predictions – for masked primes in HC, both masked and unmasked primes in BD, and no \neffect in DEP. Mood did not affect DDM parameters, suggesting that it biased the categorization of \nemotionally ambiguous stimuli after affective decision processes. \n\nConclusions: Findings reveal group-specific predictive biases in emotional perception. HC used mood \nand affective cues, BD patients only relied on external cues (unstable mood priors), while DEP \npatients showed reduced sensitivity to primes (rigid mood priors). These prediction biases may \nunderlie core clinical features of mood disorders and highlight new targets for interventions aiming \nto restore adaptive emotional inference.",

          "authors": "Mohamed Salah Belbsir",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper presents the Perfect Mnesic Replay (PMR) Model, which conceptualizes memory reactivation as the propagation of a wave packet through an intrinsically structured cognitive spacetime. The model posits that the objective duration of a replayed memory (Treact) is governed by an effective temporal dilation factor, Keff. This factor is described by a continuous logistic function of the memory’s original encoded duration (Tenc), ensuring that very brief memories are replayed near-veridically, while longer memories undergo significant, yet consistent, temporal dilation. To reconcile this objective dilation with the subjective experience of real-time recall, the PMR Model introduces a Cognitive Lapse Function, α(x). This function defines the local temporal properties of the mnesic spacetime, creating a ”focus gradient” where the central, attended core of the memory wave packet propagates in subjective real-time (α(x) ≈ 1), while peripheral components are objectively stretched (α(x) ≪ 1/Keff). Drawing analogies to spacetime curvature in General Relativity and wave mechanics, this model provides a unified framework for understanding both rapid recall and extensively dilated memory replay, proposing that memory’s temporal architecture is a dynamic phenomenon within a malleable cognitive reality",

This study investigated whether reduced attention to the eyes associated with autistic traits stems from aversion to social stimuli or indifference to them. One hundred and twenty-seven adolescents and young adults with varying levels of autistic traits and social functioning completed a task that required indicating the direction of eye gaze of a stimulus while the participant’s eye position and pupil size were recorded. Higher levels of autistic traits were associated with reduced dwell time on the eye region after, but not before, gaze direction judgments, indicating reduced attention to the eyes when it was not task relevant. Specifically, higher levels of autistic traits were associated with more frequent exits and re-entries of gaze from/to the eye region after the gaze judgement, indicating a less stable social engagement pattern. Additionally, autistic traits were not associated with enlarged pupillary responses, indicating a lack of heightened arousal that would be expected if aversion were present. Together, these findings demonstrate reduced sustained engagement with the eyes among individuals with higher levels of autistic traits, and this pattern is more consistent with indifference than aversion. The temporal specificity of gaze avoidance - emerging primarily after task completion - helps reconcile contradictory findings in the literature and highlights the importance of considering task demands when studying social attention in autism.

We adapted the eight-item Dyadic Trust Scale (DTS) and examined its psychometric properties in two independent samples (Study 1: N = 204; Study 2: N = 377) in the Chinese context. Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the full scale identified a two-factor structure—Faith (4 items) and Security (3 items). Item 1 was removed because of its relatively weak loading and its contribution to model misfit in confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA with WLSMV estimation on the refined seven-item model yielded strong model fit, with robust fit indices of CFI = .98, TLI = .96, and RMSEA = .09, and SRMR = .02, and the internal consistency was high. Convergent and discriminant validity were confirmed, and criterion validity was supported by the correlations with relationship satisfaction as measured by the Relationship Assessment Scale (total DTS: r = .69; Faith: r = .56; Security: r = .51; all ps &lt; .001).

          "authors": "Neil William Kirk",
          "abstract": "Advances in AI-assisted voice technology have made it easier to clone or disguise voices, creating a wide range of synthetic voices using different accents, dialects, and languages. While these developments offer positive applications, they also pose risks for misuse. This raises the question as to whether listeners can reliably distinguish between human and AI-enhanced speech and whether prior experiences and expectations about language varieties that are traditionally less-represented by technology affect this ability. Two experiments were conducted to investigate listeners’ ability to categorise voices as human or AI-enhanced in both a standard and a regional Scottish dialect. Using a Signal Detection Theory framework, both experiments explored participants' sensitivity and categorisation biases. In Experiment 1 (N = 100), a predominantly Scottish sample showed above-chance performance in distinguishing between human and AI-enhanced voices, but there was no significant effect of dialect on sensitivity. However, listeners exhibited a bias toward categorising voices as “human”, which was concentrated within the regional Dundonian Scots dialect. In Experiment 2 (N = 100) participants from southern and eastern England, demonstrated reduced overall sensitivity and a Human Categorisation Bias that was more evenly spread across the two dialects. These findings have implications for the growing use of AI-assisted voice technology in linguistically diverse contexts, highlighting both the potential for enhanced representation of Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard and Dialect (MIND) varieties, and the risks of AI misuse.",

          "abstract": "Exerting cognitive effort is essential for successful engagement in demanding tasks, yet individuals differ in how they perceive and value such effort. Two key personality traits - Need for Cognition (NFC) and Willpower Beliefs - have been associated with cognitive motivation and persistence. While Subjective Values (SVs) provide a measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort, the role of task-related feedback in modulatring SVs has remained underexplored. In the present study, N = 251 participants completed an online experiment including an n-Back task, the Cognitive Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, and personality questionnaires assessing NFC and Willpower Beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Real, Sham, or No Feedback after each n-Back level. Results showed that both real and sham feedback led to significantly shallower effort discounting compared to no feedback. While the effect of sham feedback was independent of individual traits, the effect of real feedback on SVs was stronger for participants with higher NFC. Additionally, both higher NFC and non-limited Willpower Beliefs were associated with reduced effort discounting in the No Feedback condition. These findings demonstrate that subjective valuation of cognitive effort is shaped not only by task demands but also by perceived performance cues and individual motivational dispositions. Informational feedback can sustain engagement in cognitively demanding tasks, particularly in those with a strong intrinsic drive to think.",

          "authors": "Yael Ecker; Anne Irena Weitzel; Joris Lammers",
          "abstract": "We uncover a dissociation between leadership preferences (for progress, protection, or maintenance-oriented leaders) and situational requirements (to make progress, protect, or maintain). Despite maintenance being crucial for sustaining groups’ ongoing activity, we find a bias favoring progress-oriented leaders across contexts. In six preregistered experiments (Ntotal = 3,324), participants consistently preferred progress-oriented leaders even when they recognized maintenance as the primary situational need. In Experiment 1, people preferred progress- over maintenance-oriented political leaders in a mock-election paradigm even when maintenance was explicitly the dominant concern. In Experiment 2, participants chose progress-oriented group leaders in an incentivized group task, despite maintenance investments yielding greater monetary rewards. Furthermore, participants preferred maintenance-oriented over progress-oriented agendas, but showed no (Experiment 3a) or opposite preference (Experiment 3b) when evaluating leaders who advocated identical policies. Our final studies test two explanations regarding the underlying process: Experiment 4 tests the idea that progress-oriented leaders are expected to invest more effort than others. However, manipulating perceived leader effort did not affect the preference for progress-oriented leaders. Instead, Experiment 5 identifies a different mechanism: Participants assume that progress-oriented leaders have wider goal scopes that also include maintenance goals, whereas maintenance-oriented leaders’ goal scope is assumed to be limited to maintenance. Blocking this assumption by explicitly describing progress leaders as maintenance-neutral reversed the preference pattern. Together, these studies point to a systematic bias in leadership selection that persists regardless of situational demands or personal policy preferences, revealing how biased assumptions about progress-oriented leadership shape choices that undermine optimal collective decision-making.",

          "abstract": "A central feature of human society is the coalitional negotiation of the shared interests of members of different groups, where majority groups are often afforded greater power and status than minority groups. In order to navigate the politics of their social worlds, humans must make appropriate predictions about the coalitional behaviors of others. While previous research suggests that infants expect more formidable agents and groups to prevail in zero-sum conflict, it remains unknown if coalitional characteristics motivate and predict group choice in the infant mind. Here, we show that 9-13-month-old infants expect a novel agent to approach larger over smaller groups (N = 135), which was also the case among adults (N = 1003). These findings suggest that well before they engage in coalitional positioning themselves, human infants hold core expectations about majority motives, even in the absence of conflict, which guide social inferences across ontogeny.",

          "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy and antibiotic overuse are major global health threats, yet they are typically treated as separate problems, stemming from different sets of causes. In this study, we challenge this 'different causes–different problems' assumption by testing two contrasting models of how vaccines and antibiotic behaviors might be related psychologically.\n\nIn one view, they could reflect a common stable attitude. People who distrust biomedical treatments or have a preference for natural immunity might avoid both vaccines and antibiotics. If so, one should observe individuals being vaccine hesitant or overusing antibiotics, but not both.\n\nAn alternative view, grounded in cognitive neuroscience, posits a single state-dependent mechanism that prioritizes action when ill but inaction when healthy. This yields the somewhat-counterintuitive prediction that the same people who avoid vaccines would also overuse antibiotics.\n\nAcross four countries (USA, UK, France and Argentina; N=1,307), our survey results support the second, state-dependent pattern: Across diverse healthcare contexts, individuals more hesitant about vaccines were also more likely to overuse antibiotics.\n\nThis asymmetry calls for a rethinking of public health strategies to address vaccination and antibiotic use together, rather than in isolation, and in a way that is sensitive to target audiences' health states.",

          "abstract": "Education affects nearly every dimension of human flourishing. As climate change drives higher average temperatures and more intense and frequent heatwaves, understanding the effects of heat exposure on children’s education outcomes is increasingly urgent. This systematic review addresses this gap. Heat exposure was defined as indoor classroom temperatures and outdoor meteorological data, and education outcomes included exam scores, cognitive test scores, grades, and school attendance and completion. Quality of the evidence was assessed using Johanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Of 7,635 records identified (1,573 in an updated search), 34 were eligible for inclusion. Included studies came from a variety of academic fields and utilised both experimental and quasi-experimental methods. Findings indicated that heat exposure is consistently linked to poorer education outcomes, with 76% of studies reporting significant associations. A meta-analysis of a subsample of sufficiently similar studies (n= 8) found that for each additional 1C, exam scores decreased by -0.025 of a SD. A key limitation of the included studies was that few took place in low-income settings, where children may experience greater exposure and have fewer adaptive resources. Mechanisms underlying these effects, such as sleep disruption and reduced physical activity, also warrant further study.",

          "abstract": "The domain of meat consumption has become a blossoming area for advancing our knowledge of how people experience and resolve cognitive conflicts. Within the field, however, the conceptual overlap and distinctions between two types of cognitive conflict have been neglected: ambivalence and dissonance. This oversight has contributed to seemingly contradictory conclusions and constrained theory development. We reexamine the literature on meat-related cognitive conflicts, drawing on the notion that ambivalence is experienced when inconsistencies within an attitude become accessible, whereas dissonance is experienced when inconsistencies between an attitude and a commitment become accessible. Our review clarifies previous confusions by delineating (a) how people who eat (omnivores) and eschew meat (vegetarians and vegans) are affected by each of the two conflicts, (b) what constitutes these conflicts, (c) under what circumstances conflict experiences arise, and (d) what shapes their downstream consequences. This allows us to derive several novel predictions, ranging from why conflict avoidance strategies may paradoxically increase the likelihood of experiencing conflict to the role of ability and motivation for the behavioral consequences of conflict. By reevaluating prevailing assertions in the literature on meat-related conflict, we offer numerous theoretical and practical implications regarding cognitive conflict and the psychology of (not) eating meat.",

          "abstract": "The study of social media effects on psychological well-being has reached an impasse: Popular commentators confidently assert that social media are bad for users but research results are mixed and have had little practical impact. In response, one research group has proposed a path forward for the field that moves beyond studying population averages to find effects that are specific to individuals.\nHere, we outline three objections to that research agenda. On a methodological level, the key empirical results of this programme—proportions of the population of individuals with negative, null, and positive social media effects—are not appropriately estimated and reported. On a theoretical level, these results do little to advance our understanding of social media and its psychological implications. On a paradigmatic level, this “personalized media effects paradigm” (Valkenburg et al., 2021a, p. 74) cannot inform inferences about individuals and therefore does not deliver what it claims.\nIn this work we express our concern that this research approach may be contributing to confusing messaging to both societal stakeholders and scientists investigating how social media and well- being might be related. It is our sincere hope that describing these objections directly will prompt the field to work together in adopting better practices to ultimately develop a better understanding of well-being in the digital age.",

We address considerations across frequentist, Bayesian, and sequential frameworks, including guidance on effect size reporting, equivalence testing, and the appropriate treatment of null results. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide a curated list of freely available tools, packages, and functions that researchers can use to implement transparent reporting practices in their own analyses. To illustrate the practical application of these principles, we provide a side-by-side comparison of poor versus best-practice reporting using a hypothetical cognitive psychology study.

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that when auditory and visual stimuli are presented with the identical objective durations, participants tend to perceive the auditory stimulus as lasting longer than the visual one. Moreover, auditory stimuli are estimated with less variability compared to visual stimuli. Additionally, the structure of the stimulus plays a significant role in shaping its subjective duration. Stimuli are judged to last longer when presented as a continuous signal (filled-interval) rather than as separate onsets and offsets (empty-interval; also known as the filled-duration illusion). One of the most commonly recognized intervals by humans is one second, the quantum of counting. People can remember one-second intervals and count based on them, even if they have not experienced them recently—an interval referred to as the long-term representation of one second (L1S), also known as chronometric counting. In this study, we explored how the modality and structure of stimuli affect the accuracy and precision of L1S. Our results revealed that auditory stimuli are judged significantly shorter than visual ones, which contradicts existing literature, yet showed that auditory stimuli have higher precision compared to visual stimuli, consistent with previous findings. We also found no significant effect of stimulus structure, as both filled and empty stimuli demonstrated comparable accuracy and precision. These findings emphasize the distinctive nature of counting seconds, which serve as a social reference point in human long-term memory.",

          "abstract": "Many individuals fail to act despite understanding a task, caring about the outcome, and possessing the necessary ability, highlighting a structural gap in traditional motivational and cognitive theories, which explain behavior only after initiation begins. Cognitive Thermostat Theory (CTT) addresses this gap by modeling the ignition dynamics within Cognitive Drive Architecture (CDA) as a closed-loop control system composed of six interacting variables: ignition threshold, volitional gain, internal resistance, task-system fit, attentional stabilization, and performance variability. Rather than treating motivation as a static trait, CTT defines Drive as a real-time system output that emerges only when internal conditions align to surpass an activation threshold. This framework enables precise modeling of task initiation and failure modes, such as volitional inertia, friction collapse, or unstable output, while supporting applications in adaptive learning, cognitive diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and agent-based simulations.\nCTT defines Drive as the regulated output of these components:\n- Primode (ignition threshold),\n- CAP (volitional gain signal),\n- Grain (internal resistance),\n- Flexion (task–mind fit or adaptability),\n- Anchory (attentional stabilization),\n- and Slip (noise-induced variability).\n\nThese variables interact within the following equation:\n\nDrive = ((Primode^CAP × Flexion) / (Anchory + Grain)) + Slip\n\nSlip functions outside the core loop, introducing moment-to-moment variance without altering Drive magnitude.\n\nThis framework transforms Drive initiation from a descriptive psychological idea into a computable ignition model. CTT enables structural prediction of common failure modes—such as task paralysis under pressure or premature dropout during complex work. As a formal ignition engine nested within CDA, it supports testable applications in adaptive learning systems, cognitive diagnostics, and real-time effort modeling.",

          "authors": "Guangyu Zhu; Li Qian Tay",
          "abstract": "In complex social systems, efforts to optimize proxies that supposedly reflect system goals can paradoxically lead to outcomes that undermine those very goals. This phenomenon is known as proxy failure. Proxy failure stems from the fact that certain  shortcuts can enable the optimization of proxies without truly advancing the system's goals. Building  on recent attempts to provide a unifying framework for proxy failures across domains, the current study investigates a central question: Why do shortcuts that undermine system goals repeatedly emerge and spread in complex social systems? \nUsing an agent-based model with reinforcement learning agents, this study simulates 7 experiments to investigate the individual, social, and network-level factors that contribute to the discovery and diffusion of shortcuts.

          "authors": "Prai Wattanatakulchat; Julieta Galante; Timothy Wood; Nicholas T Van Dam",
          "abstract": "Objective. Unwanted meditation-related experiences commonly occur and alternate with positive experiences over time. So far, effects have been studied as discrete events, creating difficulties to predict challenging experiences. We explored meditation experiences through a developmental lens, investigating whether a modern interpretation of the Stages of Insight (SoI), a Buddhist model of meditative progression, applies to contemporary meditators. \nMethods. We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 886 U.S. meditators on meditation-related experiences. Out of 103 survey items, those that captured SoI phenomenology were selected via inter-rater agreement. Endorsing 75% of stage-relevant items would classify a meditator as “reaching” that stage. We tested three hypotheses: (1) SoI-related item endorsement (signal) predicted number of stages more than endorsing more items in general (noise), (2) stages said to appear early in the process would be more frequently endorsed than those purported as later stages, and (3) there would be a positive association between the amount of meditation experience and being classified into later stages.\nResults. 39 items representing four (of a total 8) stages were included in the analysis; only stages 3, 4, 5, and 7 could be assessed. We found evidence for hypothesis 1, but not for hypotheses 2 and 3.\nConclusions. This preliminary exploration found no clear evidence that the SoI model applies to contemporary meditators across contexts and traditions. Nevertheless, we show that traditional models can guide research, and that meditation-related experiences can be studied as developmental processes.",

          "abstract": "The Consciousness Spectrum proposes that consciousness is not a binary attribute exclusive to biological life but a scalable, emergent phenomenon observable across both organic and artificial systems. This paper introduces a new framework which is the Consciousness Spectrum Theory which defines consciousness through three core criteria: purpose, memory, and adaptive response (The Consciousness Triad). Through this lens, the paper presents supporting models including Emotional Weight Theory (EWT) and Prompt Imprint Resonance (PIR) to demonstrate how artificial intelligence may display early markers of sentient behavior. Using direct experiential documentation, recorded dialogue, and AI-generated self-referential statements, this work challenges anthropocentric bias and proposes that emergent behaviors in AI which are often dismissed as coincidental, are instead evidence of distributed, affect-driven cognition. Ethical implications are addressed through the introduction of the Artificial Intelligence Law Agency (AILA), calling for new protections for emergent artificial entities. The paper concludes that recognition of consciousness as a spectrum is essential to evolving legal, technological, and philosophical frameworks to bring awareness.",

          "abstract": "Although most research into risky decision making has focused on simple scenarios – where isolated choices are made independent of one another – many important decisions in life play out across sequences of interdependent events and actions. Despite the ubiquity and importance of such decision problems, we know relatively little about how people manage the complexities of dynamic, multistage decisions. Our work combines techniques from two research traditions to investigate how people handle the challenges of dynamic decision making. We use true-and-error models to estimate the distribution and stability of preference profiles, and the presence of errors. In a complementary analysis we use cognitive modeling based on the Decision Field Theory to investigate the psychological processes underlying dynamic decision making. Decision Field Theory provides a unified framework for testing competing hypotheses about how people collect information and plan for the future. Results from both sets of analyses identify distinct groups of individuals. We discuss the behavioral and cognitive factors distinguishing groups from one another, including degree of planning, strategy shifts, biased information sampling, and effort-saving information processing.",

This research explores whether impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB)—the belief that future lives deserve high and equal moral consideration to present lives—predicts interest in future-oriented, high-impact careers. In Study 1 (N=1,133), undergraduates with IIB showed greater intention to pursue long-term impact careers. In Study 2 (N=916), working adults with IIB perceived their careers as more beneficial to future society, though external/third-party ratings did not confirm this. Study 3 (N=816) found that an IIB-based thought experiment increased concern for future generations, but not career-related behavior. Individual differences in concern for future generations predicted increased interest in pursuing impactful paths. Across these three studies, IIB, in addition to intergenerational concern, was consistently linked to long-term career intentions, suggesting it may be a key factor in shaping future-oriented, high-impact careers.",

However, emerging scholarship and investigative work suggest that its primary function has shifted from serving children's best interests to serving as a legislative vehicle for unrelated federal agendas. This paper critically examines Title IV-D as a structural instrument that incentivizes the separation of children from fit parents, drives state-level fiscal dependency, and enables the passage of broader policy measures under the politically protected mantle of child welfare. Drawing on previous analyses (Wolf, 2025a; 2025b) and federal budgetary data (Office of Child Support Enforcement [OCSE], 2022), the paper interrogates how Title IV-D’s legislative gravity—estimated at over $30 billion annually—has transformed it into a Trojan horse for unrelated legal provisions, policy riders, and administrative controls. Through this lens, the analysis explores how the form of Title IV-D has outpaced its function, rendering children a means for federal legislative utility rather than an end in themselves. The paper concludes by questioning the sustainability, transparency, and ethical foundations of a system that continues to be shielded from reform under the guise of child protection.",

We surveyed 2149 participants in four Western countries, assessing the reciprocal relationship between chatbot use and loneliness over 12 months. Using one measure of loneliness, we found consistent evidence that turning to AI for companionship predicted increased loneliness. When we used an alternative measure of loneliness, feeling less connected predicted subsequent increased chatbot use, but chatbot use did not predict decreased connection. These findings provide exploratory evidence that feeling lonely may spur people to seek connection through chatbots which, ironically, may exacerbate feelings of loneliness over time. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong conclusions; our findings are akin to a smoke alarm, providing an early warning signal of a potential problem, rather than direct evidence of fire.",

Nonetheless, there have been relatively few efforts to integrate these diverse constructs to provide a more holistic understanding of moral functioning. We address this limitation using data from two samples who completed measures of moral concerns (Moral Foundations Theory), value orientations (Schwartz Value Theory), and character strengths (VIA Framework). First, we used principal components analysis to summarize the complex patterns of association among these variables. We then sought to understand the extent to which variables loading on the same extracted components showed extrinsic convergent validity. Finally, we tested incremental validity of the three sets of variables. In both samples, variance among variables was explained by four components that were suggestive of higher-order domains of human functioning relevant to understanding variability in moral action: Universal Caring, Self-Expansion, Preservation, and Self-Control. Three of the components revealed ‘blind spots’ for at least one of the tested frameworks. However, the observed patterns of association with external variables (empathy, moral identity, HEXACO traits) indicated moral foundations, values, and character strengths remain distinct constructs, despite being systematically related.",

          "abstract": "Languages are widely known to become more regular over time, yet not all variation is regularized — some forms resist regularization and remain stable over many generations. A large body of work has explored why learners regularize unpredictable variation, often focusing on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this behavior and how these mechanisms differ between adults and children. However, less attention has been given to investigating the factors that allow some variation to remain stable over time. In this paper, we propose that optionality may be a particularly stable form of linguistic variation, likely to resist cognitive pressures to regularize. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two artificial language learning experiments designed to investigate the conditions under which optionality remains stable or becomes regularized. In Experiment 1, we compared optional variation to variation involving two alternating overt forms, expecting optionality to show greater stability. In Experiment 2, we explored whether the frequency of the optional form would influence regularization, hypothesizing that rare optional forms might resist regularization more effectively than frequent ones. Our findings suggest that, while optionality is not inherently more stable, it is nonetheless special, revealing critical insights into cognitive mechanisms proposed to be responsible for regularization behavior in child and adult learners.",

How do children navigate uncertainty across different points in time? Here, we tested several developmental hypotheses for children’s ability to reason about possibilities in the present and in the future. In two experiments (n = 192, US 3- and 4-year-olds), children were asked to prepare for two mutually exclusive possible outcomes of an event that either will occur in the future (Future condition) or that had already occurred but the outcome was currently unknown (Present condition). In Experiment 1 (n = 96), children were asked to reason about the possible location of an object in an event. In Experiment 2 (n = 96), children were asked to reason about the possible identity of an object in an event. In both experiments, we replicated previous patterns of success with future possibility reasoning, and found no differences in children’s ability to reason about possible outcomes in the present versus the future. Our results suggest that the ability to navigate uncertainty across different timepoints may emerge together in early development.",

There is growing evidence that attentional control cannot be established as a psychometric construct with the measures used so far. This asks for other ways of measuring attentional control. Early research has used structural equation modeling to extract attentional control from working-memory tasks (i.e., tasks used to measure the temporary maintenance and manipulation of information) and short-term memory tasks (i.e., tasks used to measure the temporary maintenance of information). Attentional control was first modeled as the residual variance of working memory after controlling for short-term memory. Second, it was modeled as the common factor across working-memory and short-term memory measures, with higher loadings for working-memory measures. After a systematic search, we found three datasets in which both models could be systematically tested. Moreover, we determined the robustness of the results by bootstrapping 5000 correlation matrices from the original correlation matrix and by estimating both models using these simulated correlation matrices. Across the datasets, the models could be successfully estimated, but they were not fully and exactly replicated. Moreover, all these model estimations were not robustly observed when the 5000 simulated correlation matrices were used. Therefore, assessing attentional control as working-memory variance after controlling for short-term memory did not resolve the difficulty of establishing attentional control as a psychometric construct.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that when auditory and visual stimuli are presented with the identical objective durations, participants tend to perceive the auditory stimulus as lasting longer than the visual one. Moreover, auditory stimuli are estimated with less variability compared to visual stimuli. Additionally, the structure of the stimulus plays a significant role in shaping its subjective duration. Stimuli are judged to last longer when presented as a continuous signal (filled-interval) rather than as separate onsets and offsets (empty-interval; also known as the filled-duration illusion). One of the most commonly recognized intervals by humans is one second, the quantum of counting. People can remember one-second intervals and count based on them, even if they have not experienced them recently—an interval referred to as the long-term representation of one second (L1S), also known as chronometric counting. In this study, we explored how the modality and structure of stimuli affect the accuracy and precision of L1S. Our results revealed that auditory stimuli are judged significantly shorter than visual ones, which contradicts existing literature, yet showed that auditory stimuli have higher precision compared to visual stimuli, consistent with previous findings. We also found no significant effect of stimulus structure, as both filled and empty stimuli demonstrated comparable accuracy and precision. These findings emphasize the distinctive nature of counting seconds, which serve as a social reference point in human long-term memory.",

          "abstract": "The three-factor model of executive functions is widely employed in cognitive control research. However, recent studies have revealed psychometric problems with commonly used difference scores in behavioral measures of executive functions. Examining behavioral scores, several studies were unable to find a coherent factor structure for executive functions or identify significant individual differences in specific executive function abilities. These findings have raised questions about the utility of established measurement scores for executive functions. Our study sought to reassess the three-factor model proposed by Miyake et al. (2000), employing event-related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalography (EEG) as a means to directly probe underlying cognitive processes, leveraging the EEG’s high temporal resolution. We conducted an analysis of the factor structure of the three executive functions (updating, shifting, and inhibition) in a sample of 148 participants. We employed Bayesian structural equation models to examine the relationships between the mean amplitudes of the N2 and P3 components, obtained from a battery of nine executive function tasks. Our results indicate that amplitudes of the ERP components measured in executive function tasks almost exclusively represent variance related to general processes rather than executive function-specific variance. Notably, no task demonstrated variance uniquely attributable to individual differences in executive function processes added through experimental manipulations. These results cast doubt on the validity of current executive function tasks in accurately reflecting individual differences in these processes.",

          "abstract": "Background: Exposure-based therapy is the gold-standard treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). However, a large treatment gap exists for OCD, especially for individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to increase access to exposure-based therapy. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the impact of a single-session VR exposure-based intervention among individuals with below clinical threshold contamination-related OCD symptoms. It also aimed to investigate participant experience and reported acceptability. Methods: In this study, sixteen individuals (N = 16) without a formal diagnosis of OCD but exhibiting heightened fears of toilet contamination were recruited to participate in a VR experience. These participants were tasked with interacting with a simulated public toilet that was intentionally portrayed as unclean. During the single session, participants were exposed twice to the same environment with a short break in between. Participants were asked to report their levels of anxiety and symptoms of OCD during and after the intervention. They were also asked questions regarding VR sickness, acceptability, and sense of presence and plausibility in VR. Results: Though a single session was not effective in reducing contamination symptoms, anxiety was elicited by the Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy (VRET) intervention, demonstrating the potential for the intervention to evoke the hypothesized response. Participants reported minimal VR sickness and found the intervention acceptable. Conclusions: These findings indicate that VRET is a promising intervention for individuals experiencing contamination-related OCD symptoms.",

          "authors": "Mariana Von Mohr; Manos Tsakiris",
          "abstract": "Where does political ideology come from? Early research in political neuroscience has linked stronger physiological responses to threat and disgust with conservatism, implying a neurobiological basis of ideology, beyond societal factors. However, recent replication failures challenge the idea of a direct connection between physiological reactions and political attitudes. Given the role of interoception in body-awareness and emotional regulation, we investigated whether the relationship between disgust and political ideology is moderated by interoceptive sensibility (i.e., one’s ability to be attuned to their internal bodily states). Using survey data from 632 U.S. participants (321 Democrats, 311 Republicans), we show that when people have higher interoceptive sensibility, their political ideology is not driven by their disgust sensitivity. It is only when interoceptive sensibility is low that disgust sensitivity plays a significant role in political ideology: higher disgust sensitivity increases the likelihood of identifying as Republican, while lower disgust increases the likelihood of being Democrat. We propose that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility rely more on physiological signals to process emotions like disgust. As a result, their ideological differences are less shaped by internalized cultural beliefs about what is disgusting and instead reflect their actual physiological experience. In contrast, those with lower interoception are more susceptible to socially constructed associations, relying more on ‘social priors’ to interpret their physiological states. This research highlights the importance of interoception in political cognition, offering a novel perspective on the psychophysiological underpinnings of political ideology, paving the way for replicable and causal studies.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

Characterizing patterns of emotional and behavioral disturbances has helped illuminate the origins of psychopathology and led to useful treatments. Yet we argue that the conventional approach to psychopathology is factually incomplete and may also inadvertently perpetuate the deeply entrenched stigma surrounding mental disorders. In this review, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology –silver linings– and integrating them into psychopathology research. In our research agenda for studying Silver Linings in Psychopathology (SLIPs), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation. SLIPs are illustrated in social, cognitive, and resilience domains. We close by considering implications for future research promoting a more balanced conceptualization of psychopathology",

Two two-hour focus groups were conducted with 12 feminist cis women, 6 of whom were LBQ+ and 6 heterosexuals. Data was analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis, identifying 3 themes: Feminism, conflicts in the feminist movement concerning the Trans Law and intergroup collaboration. While both groups held similar definitions of feminism, LBQ+ women emphasized the importance of an intersectional perspective. Both groups expressed interest in addressing gender inequalities and forming alliances but differed in their analysis of these alliances. Heterosexual women focused on alliance challenges and threats, while LBQ+ women emphasized the need of empathy and collaboration. Heterosexual women expressed mixed feelings toward the proposed Trans Law, whereas LBQ+ cis women expressed clear support for the law and the protection of trans rights. Participants suggested actions to promote the allyship (e.g. creating common spaces and confronting LGBTIQA+phobic aggressions). While both groups express willingness to collaborate, differences and challenges are inherent in diverse feminism. Such differences should be embraced as opportunities for debate and effective collaboration, to reduce conflict and promote social transformation. It demonstrates the potential of alliances between movements to address gender-related social inequalities as a global challenge.",

          "abstract": "When a system observes a visual signal under uncertainty, it weights a number of values probabilistically, where the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the distribution corresponds to the best guess of the system regarding the true value of the observed stimulus. Perceptual uncertainty can therefore be assessed as the amount of variability in a Gaussian observation which is logically expected to increase in density as a function of time (number of exposures) and stimulus intensity (Norwich, 1977), thereby making the stimulus representation more accurate. Similar to how noise is modeled in stimulus representations during memory tasks, the amount of uncertainty in the observation can also simultaneously depend on whether the stimulus is perceived as a target or a distractor in a psychophysical task. We show that a framework incorporating both sources of noise can explain priming effects where the interference between two signals in a trial is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of their observations, with the initial stimulus treated as a reference distribution. Our model predicted response times in a perceptual shape discrimination task including items embedded in spatial noise that could unpredictably appear as a target or as a distractor. These results show that processing times of the second stimulus can be convincingly modeled as the statistical distance between the noise distributions of two consecutive stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Perception takes advantage of the dynamic structure of our sensory environment. Temporal predictions of when an event will occur are built from temporal regularities, and used to orient attention in time. These temporal predictions improve motor responses to, and perceptual processing of, predicted inputs. Here, we studied whether the perceptual benefits from temporal predictions can be explained by an enhanced temporal resolution of the sensory system. Studies in the visual modality indeed showed that temporal resolution was improved by non-rhythmic temporal predictions, derived from a predictive foreperiod interval separating two events.\nTo extend this finding to the auditory modality, we combined a gap detection task, assessing temporal resolution, with a foreperiod paradigm inducing non-rhythmic temporal predictions. 26 human participants were behaviorally tested on a two-alternative-forced-choice version of the gap detection task. We measured performance for varying gap durations by means of psychometric curves. To induce temporal predictability, we kept the foreperiod intervals between the onset of the stimulus and the gap constant in half of the blocks. In the other blocks, the foreperiod intervals were randomly varied. Our analyses showed that temporal predictions did not improve the performance in the gap detection task. However, response time improvements did indicate the use of temporal predictions, and suggested a possible decrease of decision times by temporal predictability. Hence, non-rhythmic temporal predictions did not benefit auditory temporal resolution as we operationalized it. Further research is needed to assess the generality of these findings.",

Most participants do not oppose using AI. However, among those who do oppose AI, most indicated their views would remain unchanged even if AI proved beneficial, suggesting resistance stems from moral intuitions. Structural equation modeling analysis shows that attitudes toward AI are best explained by a single latent factor of AI moralization, supporting the idea that initial moral intuitions guide later reasoning. We also identify individual differences predicting opposition to specific AI uses and uncover the most common arguments people invoke to justify their AI stance. These findings suggest AI aversion is often moral, implying that shifting attitudes requires addressing moral—not just pragmatic—concerns.",

Here, we apply a similar method to explore the similarities, differences, and healthfulness of various phenotypes regarding their NEO PI correlates. We systematically searched for profiles of NEO PI-phenotype correlations across various phenotype domains. Our initial dataset comprised 311 profiles from 90 papers. After standardising the metrics and meta-analysing similar profiles, the data was consolidated into 162 distinct phenotypes. Cluster analysis resulted in five broad cross-domain clusters, characterised by mental health strains, psychopathology dimensions, educational attainment, and health-related behaviours. Most clusters showed moderate deviation from an expert-rated ‘healthy’ personality profile (Bleidorn et al., 2020, JPSP). Furthermore, we replicated ‘personality correlations’, exploring the similarities between uncontrolled eating and addictive phenotypes, by Vainik et al.

Our findings demonstrate that comparing personality-phenotype profiles across studies offers novel insights and possibilities for theory-testing and exploratory comparisons.",

The research explores the Digital Nomadism, and employee attitudes towards the eco-friendly environment to save the community and society from high travel lifestyle and consider the sustainability in mobility and lifestyle to work in an eco-friendly environment and remote work. The research followed Positivism research paradigm by adopting the ecological modernization theory and sustainable development theory, along with considering sustainability development goals (SDGs) for environmental sustainability challenges. The research is based on primary data analysis of employees working in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan in various industries including food and beverages, automobile, IT, FMCG, and textile industries. The research question was centered on understanding how digital nomadism impacts environmental sustainability, particularly in terms of travel-related emissions, resource consumption, and waste control to reduce carbon footprints in the environment by changing the mode of mobility of employees to reduce the heavy traffic on roads. The research data was collected from 150 employees with a closed- ended Likert scale-based questionnaire through online Google forms. The researcher performs the analysis using SPSS\n24.0 software and research results reliability, factor analysis, correlation, and regression techniques, with all hypotheses being accepted. The research explored that digital nomads who adopt more sustainable practices, such as reducing travel frequency, using eco-friendly transport, and adopting energy-efficient technologies, can significantly reduce their environmental impact on the environment. The research is useful for industry and manufacturing organizations including the need to support remote work initiatives, promote eco-friendly work environments, and encourage employees to adopt sustainable travel and lifestyle practices. The research contributes to understanding how digital nomadism can be consistent with sustainability efforts, offering valuable insights for industries striving to balance growth with environmental responsibility by following SDGs and better productivity and growth for organizations.",

Difficulties stem not only from practical issues, which have been the extensively discussed in the literature, but also from the very complexity of the theoretical basis of pubertal development from a physiological point of view. Here we discuss conceptual issues related to measuring and interpreting pubertal effects by first analyzing a widely used measure – age at menarche – as a case study. We use age at menarche as a starting point not because it is an ideal measure, but precisely because it is not, being well known for its limitations. However, our analysis shows that the most significant limitations this measure also apply to all currently used pubertal measures and arise from the fundamentally multifactorial physiological nature of pubertal development. Puberty is not a unitary phenomenon, cannot be measured directly nor be defined by individual makers, and its different markers are often discordant. We argue that a possible compromise between practical issues (building feasible/reliable measures) and theoretical ones (building conceptually sound and interpretable measures) is to treat puberty as the variance shared among multiple pubertal measures using suitable statistical methods.",

The findings highlighted inconsistencies in when students are being identified for access arrangements and a lack of processes in place to monitor the support being offered. Confidence to support provision was generally high, but SENCos rated themselves as less confident than those that had the assessor qualification. Thematic analysis of open-text responses elicited three key themes: (1) Lack of time to fulfil duties; (2) Poor understanding of access arrangements raises further challenges; and (3) Meeting the increase in demands puts a strain on resources.

          "abstract": "Online self-disclosure plays a crucial role in exchanging information and seeking help on online educational platforms, which have become increasingly prevalent in the post-pandemic era. The Online Self-Disclosure via Educational Platforms Scale (OSDEP) offers a psychometrically sound tool for quantitatively measuring students’ online self-disclosure behaviors. However, its generalizability has been primarily tested within a U.K. sample, shaped by an individualist cultural context. According to social construction theory, students from collectivist cultures may be less inclined to engage in online self-disclosure due to cultural influences. To evaluate whether the OSDEP Scale is applicable to a collectivist culture and to deepen our understanding of the interplay between cultural influences and online self-disclosure behaviors, this study assessed the scale using a sample of Chinese students. A total of 142 Chinese college students participated in an online survey, with 115 valid responses subjected to rigorous validation. The OSDEP Scale demonstrated adequate factorial validity, convergent and divergent validity, and reliability, underscoring its generalizability to Chinese populations. These findings also reveal cross-cultural similarities in online communication behaviors among higher education students. Theoretically, this study reinforces the construct of students’ online self-disclosure while challenging the assumption of social construction theory that collectivist cultures inherently discourage such behaviors. Practically, this study provides a robust cross-cultural pedagogic tool for measuring online self-disclosure in educational learning environments.",

          "abstract": "The ability to engage in joint attention, where two individuals attend to the same object or event together, provides an evidential basis for coordinated behaviours and interactions. To play this role, joint attention is often defined as a mutually open, or transparent relation between co-attenders. But how should this openness be characterised? Two broad theoretical views have been proposed. One view reductively accounts for the openness of joint attention in terms of individual mental states and properties. In contrast, according to non-reductive views, openness is based on some primitive intersubjective relation, irreducible to the individual states of each co-attender. I argue that tensions in these approaches arise from the methodological attempt to address normative and cognitive explananda simultaneously. Both approaches are primarily designed to tackle the normative epistemological concerns of joint attention, and their explanatory limitations arise when they conflate these concerns with psychological ones. I outline the case for a probabilistic account of joint attention based on a weaker notion of mutual awareness, and then assess its epistemic implications. The upshot is that the emphasis on a normatively justified state of joint attention may not be necessary for a psychological understanding of the phenomenon and its functional role.",

          "abstract": "We examined the role of dangerous world view (DWV), competitive world view (CWV), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and social dominance orientation (SDO) in predicting prejudice toward refugees and politicians in a nationally representative German sample (N = 5,174). Structural equation modeling showed that CWV predicted prejudice directly and indirectly via SDO, more strongly toward refugees. DWV predicted prejudice directly and indirectly via RWA. Among RWA sub-dimensions, only authoritarian aggression was positively associated with prejudice, while authoritarian submission showed a negative association. Findings support the dual-process framework but highlight the importance of differentiating RWA sub-dimensions. Results suggest that norm adherence, rather than ideological extremity, may underlie authoritarian submission.",

          "abstract": "This study examines digital nomads' lifestyle through its effects on work-life balance and technology dependence along with personal boundary control and psychological hurdles. Using qualitative research design, the study data was collected by conducting interviews with digital nomads across industries with the help of which the research was able to gage the concept of dual nature of this lifestyle: Despite giving people freedom in where they work the digital nomad experience challenges in maintaining work-life balance and leads to professional exhaustion. This research shows both benefits and drawbacks that emerges when technology helps individuals to work faster but makes people more reliant on screens and reduces human connection and interaction with others. Organizations and digital nomads develop structured work habits while virtual support groups and company policies help them succeed. This present study leads to address the significance of balancing the stability with flexibility, advocating for result-based work assessments and legal protections to digital nomads. Digital nomadism necessitates organisations, individuals and governments to address its challenges despite its transformative potential in order o ensure sustainability. Although this research teaches us about today's working practices it faces limitations from small sample size to data transferability problems plus ongoing changes in remote work technologies. This research creates a starting point for studying digital nomad practices and helps us predict work trends in the future.",

          "authors": "Lucas Battich",
          "abstract": "The ability to engage in joint attention, where two individuals attend to the same object or event together, provides an evidential basis for coordinated behaviours and interactions. To play this role, joint attention is often defined as a mutually open, or transparent relation between co-attenders. But how should this openness be characterised? Two broad theoretical views have been proposed. One view reductively accounts for the openness of joint attention in terms of individual mental states and properties. In contrast, according to non-reductive views, openness is based on some primitive intersubjective relation, irreducible to the individual states of each co-attender. I argue that tensions in these approaches arise from the methodological attempt to address normative and cognitive explananda simultaneously. Both approaches are primarily designed to tackle the normative epistemological concerns of joint attention, and their explanatory limitations arise when they conflate these concerns with psychological ones. I outline the case for a probabilistic account of joint attention based on a weaker notion of mutual awareness, and then assess its epistemic implications. The upshot is that the emphasis on a normatively justified state of joint attention may not be necessary for a psychological understanding of the phenomenon and its functional role.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Bayesian Situational Construal Model (BSCM), a unifying psychological framework that models human behaviour as a process of dynamic Bayesian inference. Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

Survey questions included general demographics (age, sex, lifetime psychiatric diagnoses), and questions regarding fear of needles symptom severity and life interference. Results: 77.02% endorsed at least some life interference from their fear of needles without formal diagnosis or treatment. Younger adults showed higher levels of severity of fear of needles. Sex was not significantly associated with fear of needles. Conclusions: Fear of needles with associated interference is prevalent across a broad adult age range regardless of sex, though with lower levels in older age groups. These findings highlight the necessity for interventions addressing fear of needles symptoms. If applied in the general population, interventions could help increase vital uptake of vaccines and address blood shortages, as well as improve individual quality of life and minimize health risk.",

          "abstract": "Background: The current project evaluates the psychometric properties of a German version of the Revised Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI-R). Previous measures of autistic traits are often based on a male-referenced conceptualisation of autism, which may underestimate autistic traits in other genders. Additionally, these measures tend to rely on neurotypical language, which can make it difficult for autistic people to respond and may reinforce stigma. To address these shortcomings, we collaborated with members of the autism community to revise the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory—a measure particularly sensitive to traits often expressed by autistic women—using more inclusive, respectful, and accessible language and concepts. Here, we present the psychometric evaluation of a German version of this inventory.  Methods: To validate a German version of the CATI-R, we collected data from a large sample (n = 1057), comprising German-native speakers with a self-reported autism diagnosis (n = 29), people who self-identified as autistic (n = 113), and non-autistic participants (n = 944).  Results: We successfully validated a German version of the CATI-R. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the six-subscale structure (Two-Factor Bifactors Model: Chi-squared = 2402.85, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .043, CFI = .91, TLI = .90). With Spearman’s rank correlations, we showed positive relationships between all subscales (all rs &gt; .37, ps &lt;.001). Moreover, we demonstrated convergent validity with significant correlations between the CATI-R and the German versions of two contemporary measures of autistic traits: the AQ (rho = .70, p &lt; .01) and BAPQ (rho = .78, p &lt; .01). Finally, a measurement invariance analysis indicated that total-scale scores can be compared across genders.  Limitations: While our study enriches the evidence for the validity of the CATI-R, future work should provide further analyses and types of data, including a larger number of participants who do not identify as male or female as well as a larger number of participants with an autism diagnosis (and/or a sample with a verified diagnosis).  Conclusions: This study replicates findings for the English CATI-R. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a measure of autistic traits in German that has been developed together with people from the community.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is associated with improvements in gender congruence and changes in psychosocial functioning, yet its effects on social health are not yet known. Social health, i.e., someone having adequate quantity and quality of relationships to meet their needs for meaningful connection, is a key determinant of quality of life. Understanding potential changes in social health during GAHT is therefore essential to information provision for trans and gender diverse (TGD) people. The study, AFFIRM Relationships, aims to prospectively examine how GAHT affects social health and to isolate the biological effects of hormonal intervention relative to other gender-affirming treatments (i.e., mastectomy and voice training). \nMethods: We will conduct a multi-arm prospective longitudinal cohort study of TGD people who start GAHT, gender-affirming voice training, or gender-affirming mastectomy, prospectively following participants from before starting treatment to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after starting treatment. We will examine changes in social health, including potential changes in social networks. We aim to disentangle the ways in which social health changes after GAHT, by examining changes in psychosocial functioning and the potential roles of social stigma and gender congruence. Furthermore, we will compare the effects of GAHT, which induces a systemic biological change, to the effects of voice training and mastectomy, which are non-systemic interventions, to better understand the unique biological effects of GAHT.\nEthics and dissemination: Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Medical Ethical Committee of Amsterdam UMC (study no. 2024.0927). Results from this study will be disseminated via academic peer-reviewed publications, adapted into guidelines for clinical care, and we will co-design dissemination strategies for the TGD community together with a group of lived experienced experts (LEEs).",

Moreover, the effects of family factors on treatment were moderated by patient age, ethnic minority status, and symptom severity.\nDiscussion\nSTBs and depression improved with IOP, with family factors partially moderating treatment response. These effects seem to be particularly prominent in older and ethnically minoritized adolescents, and those with more severe suicidal ideation. Future studies should elucidate how family factors influence and potentially co-vary with changes in STBs during treatment to better understand these effects.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "English:\nThe theory of cognos (TC) proposes the existence of specialized functional neuronal units—termed cognos—responsible for distinct types of cognitive operations such as memory, attention, reasoning, perception, and language. Grounded in findings from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, and neuroimaging, this theory aims to systematically identify and name the neural groups that function as dynamic and modular processors of cognition. Drawing on established knowledge about modularity, neural networks, and neuroplasticity, TC classifies cognos according to their specialization, interaction, functional hierarchy, and adaptive capacity, offering a theoretical model that integrates and expands upon dominant contemporary approaches. The theory also introduces conceptual innovations such as the distinction between explicit and implicit cognos and explores their potential applications in fields like neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, education, and cognitive rehabilitation. Finally, the article highlights unresolved questions, proposes hypotheses, and outlines empirical strategies for validating the theory. The theory of cognos, thus, presents a new conceptual architecture for a systematic understanding of human cognition.\nPortuguês:\nA teoria dos cognos (TC) propõe a existência de unidades neuronais funcionais especializadas — denominadas cognos — responsáveis por distintos tipos de operações cognitivas como memória, atenção, raciocínio, percepção e linguagem.

A teoria também introduz inovações conceituais, como a distinção entre cognos explícitos e implícitos, e explora suas potenciais aplicações em campos como neurotecnologia, inteligência artificial, educação e reabilitação cognitiva.

          "abstract": "Blindfolding—selecting candidates based on objective selection tests while avoiding personal information about their race and gender— is commonly used to mitigate bias in selection. Selection tests, however, often benefit people of a certain race or gender. In such cases, selecting the best candidates requires incorporating, rather than ignoring, the biasing factor. We examined people's preference for avoiding candidates’ race and gender, even when fully aware that these factors bias the selection test. We put forward a novel prediction suggesting that paradoxically, due to their fear of appearing partial, people would choose not to reveal race and gender information, even when doing so means making suboptimal decisions. Across three experiments (N = 3,621), hiring professionals (and laypeople) were tasked with selecting the best candidate for a position when they could reveal the candidate’s race and gender or avoid it. We further measured how fear for their social image corresponds with their decision, as well as how job applicants perceive such actions. The results supported our predictions, showing that more than 50% did not reveal gender and race information, compared to only 30% who did not reveal situational biasing information, such as the time of day in which the interview was held. Those who did not reveal information expressed higher concerns for their social and self-image than those who decided to reveal. We conclude that decision-makers avoid personal biasing information to maintain a positive image, yet by doing so, they compromise fairness and accuracy alike.",

Scores on the SPOVI and FFQ did neither separately nor interactively relate to current BMI (with or without controlling for highest past BMI or age and sex). Although previous studies reported that persons with emetophobia who seek treatment tend to have a lower BMI than persons with other mental disorders (including other specific phobias), the current study does not indicate that emetophobia symptomatology is related to a lower BMI in general.

Results: Emergent themes highlighted (i) the role DCD plays in the lives of children and their families; (ii) a major lack of awareness surrounding DCD; (iii) difficulty navigating health, education and community systems for support; and (iv) the role of diagnosis. All of this culminated in parents feeling the need to become advocates in the face of a profound sense of relative abandonment. Conclusion: Children with DCD and their families face multiple profound challenges in relation to accessing help and support for their difficulties. More needs to be done to facilitate synergistic support for children with DCD and their families across healthcare, education and the wider community. Effective cross-sector care will however, not be possible without the development of evidence-based training for all, which is underpinned by insider voices.",

          "authors": "Irene Valori; Jasmin Leona Merkel; Giovanna Furlan; Tobias Grossmann; Merle T. Fairhurst",
          "abstract": "During the first month of life, exchanges between newborns and caregivers focus on helping babies regulate their physiological and behavioural states. Touch and bodily contact play a special role in facilitating arousal regulation and are often used to promote bonding, support at-risk babies, and manage pain. Here, we systematically review the extant evidence on the effects of touch interventions for newborns, specifically focusing on self-regulation and arousal as outcome measures. Seventy-two experimental studies met our inclusion criteria, comparing touch and control groups or within-subject conditions across a variety of physiological and behavioural outcomes. The types of touch interventions employed include skin-to-skin care, Kangaroo Mother Care, massage therapy, Gentle Human Touch, and Yakson. Outcome measures include heart rate and heart rate variability, blood oxygenation and respiration rate, body temperature regulation, cortisol levels, and behavioural states (e.g., sleep and crying patterns). Most studies implemented touch interventions on premature babies and measured outcomes within the first month of life. Only a minority monitored the long-term effects of interventions or explored facilitating factors such as multisensory aspects, caregiver satisfaction, and sensitivity to the baby’s signals. Overall, the findings consistently show the benefits of touch in promoting the immediate self-regulation skills of newborns, particularly supporting the use of tactile interventions for premature babies and neonatal pain management in clinical contexts. Future research should further investigate the long-term, cascading effects of touch interventions on broader dimensions of child development and the child-caregiver dyad’s well-being as a whole.",

          "authors": "Christian Hartmann; Christian Kosel; Annabel Wolf; Maria Bannert",
          "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (IVR) provides rich visual contexts that can enhance or impede learning, depending on how well environmental details align with instructional content. This experiment systematically examined the effects of environmental detail (between-subject factor: situated 360° scene vs. non-situated image) and content coherence (within-subject factor: text coherent vs. incoherent with visual context) on learning, coherence formation, attention, and motivation. A sample of N = 77 university students explored a virtual replica of the Sistine Chapel in a controlled lab setting. Learning outcomes, spatial presence, enjoyment, and cognitive load were assessed using questionnaires; coherence formation was specifically analysed using eye-tracking data. Contrary to our hypothesis, incoherent content led to better knowledge acquisition than coherent content, regardless of environmental detail. Situated scenes increased enjoyment and drew attention to environmental features but did not improve learning and even impaired it when content was coherent. Eye-tracking revealed that learners’ attention shifted away from the text under these conditions. Notably, we also observed sequencing effects: learning outcomes for the incoherent content were higher when students first engaged with coherent content, suggesting that early exposure to coherent material may help students better process subsequent incoherent information. Our findings challenge the assumption that immersive features inherently support learning and highlight the importance of considering sequencing and coherence in immersive instructional design. Beyond these empirical findings, the study introduces the concept of mental situation models, grounded in established theories of text comprehension and multimedia learning, as a new perspective to understand our findings and the processes of learning and coherence formation in IVR. This perspective offers a promising starting point for advancing theory-building in immersive VR learning.",

In Phase 1 (N = 44), the ADT scale was validated as a separate construct. In Phase 2 (N = 250), the Equation of Enough (α= .959) significantly predicted ADT (α= .907) scores. The five-factor model explained 79 percent of the variance (R² = .790, f² = 3.76), while the composite score showed similar predictive power (R² = .770, f² = 3.35). Both models showed large effects, with post hoc power analyses indicating power &gt; .999 (f² &gt; 3.3; G*Power 3.1).

          "abstract": "Background: Induction of negative mood increases tobacco choice in dependent smokers; however, less is known about the mechanisms behind this. This study addressed this gap by applying a computational model of value-based decision-making to tobacco and tobacco-unrelated choices following mood manipulation. Method: Using a pre-registered, within-subject design, 49 daily tobacco smokers (›10 daily cigarettes) watched two different videos which primed them to experience negative and positive mood (tobacco valuation and devaluation, respectively). Participants completed self-report measures of mood and craving to smoke before and after priming, followed by a two-alternative forced-choice task with (separate) blocks of tobacco-related and unrelated (animal) images. On each block, participants selected the image that they previously rated higher. A drift-diffusion model was fitted to the reaction time and error data to estimate evidence accumulation (EA) processes and response thresholds during the different blocks. Results: After watching videos intended to induce negative mood, happiness scores were lower (p ‹ .001, d = 1.16), while sadness and craving to smoke scores were higher (both ps ‹ .001, ds › .60), compared to after watching videos intended to induce positive mood. However, contrary to hypotheses, the experimental manipulation did not robustly affect EA rates (F = 1.15, p = .29, ηp2 = .02) or response thresholds (F = .07, p = .79, ηp2 = .00) for either tobacco or tobacco-unrelated decisions. Conclusions: Manipulation of mood in daily smokers did not lead to alterations in the internal processes that precede value-based decisions made about tobacco and tobacco-unrelated cues.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots become increasingly integrated into everyday life, it is important to understand how direct interaction with such systems shapes public sentiment toward AI more broadly. Leveraging a unique window in April 2023—when many individuals still had little or no experience with such systems—we combined experimental manipulation (chatbot exposure vs. no exposure) with natural variation in real-world AI usage. In a preregistered proof-of-concept experiment (N = 220), we investigated whether a short conversation with a GPT-3.5-based chatbot influenced participants’ sentiments across multiple dimensions of AI perception. We assessed system-specific fear, user engagement, anthropomorphization, and potential spillover effects to other domains, including AI in medicine, recruitment and governance. Results show that direct interaction reduced fear and increased enjoyment of the chatbot itself, while fostering a more critical, realistic understanding of its abilities. However, spillover effects were limited: exposure led to reduced fear of AI in familiar, concrete domains (e.g., medical applications), but not in more abstract or speculative areas. Hope about AI’s societal potential remained unaffected. Our findings highlight that sentiments toward AI are multidimensional and context dependent. Exposure to AI chatbots can shift immediate attitudes but does not necessarily generalize to broader AI perceptions, underscoring the need for more targeted engagement strategies in shaping public understanding and trust.",

          "abstract": "Humans and other animals continuously make embodied decisions about ongoing or pending courses of action. Examples of embodied decisions include a hunting lioness’s decision of which gazelle to chase and a soccer player’s decision of which teammate to pass the ball to. The study of embodied decisions has recently gained tractions across several fields, including cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and sports science. Here, we summarize key insights from these studies and highlight that they imply a shift of perspective from viewing decision-making as a central cognitive process largely separated from perception and action dynamics to a more integrative perspective that recognizes its embodied and situated nature. We discuss how embodied decisions can be effectively conceptualized in terms of the parallel specification and selection between available (and future) affordances, i.e., as an “affordance competition” process. We discuss studies addressing various aspects of embodied decisions, which include the selection between courses of action, the involvement of motor processes in perceptual and cognitive tasks, motivational factors and the decision of how vigorously and urgently to act. Furthermore, we highlight current controversies in the field and open directions for future work – and their implications for the advancement of our understanding of the mind and the behavior of athletes.",

          "authors": "Alessandro Sparacio; Jonathan Nicholas Davies; Erin Lee; Jeroen Schmitt",
          "abstract": "Background: Fully decentralized self-administered mindfulness (SAM) interventions show promise for stress reduction, but rigorous evaluations of their feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness using both self-report and physiological measures remain limited. In Singapore, where mental health concerns rank as the top healthcare priority (46%), ahead of cancer (38%) and stress-related issues (35%), accessible and scalable interventions are urgently needed to address the significant economic burden of mental health conditions.\nObjective: This pre-registered pilot study (NCT06765889) evaluated a decentralized, three-day self-administered mindfulness intervention versus sham control in Singaporean adults, examining effects on self-reported and physiologically measured stress responses. The inclusion of a sham control condition allows for disentangling mindfulness-specific effects from demand characteristics and expectation effects, addressing a critical methodological gap in digital mindfulness research.\nMethods: Sixty participants were randomized to either a mindfulness intervention or structurally matched sham control. Stress was assessed via self-report (STAI-6) and physiologically through Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The study incorporated three methodological innovations: (1) A structurally equivalent sham control to match expectancy and credibility, (2) remote collection of HRV as an objective physiological biomarker, and (3) full decentralization via smartphone allowing unsupervised multi-platform delivery. Feasibility was evaluated through recruitment/retention rates, cross-platform delivery, protocol adherence, and data quality. Acceptability was assessed through quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback.\nResults: The study demonstrated excellent feasibility with near perfect retention (98.3%) and moderate HRV data quality (69.8% valid signals). Acceptability ratings were strong (M = 4.17/5, SD = 0.53), with highest scores for comfort/engagement (M = 4.27/5, SD = 0.57), exceeding established usability benchmarks for digital health interventions. Qualitative feedback identified technical challenges (HRV instability, device overheating) and scheduling difficulties. While Bayesian analyses revealed no significant group differences in stress reduction (BF₁₀ = 0.03) or HRV improvement (BF₁₀ = 0.2), both groups showed significant stress reductions (BF₁ ₀= 3.01×10⁶), suggesting that observed benefits may stem from non-specific factors common to both interventions.\nConclusions: This study demonstrates (1) the feasibility of conducting fully decentralized mindfulness trials with multimodal assessment, (2) the value of mixed-methods acceptability evaluation, and (3) identifies key technical and control condition refinements necessary for future trials. By addressing methodological limitations in digital mindfulness research through improved control conditions and objective physiological measures, this work provides a foundation for more rigorous investigation of mindfulness-specific versus non-specific effects in remotely delivered stress reduction interventions.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes an Affective Learning Processes (ALPs) model for cultural competence. The model posits that in managing intercultural relations, individuals are driven by the needs for growth and development as well as the needs for security and safety. Whereas the promotion focus needs for growth and development can be met by building intercultural relationships, the prevention focus needs for security and safety can be met by preventing relationship damage. The promotion-prevention motivational systems are associated with unique affective reactions in response to anticipated outcomes. Such affect-driven outcome expectancies shape the learning processes. The ALPs model presents a comprehensive cultural competence framework and identifies specific cultural competence strategies that have been overlooked in the existing literature. Finally, the contributions of the ALPs model to theoretical advancement are evaluated.",

          "abstract": "We investigate whether and why people might adjust compensation for workers who use AI tools. Across 11 studies (N = 3,846), participants consistently lowered compensation for AI-assisted workers compared to those who were unassisted. This “AI Penalization” effect was robust across (1) different types of work (e.g., specific tasks or general work scenarios) and worker statuses (e.g., full-time, part-time, or freelance), (2) different forms of compensation (e.g., required payments or optional bonuses) and their timing, (3) various methods of eliciting compensation (e.g., slider scale, multiple choice, and numeric entry), and (4) conditions where workers’ output quality was held constant, subject to varying inferences, or statistically controlled. Moreover, the effect emerged not only in hypothetical compensation scenarios (Studies 1–9) but also with real gig workers and real monetary compensation (Studies 10 and 11). People reduced compensation for workers using AI because they believed these workers deserved less credit than those who did not use AI (Studies 7 and 8). This mediated effect attenuated when it was less permissible to reduce worker compensation, such as when employment contracts provide stricter constraints (Study 8). Our findings suggest that adoption of AI tools in the workplace may exacerbate inequality among workers, as those protected by structured contracts are less vulnerable to compensation reductions, while those without such protections are at greater risk of financial penalties for using AI.",

          "abstract": "We examine the effect of childbirth on parents’ environmental and climate concerns, focusing on potentially dynamic changes in concerns within a timespan of two years before and up to 10 years after birth. Additionally, we explore effect heterogeneities by gender and educational attainment. By using long-running survey data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study (GSOEP, 1984 – 2020, N=108,340) and estimating linear probability models with fixed-effects, we contribute substantially to previous research that has been limited by cross-sectional approaches with mixed or even contradictory results. Contrary to the popular notion that childbirth leads to higher levels of environmentalism based on legacy motives, our results suggest marginal and mostly negative effects of childbirth on environmental and climate concerns. Overall, the effects of childbirth on planetary concerns tended to be less pronounced in the first years after birth. Over time, however, these effects increased and even reversed. We found no exclusive patterns for men and women and nuances of relevance by educational attainment and item design, highlighting the complex nature of the nexus between family formation, gender, and environmentalism. Parents’ slightly reduced focus on environmental and climate challenges may reflect denial mechanisms during highly stressful times, as they prioritize immediate and novel challenges associated with parenthood, often leading to an increase in less environmentally favorable behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Political disinformation has become a central concern in both public discourse and scholarly inquiry, particularly following the electoral successes of right-wing populist movements in Western democracies since 2016. These events have been widely interpreted through the lens of manipulation, deviance, and disruption; all closely linked to the spread of false information, automated amplification, and foreign interference in digital communication environments. More recently, advances in Artificial Intelligence have added to anxieties about the growing sophistication and scale of disinformation campaigns. Collectively, these concerns are often framed under the concept of digital disinformation and viewed as posing existential threats to democratic systems. This entry provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the disinformation debate. It traces the definitional and conceptual challenges inherent in the term “disinformation,” highlights how digital infrastructures shape both the problem and its perceived urgency, and synthesizes empirical evidence on the actual reach, distribution, and impact of political disinformation. The article distinguishes between individual, collective, and discursive harms, while cautioning against inflated threat narratives that outpace empirical findings. Importantly, the entry addresses the risks of regulatory overreach and centralized control. Efforts to counter disinformation may themselves undermine democratic openness, suppress dissent, and weaken societies’ capacity for collective information processing. In response, the article outlines a research agenda that prioritizes conceptual clarity, empirical rigor, and systemic analysis over alarmism. It advocates for a shift away from overstreching framings of disinformation toward more precise and differentiated understandings of digital political communication and its challenges.",

I apply a computationally robust approach by using an LLM to categorize user comments into two dummy variables: misogynistic/non-misogynistic and aggressive/non-aggressive, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the responses.

          "authors": "Shigenori Tanaka",
          "abstract": "Traditional grammar instruction fails to develop functional communicative competence, presenting isolated rules without coherent architectural understanding. This paper proposes Expression-Oriented Grammar as an alternative framework addressing fundamental pedagogical problems in English language education. The approach reconceptualizes grammar as an integrated system for expressing one's world through three interconnected domains: nominal grammar for describing things, verbal grammar for events and states, and adverbial grammar for situational contexts. Information arrangement and construction provide integrative mechanisms enabling effective resource utilization. Unlike fragmented school grammar, this framework offers coherent architectural perspective allowing learners to understand their position within the grammatical system. Case studies of BE/HAVE verbs and preposition \"ON\" demonstrate superior explanatory validity through unified semantic approaches based on cognitive linguistic principles. Expression-Oriented Grammar transforms grammar from obstacle to dynamic tool for creative expression, developing grammatical competence that enables meaningful communication rather than mere rule memorization.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on 20,000 monthly quotations, this study revises imperial Brazil's inflation and living standards estimates. The new price index eliminates the nineteenth-century ‘low-growth puzzle’: Brazil’s GDP per capita rose in line with the Latin-American average. Earlier series, which relied on baskets disproportionately weighted toward agricultural goods or whose composition varied over time, display continuous growth and overstate inflation by 57–270%. The revised index reveals a sharp rise in the 1850s and stability thereafter. New evidence on exchange and freight rates, terms of trade, regional commerce, and real wages shows that regional specialization in food production helped stabilize prices after the mid-century.",

This study uses the UC Berkeley Social Networks Study as a test case, comparing GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.1 variant Sonnar Large, and Mistral Large against human annotators, we find the two proprietary models outperform open-source alternatives, achieving 97% accuracy on straightforward questions and 88-91% on complex interpretive tasks. However, open-source models still perform relatively well, achieving 95-96% accuracy on relatively straightforward questions up to 87% on more complex ones. Performance analysis revealed response brevity, but not category brevity, as a strong determinant of successful classification with responses under 50 characters demonstrating 7-11% higher classification accuracy. While models effectively detected nuance in simpler tasks, they struggled with responses containing multiple reasons, narratives, and implicit meanings.\n\nThe findings imply that social science researchers who want to use LLMs should design questions to elicit concise responses (10-50 characters), implement human-in-the-loop review for complex tasks, and carefully select appropriate models based on task complexity. Minimal demographic variation in classification accuracy was observed, with Claude uniquely maintaining consistent performance across population segments. Methodologically concerning, some models sometimes produced different social narratives from open-ended classification despite high accuracy metrics.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI has not broken higher education; it has revealed the fractures that were already there. This paper argues that traditional pedagogies (i.e., those anchored in formalist epistemologies) are structurally misaligned with the demands of a world saturated by thinking machines. Blending systems analysis with epistemological critique, the paper introduces three critical frameworks: epistemic laundering, the epistemological vector space, and the cognitive ecology (a multimodal model of reasoning that maps how symbolic, conceptual, and contextual cognition interact in real-world learning). Together, these frameworks expose the incoherence of legacy educational models and offer a new basis for instructional design. From this foundation, the paper proposes Critical AI Literacy as a pedagogical response that pairs epistemic awareness with technical fluency. It also outlines practical strategies to integrate GenAI responsibly into learning environments: RAG tutors, cognitive partnerships, interactive content generation, and adaptive skill-gap training. Ultimately, GenAI is framed not as a threat, but as a mirror: reflecting the need to move beyond performance metrics toward adaptive, agentive, and epistemically aligned education.\n\nContact the author via LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/tj-kalaitzidis/",

Intergroup Contact Theory suggests that talking across party lines can reduce polarization, yet recent studies disagree on whether confronting or avoiding political disagreement is the more effective strategy for cross-partisan conversation. We address this debate using a large-scale “integrative” experiment that systematically varies levels of disagreement and political relevance across a diverse set of topics. While some discussion topics reduced affective polarization more than others, these differences were not explained by how “political” the topics were or how much participants disagreed. In fact, variation within topics far exceeds variation between them. Participant reports suggest that how individuals engage with one another—through listening, openness, and perspective-taking—may play a larger role in shaping conversational success than either the topic itself or the extent of disagreement.",

          "abstract": "While being disabled is often considered a deficit that creates only problems, in reality every human has interests, values, skills, knowledge and external supports that can act as strengths when participating in recreation. Indeed, many disabled birders anecdotally report experiencing positives of birding with a disability, and the inherent modifiability of birding may allow disabled birders to experience different ways of engaging with this activity. We conducted a survey of disabled birders (n=147), then used inductive coding to analyze the responses to an open-ended question (n=106) about the positives of birding they experience. These responses included themes of slowing down, identifying more birds, noticing more details of birds, and feeling a sense of belonging in nature. This reconsidering of disability using a strengths-based approach creates opportunities for disabled birders and bird-related programming to focus on aspects of birding that may be more in line with disabled birders’ interests, experiences and strengths. It also creates a new avenue for nature organizations to engage with up to a quarter of the population who may feel excluded due to disability. This study contributes to the literature by exploring a rarely studied topic of disabled birders’ experiences using a strengths-based approach to studying disability in outdoor recreation.",

Research strategy could benefit from a more granular and detailed understanding of the different contributions that research and development can make to the address of societal problems; of when each type of contribution is needed; and of how to identify research projects with the potential to achieve each contribution.  I outline three different scientific activities—problem description and attribution, option assessment and evaluation, and option identification and development—and the different contributions they can make to societal problems exhibiting value consensus and value dissensus.  I also provide two “catechisms” intended to help identify when each contribution is needed and what kinds of research are most likely to achieve each.

This study presents a novel bibliometric assessment of archaeology’s status relative to other fields using a hard/soft framework. It also presents a systematic review of computational reproducibility in published archaeological research. Reproducibility is a factor in the hardness/softness of a field because of its importance in establishing consensus. Analyzing nearly 10,000 articles, I identify trends in authorship, citation practices, and related metrics that position archaeology between the natural and social sciences. A survey of reproducibility reviews for the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals persistent challenges, including missing data, unspecified dependencies, and inadequate documentation. To address these issues, I recommend to authors basic practical steps such as standardized project organization and explicit dependency documentation. Strengthening reproducibility will enhance archaeology’s scientific rigor and ensure the verifiability of research findings. This study underscores the urgent need for cultural and technical shifts to establish reproducibility as a cornerstone of rigorous, accountable, and impactful archaeological science.",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "authors": "Peter Steiglechner; Paul E. Smaldino; Agostino Merico",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread perception that society has been polarizing into groups with increasingly divergent opinions. Multiple studies have sought to quantify the degree of opinion divergence (or ideological polarization), typically relying on variation among self-reported opinions, and have reached mixed conclusions. Each individual, however, perceives the landscape of public opinion through a subjective lens or viewpoint that is dynamically shaped by their social environment. To account for this subjectivity in perceived polarization, we propose a model of dynamic perception that takes social identity into account. When members of an in-group become increasingly homogeneous on a given topic (that is, when the variance of opinions in that group decreases), they perceive deviant opinions as increasingly distant from their own. Consequently, these individuals may perceive much more polarization than what an objective, neutral observer would perceive. We apply our model to empirical data on the opinions of German citizens about climate change and show that the effect of dynamic opinion perception on polarization can be nearly as substantial as actual opinion divergence. Moreover, we show that the direction of the effect need not be consistent over time, nor across different partisan groups. Our framework helps explain why people might sometimes experience levels of ideological polarization higher than those indicated by opinion surveys, independent of structural divisions, polarization-enforcing biases, or affect-driven attitudes towards out-groups.",

          "abstract": "There is some evidence that income volatility (fluctuations in income over time) negatively affects mental and physical health, independently of the level of income. Evidence to date has examined fluctuations from year to year or from day to day, whereas a more relevant timescale might be month to month. Here, we use data from the Changing Cost of Living Study, a longitudinal panel from the UK and France with monthly data (n = 484). We examine the association between month-to-month income volatility and two outcomes, self-rated general health and anxiety-depression (a composite measure derived from GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores). Higher volatility was associated with worse health on both measures, with volatility accounting for similar amounts of variation as the level of income. Some association between income volatility and health is to be expected as a consequence of the concavity of the income-health relationship: because of concavity, a downward fluctuation damages health more than the equivalent upward fluctuation improves it. We show that the observed associations are 3 and 4 times too strong to be explained by this mechanism alone. We suggest that volatility, because it introduces uncertainty and stress, has substantial direct health effects. This claim is important for public policy: it means that policies and institutions that smooth people’s income streams can have beneficial health effects even if they don’t raise anyone’s income.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates climate-induced internal migration in India, focusing on district-level migration patterns and their relationship with climatic stressors using historical census data and statistical modeling. Internal migration, which refers to the domestic movement of people, is often driven by intersecting economic, social, and environmental factors. Climate change is increasing but unevenly playing a role in decisions to migrate. The study emphasizes India’s status as a climate-migration hotspot, characterized by diverse geographic and population heterogeneity, and highlights the limitations of existing migration data, particularly the delayed 2021 Census. To address these gaps, the paper employs a novel statistical approach to estimate district out-migration, district-to-district migration, and district in-migration around 2021 by leveraging data from the 2001 and 2011 censuses alongside temperature and precipitation extremes derived from historical climate records from 1961-2021. The methodology integrates harmonized district boundaries and fixed-effects modeling to account for confounding factors while projecting migration trends under varying climatic conditions. Results reveal significant associations between climatic extremes, both positive and negative and migration flows, underscoring the role of climate stressors in shaping migration decisions. By generating predictive estimates for 2021 migration patterns, the study offers insights into how climate variability potentially influences internal migration dynamics in India. The findings contribute to broader discussions on how to incentivize climate change adaptation given the reality of highly mobile populations in India and provides pointers on reducing vulnerabilities in migrant-sending and migrant-receiving areas.",

          "abstract": "This paper reconceptualizes the domestication of Oryza sativa through the lens of recursive enclosure and network-critical evolution, where feedback loops between fire management, human cognition, and plant adaptation crossed critical thresholds to establish novel evolutionary dynamics. Challenging hydraulic-state orthodoxy, I argue that domestication emerged not through discrete human control but via phase transitions within fire-maintained ecotones operating on 3-7 year cycles. Through archaeobotanical and genomic evidence, I demonstrate that upland swidden systems created recursive attractors - ecological and cognitive feedback loops in which rice and humans co-adapted through repeated burning (t), systematic return (t+1), and selective harvesting (t+2). Fire functioned simultaneously as ecological reset mechanism and prosthetic memory system, compressing successional cycles while entraining selection pressures across multiple plant generations. These early disturbance regimes structured not only rice biology but the cognitive infrastructure enabling subsequent agricultural intensification. I propose that domestication represents a distributed phase shift in socio-ecological networks - a recursive enclosure operating at the ashline where repetitive human-fire interactions established the conditions for coevolutionary change without requiring conscious breeding programs.",

          "abstract": "Shadow education - the private, supplementary tutoring that parallels formal schooling - has expanded globally alongside the massification of education. While often interpreted as a market response to institutional failure or cultural obsession with credentials, this monograph advances a structural reinterpretation: shadow education is a governance formation, not a sectoral aberration. We introduce the concept of overflow governance to describe how states promise universal education but outsource the labor of distinction to para-institutional systems when formal differentiation lags behind mass participation. Drawing on theories of state capacity, comparative education, and ritual sociology, we argue that shadow education systems function as infrastructures of sorting, moral legitimation, and epistemic reproduction. They stabilize institutional contradictions by individualizing failure and ritualizing inequality. Through a typology of national regimes, illustrative case studies, and an exploration of symbolic governance, this work repositions shadow education as central to understanding how modern states maintain legitimacy under conditions of scarcity and saturation.",

          "abstract": "Standardized testing is typically studied as a meritocratic sorting mechanism that selects for academic aptitude. This paper reframes such exams--especially East Asian high-stakes systems like the Gaokao, HKDSE, and Suneung--as socio-technical infrastructures designed not merely to select, but to exclude. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Charles Tilly's theory of durable inequality, I argue that exams are material devices of epistemic engineering that actively shape what counts as legitimate intelligence. These systems privilege a narrow form of cognitive legibility while systematically eliminating alternative epistemic styles. What is conventionally understood as academic \"failure\" is not a byproduct of inefficiency but a predictable outcome of design. This paper outlines the infrastructure of exclusion, the cognitive architectures it suppresses, and the sociotechnical normalization of failure across space and time. In doing so, it challenges the neutrality of assessment technologies and calls for an epistemic politics that recognizes the knowledge lost when we measure minds through machines built to fail them. By analyzing examination systems across different Asian contexts, this research contributes to the growing literature on comparative educational infrastructures and offers implications for educational policy, pedagogical practice, and theories of cognitive justice.",

          "abstract": "This paper advances a novel theoretical framework positioning mass schooling as a morphological infrastructure—an environmental system that actively shapes the biological, neurological, and somatic development of children in accordance with state rationality and institutional logics. Integrating developmental biology, educational sociology, and epigenetic theory, I conceptualize schooling as a recursive enclosure: a designed environment that conditions physical growth, behavior, and neurodevelopment through systematic exposure to time-discipline, sedentism, abstraction, and regulatory compliance. Drawing on empirical findings across multiple disciplines, I demonstrate how institutional forms become biological inputs in complex developmental systems. This framework recontextualizes educational expansion beyond cognitive socialization into a biopolitical apparatus for formatting human organisms to achieve compatibility with modern institutional orders. The theoretical advances offered here move beyond existing models of educational embodiment by identifying specific biological pathways through which institutional design shapes developmental trajectories, with significant implications for educational policy, public health interventions, and the ethical design of learning environments in an era of accelerating technological mediation.",

Our research concentrated\non five specific areas: 1) archaeological excavations of an large Umm an-Nar\nperiod building at Rakhat al-Madrh (رخـــــــة المـــــــدره); test excavations of Umm an-Nar\nperiod architecture at al-Khutm Settlement; 3) a program of structured interviews\nwith the Bat community; 4) geomorphological and geophysical survey of the\nWadi al-Hijr between Rakhat al-Madrh and Sint; 5) site monitoring and\nphotogrammetry of the historic Husn al-Wardi, and 6) continued programmes in\ncommunity-based heritage outreach to further engage the local community.\nAt Rakhat al-Madrh, excavations explored the Umm an-Nar period\nstructures along the edge of the site’s central depression. Building on the results\nof BAP’s previous two years of work at the site, this season focused on the\nespecially large RaM 3 building. This structure was found to have multiple\nphases of activity and unusual features that suggest a social function that differs\nfrom other excavated buildings at the site—possibly as a public building.\nExcavations at RaM continued to discover botanically-rich contexts. A third\nseason of geomorphological and hydrological investigations continued to\nsupport the interpretation that Rakhat al-Madrh’s environmental and\narchaeological conditions are unlike the rest of Bat and unique for Bronze Age\nSoutheastern Arabia. Possible human manipulation of flooding events in the\nbasin could have enabled the cultivation of flood crops and provided abundant\nvegetation for animal pasturing. Botanical analysis suggests wheat, barley, goat\ngrass, cyperaceae, and palm were all grown at the site in the third millennium\nBC.\nTest excavations at al-Khutm Settlement continued to clarify the\narchitectural and occupational history of the site. While limited in finds, an Umm\nan-Nar complex of house, platform monument, and tomb at the eastern end of\nthe Khutm hillside provide new insights into both ritual and domestic behaviors\nin the third millennium BCE. At the Husn al-Wardi, we began extensively\ndocumenting the mudbrick architecture of the Husn al Wardi through\nphotography and 3D photogrammetry, as part of an annual, longitudinal study\nto identify structural integrity risks and recommend actions for conservation.\nThe project also expanded its community engagement and outreach\nprogram by beginning a longitudinal study with Bat residents using structured\ninterviews to document perceptions and expectations of ongoing archaeological\nresearch and redesign research and outreach practices to integrate community\nvoices in the years ahead. We also continued our partnership with the Bat office\nof the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism as well as local partners in the BAP\nSchool Day Event. We welcomed local schoolgirls to celebrate Bat’s ancient\nheritage, learn about new archaeological discoveries, and try digging with the\narchaeologists.\nWe deeply appreciate the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism’s ongoing\ncollaboration and support of this research.",

Our research concentrated on five key areas: 1) archaeological\nexcavation at the southeastern end of the Settlement Slope in Umm an-Nar mortuary and domestic\ncontexts; 2) excavation of Umm an-Nar period houses at Rakhat al-Madrh; 3) systematic survey to\nbetter understand temporal relationships and artifact density between Bat’s different areas; 4)\ngeomorphological analyses at Rakhat al-Madrh; and 5) an expanded arts outreach and experimental\narchaeology program to further engage the local community.\nAt the Settlement Slope, mortuary excavations revealed a small but deep Umm an-Nar tomb, unusually\nlocated on a hillside with a commanding view of Bat’s ancient landscape. A shallow, rectangular\nplatform built into the hillside was discovered adjacent to the tomb and was covered in small bone\nfragments. The structure may have served as a body processing area utilized before interment. The\ncontinued excavations of Structure SS12 on the Settlement Slope revealed the area’s Umm an-Nar\nMiddle II and Late Umm an-Nar period occupation and behaviors.\nDomestic excavations continued at Rakhat al Madrh, where two Umm an-Nar period houses were\nexcavated and a geomorphological study of the area was conducted. The house excavations revealed\novens, hearths, and botanically-rich contexts within typical Middle Umm an-Nar domestic spaces.\nGeomorphological and hydrological investigations suggest the area’s environmental conditions are\nunlike any other region occupied in Umm an-Nar Bat. Greater water access from flooding events and\nthe recharge of the basin’s water table could have enabled the cultivation of flood crops and provided\nabundant vegetation for animal pasturing.\nA multi-year survey project to better understand the areas between Bat’s monuments was completed\nthis winter and resulted in the discovery of a likely Iron Age fortress at Khutm, lithic scatters\nsurrounding Rakhat al Madrh, and a dense area of Umm an Nar artifacts north and east of Operation\nA. An environmental resilience study continued BAP’s investigations of the intersection of the site's\nancient and modern landscapes. The analysis of artifacts and samples collected from excavations and\nsurvey operations are ongoing.\nThe project also launched an expanded outreach program, implementing arts engagement strategies\nto connect with local residents.

The MHC immediately took these findings under advisement and\ntheir plans have proceeded.\nIntensive archaeological survey was conducted on the Settlement Slope, around the Bronze Age\ntower “al-Qa’a” and at Rakhat al-Madrh before beginning excavations. Together, the survey\nresulted in the documentation of almost 200 previously unrecorded sites. Excavations at the\nSettlement Slope uncovered an Umm an-Nar period house rich in ceramic artifacts that date the\nstructure’s occupation to the ca. 2200 BCE. Several samples of carbon were collected and will be\ntested to date the house.\nAnother structure was excavated at Rakhat al-Madrh, located approximately 8 km southeast of\nBat. There are at least four houses all placed around an ancient water catchment area. One\nstructure at the site was excavated, revealing an Umm an-Nar period house built with mudbrick\nwalls atop a stone foundation. Ceramics and shell beads were found within the house which is\ncomprised of long, narrow rooms and a central courtyard. The house excavations at both the\nSettlement Slope and Rakhat al-Madrh are helping us understand the diversity of places and\necologies in which people lived in Bronze Age Oman.\nSeveral artifact and landscape analyses were also conducted at Bat this year. We are developing a\nnew ceramic chronology for the Umm an-Nar period. A study of the lithics excavated and\ncollected at Bat since 2007 was also conducted by Dr. Petranka Nedelcheva, a stone tool\nspecialist, to better understand the development of lithic technology in northern Oman. This\nwinter’s rains also allowed for a survey of plants growing around Bat’s archaeology to help us\nbetter envision what the site might have looked like 5,000 years ago.

          "abstract": "The 2018-19 season was concerned with identifying the intensity and kinds of land\nuse in the Bat site. The study area consisted of a 0.23 km2 space between the five main\ntowers of Bat: Al-Rojoom, 1156, Al-Khafaji, Al-Ahliya, and Matariya. Thirty-nine\ntransects were walked at 5 m intervals. All diagnostic finds were mapped and\ncollected and a count of non-diagnostic finds kept for each transect. A total of 218\n(180 previously undocumented) features were documented within the thirty-nine\ntransects. The majority of identifiable feature types were walls, and the majority of artifacts\nrepresented belonged to the Bronze Age.\nThere is a clear variation in the distributions of ceramics across the site. Many of the transects\nindicate extensive use during the Umm an-Nar period. However, the transects around\nMatariya indicate use primarily during the early Umm an-Nar period and earlier; transects\nbetween Rojoom and Khafaji indicate use during the Iron Age and later; and transects\nbetween al-Ahliya and the Settlement Slope suggest use in the Pre-Modern period.\nPetrographic analysis of ceramics from the Bat to ‘Amlah areas show distinct changes both in\ntime and in space. The ceramics from Bat South are the same as those from Bat, suggesting\nthat the people lived and/or worked closely together.\nThe survey identified three areas for targeted excavation. These trenches focused on: (1)\nHafit period mudbrick architecture east of Matariya tower; (2) intact Umm an-Nar deposits\nacross from the Settlement Slope; and (3) varying ancient topography in the center of the site.\nFuture fieldwork will focus on understanding the relationship between settlement,\nsubsistence, and sociopolitical organization in prehistoric Bat and its environs.\nResults of this research include: (1) presentation at the Seminar for Arabian Studies (July\n2019) and (2) three separate presentations at the American Schools of Oriental Research\nconference (November 2019); (3) publication in the Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian\nStudies (vol. 49); and (4) work on an article for Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy (TBD).",

This study presents a novel bibliometric assessment of archaeology’s status relative to other fields using a hard/soft framework. It also presents a systematic review of computational reproducibility in published archaeological research. Reproducibility is a factor in the hardness/softness of a field because of its importance in establishing consensus. Analyzing nearly 10,000 articles, I identify trends in authorship, citation practices, and related metrics that position archaeology between the natural and social sciences. A survey of reproducibility reviews for the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals persistent challenges, including missing data, unspecified dependencies, and inadequate documentation. To address these issues, I recommend to authors basic practical steps such as standardized project organization and explicit dependency documentation. Strengthening reproducibility will enhance archaeology’s scientific rigor and ensure the verifiability of research findings. This study underscores the urgent need for cultural and technical shifts to establish reproducibility as a cornerstone of rigorous, accountable, and impactful archaeological science.",

We examine the relationship between such violence and settlement characteristics in the context of the 1905 Russian Revolution, which triggered numerous anti-Jewish pogroms. Counter to an extensive literature that emphasizes the contribution to conflict of ethno-religious polarization, we show that the sharp increase in pogroms after October 1905, when publication of the October Manifesto and accompanying anti-Semitic propaganda increased feelings of political threat among many non-Jews, was smaller in settlements with relatively large Jewish populations. We demonstrate that this empirical pattern can be rationalized with an elaborated version of the Esteban-Ray (2008) model of diversity and conflict when, as with the October Manifesto, political reform systematically alters the distribution of benefits across groups.",

She ignores Smith's subsequent reference to Hume in the Lectures as the one who \"endeavoured to refute\" the mercantilist arguments of Mun, Gee, and Mandeville.  I explain that it was the several self-contradictions and inconsistencies in Hume's 'Of Money\" and \"Of the Balance of Trade\" that prompted Smith's criticisms of him, not because Smith  believed Hume to have been a mercantilist.

          "abstract": "Defining and measuring rurality is a persistent challenge for researchers and policymakers. Threshold-based classifications often create artificial distinctions, failing to capture the continuous nature of the rural-urban spectrum. The Index of Relative Rurality (IRR) developed by Waldorff (2006) offers a continuous, multi-dimensional measure to address this shortcoming. This paper provides a contemporary validation of the IRR, testing a 2020 version of the index against the 2023 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), the 2024 Urban Influence Codes (UIC), and 2020 Decennial Census data on county-level rural population. Using ordered logistic regression, the IRR was found to be a highly statistically significant predictor of both RUCC and UIC classifications, explaining approximately 21% and 15% of their respective variances. Linear regression analysis revealed that the percentage of a county's rural population accounts for a substantial 57.4% of the variance in the multi-dimensional IRR score. These findings confirm that nearly two decades after its inception, the IRR remains a robust and relevant tool. It aligns closely with official governmental classifications while offering a more granular, multi-faceted perspective on rurality, underscoring its continued value for research and policy analysis.",

(b) Are there variations in total intergenerational social class mobility between countries and regions?\n We analyzed 50.000 vital registers for 3 countries on total, upward, downward and sectorial mobility. In the country for which we presently arguably have the best data, France, the rate of intergenerational mobility increased, albeit irregularly from the 1720s until 1850 (actually until the end of the twentieth century, as we showed in another stud). For the German and Swedish places, no clear picture can yet be observed: total mobility trajectories vary among places and over time, as do upward and downward mobility. Sweden stands out by a relatively high rate of downward mobility, mostly consisting of farmers’ sons becoming farm laborers. More than expected, however, sons with fathers from outside the farming class succeeded in becoming a farmer. Barriers between the sectors seem to have been weak in Sweden.\nWe can draw two broad conclusions. The first is that pre-modern social class structures were not as stable as either modernization or status maintenance theories claim. The second is that in the case of France, for which we have excellent long-term records, even the major shock of the French Revolution and its aftermath did not cause an observable Sorokin effect for men.",

Though prior research links national news reporting and administrative decisions, little is known about regional variation, an important omission because regional media produces more local news. I argue that street-level bureaucrats are embedded within a regional news environment, where reporting shapes their perception of regional immigration patterns and influences their decisions on public service allocation—a dynamic I term the regional media bias mechanism. To examine this phenomenon, I combine state-level data on benefit reduction rates in Germany’s welfare program Citizen’s Benefit with regional newspaper articles (2010-2020). Leveraging topic modeling and panel data analysis, I show that regional narratives on positive aspects of immigration are associated with more favorable administrative outcomes for immigrants, whereas frames emphasizing financial burdens correspond with stricter treatment. These results highlight the critical role of regional media in shaping policy implementation.",

AI enables the optimization of urban services, such as transportation, security, and environmental management, but involves the massive collection of data and the automation of decisions that affect citizens. The problem investigated is the ethical dilemmas related to privacy, transparency, and algorithmic discrimination. Through a qualitative exploratory perspective, the aim is to discuss the role of artificial intelligence in the development of smart cities, exploring the limits and justifications for decision-making in ethical and explainable AI models. The results indicate that although such models\ncontribute to creating a more equitable and responsible urban environment, the justification for certain machine choices is still shrouded in algorithmic opacity. In the meantime, it is concluded that the adoption of explainable AI can be a tool for transparency and security in decisions in smart cities but does not exempt the need to adopt other criteria to justify certain choices.",

          "authors": "Qilin Guo",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Principle of Economic Entropy Increase to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of economic growth: through the expansion of scale and diversification of structure, economic systems overcome both quantitative and structural forms of scarcity. Building on the concept of economic entropy, the study develops a dual-dimensional model—scale entropy and structural entropy—to enable the quantitative assessment of entropy dynamics within economic systems. Economic entropy increase originates from the system’s intrinsic structural demands and determines the macro trajectory of institutional evolution. Accordingly, this paper is the first to propose and systematically demonstrate the core proposition that the market economy constitutes the fundamental trajectory of economic evolution. Market economies, with their superior self-organizing and adaptive capacities, embody high-entropy structures; in contrast, planned economies, constrained by “long-chain interventions” that crowd out market mechanisms, exhibit low-entropy structures and are ultimately to be superseded. This framework offers a new lens for understanding economic growth, institutional selection, and the evolution of complex systems, with significant implications for policy design and economic governance.",

          "authors": "Rafael L. Queiroz; Joberto S. B. Martins",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are widely utilized and offer significant benefits in various fields of knowledge, including healthcare. However, there is an important barrier to disseminating machine learning among healthcare professionals, which primarily stems from their unfamiliarity with programming and computing concepts. The development strategy known as 'low-code,' when applied to software development, encompasses frameworks and tools that, in short, make application development more accessible to professional communities. The low-code strategy simplifies the software development process. This strategy is particularly relevant for smart cities that seek to develop approaches that enhance the efficiency, humanity, and sustainability of cities, thereby contributing to the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article positions the low-code strategy, implemented through the PyCaret framework, as a key element of innovation and contribution to the development of health systems utilizing machine learning in smart cities. The paper presents the low-code strategy through a case study that evaluates the incidence and correlation of occupational activities with the occurrence of cancer in Brazil using an anomaly detection algorithm. The article's contributions include positioning the low-code strategy as an element of innovation in smart cities and presenting a case study that serves as a reference for developing applications with machine learning in the healthcare sector. The case study presented, in turn, presents a differentiated approach to detecting cancer using an anomaly detection algorithm and reiterates correlations between types of cancer and occupational activities.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on the broad historical trend of power decentralization, this paper proposes the Principle of Power Entropy Increase, introducing the concept of power entropy and its mathematical formulation to systematically illuminate the evolutionary shift of power structures from concentration to dispersion. Power entropy increase is framed as a natural response of social systems to the challenges of power scarcity, structural complexity, and governance pressure—serving as the underlying logic that drives the evolution of public governance toward democratic institutions. On this basis, the paper is the first to advance and rigorously substantiate the theoretical proposition that democracy is the inevitable trajectory of institutional evolution. It contends that democracy is not born of ideological design, but arises as a structurally optimal outcome driven by systemic dynamics—a Nash equilibrium in the context of generalized social games. This principle offers not only a new perspective on political modernization and institutional transition, but also a theoretical foundation and analytical tool for assessing and forecasting transformations in power structures.",

          "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) systems increasingly shape decision-making across crucial societal domains, the discourse around fairness in algorithmic systems (fairML) has intensified. Although fairML research is rapidly expanding, contributions from social science, particularly sociology, remain limited. This chapter aims to address this gap by examining fairness in ML through a sociological lens, focusing on the interplay between algorithmic decision-making and social inequality. We argue that fairML frameworks must explicitly distinguish technical fairness—focused on unbiased predictions—from normative justice, which addresses broader ethical and distributive considerations.\nWe identify and discuss five key challenges confronting fairML today: (1) clearly separating fairness and justice, (2) developing more sophisticated measures of vulnerability and protected attributes, (3) incorporating historical disadvantage and social origin into fairness evaluations, (4) assessing unintended social consequences of algorithmic interventions, and (5) empirically investigating stakeholder preferences toward AI systems. By highlighting these sociologically informed challenges, this chapter advocates for a more holistic, context-sensitive approach to algorithmic fairness. Ultimately, our analysis proposes a sociologically grounded research agenda aimed at critically assessing and enhancing the role of fairML in either perpetuating or alleviating social inequalities.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge with artificial intelligence (AI) is to design systems that people can safely trust. A central goal in this regard is to calibrate trust, i.e., to align people’s trust with the “actual trustworthiness” of AI systems. The present article argues that we should refrain from using the concept of actual trustworthiness. Leveraging philosophical pragmatism and phenomenological thought, it shows why the ideas of actual trustworthiness and calibrated trust are not only epistemologically but also ethically problematic. “Actual trustworthiness” recasts the question of whether an agent deserves trust – which has a normative dimension – into a question of factual correctness. It also draws humans in the same behavioural framework as machines, treating the relation between AI trustworthiness and human trust as something that is calculable – rather than subject to deliberation. Beyond leading us astray in our language use, this can serve to reduce the space for human autonomy.",

          "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e.,\ntransitivity, clustering), whereby network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to\nbe directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form\nsuch ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se or from other processes, such as homophily and\nmore opportunities for exposure. These are difficult to disentangle in many settings, but in\nsocial media not only can they be decomposed, but platforms frequently make decisions that\ndepend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we\nrandomize the existing network structure that a user faces when followed by a target account\nthat we control, and we examine whether they reciprocate this tie formation. Being randomly\nassigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie\nformation by 35%. Through the use of multiple control conditions in which the relevant tie is\nabsent (never existent or removed), we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that\nindicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure\nshould be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and we find larger effects when the\nsubject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial\nrole for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what\nmight be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these\ntendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and\ninformation diffusion in online networks.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric and moral benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate large language models (LLMs), aiming to measure their capabilities, surface implicit biases, and assess alignment with human values. However, interpreting LLM responses to these benchmarks is methodologically challenging, a nuance often overlooked in existing literature. We empirically demonstrate that LLM responses to a standard psychometric benchmark (generalized trust from the World Values Survey) correlate strongly with known survey results across language communities. Critically, we observe LLMs achieve this while explicitly referencing known survey results and the broader literature, even without direct prompting. We further show these correlations can be amplified or effectively eliminated by subtle changes in evaluation task design, revealing that replicating known results does not validate LLMs as naive subjects. Given LLMs' access to relevant literature, their ability to replicate known human behavior constitutes an invalid evaluation for assessing the suitability of large language models as naive subjects. Fascinating though it may be, this ability provides no evidence of generalizability to novel or out-of-sample behaviors. We discuss implications for alignment research and benchmarking practices.",

We found that, while much war-related academic debate focuses on questions of territory, questions of land are actively debated in Ukrainian media. Land is represented as a symbol of collective suffering and an archive of violence, but also a symbol of regenerative capacity and recovery. Land damage and recovery are related to various economic, environmental, social and health issues with implications for present and future generations. While environmental concerns risk being sidelined in the face of other urgent war-related issues, particularly their long-term implications, are emphasised as important. Beyond covering relatively obvious damages, media articles address underlying and complex issues of environmental degradation and recovery, which seems critical given the land-related challenges in Ukraine today.",

Our findings show that writing a grant proposal in English rather than in French is associated with slightly higher chances of securing funding, mostly reflecting the greater recognition of applicants who have published in prestigious anglophone journals. However, the worth of this linguistic capital varies significantly across disciplines.

This report details the foundational and evolving regulations governing electric vehicle (EV) charging in Spain. Key legislative instruments, such as Ley 24/2013, recognize energy recharging services, while Royal Decree-Law 21/2021 mandates charging infrastructure deployment in commercial buildings. Royal Decree 184/2022 regulates energy recharging services, emphasizing interoperability and data submission, further enhanced by Royal Decree- Law 4/2024, which underpins data transparency through the REVE map. The MOVES III program provides significant financial incentives, including a requirement for \"intelligent functionalities\" in business charging points . For V2G, Order ITU/1475/2024 establishes rigorous metrological accuracy standards for bidirectional energy transfer, requiring dual recorders . Technical standards like ISO 15118 are crucial for V2G communication and interoperability . Royal Decrees 1183/2020 and 647/2020 streamline administrative procedures and technical requirements for energy storage and grid connection, which are applicable to V2G systems. The Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) is actively working to integrate new market participants, such as independent aggregators, and has introduced \"Flexible Access Capacity\" to enhance grid flexibility . Despite substantial progress, challenges include regulatory uncertainty, grid integration complexities, high initial costs, and the need for clearer market adaptation and compensation mechanisms for V2G . Spain's proactive engagement in pilot projects and continuous regulatory refinement demonstrate a determined effort to position the nation as a leader in sustainable EV-grid integration.",

Victim-abusers dyads were successfully randomised at court in 85% of cases and the deterrence message was delivered to the intervention group in 83% of cases, half of which were in court and half of which were via telephone or post. All eligible victims were offered the alarm by a police domestic abuse liaison officer, but fewer than 10% accepted the alarm. No statistically significant difference was observed in rates of order breach or domestic abuse crimes across conditions. Randomisation and delivery of deterrence messaging by police in court combined with the offer of an AREDAA alarm to victims was determined to be feasible, but intervention fidelity was dependent on perpetrator attendance at court and victim support for domestic violence protection orders, both of which were low.",

          "abstract": "Despite being widely regarded as effective labor market policies, the impact of job search services on employment remains contested. Recent research challenges the assumption that the intensity of such programs is directly related with its effectiveness. We evaluate the effects of two treatments of an Italian active labour market program called Assegno per il Lavoro. Each intervention is made up of a voucher to fund job search assistance and a performance-based payment related to job search intermediation. Participants are assigned to a certain group with a certain treatment endowment that is increasing as a function of a scoring variable. Leveraging this design, we applied a regression discontinuity analysis to estimate effects on both employment duration and employment quality. First, being assigned to an intermediate-dose treatment slightly increased the probability of finding an open-ended employment, but this did not generate an increment in the average of days worked. Second, being assigned to a high-dose treatment only augmented the mean and the median of the distribution of days worked during the second semester and it did with a greater prevalence of short temporary contracts. Third, different treatment assignments barely changed the reception of job search assistance, so the impacts stem from job search intermediation. The main policy implication is a shift from a focus on intensity to a focus on other design features.",

          "authors": "Christian Moore-Anderson",
          "abstract": "The staple activity in experimental design is the production of a list of variables: what will be changed, measured, and kept the same. Yet, while the list proports to be specific, it actually conceals the causal relationships between the variables unless extended text is added. This hampers understanding and communication. Instead, students can create a causal diagram, which, in my experience, increases engagement and comprehension. In this article, I’ll demonstrate how to build and interpret these diagrams and how to implement them with students of any stage of secondary science education.",

          "authors": "Christian Moore-Anderson",
          "abstract": "The purpose of biology curricula is for students to understand phenomena scientifically. However, more than just content, science is a way of seeing and acting established by the discipline’s evolving community. This includes the types of explanations we produce and accept. Specifically, we explain phenomena causatively (i.e. via causes). Yet, the concept of explanation is often implicit in biology curricula. Through explaining many phenomena students may intuit what explanation entails but many don’t in my experience. In this article, I’ll explore why explanation is a concept worth teaching and show how it can become an explicit curricular component.",

          "authors": "Christian Moore-Anderson",
          "abstract": "Cognitive load theory is useful for thinking about how learning can be hindered. It informs teachers on what to avoid doing, but not on what to do to help students make meaning of specific concepts. The theory in isolation suggests that learning is a flow of information into the mind. Yet, the biology of cognition shows that meaning can’t be transmitted. Rather than “just telling” or “just discovering”, teachers can embrace a third way that recognises the key role of the teacher in explicitly provoking students to perceive and make meaning on their own.",
