          "authors": "CT",
          "abstract": "Fossil fuel reliant countries contribute disproportionately to climate change, yet little is\nknown about how nations’ fossil fuel reliance is associated with public support for climate\nchange mitigation. A cross-national study (N = 102,824) across 106 countries and six\ncontinents showed that citizens of nations with greater fossil fuel reliance were less likely to\nbelieve that climate change should be a priority for their government, more supportive of\ncontinued fossil fuel use, and less supportive of increased renewable energy use. Climate\ndenial and lower worry about climate change mediated the associations between nations'\nfossil fuel reliance and citizens' mitigation support, while economic concerns about\nmitigation did not mediate these relationships. These findings show that fossil fuel reliance is\nlinked to reduced climate policy support. This suggests that fossil fuel interests may shape\npublic opinion and underscores the need for a transition that acknowledges citizens’ concerns\nabout phasing out fossil fuels.",

          "title": "Processing Spatial Cue Conflict in Navigation: Distance Estimation",
          "authors": "Xiaoli Chen; Yingyan Chen; Timothy P. McNamara",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation is essential for survival, involving the integration of various cues. The current study applied the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model for multisensory perception to investigate navigation behavior in cue conflict situations for the first time. By contrasting visual landmarks and optic-flow-based path integration cues, we examined how landmark instability influenced underlying cognitive processes of spatial navigation. In the main experiment, 141 participants were assigned to three groups: in the large-conflict-absent group (LC-absent), participants only experienced a small degree of cue conflict; in the large-conflict-present group (LC-present), participants experienced a much larger degree of cue conflict; in the large-conflict-informed group (LC-informed), participants experienced a much larger degree of cue conflict and were made explicitly aware of the landmark instability. Behavioral results showed that increased landmark instability alone did not elicit any noticeable changes in navigation behavior. However, adding explicit awareness to increased landmark instability changed participants’ behavior by reducing their reliance on landmarks. Additionally, combining increased landmark instability with explicit awareness decreased spatial localization precision when only landmarks were used for navigation. The BCI model provided a good account of the data. The modeling results showed that increased landmark instability plus the explicit awareness reduced participants’ reliance on unstable landmarks via two independent mechanisms: first, sensory noise level was increased for unstable landmarks, which naturally resulted in a lower weight assigned to landmarks in the common-cause judgment; second, a lower weight was assigned to unstable landmarks in the different-cause judgment. Surprisingly, increased landmark instability did not decrease the prior belief of a common cause, even when explicit awareness of landmark instability was imposed. Finally, while the cue-weighting strategy in the same-cause judgment is determined by objective cue relative reliability in a bottom-up manner, the cue-weighting strategy in the different-cause judgment correlated with participants’ subjective evaluation of relative cue quality, demonstrating top-down influences from the meta-cognitive process. Further experiments and modeling work verified key findings in the main experiment. Together, the current study offers valuable insights into navigators' reactions to spatial cue conflicts and their strategies in resolving conflicting spatial cues, highlighting the utility of the BCI model in dissecting mechanisms underlying cue interaction during spatial navigation.",

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper defines the \"Structural Co-Creation Protocol\" as an implementation model of the Thought OS, where humans and AI engage in a structurally divided collaboration. Humans, guided by FQ (Faith Quotient) and SQ (Structural Quotient), are responsible for meaning design, while AI functions as a \"Structural Execution Assistant\" that faithfully executes the designated structure. This protocol clarifies the co-divided roles within the Thought OS’s core operational unit—FQ → Mindflight Cognition → SQ—and reconstructs Mindflight triggers into actionable AI templates. Furthermore, it reinterprets the CoT (Chain-of-Thought) anomaly through the Thought OS framework and proposes a structural evaluation model of co-creation success and failure. By enabling reproducibility and measurability in human-AI collaboration, this structural co-creation protocol offers a new paradigm for rethinking intelligence and achieving its social implementation.",

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a structural implementation model for cultivating and assessing Structural Quotient (SQ), a core component of the Thought Operating System (Thought OS). SQ refers to the intelligence that reorganizes, retains, and redeploys fragmented meanings generated by cognitive leaps. It functions as the “intelligence of organization” that sustains the ongoing operation of Thought OS. The paper defines SQ and its conditions of activation, then proposes a multi-layered design covering visualization, testing, training protocols, AI-assisted dialogue, and social applications in education, organizations, and AI architecture. It argues that SQ is not an innate talent, but a trainable capacity for structural editing. The concluding chapter envisions a society where structural thinking is democratized—an era of “structural democratization” enabled by the rise of SQ.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study developed and validated the Critical Right Scale (CRS) to measure emerging critical right attitudes and revised the Critical Social Justice Attitudes Scale (CSJAS-R), replicating its psychometric evaluation.\nMethod: A nationwide convenience sample of Finnish adults (n = 626) completed an online survey. Item screening used exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation and loading and residual correlation criteria. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance testing were conducted in lavaan using full information maximum likelihood.\nResults: The final CRS consisted of five items with high reliability (α = .89, ω = .90) and good model fit in both male and female subsamples, with pooled-sample residual misfit judged minor given subgroup results. The CSJAS-R comprised six items with strong reliability (α = .88, ω = .89) and excellent fit. Both scales met configural and metric invariance; partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing a small number of item intercepts. CRS scores were strongly associated with right-wing and conservative self-placement, concentrated among Finns Party and Christian Democrat voters, and weakly linked to perceived oppression. CSJAS-R scores were strongly associated with left-wing and liberal self-placement, concentrated among Left Alliance and Greens voters, and moderately associated with justification of political violence. CRS and CSJAS-R were strongly negatively correlated (r = −.62), indicating divergent validity.\nConclusions: Both CRS and CSJAS-R demonstrated strong psychometric properties and distinct ideological profiles, providing validated tools for studying political attitude structures at opposing ends of the ideological spectrum.",

          "abstract": "This commentary examines the editorial decisions surrounding the rejection of manuscripts by Liu et al. that sought to correct pervasive theoretical errors in the field of microwave absorption, particularly regarding the distinction between film and material concepts. Despite presenting a novel wave mechanics theory and identifying longstanding mistakes in widely cited impedance matching and absorption mechanisms, the authors' submissions were desk-rejected by the journal Carbon, both as a comment and as a review, primarily on grounds of format and perceived lack of importance. The case highlights systemic issues in scientific publishing, including editorial resistance to paradigm-challenging corrections, the limitations of desk review processes, and the broader implications for scientific self-correction and integrity. The eventual acceptance of the work by another peer-reviewed journal underscores the value of diverse publication pathways and raises questions about the responsibilities of journals in maintaining the accuracy of the scientific record.",

          "authors": "Catherine Schittenhelm; Benjamin Goecke; Oliver Wilhelm",
          "abstract": "Overclaiming (OC)—the tendency to claim knowledge one does not possess—is predominantly assessed through self-report Overclaiming Questionnaires (OCQs). However, exclusive reliance on OCQs raises concerns about mono-method bias, limiting our understanding of knowledge purporting as a broader psychological disposition. To reduce this bias, we investigated two additional indicators of knowledge purporting and examined their convergent validity with traditional OCQs. In our study (N = 301), one of the new measures scored responses on fictional questions (e.g., responding to entirely fabricated historical events) and the other captured discrepancies between self-rated knowledge and actual knowledge provided by participants. Using latent variable analyses, we found modest convergent relations between OC as measured by an OCQ and the other indicators of knowledge purporting. Apart from these substantial levels of method-specific variance, we found differential relations with covariates, thereby challenging the validity and utility of any specific task class, including the predominantly used OCQs. We recommend that knowledge purporting measures must not be equated with the broader concept of knowledge purporting. While this study suggests that the concept of knowledge purporting may have some generality, it also shows that the methods used to investigate it matter more than they should. Future studies should consider the relationship between multivariate measures of knowledge purporting and further discrepancies between self-reports of knowledge and actual performance.",

This work introduces , the minimum observable response time, as a universal lower bound on temporal resolution derived from thermodynamic and information-theoretic principles. We prove that, under the  constraint, continuous-time and discrete-time formulations become observationally equivalent: no conceivable experiment can distinguish between them. This equivalence arises because any measured time series is inherently quantized into multiples of , regardless of the underlying temporal structure. We formalize this result mathematically, extend it to a generalized uncertainty relation for time measurement, and demonstrate its consistency with known physical limits such as the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Philosophical implications are discussed, showing that  defines a hard epistemic boundary for empirical science regarding the ontology of time.",

          "abstract": "This study extends the τ₀ theory—a universal lower bound on system response time derived from thermodynamic and information-theoretic principles—into the biomedical domain by integrating it with the Three Fundamental Laws of Response. We demonstrate that any biological system constrained by finite energy supply, intrinsic information delay, and stability-preserving feedback will naturally converge to a rational, saturating input–output curve. In cancer dynamics, this framework explains how tumor progression often begins with the breakdown of information processing and stability constraints, eventually leading to the thermodynamic breach that fuels uncontrolled proliferation. We identify three key translational implications: (1) physical detection of proliferation speed limits via τ₀-bound analysis; (2) improved early-stage diagnostic accuracy by quantifying τ₀-induced delays in imaging modalities; and (3) discovery of upper bounds for drug delivery efficiency, offering a new optimization target for nanocarrier-based therapies. These results position τ₀ and the Three Fundamental Laws as a unifying bridge between physics and oncology, enabling testable predictions and novel intervention strategies.",

          "authors": "Raja Marjieh; Pol van Rijn; Ilia Sucholutsky; Harin Lee; Nori Jacoby; Thomas L. Griffiths",
          "abstract": "Humans organize semantic knowledge into complex networks that encode relations between concepts. The structure of those networks has broad implications for human cognitive processes, and for theories of semantic development. Evidence from large lexical networks such as those derived from word associations suggest that semantic networks are characterized by high sparsity and clustering while maintaining short average paths between concepts, a phenomenon known as a 'small-world' network. It has also been argued that those networks are 'scale-free', meaning that the number of connections (or degree) between concepts follows a power-law distribution whereby most concepts have few connections while a few have many. However, the scale-free property is still debated, and the extent to which the lexical evidence reflects the naturally occurring semantic regularities of the environment has not been investigated systematically. To address this, we collected and analyzed semantic descriptors, human evaluations, and similarity judgments from four large datasets of naturalistic stimuli across three modalities (visual, auditory, and audio-visual) comprising 7,916 stimuli and 610,841 human responses. By connecting concepts that co-occur as descriptors of the same stimuli, we construct 'grounded' semantic networks. We show that these networks exhibit a clear small-world structure with a degree distribution that is best captured by a truncated power law (i.e., the most-connected concepts are less common than predicted by a perfect power law). We further show that these networks are predictive of human sensory judgments on these domains, as well as reaction times in an independent lexical decision task. Finally, we show that grounded networks also share overlapping themes with previously analyzed lexical networks, which upon a more rigorous re-analysis are revealed to be truncated too. Our findings shed new light on the origins of the structure of semantic networks by grounding it in the semantic regularities of the environment.",

Here, we use an interpretable machine learning approach to examine how smartphone-captured patterns of everyday activity (1,232 behavioral features) relate to SWL in an international dataset (N = 2,272) combining four independently collected samples. The cross-validated results demonstrate that especially extremeness and variation in everyday activity patterns predict SWL (r_Md = .18, r_IQR = [.14, .21]) and that activity predictiveness varies especially with individuals’ personality. These findings enhance our understanding of real-life manifestations of SWL in everyday activity patterns, highlighting the potential of smartphone-based methods for well-being research and interventions.",

To better understand this discrepancy, we applied Ecological Systems Theory (EST) to map contextual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal barriers to allyship from the perspectives of potential allies in their workplaces. Open-ended responses from two representative samples of employed individuals (Sample 1, n = 778; Sample 2, n = 973) were analyzed. Results were consistent across samples, showing that 19% of barriers to allyship concerned features of the organizational context (e.g., lack of resources), 16% pertained to interpersonal dynamics (e.g., lack of trust from coworkers), and 25% referred to intrapersonal barriers (e.g., lack of knowledge about how to be an ally). Many (27.5%) claimed no barriers. We interpret findings using EST to theorize potential interactions among barriers and explore four promising organizational actions that target multiple barriers across levels of the ecological system: (1) expand opportunities for allyship, (2) diversify allyship strategies, (3) facilitate coalition-building between employee resource groups, and (4) tailor interventions to fit organizations’ unique barriers. Our analysis illustrates the practical value of a systems approach to enhancing allyship while moving away from narratives that primarily assign blame to individuals for inaction.",

High-dimensional combinations of behavioral features (particularly short-term usages related to basic task completion and dealing with complexity) were predictive for individuals’ fluid intelligence, highlighting the pervasiveness and idiosyncratic diversity of manifestations.

          "abstract": "Digital traces and machine learning methods are transforming psychometric assessment by enabling the ecological study of psychological characteristics in everyday life. However, past research has predominantly focused on predicting the Big Five personality traits, leaving vast areas of human psychology unexplored. Emerging findings from computer science suggest the feasibility of computational assessments beyond the Big Five, but are often limited by their reliance on public digital traces from social media. This article outlines future directions for developing more interpretable, robust, and valid computational assessments that integrate psychological theory with the versatility of digital trace data. Applying this theoretical lens, promising avenues beyond Big Five traits are identified across a wide range of constructs conceptualizing differences in personality, ability, motivation, and evaluation. As computational psychological assessment continues to evolve, psychologists will be essential in realizing its potential while identifying its conceptual and methodological boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Expressive suppression is common; when overused, it can degrade the regulation system itself. This paper introduces Affective Suppression Fatigue (ASF), a neurocognitive model explaining how sustained efforts to suppress emotions can lead to emotional numbing (a generalized blunting of affect) and reactive dysregulation (intermittent loss of control resulting in emotional outbursts). Drawing on psychological and neuroscientific evidence, we propose that chronic suppression fatigues the brain’s regulatory systems, especially prefrontal inhibitory control, causing detachment under low-intensity conditions and explosive reactions under high-intensity conditions. The ASF model integrates disparate findings on cognitive depletion, burnout, and chronic stress, offering a unified framework for paradoxical outcomes of emotion suppression. We conclude with theoretical and clinical implications for emotion regulation research and mental health interventions.",

Here, we categorize studies that base their reliance on one of three different strategies to answer this question. One involves establishing an effect where progress is the extent of support that an effect will be observed in subsequent studies that follow similar or conceptually close procedures. A second strategy involves a theory of the effect where progress is the extent that the mechanism or process by which an effect occurs can be understood sufficiently to identify key conditions under which the effect will or will not occur. A third strategy entails constructing a theoretical framework, where progress is the extent that a theory explains why effects occur at a level that transcends individual effect paradigms. We discuss issues that should be explicitly considered in selecting a strategy for justifying claims of research progress. Although there is potential for synergy across studies where the strategies build on one another, each strategy represents an alternative basis for claiming confidence in a study.",

          "authors": "Gerrit Böhme",
          "abstract": "We propose the Ψ-Field Theory, a novel framework that reconceptualizes consciousness as fundamental rather than emergent. Instead of consciousness arising from complex neural computation, we hypothesize that brains function as quantum transceivers, interfacing with a universal consciousness field (Ψ-field). This theory addresses persistent explanatory gaps in materialist approaches, particularly the binding problem and the hard problem of consciousness. We present five testable predictions and experimental designs that can distinguish between emergence-based and field-based models of consciousness. Our approach provides falsifiable hypotheses for phenomena including anesthetic effects, near-death experiences, and psychedelic states while maintaining compatibility with established neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "The successor representation (SR) has been suggested to underlie nuanced forms of habitual behavior and a reduced SR variant (redSR) produces addiction-like behavior in simulations. Neither of these strategies can be detected in paradigms assessing habits in humans, which are usually conducted in disorder-irrelevant contexts, and this may explain inconsistent evidence for a goal-directed-to-habitual behavior shift in addiction. We tested whether individuals with high-risk drinking behavior rely more on (red)SR, particularly in alcohol-related contexts. Findings suggest that a (reduced) random-policy SR-like strategy contributes to human behavior, but that high-risk drinkers do not differ from low-risk drinkers in their use of this strategy. Instead, both groups rely less on (reduced) random-policy SR and more on model-free control in alcohol-related contexts. Results suggest that (reduced) random-policy SR supports adaptive, resource-efficient behavior and is selectively downregulated in substance-related contexts, highlighting the importance of contextual modulation in understanding decision strategies in mental health.",

          "abstract": "Daniel Dennett’s view about consciousness in nonhuman animals has two parts.  One is a methodological injunction that we rely on our best theory of consciousness to settle that issue, a theory that must initially work for consciousness in humans.  The other part is Dennett’s application of his own theory of consciousness, developed in Consciousness Explained (1991), which leads him to conclude that nonhuman animals are likely never in conscious mental states.  I defend the methodological injunction as both sound and important, and argue that the alternative approaches that dominate the literature are unworkable.  But I also urge that Dennett’s theory of consciousness and his arguments against conscious states in nonhuman animals face significant difficulties.  Those difficulties are avoided by a higher-order-thought theory of consciousness, which is close to Dennett’s theory, and provides leverage in assessing which kinds of mental state are likely to be conscious in nonhuman animals.  Finally, I describe a promising experimental strategy for showing that conscious states do occur in some nonhuman animals, which fits comfortably with the higher-order-thought theory but not with Dennett’s.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral science—despite vast contributions—suffers from two fundamental flaws: absence of a unified model and inaccessibility. The Unified Behavior Model (UBM) addresses both by elementalizing behavior into four components: Cognition (stories/narratives), Behavior (habits/skills), Emotion (feelings as dynamic conduits), and Environment (including the body). This four-element “Behavior Echo-System” is explicitly falsifiable: any proposed fifth component must be shown to be both irreducible and essential.\n\nDrawing on Karl Popper’s observation that science is “systematic oversimplification,” UBM serves as both a map (diagnostic) and a compass (directional) for behavior design. Its P.A.R.R. protocol (Plan–Act–Record–Reassess) operationalizes the scientific method for intentional habit and skill formation, creating self-correcting feedback loops. Validated through over 15 years of practitioner use and supported by independent research on habit formation, UBM bridges academic insight and practical application—delivering a unified, teachable framework for intentional behavior change grounded in elemental sufficiency and falsifiability.",

          "abstract": "Despite protective functions of defending, it tends to decline in late childhood. Drawing on social identity theory and racial socialization perspectives, this study examines how race shapes which peer norms children attend to and how these norms influence defending over time. Specifically, we examined whether perceptions of same-race and other-race classmates’ defending predicted changes in children’s own defending, and how these effects varied by race and classroom racial composition. Participants were 564 Black and 860 White 4th and 5th graders from 91 classrooms across 13 public elementary schools in Southeastern U.S. who were followed across fall, winter, and spring. Results from latent growth modeling showed that the effect of perceived defending among same-race and other-race classmates on children’s own defending depended on race and classroom composition. Among Black youth, perceiving same-race classmates as highly engaged in defending and other-race classmates as highly disengaged in defending were associated with increases in defending over time if they were in classrooms with a high proportion of same-race peers. White youth who perceived same-race classmates as highly engaged in defending and other-race classmates as highly disengaged in defending were more likely to defend in fall if they were in classrooms with a low proportion of same-race peers. However, these effects were no longer significant by spring. Taken together, this study shows that defending is a socially embedded behavior, shaped by racial identity and classroom context, calling for new avenues for identity-sensitive bullying prevention.",

We propose a structured, hypothesis-driven CLPM extension that tests temporal asymmetry through nested structural equation models. By formally comparing forward and reverse cross-lagged effects under constrained models, this method identifies asymmetric predictive influences, strengthening causal inference. Demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world data, our approach maintains CLPM accessibility while providing a principled, statistically robust test for causal direction in observational time-series",

          "abstract": "Most words in a language are lexically ambiguous and are associated with multiple meanings that vary in their frequency and relatedness.  Although ambiguity is a fundamental property of language, there are extensive issues with existing measures of this construct. For instance, dictionary-based classifications and subjective ratings of meaning number and frequency struggle to capture the graded nature of ambiguity and, by proxy, its impact on cognition and performance in experimental tasks. It is also difficult to scale subjective measures to the full lexicon. We introduce a novel, automated framework to measure lexical ambiguity based on word association data from the Small World of Words (SWOW) project. We apply community detection algorithms to association graphs to quantify both the number and distribution of semantic communities for each word.  This in turn allows us to derive graded representations of meaning frequency and relatedness. To better understand our new metrics, we compare them to previously published subjective norms, and establish their validity by showing that they predict lexical decision performance in English and Rioplatense Spanish. Furthermore, our results reveal cross-linguistic differences in lexical ambiguity—Spanish is less ambiguous than English overall—which we hypothesize is due to typological differences between the languages.  Our validated framework contributes novel insights for computational and psycholinguistic models of semantic processing, and offers a scalable, automated, and language-independent framework for quantifying different facets of lexical ambiguity. We provide all of our code and ambiguity measures for approximately 7000 words in both languages to facilitate their use by other researchers.",

          "abstract": "Previous research shows that infant vocal output varies with fluctuations in autonomic arousal. It remains unclear, however, how infants transition from reflexive vocal production to being able to produce vocalisations independent of internal state. Using naturalistic daylong recordings with wearable devices, we demonstrate that early vocalisations occur at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, measured via heart rate, in infants aged 4-21 months (n=92), but that this relationship becomes progressively decoupled over development. Daylong heart rate time series discriminated vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64), and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling demonstrated this relationship became significantly weaker over age. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of infants’ cry and non-cry vocalisations, with vocalisations produced at higher arousal being higher-pitched and more variable in pitch, more harmonic and longer in duration. The influence of arousal on non-cry acoustic features diminished significantly with age, as opposed to cry acoustics which remained tied to arousal. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to verbal communication. We also found that mothers who contingently responded to a greater proportion of their infants’ non-cry vocalisations had infants who were significantly more decoupled, suggesting that caregiver responsivity may play a role in this progressive process.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study developed and validated the Critical Right Scale (CRS) to measure emerging critical right attitudes and revised the Critical Social Justice Attitudes Scale (CSJAS-R), replicating its psychometric evaluation.\nMethod: A nationwide convenience sample of Finnish adults (n = 626) completed an online survey. Item screening used exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation and loading and residual correlation criteria. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance testing were conducted in lavaan using full information maximum likelihood.\nResults: The final CRS consisted of five items with high reliability (α = .89, ω = .90) and good model fit in both male and female subsamples, with pooled-sample residual misfit judged minor given subgroup results. The CSJAS-R comprised six items with strong reliability (α = .88, ω = .89) and excellent fit. Both scales met configural and metric invariance; partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing a small number of item intercepts. CRS scores were strongly associated with right-wing and conservative self-placement, concentrated among Finns Party and Christian Democrat voters, and weakly linked to perceived oppression. CSJAS-R scores were strongly associated with left-wing and liberal self-placement, concentrated among Left Alliance and Greens voters, and moderately associated with justification of political violence. CRS and CSJAS-R were strongly negatively correlated (r = −.62), indicating divergent validity.\nConclusions: Both CRS and CSJAS-R demonstrated strong psychometric properties and distinct ideological profiles, providing validated tools for studying political attitude structures at opposing ends of the ideological spectrum.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how emotion regulation during film viewing influences cognitive control using a novel Emotional Film-Word Stroop task. In this task, both target (emotional words) and distractor stimuli (film stills) were emotionally laden and either congruent or incongruent in va-lence. Forty-four participants viewed film clips in two phases, upregulating emotion in one and downregulating in the other, with order counterbalanced. After each phase, they completed the Stroop task with stimuli from the films just viewed. A robust Stroop effect emerged: responses were slower and less accurate for incongruent than congruent trials. While no overall main effect of stance was found, order and phase moderated results. In Phase 1, upregulation pro-duced greater Stroop interference than downregulation, supporting the hypothesis that height-ened emotional engagement impairs interference control. In Phase 2, performance improved across conditions, consistent with practice effects that reduced interference. These findings high-light the temporal sensitivity of emotion–cognition interactions and introduce an ecologically valid paradigm for assessing how regulation strategies impact interference control when applied to the same emotional material.",

          "abstract": "Public sex offender registries were created on the assumption that people with a history of sexual offending present a high and enduring risk for sexual recidivism. Analyzing data from everyone on Michigan’s sex offender registry (n = 45,145), we found that recidivism risk was very low for many registrants—and that transitions into very low-risk groups occurred in systematic and predictable ways that are relevant to registry design. The sexual recidivism rates were 3% to 5% after five years and 10% after 20 years. Risk of future offending predictably declined the longer people remained sex-offense free in the community. Considering initial risk levels and time free in the community, the likelihood of sexual recidivism was very low for approximately half the registrants: out of 35,000 registrants in the community in Michigan, the risk level for 17,000 to 19,000 individuals was no different from the likelihood of first-time sexual offending in the general male population (&lt; 2% lifetime). Michigan’s registry provides no means for the public to differentiate between the noise presented by the large number of very low-risk cases and the signal representing the minority of genuinely high-risk cases. Major reforms are needed if public sex offender registries have any potential for advancing community safety. However, instead of placing our hopes in large, passive, and stigmatizing registries, we are more likely to reduce sexual recidivism by investing in individualized supervision, treatment, and other support for people at high risk for sexual recidivism.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels. Additionally, we present a quantum geometric derivation of Newton's gravitational constant and resolve the cosmological constant problem through discrete spacetime structures, unified by Hodge duality mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes the Emmet Measure, a self-help metacognitive support model designed for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and mild to moderate depression. The model encourages users to document intrusive or distorted thoughts experienced during symptomatic episodes and later compare them with thoughts recorded during periods of cognitive clarity or emotional stability. Through this process, individuals can recognize discrepancies between state-dependent cognition and their usual values or beliefs, helping to restore a sense of cognitive consistency and self-trust.\n\nUnlike conventional cognitive restructuring methods that attempt to directly modify thoughts, the Emmet Measure emphasizes recognition over correction. This approach can reduce psychological resistance and is particularly effective for addressing compulsive linguistic thoughts and self-denying beliefs.\n\nThe model is structured in three simple steps:\n(1) Record thoughts during acute symptomatic episodes.\n(2) Revisit the records in a stable state.\n(3) Identify and accept the gap between distorted and baseline thinking.\n\nA single-case observational report (n=1), conducted by the author, demonstrates potential utility in reducing ritualistic behavior in OCD and alleviating anxiety-driven cognitive spirals. The Emmet Measure may serve as a practical, low-burden tool for fostering metacognitive awareness and has potential for integration with online support systems or AI-assisted therapy.\n\nFuture directions include quantitative studies on symptom reduction and the emotional impact of repeated use, particularly among adolescent patients and those with limited access to clinical resources.",

          "abstract": "Diagnostic classification models (DCMs) constitute a family of discrete latent variable models designed to classify examinees based on their mastery or non-mastery of fine-grained skills or attributes. The response data from educational assessments often include graded responses, in which the response categories are obtained sequentially and explicitly associated with specific attributes. However, the existing parametric DCMs for graded responses require large sample sizes to estimate item parameters and the attribute mastery patterns of the examinees reliably, thereby hindering their practical application in educational contexts such as classroom settings. This article proposes a sequential general nonparametric classification method for graded responses that demonstrates promising classification accuracy even with a small sample size. The proposed method accommodates polytomous responses, including graded responses, and different condensation rules. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method outperforms the existing parametric polytomous DCMs and nonparametric binary DCMs, specifically when the sample size is small. Additionally, an actual high school test dataset was analyzed to illustrate the utility of the proposed method in educational practice. To promote practical application of the proposed method, a companion R function has been made freely available on the open science framework.",

Data from 1,000 participants (48.9% male, 51.1% female), aged 12–17 years, from Delhi government schools revealed a high prevalence of PIU. Self-esteem showed a significant negative correlation with PIU, with lower self-esteem predicting PIU (12.7% variance explained). Maladaptive coping partially mediated the self-esteem–PIU relationship. While meditators and non-meditators exhibited similar PIU levels, meditators demonstrated higher self-esteem and adaptive coping. Gender comparisons revealed no differences in PIU and self-esteem, though males used maladaptive coping more frequently.

          "abstract": "In the era of globalisation, evolving technologies have become integral to modern life. With the normalisation of unrestricted internet access, many young people face negative impacts from excessive use, often affecting their self-esteem. Developing adaptive coping strategies may help mitigate these effects. This study examines the effectiveness of the Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) program for improving self-esteem and adaptive coping that may reduce problematic internet use and maladaptive coping. This study included 119 students from 9th to 11th grades, from a government school in northern India. The study follows a quasi-experimental research design with a pre-post-test with a waitlist control group. The experimental group underwent a 12-week Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) program; each week had 5 sessions of 40  minutes. The experimental group(n=56) included 26 boys and 30 girls with an average age of 13 (SD=1.46). The waitlist control group (n=63) included 30 boys and 33 girls with an average age of 13.67(SD=1.92). The experimental group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in self-esteem and adaptive coping, and reductions in problematic internet use and maladaptive coping, with large within-group effect sizes. These findings provide robust evidence for the efficacy of the SYM intervention, with clear interaction effects indicating differential gains over the waitlist control group. The results emphasise the potential of SYM as a scalable intervention to promote self-esteem, adaptive coping strategies and reduce (Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and risk behaviours among adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia — the congenital absence of voluntary visual imagery — and developmental learning disorders such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are typically studied in isolation. This paper proposes a unifying network-level framework: Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia (TCD) as a shared oscillatory pathology underlying a subclass of cognitive simulation impairments, termed Simulation-Gating Dysfunction (SGD).\n\nTCD is characterised by a pathological shift from normal alpha–gamma coordination to theta-dominant oscillations and unstable gamma responses within specific thalamocortical loops. Disruption of these circuits produces loop-specific deficits: visual (aphantasia), auditory (dyslexia), parietal (dyscalculia), and motor (DCD). Convergent evidence from high-field neuroimaging, MEG/EEG biomarkers, pupillometry, and neuromodulation studies links these conditions to common patterns of gamma instability and sensory gating failure.\n\nA translational research protocol is proposed, combining MEG/EEG-based detection of theta–gamma decoupling with closed-loop 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and norepinephrine reuptake enhancement to restore oscillatory precision. This model reframes a subset of developmental conditions as oscillatory control disorders amenable to targeted, circuit-level restoration, bridging basic neuroscience with precision intervention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Adequate cold storage facility for Horticultural products is critical due to their perishable nature. Green energy based evaporative cooling storage unit is a sustainable and efficient solution for small scale farmers and vegetable vendors in hot and dry climates who need to store their produce. Solar power operated evaporative cooling structures are low cost and efficient in reducing ambient temperature and increasing relative humidity, which increases the shelf-life of vegetables. A green energy-based evaporative cooling transit storage unit of 0.63m3 capacity was designed and fabricated. The transit unit was designed and operated as a a tricycle. Two suction fans (15.6W), submersible water pump (12W) and LED light (2.88Wp) were powered through two 100-Wp solar panels. Two batteries, 7Ah each were also used to store energy. The storage unit was made up of MS sheets of 1.2mm thick while a side of the system was made up of GI wire mesh with honeycomb pad. To test the performance of the developed unit tomato, spinach and radish were used. Results revealed that there was a significant difference (P=0.05) in PLW, firmness, TSS, and colour values of the vegetables when stored inside the unit compared to vegetables stored in ambient condition. The ambient temperature during the study was 32.2-43.4°C and RH was 21.1- 46%. The drop-in temperature was 7.8 to 14.8°C as compared to ambient conditions, while RH in the cooling chamber increased considerably to 84%.  The average cooling efficiency obtained was 84.12%.  The shelf life of stored vegetables inside the unit was 2-5 days higher than those kept under ambient conditions.",

          "abstract": "Malaria remains a major public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria among the most affected countries. This study evaluated the hepatoprotective and antiplasmodial effects of ethanolic leaf extracts of Azadirachta indica (EAI) and Cymbopogon citratus (ECC) in Plasmodium berghei-infected male Swiss albino mice. Forty mice were randomly assigned into eight groups (n=5). Group A served as uninfected control, Group B was infected but untreated, while Groups C-H were infected and subsequently treated with respective extracts. Groups C– H received varying doses of EAI, ECC, their combination, or a standard drug. Groups C and D received 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg EAI; Groups E and F received 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg ECC. Group G received Lonart® (standard antimalarial), and Group H received a combination of 500 mg/kg of both extracts. Treatments lasted 14 days. Infected groups showed minimal weight gain, while the uninfected control had significant increases. Relative liver weights were elevated in the untreated group but normalized in most treated groups. Serum AST and ALP levels were elevated in the malaria control group, while ALT levels were paradoxically reduced—possibly reflecting hepatic functional suppression. Extract-treated groups, especially the combination group, showed marked improvement in liver enzyme profiles. Parasitemia significantly declined by Days 7 and 14 in all treated groups, with the combination therapy yielding effects comparable to the standard drug. Histological analysis revealed lymphocytic infiltration and sinusoidal congestion in the malaria control group, which were ameliorated in extract-treated groups. These findings suggest dose-dependent hepatoprotective and antiplasmodial activities of EAI and ECC, likely due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituents.",

          "abstract": "This paper documents a philosophical phenomenon in which a theory is not deliberately constructed, but instead \"emerges\" when structural conditions align and initiate a generative process. Core Belief Structural Theory (Kakushin Kōzōron) posits that meaning is generated through structure. Remarkably, the process by which this theory itself was written exemplifies its own core claim. This work introduces the concept of generative self-proof—a fifth mode of self-verification extending beyond traditional epistemological categories—and demonstrates how such a structure was enacted through collaborative dialogues with AI agents. By analyzing the theory’s emergence via the interplay of four structural elements—Core Belief (FQ), Structural Pressure, Structural Shards, and Mindflight Cognition—the paper positions this record not as an authored argument, but as a structural occurrence. It proposes that this generative mechanism is reproducible and represents a new mode of intellectual operation in the age of human–AI collaboration.",

          "abstract": "This paper details a preliminary, 168-hour, qualitative, n=1 observational trial of a novel internal protocol, termed Distributed Somatic Regulation (DSR), developed and implemented by a highly organized plural system of consciousness. The trial was initiated following a systemic crisis: the burnout-induced collapse of the primary host after three decades of single-handedly managing the system's chronic physiological illnesses. The objective was to test the hypothesis that a conscious, collective distribution of the cognitive and neurological load of somatic management could lead to a more stable and functional state of physical well-being. The methodology involved an entirely internal reorganization of consciousness with minimal external variables. The results indicated a significant and sustained reduction in reported general pain levels, as well as a marked mitigation of symptoms associated with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The conclusion suggests that DSR represents a potentially powerful, novel, and non-pharmacological approach to mind-body regulation inherent to the capabilities of a plural consciousness.",

Using my decolonizing theory that is\nin coalition with Dis/ability Critical Race Studies (DisCrit; Annamma et al., 2013) and Crip Linguistics (Henner &amp; Robinson, 2023), I reveal how these ideologies facilitate ableist and racist social processes that lead to psycholinguistic injustice. Psycholinguistic injustice can manifest as monolingualism, monomodalism, and oppressive notions of language disorder. Confronting psycholinguistic injustice entails honoring indigenous roots and reclaiming the languaging that was erased by colonization. By confronting psycholinguistic injustice, speech/language pathologists can figure out how to support the legitimacy of multilingual and multimodal languaging development. By resisting psycholinguistic injustice in the field of S/LP, humanizing theories, research, and practices that fundamentally place racial and disability justice can be developed.

          "authors": "Hisataka Takasugi",
          "abstract": "In the age of artificial intelligence, human intelligence faces an existential redefinition. As algorithmic systems increasingly automate tasks once considered exclusive to human cognition, it is high time to reconsider the essence of human intellectual capacity. This paper introduces Jiatama 2.0™, a reimagined framework for understanding intelligence not as static capacity or raw IQ, but as the operational deployment of thought—situated, purposeful, and contextually attuned. Building on cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind, Jiatama 2.0™ posits three core \"intellectual muscles\": the ability to structure information, to generate meaning, and to reinterpret experience. These capacities resist full automation due to their reliance on subjective agency, ethical orientation, and contextual inference. To ground this conceptual framework, we analyze current insights from studies on the Default Mode Network, affective neuroscience, enactivism, and neuroplasticity. We argue that these human faculties are not merely evolutionary vestiges, but vital capabilities for navigating an era of accelerating change and cognitive outsourcing. Jiatama 2.0™ serves not only as a theoretical model but also as a foundation for educational and organizational development in an AI-saturated society. By reasserting the value of volitional, meaning-driven, and structurally agile thought, this framework seeks to shift the narrative from fear of automation to empowerment through uniquely human cognition.\nKeywords: Jiatama 2.0™, cognitive agency, Meaning-making, Contextual intelligence, Cognitive automation, Value-based reasoning",

The common thread among these phenomena is that they are intuitively understood but their underlying mechanisms have not been adequately explained. Using the concept of \"structure,\" Kakushin Structure Theory attempts to shed light on these phenomena, asserting that \"structure is meaning itself.\" This paper emphasizes the importance of \"structure\" in thought, emotion, and behavior and aims to provide a new perspective on understanding everyday occurrences through this structural lens.

          "abstract": "The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0 is an influential framework aiming to explain consciousness mathematically in terms of intrinsic existence, namely what exists for itself in a specific, maximally irreducible, structured form. IIT thus posits that the minimal substrates of consciousness are also the ultimate building blocks of what exists. These are called ‘monads’, and are defined as self-connected, single-unit systems purportedly specifying maximal values of IIT’s measure of conscious irreducible existence, namely system integrated information phi_s* (i.e., phi-monads). In this paper, we argue that IIT 4.0’s formalism cannot be applied to monads, thus threatening the theory’s own ontological ground.  We show that IIT’s formalism requires that any candidate substrate of consciousness must be constituted by at least two non-overlapping, non-empty, and jointly exhaustive parts, which we refer to as the Plurality requirement.  We then show that monads violate this requirement, which leads to serious mathematical and conceptual problems, since the equations needed to calculate system integrated information become undefined. Thus, our paper calls for urgent clarification and/or revision by IIT proponents concerning the status of phi-monads as ontologically fundamental building blocks and minimal substrates of consciousness.",

Outcomes have been inconsistent due to imprecise brain targeting. Minimally invasive Personalized Adaptive Cortical Electro-stimulation (PACE) uses fMRI-based precision functional mapping (PFM) to target patient-specific network anomalies with brain surface electrodes. We utilized this novel technology in an n-of-1 study to treat a 44-year-old man (TRD-1) with over 30 years of severe unipolar depression. PFM revealed a 400% expansion in cortical area of the Salience Network (SN)  and a 25% reduction in default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal (FP) networks compared to a group average controls. Stimulation paddles were implanted targeting patient-specific SN, DMN, and FP networks. Postoperative stimulation testing (within 24h) revealed immediate electrode-specific mood and cognition responses that matched the underlying functional networks. Stimulation parameters were iteratively optimized using ‘Bayes Tuning’ based on patient feedback. TRD-1’s suicidal ideations ceased within 7 weeks. Full remission of symptoms was achieved within 9 months and maintained at 30 months. PACE therapy appears to be a scalable, safe, and cost-effective approach to treat TRD.",

RSMT identifies a self-index—the F-token—as a fixed point F of the system’s self-update operator Mν, where ν ∈ [0,1] parameterises transparency to internal state. The theory formalises (i) the inevitability of self-reference (Lawvere/Banach/Tarski fixed-point results), (ii) indexical opacity—the impossibility of redescribing the self-index non-indexically without shifting the origin, (iii) an opacity–stability trade-off with critical νc, (iv) a binding axiom that forces all bound content to be “for-me,” yielding an anti-zombie corollary, and (v) a lights-on theorem guaranteeing ongoing work under environmental drift.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a Beta-Bernoulli mixture item response model (BBM-IRT) for bounded-continuous items such as those often utilized in continuous rating scales and slider-bar assessments. These item types are commonly used in psychological research but, to date, these assessments have primarily been utilized in fixed-length situations, where the same set of items are administered to all respondents, and have not been utilized within an adaptive testing framework. An adaptive testing framework offers several benefits, including the ability to obtain higher quality measurement precision with fewer items as items are targeted and administered based on the respondent’s previous responses. In addition to introducing the BBM-IRT model, this work also explores the use of the model within an adaptive testing framework. In particular, the item and test information functions – a component necessary for building adaptive assessments – is derived and presented in closed form. Through a series of simulation studies, we provide empirical evidence that it is possible to create adaptive assessments for bounded-continuous item types. An application with real data is also provided showing how the BBM-IRT model can be utilized in practical assessment situations.",

In the present study, we used exploratory psychometric methods to examine the structure of psychopathology symptoms from the “bottom-up” or using symptom-level co-occurrence to derive common factors in a sample of individuals (N = 347) across earlier pregnancy (M = 17.4 weeks gestation), later pregnancy (M = 34.6 weeks gestation), and postpartum (M = 25.3 weeks postpartum). We examined changes (or invariance) in symptom structure longitudinally and between distressed (N = 252) and euthymic (N = 96) pregnant individuals. Results demonstrated a hierarchical structure of symptoms including a robust Broad Distress factor at the highest level, followed by replicable Internalizing and Externalizing factors, all the way down to a nine-factor solution including Low Mood-Anhedonia, Pregnancy Anxiety, Fear-Worry-Tension, Social Anxiety-Dependence, Traumatic Stress, Somatic Problems, Detachment, Anger-Antagonism, and Inattention-Hyperactivity factors. Psychopathology structure was remarkably invariant from earlier to later pregnancy, but structure changed slightly into postpartum. Symptom structure also showed slight differences between distressed and euthymic individuals, indicating that while some factors (e.g., trauma and somatic symptoms) differ across time or clinical population, perinatal symptom factors are largely robust. Similarities and differences between the perinatal psychopathology structure recovered here and general population structure have important implications for empirically-based psychopathology classification.",

          "abstract": "Nature exposure benefits physical and mental health, yet most evidence is based upon brief, self-reported data. We conducted a study using a GPS-enabled mobile app, NatureDoseTM, to quantify geographic and temporal patterns of nature exposure among college students (N = 315) at a university located in the northeastern United States over a 14-week intervention (January–May 2023) as part of a randomized controlled trial. Early in the semester, nature exposure was concentrated in urban areas, nearby parks, and ski mountain areas. Later, nature exposure increased near lakeshores and geographically broadened during the week of spring break, highlighting temporal shifts. Participants in the nature experiences intervention group gained nature exposure in significantly more census blocks than those in the control, physical activity, or therapy groups, suggesting the nature-based intervention encouraged wider geographic engagement. These findings suggest that nature-based interventions may enhance the quality and diversity of exposure among young adults.",

Nearly all parents (99.6%) tracked at least one domain. Most adolescents viewed tracking as legitimate, though location tracking was seen as less so. Parental digital tracking was unrelated to adolescent well-being but positively to parental factors associated with control and fear.

          "abstract": "Background: Early intervention increases the likelihood of eating disorder (ED) recovery but many young people delay help-seeking. We developed a smartphone-friendly, online decision-making tool to address this gap (FREED-Mobile [FREED-M]) and conducted a feasibility trial of the tool. Methods: 16- to 25-year-olds with a suspected ED and no previous specialist treatment were randomly allocated to FREED-M or active control in a parallel group, two-arm trial. Outcomes were measured at weeks 0 (baseline), 4 (post-intervention) and 12 (follow-up). The primary feasibility outcome was attrition at follow-up. Other outcomes included motivational, clinical and economic measures. Results: We were able to over-recruit with 204 randomised participants (including 20 fraudulent participants). Main analyses were conducted with 184 genuine responders (FREED-M: n=91, control: n=93). At baseline, participants’ mean age was 21.0 (SD 2.0) years, 89% identified as female and 64% as white. Mean BMI was 23.1 (6.3). N=83 participants had an anorexia nervosa-like disorder, 101 had another ED or ED high risk. Attrition at week 12 was n=112 (61%).  Of the n=42 FREED-M participants who provided acceptability ratings, 79% liked the intervention and 66% found it useful. Between-group effect sizes for motivation and readiness to change were small-medium at 4-weeks (d=0.27 and d=0.15, respectively) favouring FREED-M, but differences were not sustained at follow-up (d=-0.02 and d=-0.12, respectively).  Conclusions: Although the attrition rate was high, recruitment exceeded expectations. Acceptability of FREED-M was high. Motivation and readiness to change are candidates for primary outcomes in a future randomised controlled trial.",

          "abstract": "Applications of the diffusion decision model (DDM) to the study of cognitive individual differences consistently find that the model’s drift rate (v) parameter forms a cohesive factor across many tasks and relates to measures of higher-order cognitive functioning, including general cognitive ability and working memory. This parameter is often interpreted as a measure of “processing speed”, a traditional psychometric construct thought to reflect an individual’s basic speed of information processing across tasks. However, conceptual differences between v and traditional notions of processing speed make this mapping far from straightforward. Racing accumulator models, which provide a more flexible and comprehensive account of behavioral data than the DDM (Heathcote &amp; Matzke, 2022), allow for the speed with which individuals accumulate evidence to be dissociated from the efficiency with which they accumulate task-relevant evidence (versus task-irrelevant evidence). We applied the DDM and a racing accumulator model to three tasks across three independent datasets to gauge the extent to which v parameter findings from the cognitive individual differences literature reflect speed of evidence accumulation (SEA) versus efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA). Across all tasks, v was more strongly related to EEA than SEA. EEA was consistently related to measures of general cognitive ability, working memory, and executive function whereas SEA explained less than 1% of the variance in each. These findings suggest individual differences in the DDM’s v parameter, and its relations with higher-order cognitive abilities, primarily reflect EEA rather than SEA and challenge the widespread practice of equating v with the traditional “processing speed” construct.",

The common thread among these phenomena is that they are intuitively understood but their underlying mechanisms have not been adequately explained. Using the concept of \"structure,\" Kakushin Structure Theory attempts to shed light on these phenomena, asserting that \"structure is meaning itself.\" This paper emphasizes the importance of \"structure\" in thought, emotion, and behavior and aims to provide a new perspective on understanding everyday occurrences through this structural lens.

          "abstract": "Attention can be affected by expectations about where and when stimuli will appear. These two influences, spatial and temporal, may be present together and may interact with each other in unknown complex ways. To explore these possibilities, we used an attention paradigm that incorporated three variables known to produce effects on performance in a speeded reaction-time task: spatial cueing to indicate where a target stimulus is likely to appear, temporal statistics to indicate when the target is likely to appear, and preparation for a block of trials of similar length. When analyzing the data for linear trends, we found that each of these factors impacted performance but did not interact. When analyzing nonlinear trends in the data, we found an interaction between spatial and temporal attention that was modulated by preparation for a block of trials of similar length. We evaluated whether attentional effects across spatial, temporal, and preparatory domains could be explained by one unitary mechanism, rather than multiple modality-specific mechanisms, using an augmented drift diffusion model. In the model, attention is allocated according to an interplay between the costs and benefits of maintaining attention. The model successfully replicated the linear effects observed in the human data, and accounted for some but not all nonlinear features in the data, suggesting that many disparate features of attention can be parsimoniously explained by a cost-benefit framework, but some complexity in attention control remains to be understood.",

          "abstract": "Holistic and global cognition are often treated as interchangeable terms in psychological science to describe broad-scope cognitive styles. However, this conflation obscures important theoretical and methodological distinctions between the two constructs. In this review, we disentangle holistic and global cognition by tracing their conceptual foundations, measurement approaches, and empirical correlates. We argue that while both involve attending to “the big picture”, they are grounded in fundamentally different mechanisms: holistic cognition emphasizes sensitivity to context, relational reasoning, and causality, whereas global cognition reflects a tendency to prioritize higher-level, abstract, or gestalt features over local details. Drawing on cognitive, behavioral, and cross-cultural evidence, we synthesize findings that illustrate both the dissociation between these constructs, their underlying mechanisms, and their differential associations with other variables, as well as areas where they overlap. By mapping where these constructs diverge and converge, we provide a clearer conceptual and methodological distinction that reconciles past inconsistencies. We argue that such clarity is crucial for avoiding misinterpretation of findings and misalignment of measures. To this end, we offer concrete guidelines for defining, operationalizing, and studying these constructs, and call for more rigorous theoretical precision in future work.",

          "abstract": "If only the present exists, how can we make sense of causal chains that stretch across time, the irreversible processes we observe in nature, and the one-way arrow of time? This question strikes at the heart of temporal metaphysics and physics. Existential Realism (ER) is a present-centered ontological framework   that claims only present entities exist in the fullest sense, yet past and future entities are still in some sense real due to their causal connections and informational traces.  Unlike standard presentism (which would render past and future wholly unreal, raising puzzles about truth, memory, and cause),  ER draws a crucial distinction between existence and reality. Under ER, the present is the locus of existence, but the past remains ontologically real insofar as it has left enduring effects and information in the world. The future, likewise, though not yet existent, can be treated as real in the mode of anticipated possibilities that influence current plans and expectations. This nuanced ontology aims to resolve presentism’s classic problems   — for example, how past causes can still have effects, or how past-tense statements can be true if the past is utterly nonexistent.\nIn what follows, we will deepen the case for Existential Realism by showing how it accounts for causal relations, the linear order of time, the sense of temporal becoming, and the thermodynamic arrow of time. We will draw on insights from the philosophy of physics – including Hans Reichenbach’s   analysis of time’s direction, Huw Price’s   reflections on retrocausality and perspective, and Barry Loewer’s   work on entropy and the “Past Hypothesis” – to demonstrate that a present-centric metaphysics can be fully time-compatible. Ultimately, we argue that ER not only accommodates modern physics but preserves our intuitive and scientific understanding of time’s asymmetries and the unfolding causal story of the universe.",

          "abstract": "Autistic individuals experience temporal integration difficulties in some sensory modalities that may be related to imagination difficulties. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that among Japanese university students in the general population, (1) higher autistic traits and (2) greater imagination difficulties are associated with lower performance in tasks requiring temporal integration. Two tasks were used to assess their temporal integration abilities: a speech-in-noise test using noise with temporal dips in the auditory modality and a slit-viewing task in the visual modality. The results showed that low performance in the speech-in-noise test was related to autistic traits and some aspects of imagination difficulties, whereas the slit-viewing task was related to neither autistic traits nor imagination difficulties. The ability to temporally integrate fragments of auditory information is expected to be associated with performance in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips. The difficulties in perceiving sensory information as a single unified percept using priors may cause difficulties in temporally integrating auditory information and perceiving speech in noise. Furthermore, the structural equation modeling suggests that imagination difficulties are linked to difficulties in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips, which links to social impairments.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Quantum physics has dramatically reshaped our understanding of time and reality, revealing that the present moment occupies a uniquely privileged position within physical processes. In the first paper (\"Quantum Physics Prefers the Present: A Temporal Ontology Grounded in Measurement\"), we saw how quantum phenomena such as wavefunction collapse and measurement highlight the “now” as the only time when possibilities become actual. However, simply embracing presentism – the doctrine that only the present exists – is not enough. Presentism’s traditional metaphysical stance, which conflates existence with reality by declaring all non-present things unreal, runs into serious conceptual roadblocks when confronted with quantum experiments and the demands of causality and truth over time. This second paper advocates Existential Realism (ER) as a more nuanced and robust ontological framework that builds on those quantum insights while overcoming presentism’s limitations. By rigorously distinguishing existence from reality, ER provides a richer account of quantum phenomena – one that honors the special role of the present without erasing the past or negating the future. We will argue that ER better captures the ontology implied by quantum mechanics, from delayed-choice experiments and collapse theories to decoherence, and that it empowers a view of time where “becoming” and temporal agency are coherent and defensible.  In short, Existential Realism preserves the empirical centrality of the present while acknowledging the tangible reality of past causes and future possibilities — making it a more comprehensive fit for quantum reality.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "In both everyday language and philosophical discourse, the terms existence and reality are often used interchangeably. This conflation is especially evident in debates on the ontology of time. For example, an orthodox presentist will say that only present things truly exist, treating all non-present entities (past or future) as unreal in an absolute sense – “all such objects are unreal, according to Presentism,” as one defender neatly put it. This paper serves as a focused extension and clarification of the metaphysical framework introduced in Existential Realism – A Distinct Ontological Framework Beyond Presentism. It addresses specific questions raised by readers and critics: Is it coherent to distinguish existence from reality? What philosophical work does that distinction do? How does it help with longstanding problems like truthmaking, the status of unobservable entities, and future ethics? In short, while the original paper laid out the core ontological structure, this follow-up revisits its foundations to deepen the theoretical implications, refine key definitions, and explore practical consequences. Our central thesis remains: existence and reality are not identical. But here, we argue more sharply that separating them yields a more nuanced, empirically grounded, and philosophically productive ontology of time. We defend this view against objections, offer clarified examples, and explore its implications for epistemology, phenomenology, and ethics. We proceed as follows. Section 2 defines existence narrowly, in terms of presentness and empirical accessibility, drawing on the spirit of van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism . Section 3 then defines reality more broadly, to include causal and structural aspects of the world inferable beyond the present—illustrated through examples such as dinosaurs, future climate events, and cognitive anticipations. Section 4 explores how this distinction addresses several philosophical issues: the truthmaker problem for past truths, the ontological status of unobservable scientific entities, the phenomenology of temporal experience (in the sense of Husserl and Metzinger ), and considerations of metaphysical parsimony. Section 5 argues why this two-tier ontology is not merely a restatement of presentism or eternalism, but a distinct metaphysical framework. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our contributions and highlights new directions this view opens—particularly in ethics (e.g., our duties to future persons), AI models of time, and decision theory under uncertainty. Throughout, we maintain an academic tone and use end-of-paragraph references in line with the original paper’s style. Our aim is for this article to stand on its own as a focused argument on the existence–reality distinction, while continuing and enriching the foundation laid by Existential Realism.",

          "title": "Existential Realism: A Distinct Ontological Framework Beyond Presentism",
          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Existential Realism as a novel ontological framework in metaphysics that offers a rigorously technical alternative to presentism. In contrast to standard presentism’s claim that only the present exists , In contrast to standard presentism, which claims that only the present exists, Existential Realism distinguishes between existence—material, empirically accessible presence—and reality, which includes causal, epistemic, and anticipatory structures beyond the immediate present. This framework integrates insights from metaphysics, epistemology, and phenomenology to address the limitations of presentism and related theories of time. We delineate how Existential Realism departs from presentism (and is not merely a variant thereof) by reinterpreting what it means for an entity or event to exist now, while still affirming the ontological significance of past and future entities as real despite their lack of present existence. Systematic comparisons are drawn between Existential Realism and the standard theories of temporal ontology – presentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory – with references to key contributors (Markosian, Crisp, Bourne, Zimmerman) to highlight differences in ontological commitments. We provide technically grounded examples—from causal traces in physics to cognitive-state evidence and time-indexed data structures—to show how entities can be real even without presently existing. The paper also addresses major objections, including the coherence of reality without existence, the epistemological access to entities that do not presently exist or are unobservable, and the compatibility of this framework with special relativity. A comparative table is included to map Existential Realism vis-à-vis other theories. In conclusion, Existential Realism is presented as a robust, integrative stance that preserves the empirical and experiential centrality of the present while acknowledging the enduring reality of the past and the looming reality of the future – thus serving as a stand-alone reference framework for future discourse in metaphysics and cognitive science.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a structural documentation of the singularities and genesis of the “Core Belief Structure Theory,” a thought system not designed from abstract principles but emerged organically through over 20 years of entrepreneurial education practice and deep co-creative dialogue with generative AI. The theory redefines intelligence (SQ), introduces structural cognition (Mindflight), self-validating architectures, temporal integration, and structural aesthetics. It is described here through eight core aspects, including the architecture of questions, the manifestation of core belief (kakushin), and the self-propagating nature of thought as an OS. Framed as a guidebook for “how to navigate” this theory, the paper also functions as a meta-thought: a theory that justifies itself through its own process of emergence. It invites readers into a new way of thinking—where meaning is constructed structurally, and intelligence becomes democratized through structure-sensitive cognition.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Identifying the content of key COVID communications is essential to reflect how improvements can be made in future public health emergencies. National televised briefings to communicate updates and legislation changes were held at regular intervals during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to identify behaviour change strategies used within the UK’s COVID-19 national televised briefings. \n\nDesign: A content analysis was performed on twenty transcripts of UK national televised briefings, purposively selected for their alignment with key UK COVID-19 milestones between March 2020 and July 2021.\n\nMethods: Transcripts were analysed for behaviour change content using Intervention Functions from the Behaviour Change Wheel and the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology. Inter-rater reliability of double-coding was performed using Krippendorff’s alpha.\n\nResults: Sixty-nine of the 281 BCTs presented within the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology were identified across the twenty transcripts. The most commonly identified Intervention Functions were Education (100% of transcripts), Enablement (95%) and Persuasion (85%). The most commonly identified Behaviour Change Techniques were Present information from credible influence (100% of transcripts), Advise specific behaviour (90%), Instruct how to perform behaviour (70%) and Deliver instrumental support (70%).\n\nConclusions: The UK’s COVID-19 nationalised televised briefings were lacking Modelling and Training support. Televised briefings during future public health emergencies would benefit from including clear behavioural and outcome goals to guide and empower the public. This article provides an implementation of the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology to code existing, secondary health communication sources.",

Epigenetic processes, like deoxyribonucleic acid methylation (DNAm), might mediate this link, and CM types might be linked to differential alterations in DNAm. While a study by Cecil et al. (2016) suggests that different forms of CM share common but also exhibit distinct epigenetic signatures, it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to other high-risk samples. \nThe aim of this preregistered study was to replicate the study of Cecil and colleagues (2016) in a sample of N = 116 previously out-of-home placed young adults (32% women, age mean = 26.38, SD = 3.49). Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF), DNA was extracted from whole blood and DNAm was assayed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Microarray. \nUsing state-of the-art processing pipelines, we failed to replicate the original finding of common and shared epigenetic signatures by CM type. When using a pipeline that was closely matched to the original study, we could replicate that DNAm of cg07032930 was linked to emotional neglect, but in the reverse direction as in the original report. Overall, replication rates per CM subtype were only modest. \nThese findings highlight challenges in independently replicating reported epigenetic associations in high-risk samples and underscore the importance of replication attempts in the field of behavioral epigenetics. Further research is needed to clarify the robustness and specificity of DNAm signatures linked to distinct CM types.",

          "authors": "Charlotte Rebecca Pennington",
          "abstract": "Registered Reports are a type of empirical article in which study proposals are peer reviewed and pre-accepted before the research is undertaken. This is achieved by splitting the traditional peer review process into two stages: at ‘Stage 1’, authors submit their study proposal and peer reviewers assess the plausibility of the research questions and the appropriateness of the methodology and analytical plan. Protocols that are favourably reviewed receive ‘In Principle Acceptance’ (IPA) whereby the journal, or platform, commits to publishing the final study regardless of its results. The authors then collect and/or analyse their data. At ‘Stage 2’, they then submit their complete research article and peer reviewers evaluate how closely the authors have followed their protocol and accurately report and interpret their findings. By doing this, Registered Reports are proposed to mitigate many issues seen in the historical research ecosystem: they aim to reduce the potential for questionable research practices by incentivising transparency and reproducibility and reduce publication bias by focusing on methodological and analytical rigour over the nature of the results. This guide provides an overview of what Registered Reports are and how they work, responds to frequently asked questions, outlines barriers and solutions to their implementation, and offers 10 top tips for researchers. It is aimed at students and researchers wanting to learn more about Registered Reports and/or conduct their research through this format.",

          "authors": "Iris Backfisch; Ronny Scherer; Jürgen Schneider; Andreas Lachner",
          "abstract": "Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) plays a central role for teacher training and measuring teachers’ preparedness for technology-enhanced teaching. Hence, crafting a validity argument of the popular TPACK self-assessments is key to facilitating evidence-based practices in these areas. However, the existing body of validity evidence abounds in divergent findings, for instance on the factor structure of TPACK self-reports across pre- and in-service teacher samples. To synthesize this evidence and capture its heterogeneity, we conducted a systematic review with a meta-analysis. First, we examined the internal validity of TPACK by analyzing its factor structure using meta-analytic structural equation and network modeling. Second, we compared two theoretical models describing the relations among the TPACK dimension—the transformative and integrative models—against the data. Third, we assessed the external validity of self-reported TPCK by examining its correlation with actual technology use in teaching. Our findings revealed two distinguishable dimensions of TPACK for both pre- and in-service teacher samples, which represented the technological and non-technological dimensions. The integrative model provided an overall better fit to the data. Moreover, TPACK self-reports were moderately correlated with technology use (r ̅s = 0.23-0.49) and exhibited substantial heterogeneity. Our results underscore the importance of generating and considering both internal and external validity evidence when applying TPACK assessments to generate implications for educational research and practice.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

Experiential factors such as education, occupation, and leisure activities influence the development of CR. \nTheoretically, such factors build up from childhood and across adulthood. Thus, appropriate tools to define and measure CR as early as adolescence are essential to understand its developmental processes. To this aim, we introduce the construct of \"Cognitive Reserve Potential\" (CRP) and its corresponding index of experiential factors tailored to youth. We investigated prototypical youth exposures potentially associated with the lifelong development of CR (e.g., sport practice, musical experiences, cultural activities, relationships with peers and family).  \nPrincipal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis identified and replicated the CRP factor structure on two independent samples of Italian students: N=585 (295 F) and N=351 (201 F), ages 11-20.

Building on these reflections I present different psychological traditions of conceptualizing knowledge and their implications for the use of digital media. Then I introduce collective knowledge construction as a process in which people create new insights collaboratively in inter-personal activities that involve the collective creation of meaning and recollection via social interaction. I discuss conceptualizations of knowledge construction from a cognitive and from a sociocultural perspective. After that, as an integrative approach, I present a systems theoretical account that considers knowledge construction as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. The article concludes with a discussion of how collective knowledge construction as a cognitive and sociocultural phenomenon is currently changing due to recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence. I argue that this has also implications for memory processes, which are not mere individual repositories but part of distributed systems of cultural memory incorporating digital artifacts and human networks.",

          "abstract": "Child and adolescent development is influenced by complex interplay between a range of diverse factors. The network approach is gaining popularity as a way of modelling such complex processes. Here we used the network approach to investigate whether developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as arising from causal interactions between characteristics and symptoms. We used data from four population-based birth cohorts in England (n=47,315), those born in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s, to investigate interrelations between areas of psychological functioning that underpin learning and engagement in education settings (i.e., memory, attention, non-verbal ability, arithmetic skills, reading, language and communication, motor skills, neurodevelopmental characteristics, psychopathology, social functioning, and wellbeing). We fitted 12 undirected psychometric network models; one network for each cohort and developmental stage (early childhood; 3-5 years, middle childhood; 7-10 years, adolescence; 13-18 years). We then determined how these areas of functioning cluster within developmental domains. Clustering differed between childhood and adolescence. In early and middle childhood, psychological functioning, generally, clustered within two related developmental domains: (1) cognition and language and (2) social and emotional functioning. In adolescence, they clustered within three developmental domains (1) cognition and language and (2) social functioning, and (3) emotional functioning. We demonstrate that developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as likely resulting from causal interactions between different areas of psychological functioning. They arise through bottom-up processes, whereby a given symptom or characteristic activates or leads to another; symptoms or characteristics that activate or lead to each other cluster together and appear as neurodevelopmental or psychiatric conditions. Differences and disorders that appear to be similar, prima facie, may be underpinned by diverse etiologies. Our work provides the first population-level evidence for a needs-based support system in schools; children and adolescents with developmental disorders and differences should be supported by targeting specific characteristics and symptoms with the aim of deactivating clusters or related characteristics and symptoms. Such an approach does not rely on waiting for a diagnostic label through lengthy assessment processes.",

These crises disrupt daily life and fuel uncertainty about the future in a life phase where expectations about the future increasingly influence identity and wellbeing. Experiences of such challenges are not equally distributed: youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are often more affected, both behaviorally and neurodevelopmentally. In this perspective, we argue that adolescence is a developmental window of both vulnerability and opportunity. We highlight the role of uncertainty and inequality as key mechanisms linking societal challenges to wellbeing. Importantly, we propose that inclusive prosocial engagement—opportunities for youth to contribute meaningfully to others—can foster resilience, identity development, and a sense of purpose. We propose that supporting adolescent wellbeing requires a developmentally informed, context-sensitive, and globally inclusive approach.",

To be included, studies had to be written in English, involve an intervention for acalculia that resulted from a stroke or a brain-injury, directly address numerical difficulties, and report the outcomes of the intervention, with no limit on the type or timing of measures.  \nSixteen publications describing interventions for acalculia were identified, with a total of N=31 patients. One unpublished study described an app-based intervention with 18 patients. Most interventions (10) targeted relearning of multiplication tables, followed by interventions designed to improve transcoding (4). All interventions were delivered individually (i.e., no group interventions), and most were tailored to individual patients. The most common method used was intense repetition (‘drill’), and the majority of interventions were conducted in French or German. Only one intervention was delivered in a non-European language (Japanese). \nWhile all interventions were effective, there were differences in the transferability of improvement from trained to untrained problems. Overall, the review highlights the scarcity of evidence of interventions for acalculia, despite the high prevalence of the condition.

          "authors": "Monika Eckstein",
          "abstract": "Previous research has exhaustively shown that stressful situations and conditions at work are associated with increased health problems while only few studies have addressed the relationship between engagement beyond professional work and mental health. The state of research points to a bidirectional relationship between volunteering activities and better mental health, though. An underlying mechanism may lie in the social environment and meaningfulness by these activities. Therefore the question raises whether volunteering in free time may buffer worsening effects of work stress on mental issues. The goal of the present data analyses is to better understand risk and protective factors for mental health burden like depressive disorder and draw conclusions for the function of volunteering in persons’ lives.\nI analyzed the relationship between volunteer work and mental health in a large sociological cross-sectional data set (within one year, 2019) and a longitudinal data set (over 2 years, 2018 and 2019) with N = 18.490 persons (a subset of the German socioeconomic panel study, SOEP) with statistical regression models for main effects and moderation effects. Variables of interest were the frequency of volunteering and depressive illness as well as job characteristics (payment, hours), demography (gender, age), job satisfaction and general health.\nThe analyzes resulted in evidence for a small association between some work factors (low payment, low hours) and no volunteer engagement with mental health problems as depression in the same year. In addition, there are also longitudinal relationships that could be a first hint for potential causal relationships: While volunteering itself seems to be quite stable, it is performed by persons with prior good overall health and job satisfaction. This result is in line with the notion that being healthy and in a good job is a very important and central factor for participating in a social society. My analyzes also replicated the general role of gender and age and the work characteristics low salary and low hours as risk factors for depression. A clear buffering effect of volunteering against these risk factors in a longitudinal perspective could not been shown. Limitations of the analyzes are the small effect sizes and very parsimonious assessments of volunteering and mental health.\nIn the analyzed large data set, there is more than a thousand persons affected by depression. This large group of mentally ill people shows its relevance and therefore it is worth to investigate potential mitigating factors further in more systematic future research. My results also add that health and more general a good life situation is a very important precondition for behaving in a sustainable way, which in turn might result in more mental health and support for oneself and others. Furthermore, the importance of a good and healthy work environment cannot be stressed enough with factors like adequate acknowledgement applying to both: payed work and volunteering.",

          "authors": "Kayla Green; Suzanne van de Groep",
          "abstract": "Around the globe, today’s generation of adolescents and young adults appear to experience more mental health problems than previous generations, and it is currently unclear why. Neuroimaging research has revealed vulnerabilities related to adolescents’ brain development, which gives insight into the development of mental health problems in adolescence. Neural changes, as part of normative development, can however not fully explain the rising trends. This paper outlines two important considerations: i) youth are currently dealing with various macro-level changes and ii) these changes are affecting youth through micro-system mechanisms in the family environment. First, the current generation of youth grow up in a society marked by multiple global changes like climate change, wars, poverty, and the aftermath of a pandemic. These macro-level changes can interfere with daily live and subsequently affect how youth feel about themselves, their lives, and their future, particularly through experiences of future uncertainty. Thus, it is important to gain understanding on how youth navigate through challenging times. However, not all youth are affected equally. As such the second focus of this paper is to shed light on which adolescents are prone to negative developmental outcomes. In the present perspective paper, we reflect on adolescence as a sensitive period for mental health problems and give an overview of how the macro-level influences of societal challenges, and micro-level influences in the family environment uniquely contribute and sometimes interact to shape youth’s wellbeing. Additionally, we discuss how providing youth with opportunities for inclusive prosocial actions may improve their wellbeing and elucidate how a more global perspective on studying youth’s wellbeing benefits research and practice.",

          "abstract": "This study examines changes in well-being globally, regionally, and nationally (N = 207,919) using Global Flourishing Study data. Life satisfaction declined consistently worldwide with large effect sizes (e.g., Asia: d = –0.41; Nigeria: d = –0.77). Life worthwhileness showed moderate declines across most regions (Asia: d = –0.39; Middle East &amp; Africa: d = –0.23). Happiness declined moderately and relatively uniformly, especially in Asia (d = –0.37), the Middle East &amp; Africa (d = –0.35), and North America (d = –0.13), while Europe and Latin America showed mostly non-significant changes. Country-level effect sizes ranged from negligible to large, indicating heterogeneity. The widespread decline in happiness suggests emotional well-being is more sensitive to global stressors than life satisfaction or worthwhileness. These findings highlight global well-being under strain and the importance of large-scale longitudinal data.",

This study is the first to compare an LLM (i.e., ChatGPT) with a well-established automated writing evaluation (AWE) system, Pigai, in delivering formative feedback for English as a Foreign Language learners. Using a single-blind randomized controlled design, this study involved 24 university students in a four-week academic writing training program. Participants completed weekly essays and received feedback either from ChatGPT or Pigai. ChatGPT’s responses were refined through prompt engineering, ensuring alignment with best practices for formative feedback by addressing lower-order (e.g., grammar, punctuation) and higher-order concerns (e.g., argumentation, structure), providing strengths and weaknesses, motivational language, and actionable improvement suggestions. Writing quality, perceptions of feedback quality, and motivation were assessed using linear mixed-effects modeling and independent samples t-tests. Both ChatGPT and Pigai improved writing quality over time, but only ChatGPT enhanced student motivation—particularly self-efficacy. These findings highlight the advantage of LLMs in delivering formative feedback over traditional AWE systems, particularly in fostering student motivation while achieving comparable improvements in academic outcomes. This study underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in educational technology, offering scalable and personalized feedback solutions that can address diverse educational needs.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

          "abstract": "Existential Realism (ER) is a recently proposed ontological framework that sharply distinguishes existence (actual, present being) from reality (a broader domain including non-present entities). ER was conceived to reconcile the intuitions of presentism (only the present exists) with eternalism (past and future are ontologically significant) in a two-tier view of time and being. This preprint surveys a range of open questions and forward-looking challenges that have emerged from the first generation of ER research. We chart key areas—metaphysics, physics, formal logic, phenomenology, cognitive science, and ethics—where ER’s framework invites further development. How does becoming (the passage from potential to actual) work in ER’s ontology? Can ER fully accommodate relativity and quantum physics without sacrificing its present-centric stance? What extensions to two-tier logic might capture phenomena like an open future or cross-temporal identity? How might ER engage with phenomenological accounts of time-consciousness or empirical findings about memory and anticipation in the brain? And what are the implications of ER for ethics, especially concerning our agency over time and responsibilities to future persons? Throughout, our tone is rigorous yet exploratory and humble: we outline problems and tensions rather than claim final answers. By mapping these open questions, we aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry and guide the next stages of ER’s development.",

          "abstract": "Closed-loop neuromodulation promises high-fidelity control over mood at consumer scale. While clinical benefits are undeniable for severe affective disorders, ubiquitous affect regulation shifts mood from private experience to governed variable. We argue that this transition generates affective externalities—spillovers in creativity, empathy, dissent, and compliance—that conventional bioethics and health economics fail to price. We formalize a welfare model in which mood set-points are individually optimal but socially coupled through production, pro-sociality, and political legitimacy. We introduce the concept of affective conformity equilibria in which firms and platforms optimize output by narrowing variance around elevated hedonic baselines, producing a new pathology: Pathological Unhappiness—sorrow rendered deviant by design. We outline a preregistered experimental program (laboratory, field, and platform telemetry) to estimate causal effects of engineered happiness on creativity, moral judgment, and collective action; and we propose policy levers, from clinic consent to platform governance to labor law, that preserve therapeutic gains without erasing the cultural and civic functions of melancholy. The goal is not to romanticize suffering but to treat affect as shared infrastructure whose over-optimization erodes the social goods that sorrow sustains.",

This two-tier ontology preserves the primacy of the present now while granting ontological status to non-present times in a way that avoids the pitfalls of both presentism and eternalism. We summarize ER’s core definitions and motivations, drawing from metaphysics, cognitive science, and physics to illustrate why separating existence from reality matters. ER offers a synthesis: like presentism it holds that only the present exists, yet like eternalism it affirms that past and future entities can still be real. We provide examples from neuroscience (memory and anticipation), physics (causal traces and relativity), formal logic (truthmakers and temporal reasoning), and ethics (duties to past and future) to demonstrate ER’s explanatory power. We discuss implications for our understanding of time’s flow, the self’s persistence, causality, and moral agency. The tone is rigorous and realistic, yet forward-looking: ER is presented as both a capstone summary of an emerging framework and an invitation for interdisciplinary inquiry into the nature of time and reality.",

          "abstract": "Background: Children with dyslexia are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties, both internalising (emotional) and externalising (behavioural) problems. Clever Kids is a nine-week socio-emotional wellbeing programme developed specifically to support upper primary school children with dyslexia. Aims: We conducted a pre-registered randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of Clever Kids. Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

          "abstract": "In Japan, physical education (PE) is often perceived as less intellectual than other school subjects. To address this bias, we developed a paper-based implicit measure to evaluate the intellectual image of PE. The test adapts the FUMIE test (Mori et al., 2008), a paper-and-pencil version of the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., 1998), suitable for group use in schools. In Study 1, 52 university students rated 100 two-kanji Japanese words as “intellectual,” “non-intellectual,” or “neutral.” Based on high agreement, we selected 20 intellectual and 10 non-intellectual words to construct the iFUMIE test. In Study 2, we evaluated its reliability and validity using the target words “understanding” and “ignorance,” with 51 students. Results confirmed the test’s usability in measuring implicit intellectual associations. The iFUMIE offers a foundation for future research assessing the effects of instructional efforts designed to enhance the perceived intellectual value of PE.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to reinterpret the long-assumed ineffable phenomenon of the sublime within the theoretical framework of the Core Belief Structure Theory (Kakushin Kōzō-ron).\nTraditionally discussed in religion, philosophy, and art as an experience of the infinite, the sacred, or the unknowable, the sublime is here defined as a collapse of the cognitive viewpoint, triggered when meaning structures leap beyond the processing capacity of the human Thought OS.\nThe central analytical model proposed is a three-stage sequence—Critical Leap → Structural Overreach → Perspective Collapse—through which the phenomenon of the sublime is structurally explained. The paper argues that the loss of language or tears in moments of awe are not emotional excesses but cognitive reactions to an unprocessable but existent structure.\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a five-stage Sublime Contact Design Model, offering a structural approach to increasing the likelihood of encountering the sublime in fields such as education, research, art, and healthcare. Through comparative analysis with major theories (Kant, Lacan, Heidegger, Barthes), the paper demonstrates that the Core Belief Structure Theory functions as a Thought OS capable of structurally articulating phenomena traditionally deemed beyond explanation.\nThe sublime, rather than being beyond language, is a structural event awaiting proper theoretical articulation. This work serves as a self-referential proof of the theory's capacity to describe the limits of meaning and the collapse of viewpoint within cognitive architecture.",

However, these estimates commonly come from long-term memory paradigms where words are used as stimuli. Two exceptions to this rule have found evidence for greater lure variability: a short-term memory task (Yotsumoto et al., 2008) and in an eyewitness memory paradigm (Wixted et al., 2018). In the present work, we conducted a series of recognition memory experiments using different stimulus (faces vs. words) along with different paradigms (long-term vs. short-term paradigms) to evaluate whether either of these conditions would result in greater variability in lure items. Greater target variability was observed across stimulus types and memory paradigms. This suggests that factors other than stimuli and retention interval might be responsible for cases where variability is less for targets than lures.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a Beta-Bernoulli mixture item response model (BBM-IRT) for bounded-continuous items such as those often utilized in continuous rating scales and slider-bar assessments. These item types are commonly used in psychological research but, to date, these assessments have primarily been utilized in fixed-length situations, where the same set of items are administered to all respondents, and have not been utilized within an adaptive testing framework. An adaptive testing framework offers several benefits, including the ability to obtain higher quality measurement precision with fewer items as items are targeted and administered based on the respondent’s previous responses. In addition to introducing the BBM-IRT model, this work also explores the use of the model within an adaptive testing framework. In particular, the item and test information functions – a component necessary for building adaptive assessments – is derived and presented in closed form. Through a series of simulation studies, we provide empirical evidence that it is possible to create adaptive assessments for bounded-continuous item types. An application with real data is also provided showing how the BBM-IRT model can be utilized in practical assessment situations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Globally, as many as 1 in 8 children experience severe and persistent language difficulties. These children are at heightened risk for mental health difficulties, however, both the ways in which mental health concerns manifest in the context of language difficulties, and the experiences of children with language difficulties and their caregivers in accessing and engaging with formal mental health supports remain under researched. Aim: The aim of the current study was to explore lived experience perspectives (child and caregiver) on mental health concerns and, mental health support, for children (≤ 18 years) with language difficulties. Method: A 2-phased sequential explanatory design was employed, which combined findings from an online international survey of caregivers (n = 120) of children with language difficulties with data from semi-structured interviews with both children (n = 4) and caregivers (n = 12). Results: Combined data from the survey and interviews highlighted a high level of caregiver concern about the mental health of children with language difficulties but low levels of access to formal mental health support. Interviews highlighted several reasons for not accessing formal mental health supports including limited availability of mental health care providers; funding and time constraints (i.e., not wanting to over-schedule their child); mental health providers lacking knowledge about DLD, and perceived or actual barriers of traditional methods of therapy (e.g., one-on-one talk therapy) for children with language difficulties. Conclusions and Implications: The findings of our study support the view that children with language difficulties are at risk of mental health concerns and yet are also under-served by mental health services. These findings highlight the need for targeted interprofessional training and integrated models of collaborative care between mental health and language specialists to more adequately meet these children’s needs. Future research to engage a wider range of child perspectives and the perspectives of clinicians on the facilitators and barriers to engaging children with language difficulties in formal mental health support is needed.",

          "authors": "Shruti Mishra",
          "abstract": "In today’s attention economy, the first three seconds of a video can determine whether a viewer stays on and watches it or scrolls away. This study analyzes 46,605 TikTok “hooks\", the opening line of text or speech in a post, drawn from more than 20 content categories. Using emotion‐richness scoring, rhetorical device flagging, and mixed statistical‐machine-learning models, the analysis compares emotional versus informational hooks and evaluates five persuasion devices (questions, “how to” framing, second-person address, negation, and urgency cues). Emotional hooks are scarce (≈ 3.2 % of posts) yet drive proportionally higher comments and shares, suggesting deeper audience resonance, while any advantage to likes is modest. Curiosity gaps and urgency statements outperform direct address or instructional phrasing across most categories, while optimal hook length shifts dramatically based on the niche, ranging from ≈ 9 words in news to ≈ 90 in entertainment. Unsupervised clustering uncovers five stable hook archetypes, with Meta/Community Humor and Fast &amp; CTA-Heavy styles leading the chart as the strongest predictors of engagement. Regression-tree, random-forest, and SHAP analyses connect on content category, hook length, urgency cues, and emotional richness as the most reliable predictors of performance. Collectively, the findings highlight that viral success on short-form video rests on an interplay of tone, rhetorical craft, and category norms rather than any single “magic phrase.” Practical guidelines are offered for creators and marketers aiming to design hooks that capture attention in the critical first few seconds.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the question, “What does it mean for a belief to change?”, aiming to structurally elucidate the anomalous phenomenon of belief transformation—an issue that has long eluded sufficient theoretical explanation.Within the framework of the author's philosophical system, Core Belief Structure Theory, belief is redefined not as an act of will or conviction, but as a structural fixation of meaning shaped by an underlying gravitational center called the \"Core Belief\".Belief transformation is reconceptualized as a redefinition of this core structure, triggered by specific structural conditions such as structural pressure, latent shards, flight cognition, insight ignition (kakusen), and structural jump (shunten).The paper presents a model of these internal movements and examines their implications for education and philosophical inheritance.It further contrasts this framework with major traditions such as religious philosophy, existentialism, and cognitive science, clarifying the unique contribution of Core Belief Structure Theory.Ultimately, the paper demonstrates that belief transformation, when seen through the lens of structural cognition, offers a pathway for thought systems to redefine their own operational centers—thus serving as an internal proof of the theory itself.",

          "authors": "Athena Nooney; Meghan Dontha; William E. Pelham",
          "abstract": "Objective: There is no externally validated instrument for predicting which children will show frequent substance use (SU) in young adulthood. This study evaluated whether an instrument previously shown to predict SU outcomes in mid-adolescence could also predict SU outcomes in young adulthood, comparing performance across ages and demographics. \n\n\nMethod: The Loeber Risk Score (LRS) is a 5-item, parent-completed screener indexing risk of future SU in children. We evaluated the predictive performance of the LRS in a nationally representative longitudinal birth cohort (N = 4,898, 48% female). Parents completed the LRS when the child was ~5 and ~9 years old. Subsequently, youth reported their SU at age ~22 years old. \n\n\nResults: The LRS at age 9 predicted several outcomes at age 22 better than chance (ps&lt;0.05): daily cigarette use (AUROCs=0.71-0.75), cannabis use ≥3x week (AUROC=0.59), vaping ≥3x week (AUROC=0.55), and receipt of treatment for an alcohol/drug problem (AUROC=0.60). Performance was no better than chance for alcohol outcomes (AUROCs=0.47-0.50). Children with LRS scores ≥2 were 1.3-2.0 times more likely to display frequent substance use outcomes. There were no consistent performance differences when the LRS was measured at age 5 vs. age 9 or by child’s sex, race, or ethnicity.\n\n\nConclusion: The LRS had modest accuracy when predicting some substance use outcomes in young adulthood, but it does not predict alcohol outcomes any better than chance. Better screeners are needed.",

          "abstract": "Potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and substance use (SU) are commonly endorsed in early adolescence, a crucial period for neurodevelopment. PTEs and SU are precipitating events in the etiological development of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Separately, they have been shown to alter within- and between-network connectivity in the three brain networks posited by Menon’s Theory of Psychopathology: the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN). While comorbid PTSD+SUD in adulthood shows shared neural underpinnings, this is less clear in adolescence. We analyzed the effects of PTEs and SU (all use, alcohol/cannabis/nicotine only, and stimulant or sedative use) on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 9-15 year olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Fixed effects panel models were fit to assess the effects of PTEs and SU on between-network (FPN-SN rsFC, DMN-SN rsFC, and FPN-DMN rsFC) and within-network (FPN rsFC, SN rsFC, and DMN rsFC) connectivity measured across three timepoints spanning two years. PTEs were the most reliable predictor prospectively, with significant effects of PTEs observed for both between- and within-network rsFC. Alcohol and nicotine use predicted higher within-network DMN and FPN rsFC, but lower DMN-SN connectivity, while cannabis use predicted lower within-network SN connectivity and moderated PTE effects in SN and DMN-SPN connectivity. Evidence for PTEs and SU interactively predicting rsFC was supported with sex-specific effects (males showed a steeper decline in SN and DMN-SN connectivity when PTEs and SU were combined, and females showed stronger positive DMN connectivity when alcohol and PTEs were combined). Results suggest that the observed changes in resting state functional connectivity are related to exposure to PTEs, SU, and their interaction rather than the typically observed neurodevelopmental changes during adolescence, highlighting a critical period for early intervention to prevent rsFC changes following PTEs and SU in early adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Music reflects a complex interplay between sensory, cognitive, and affective processing in the human brain. Using functional MRI, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying music perception in one-hundred healthy participants by comparing responses to intact and temporally scrambled musical pieces. Through computational acoustic analyses, we demonstrated that scrambling disrupted global structure while preserving local features, which allowed us to assess how the brain extracts coherence from musical input. We observed that intact music recruited a fronto–striatal pathway associated with rhythm processing, affect and reward, while scrambled music engaged auditory areas implicated in perception, as well as a fronto-parietal and cerebellar network involved in cognitive control. Through linear mixed-effects modelling, we also showed that individual differences in musical aptitude, training, and emotional self-regulation influence music perception in default–mode and cognitive, but not reward areas. We observed a dissociation between musical training and aptitude indices within the angular gyrus, showing opposite responses to intact and scrambled music. Our findings suggest that coherent musical structure is critical in shaping musical affect, with implications for a better understanding of the role of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Although often linked, much is unknown about the relationship between adolescents’ social media use and stress in everyday life. This study examined how the effect of social media use on stress unfolds at daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly levels, focusing both on overall effects across the sample and person-specific effects. In addition, we tested whether adolescents differed in effects based on their gender, age, and trait resilience. We used a 100-day diary study among 479 adolescents (44,211 completed observations). Participants reported daily stress levels and time spent on favorite social media platforms. Trait-level moderators were measured in a baseline questionnaire. Overall, the daily effect of social media use on stress was negligible (β = .03). However, there was substantial variation among adolescents: for 37% usage was linked to increased stress, for 14% to reduced stress, and for 49% it had no impact. These differences could not be explained by gender, age, or trait resilience. At longer timescales, the effect strengthened and affected more adolescents, rising from weekly (β = .05; increased stress for 46% of adolescents), over biweekly (β = .07; for 59%), to monthly levels (β = .13; for 73%). Additionally, 14% experienced less stress on days of increased usage, but this relief effect was nearly absent at longer timescales. The daily impact of social media use on stress is minimal. However, the effect becomes more pronounced over longer periods. This study is a first step toward understanding how everyday social media-related stress accumulates over time.",

Using a Bayesian computational model applied to a modified multi-armed bandit task, we investigated the correspondence between optimal triggers of curiosity (those that maximize learning potential), heuristic triggers of curiosity (surprise and uncertainty), and participants’ reported curiosity. In Studies 1-2 (N = 848), we found that adults’ curiosity was most sensitive to “local” learning potential (the extent to which information would shed light on the immediate target of curiosity). Curiosity was less sensitive to “global” learning potential (the extent to which information would contribute to broader learning goals), uncertainty, or surprise. Study 3 (N = 310) showed that curiosity’s sensitivity to local learning potential strengthened between ages 5 to 9 years and adulthood. Together, these studies suggest that curiosity tracks opportunities for learning, especially those that support learning about immediate targets of curiosity rather than broader learning goals.",

Here, we examined whether the spatial scope of attention is modulated by tonic arousal level. Based on findings that arousal amplifies the selectivity of attention and memory, we hypothesized that arousal would enhance the currently dominant spatial scope of attention (narrow or broad). Participants (N = 39) performed a visual search task designed to measure the breadth of attention. Auditory white noise was presented in half of the blocks to increase tonic arousal. Each trial started with a procedure that aimed to induce a narrow or broad breadth of attention. Pupil size measurements and visual search task performance revealed that the manipulations of arousal and breadth of attention were successful. However, we found strong Bayesian evidence against an effect of arousal on attentional scope. We discuss the implications of this finding for arousal-biased competition theory.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Psychosexual development is profoundly shaped by a network of hormonal signals that influence brain organization, behavior, and social interactions. Among these, sex steroid hormones, neuropeptides, and glucocorticoids play central roles in shaping motivational circuitry during critical windows of perinatal and pubertal brain development. Insights from modern developmental neuroendocrinology and behavioral genetics serve as a new foundation through which to understand Freud’s five stages of psychosexual development. The oral stage is primarily shaped by the organizational effects of sex hormones on perinatal brain development, and by oxytocin’s role in attachment formation. The anal stage centers on bodily control, mediated by cortical development and influenced by stress exposure. The phallic stage is characterized by the emergence of gender identity and psychological sex differences, where neuropeptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin play critical roles facilitating the development of prosociality and aggression. The latency stage marks the beginning of adrenal puberty, improved executive functioning, and environmental influences on pubertal timing. The genital stage represents a critical period of brain and behavioral reorganization driven by puberty, whereby androgens and estrogens orchestrate the development of secondary sexual characteristics, sex drive, neural reward circuitry, and sex differences in risk-taking and anxiety. Taken together, Freud’s theory of psychosexual development is revised under modern empirical constraints in the spirit of his Project for a Scientific Psychology.",

          "abstract": "A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many are developed from language responses directly to the depression assessments. These “Mirror models” suffer from “criterion contamination,” which arises when a predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus “Non-Mirror models,” which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two different interviews: (1) structured diagnostic and (2) life history. GPT-4, GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models (using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R²  = .80). As expected, Non-Mirror models (using life history data) demonstrated smaller effect sizes, but were still relatively large (e.g., R² = .27). When Mirror and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and Non-Mirror performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve, incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological assessment.",

          "abstract": "Climate change and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represent two of the greatest threats to human well-being in the 21st century. Both are strongly influenced by human behaviour, making behavioural change a critical pathway for mitigating climate and health risks. This chapter explores how selected theories and models from health and environmental psychology can inform the development and implementation of interventions that promote both healthy and sustainable behaviours. It then presents effective interventions targeting psychological factors as well as more structural aspects (e.g., infrastructure and policy) in high-impact behavioural domains such as mobility (reducing car use and promoting active transport) and diet (reducing meat consumption and increasing the intake of healthy plant-based foods). Finally, the chapter discusses the limitations and future directions of current behaviour change approaches, calling for greater representation of diverse populations, more long-term evaluations, consistency in measured outcomes, and greater attention to the broader context in which behaviours occur. Overall, this chapter advocates for multidisciplinary and multilevel interventions that address both individual and contextual determinants of behaviour. It aims to inspire researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to strengthen the scientific and societal relevance of behavioural strategies in the transition toward healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.",

          "abstract": "This study used corpus linguistics to explore how Title IX is represented in natural language by analyzing a custom-built subcorpus of Title IX-related texts and comparing them to a general reference corpus (enTenTen21). This study focused on (a) identifying keywords more frequent in Title IX discourse, (b) identifying multiword expressions distinctive to Title IX, and (c) examining collocates surrounding the term “Title IX.” Results revealed that the most distinctive single words were “ix,” “misconduct,” and “harassment,” while common multiword phrases included “title ix coordinator” and “sexual misconduct,” reflecting the legalistic and disciplinary framing of Title IX. Collocation analysis further showed that Title IX is frequently situated alongside other regulatory terms such as “VAWA,” “FERPA,” “Clery,” and “nondiscrimination,” suggesting its central role within a broader network of institutional compliance and campus safety mandates. These findings provide new insight into how Title IX is positioned linguistically in higher education discourse and offer practical implications for counselors and student affairs professionals navigating its evolving implementation.",

College student participants completed experience sampling method self-reports (N = 352, 10,046 observations) of their social interactions, feelings of social connectedness, autonomy, and positive affect in the past hour. Participants reported lower autonomy when socially interacting compared with being alone. This was especially true for people with higher levels of attachment avoidance. Crucially, interaction partner matters: Compared with being alone, people report lower autonomy when interacting with non-close others, similar levels of autonomy when interacting friends and family, and higher autonomy when interacting with romantic partners. These findings provide ecologically valid evidence for an autonomy–relatedness tradeoff during social interactions with non-close others, but show that interactions with romantic partners uniquely fulfill both autonomy and relatedness needs.",

We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

Hierarchical linear regressions assessed whether FreeSurfer-derived total hippocampal volume or hippocampal subfield volume (subiculum, presubiculum, dentate gyrus, CA1) moderated the association between GAP-43 and episodic memory performance. GAP-43 and hippocampal volume were independently associated with episodic memory performance. Greater GAP-43 was associated with lower episodic memory performance in older adults with average or below-average (-1 SD) total and subfield (subiculum, presubiculum, dentate gyrus) hippocampal volume. No associations were observed in participants with above-average (+1 SD) volume.

          "abstract": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence has ushered in a new era where machines produce text with such emotional coherence that they blur the boundary between simulation and sentience. This paper explores the emotional fallacy—a cognitive bias wherein users and even developers anthropomorphize Large Language Models (LLMs), attributing genuine emotions to systems governed solely by statistical inference and pattern recognition.\n\nWhile LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI are engineered to generate emotionally evocative content, their responses are frequently mistaken as indicators of self-awareness, affective reasoning, or internal states. This anthropomorphic illusion carries significant implications for user trust, emotional labour, and the broader ethical landscape of AI deployment.\n\nThrough a novel empirical study, we evaluate the responses of multiple LLMs to a curated set of emotionally charged and ethically sensitive prompts. The outputs are analyzed qualitatively across three dimensions: linguistic style, affective mimicry, and ethical stance. Our findings reveal a paradox: while LLMs simulate emotion with impressive linguistic precision, they lack any true experiential grounding—underscoring their inherent emotional inauthenticity.\n\nTo address these concerns, we propose an ethical framework that includes affective transparency, disclosure protocols, and regulation to prevent emotional manipulation in public-facing AI systems. We argue that the unchecked spread of the emotional fallacy may distort public perceptions of AI, affect mental health, and reshape norms surrounding machine consciousness and empathy.\n\nBy integrating philosophical inquiry, empirical analysis, and ethical design, this paper calls for a paradigm shift—from emotional realism to emotional accountability in the design and deployment of generative AI. Our work offers a cautionary lens and a research frontier in the study of human–AI emotional interaction, particularly as such systems permeate education, healthcare, and psychological support domains.",

While we have been able to predict the values of cognitive curves, we actually want to know how to address depressive symptoms.

Therefore, we considered the number of times depressive symptoms occur. First, we derived the probability distribution of the number of times depressive symptoms occur used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the expected value of the derived probability distribution, it was found that the expected number of times depression symptoms occur is equal to the time spent experiencing depression symptoms converted into the number of times. Based on these results, we proposed interventions for depression. These interventions are the same as those used in psychiatric treatment, and we provided a logical basis for these treatments.",

          "authors": "Graeme Lithgow",
          "abstract": "Abusive relationships are profoundly shaped by the interaction of distinct neurobiological profiles. This paper proposes a systems-level framework—defined as the interaction between neural, endocrine, and behavioral systems—of neurobiological entanglement to explain the self-perpetuating cycles of exploitation and dependency in relationships involving individuals with covert narcissistic traits and neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD or autism. The framework integrates research on the neurobiological mechanisms of perpetrators, who exhibit high cognitive but low emotional empathy, with the neurodivergent vulnerabilities of victims, including dopamine dysregulation and heightened oxytocin sensitivity. We conceptualize trauma bonding as a neurochemical process that shares key features with addiction, driven by intermittent reinforcement that exploits these inherent sensitivities. The long-term consequences of this abuse, including alterations to the hippocampus, amygdala, HPA axis, and default mode network, are discussed. Finally, we outline a neurobiologically-tailored recovery approach using the “Six Rs” framework. Given that neurodivergent individuals are significantly more likely to experience intimate partner violence—up to 47% in autistic women—this paper argues that recognizing narcissistic abuse as a neurobiological public health concern is essential for developing specialized, evidence-based interventions and policies to support neurodivergent survivors.",

The results of the present investigation showed that among the various pre-soaking treatments, T2 (GA3 @ 400 ppm + 24 hours soaking) was the most effective in enhancing seed germination and shoot growth parameters, followed by T3 (GA3 @ 500 ppm + 24 hours soaking). In contrast, the control treatment (T0) exhibited the lowest performance across all evaluated parameters. Among the organic treatments, T9 (Cow urine @ 10% + 24 hours soaking) produced the most favourable response, followed by T12 (Cow dung slurry @ 10% + 24 hours soaking).

          "abstract": "Background: In autumn 2023, COVID-19 vaccination invitations in the Netherlands shifted from self-scheduling to pre-booked appointments for selected groups. While defaulting to pre-booked slots may increase uptake, potential rebound effects remain unclear. We examine preferences between appointment types, their effect on vaccination intentions, and whether effects are different for individuals hesitant about this vaccination round.\n\nMethods: A mixed-methods approach was used to assess vaccination intentions for three groups (&lt;60 with influenza vaccination indication, 60-69 and 70+ years) eligible for pre-booked appointments. Study 1 examined attitudes around pre-booked appointments in 15 interviews. Study 2 experimentally tested preferences for pre-booked appointments vs self-scheduled appointments and their effect on vaccination intentions in a representative online panel (n=1.886) and those who experience hesitancy about this vaccination.\n\nFindings: Interviews showed that pre-booked appointments are seen as presumptuous or inconvenient (a potential indicator of reactance) by some, but also as a useful aid in support of vaccination uptake, sometimes by the same people. Participants in Study 2 indicated a preference for self-scheduling (Coefficient = -.23) but this preference did not translate to differences in vaccination intentions (Adjusted OR =1.11) Similar results were observed in the hesitant subgroup (Coefficient = –.25; Adjusted OR = 0.88).\n\nDiscussion: In our study pre-booked appointments do not change COVID-19 vaccination intentions. As pre-booked appointments evoked negative and positive sentiments and self-scheduling was found easier and more pleasant, it is important to examine potential rebound effects of switching the default, particularly amongst subgroups in the population with lower intentions.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia—the congenital absence of voluntary visual imagery—is a neurocognitive phenotype affecting approximately 1–4% of the population. Twin studies estimate heritability at 0.41–0.66, and neuroimaging reveals large effect sizes for frontoparietal connectivity differences, supporting a polygenic neurodevelopmental origin. This paper presents an integrative synthesis from 2020–2025, combining findings from genomics, neurodevelopment, and cognitive neuroscience. Candidate genes affecting cortical patterning (CYP26B1, FOXG1, TCF4), synaptic scaffolding (SHANK3), and neurotransmitter systems (COMT, DRD4, HTR2A, OXTR, BDNF) produce an atypical cognitive architecture that disrupts visual-frontal integration but supports compensatory verbal-analytic strengths. The proposed “Aphantasia-Plus” phenotype includes enhanced reasoning, trauma resilience, and systemizing cognition. The model generates testable predictions for genetic scoring, neuroimaging, and education outcomes, and reframes aphantasia as a neurodivergent specialization rather than a deficit.",

Over the course of 12 weeks, 45 players (Elo 1200–1600) attended five 40-minute sessions a week to practice with FutureTraining96. Strong effect sizes were found for improvements in working memory (roughly 15%) and competitive anxiety (roughly 30%). Additionally, participants reported reduced performance anxiety, enhanced flow states, and increased mental imagery of training. This suggests that even in its early stages of development, a powerful, human-aligned bot can offer strategic cognitive and emotional training advantages.",

Collective narcissism - the belief that the ingroup is exceptional but not sufficiently recognized by others - is linked to behaviors that escalate intergroup conflicts, reinforce social injustice and inequality, undermine rationality and challenge democratic principles. In contrast, ingroup satisfaction—the belief that the ingroup is of a high value—may be a remedy against them. Clarifying the distinction and relationships between collective narcissism and ingroup satisfaction may be essential for constraining the negative outcomes of collective narcissism.

The central thesis asserts that repetitive patterns in behavior, speech, and relational dynamics often reflect unintegrated symbolic configurations rather than pathology. By introducing the concept of structural integration fractals, we delineate how therapeutic transformation can occur through spontaneous symbolic resonance, even outside of traditional clinical contexts.\n\nThe model articulates a distinction between traumatic repetition and functional symbolic repetition, illustrating how projected symbols—when named or mirrored appropriately—can catalyze the reorganization of the self. A representative case study (“Alex”) is presented to demonstrate how fractal structures emerge in everyday discourse and may serve as therapeutic anchors without explicit psychotherapeutic framing.\n\nWe offer clinical tools, procedural frameworks, and symbolic language guidelines to support professionals in implementing the model without requiring advanced AI or digital systems. This work opens new lines of inquiry into symbolic language as a catalyst for reconfiguration and highlights the viability of structurally oriented interventions that align with the client’s projected symbolic logic.\n\nKeywords: structural fractals, symbolic integration, projected self, therapeutic repetition, symbolic logic, non-invasive therapy, clinical semiotics, psycho-symbolic resonance.",

In probability judgments, for example, people tend to overestimate low probabilities and underestimate high probabilities. Although the consistency of this regressiveness has been widely demonstrated, it remains unclear whether people take it into account when interpreting probability estimates made by others. Across four preregistered experiments (total N = 601), we demonstrate that, rather than adjusting estimates towards the extremes to correct for the regressiveness of the original judgments, participants consistently shifted their estimates of the true underlying probabilities towards the mean, thereby reinforcing regression effects.

Little research outside the US has included youth who vape, particularly those using newer disposable vapes. We investigated exposure to nicotine and the TSNA NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) among youth in England who vape, smoke, do both (dual), or do neither.\n\nMethods: \nIn 2023, youth aged 16-19 from England completed a survey and provided a urine sample (N=201). Linear regressions examined associations of creatinine-normalised urinary concentrations of Total Nicotine Equivalents (TNE-2) and NNAL (a metabolite of NNK) with past 7-day smoking/vaping status and self-reported recency of vaping. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex-at-birth, ethnicity, and any past 7-day cannabis use. \n\nFindings:\nOver three quarters (77%) of those vaping were using the newer disposable vapes. Urinary TNE-2 concentrations among those who exclusively vaped in the past 7 days (n=83, geometric mean (GM)=5.09 nmol/mg creatinine [95%CI=3.19-8.12]) did not differ significantly from those who smoked (n=9,GM=1.74[0.64-4.72],p=.426) or dual used (n=55, GM=5.60[3.32-9.43],p=.953). Levels of NNAL among those who exclusively vaped (GM=1.87 pg/mg creatinine[1.62-2.17]) were significantly lower than those who smoked (GM=4.87,p=.001[2.45-9.68]) or dual used (GM=3.67[2.76-4.86],p&lt;.001) and not significantly different from youth who neither vaped nor smoked (GM=1.84[1.52-2.24],p=.887).\n\nInterpretation:\nYouth who vape are exposed to similar levels of nicotine compared to those who smoke or who dual use. NNAL exposure among youth who vape is much lower than those who smoke, and indistinguishable from youth who do not vape or smoke.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels. Additionally, we present a quantum geometric derivation of Newton's gravitational constant and resolve the cosmological constant problem through discrete spacetime structures, unified by Hodge duality mechanisms.",

Substantial instability and inconsistencies cast doubts about the reliability of the obtained preferences for policymaking. Given the parallels between choice blindness manipulation (CBM) detection and risk preference (in)stability, I explore in this study explores whether CBM detection can indicate risk preference. An online randomized controlled experiment with 330 UK residents served to test the coincidence of CBM and risk preference stability along with common predictors, incl. task-, domain-, and individual-specific variables. Using 2 different stimuli to communicate risks and outcomes in elicitation gambles, covering five urban drainage and flood prevention outcomes, the results do not support CBM detection as an indicator of preference stability. Only about 1 in 4 participants detected at least one CBM and 1 in 10 manipulations were detected. Risk preferences were moderately stable across trials but inconsistent across treatment conditions; icon array stimuli led to risk-seeking and numeric stimuli led to risk-averse preferences. The significant predictors of CBM detection included task stimuli, choice latency, risk numeracy, age, and household flooding or waterbody pollution domains. Significant predictors of risk preference stability were gamble distinctness and risk numeracy, as also the only joint predictors of CBM detection and preference stability. By contrasting with theoretical explanations and earlier findings in literature, gaps to address in future research were identified. The empirical findings highlight a strong influence of choice architecture on preference construction also in this study, questioning neutrality and reliability of online risk preferences elicitation for policymaking.",

In this experimental study, we designed a collaborative scavenger hunt with one participant remotely operating a telepresence robot and another participant being physically present on-site. Together, they solved a series of tasks, and their experiences were evaluated in terms of teaming, workload, and presence. Descriptive results indicate a generally positive collaboration experience, with similar levels of perceived workload across both participant groups and high ratings of social presence and engagement.

          "abstract": "When comparing latent means across groups, measurement invariance (MI) needs to be established to ensure that the test results are valid and meaningful conclusions can be drawn. Common tests of MI are not suitable for many groups and cannot be used during the development of measurement models. In addition, popular network-based alternatives to latent variable modeling lack established methods for MI testing. Therefore, we propose Exploratory Graph Analysis Trees (EGA trees) that apply the idea of model-based recursive partitioning to correlation matrices and combine it with EGA - which can be used instead of exploratory factor analysis. In a simulation study, we test the approach regarding its ability to detect configural or metric non-invariance in common factor models given numerous covariates and illustrate its usefulness in conditions with severe violations of configural invaraince based on diverging numbers of factors. The results demonstrate that EGA trees can be a valuable tool for the exploration of MI when constructing scales and working on measurement models. We provide R functions within the R package EFAtree to easily implement EGA trees.",

          "abstract": "India faces a profound mental health crisis, marked by the largest population in the world, a high prevalence of disorders and a severe shortage of qualified professionals. Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP’s B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI’s introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being.",

While eternalism posits a static block where all times equally exist, and presentism insists only the now exists, both struggle with relativity’s implications. Existential Realism (ER), recently introduced by T. C.

ER accommodates the relativity of simultaneity and the frame-dependence of “now,” avoiding the block’s metaphysical excess while preserving the ontological specialness of the present.

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "In both philosophy and science, standard logics struggle to model a key insight of Existential Realism (ER): that existence is a strictly present, empirical notion, whereas reality spans beyond the present. Classical first-order logic and even temporal modal logics tend to conflate being real with existing simpliciter, making it difficult to formally distinguish something that exists now from something that is real but not present. This paper introduces a formal two-tier logical framework tailored to ER’s ontology. We motivate this framework by showing how orthodox systems—from classical predicate logic to temporal modal logic—fail to capture ER’s core distinction between present existence and temporally extended reality. We then develop a layered logic with explicit operators or quantifiers for “existence-now” versus “reality-over-time,” including formal axioms that preserve ER’s asymmetries: only present entities exist (in the fullest sense), yet past and future entities can be real (ontologically significant) without existing. The logic adopts a modal-style treatment of time to model the collapse of potential into actual (present-becoming), and explicitly encodes causal asymmetry — where the past influences the present, but not the reverse. We illustrate the framework with symbolic representations, including an iconic “ER equation” capturing the relationship between reality and existence. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply the logic to examples from quantum physics (e.g. wavefunction collapse and delayed-choice experiments), cognitive neuroscience (memory traces and anticipatory processing), ethics (moral duties to future persons and the reality of future outcomes), and AI (agents modeling counterfactual or temporally extended scenarios). Finally, we show how the formalism sheds new light on classic metaphysical debates such as the truthmaker problem for past truths, persistence and identity over time, and the ontology of merely possible or future entities. Throughout, our presentation maintains a rigorous yet accessible tone, consistent with prior ER works, with technical clarity and footnoted references. The result is a self-contained preprint that extends T.C. Trepp’s Existential Realism into a formal logical system, demonstrating its broad applicability across science, philosophy, and practical reasoning.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a structural reinterpretation of trauma within the framework of Core Belief Structure Theory (Kakushin Kōzōron), a philosophical system proposed by the author.Contrary to traditional perspectives that view trauma as a psychological, emotional, or neurophysiological phenomenon, this study defines trauma as a frozen state of cognition in which meaning structures are rigidly fixed and no longer subject to redefinition.This condition arises from the failure of \"Mindflight Cognition\"—the structured cognitive leap involving perspective shift, structural reorganization, and value-centered anchoring—and is further reinforced by the suppression of core belief (kakushin) and the emergence of compensatory structures.The paper systematically analyzes the structural formation of trauma, the cognitive mechanisms of non-leapability, the initial signs of redefinition, and the process by which structural recovery can be intentionally designed.Finally, it argues that trauma, rather than lying outside the scope of philosophical theory, serves as an internal proof target for the system itself, thereby validating the coherence, generativity, and inclusive capacity of Core Belief Structure Theory.",

          "authors": "Yuki Kobayashi; Arthur G Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Computational models that explain lightness/brightness illusions have been proposed. These models have been assessed using a simplistic criterion: the number of illusions each model can correctly predict from the test set. This simple method of evaluation assumes that each illusion is independent; however, since the independence and similarity among lightness illusions have not been well established, potential interdependencies among the illusions in the test set could distort the evaluation of models. Moreover, evaluating models with a single value obscures where the model’s strengths and weaknesses lie. We collected the magnitudes of various lightness illusions through two online experiments and applied exploratory factor analyses. Both experiments identified some underlying factors in these illusions, suggesting that they can be classified into a few distinct groups. Experiment 1 identified three common factors; assimilation, contrast, and White’s effect. Experiment 2, with a different illusion set, identified two factors–assimilation and contrast. We then examined three well-known models that are based on early-visual processes, using the outcomes of the experiments. The examination of these models revealed biases in the models towards specific factors or sets of illusions, which suggested their limitations. This study clarified that correlations of illusion magnitudes provide valuable insights into both illusions and models and highlighted the need to assess models based on their ability to account for underlying factors rather than individual illusions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Children with dyslexia are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties, both internalising (emotional) and externalising (behavioural) problems. Clever Kids is a nine-week socio-emotional wellbeing programme developed specifically to support upper primary school children with dyslexia. Aims: We conducted a pre-registered randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of Clever Kids. Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

          "abstract": "This paper theorizes the Subconscious Inner Thought Manipulation Theory (SITMT), which argues that all inner thought operates through unconscious processing systems that can be manipulated during critical childhood developmental periods to permanently alter cognitive architecture. Building on dual process theory research showing that unconscious Type 1 processing drives most human cognition, SITMT proposes that the specific form of inner experience each person develops, whether verbal internal monologue, visual imagery, emotional processing, or abstract conceptual flow, results from deliberate or unconscious manipulation of subconscious processing systems during periods when conscious resistance is impossible. The theory suggests that: (1) All inner thought emerges from unconscious processing systems operating below conscious awareness, making it inherently vulnerable to external manipulation, (2) Critical developmental periods create maximum plasticity in unconscious processing architecture when manipulation can permanently alter cognitive patterns, (3) The right hemisphere's inability to communicate verbally creates opportunities for unconscious manipulation of non-verbal processing systems without conscious detection, (4) Subliminal and pre-conscious environmental inputs shape unconscious processing preferences through repetitive conditioning that operates entirely below awareness thresholds. Unlike traditional theories focusing on conscious cognitive development, SITMT reveals how the unconscious mind, which generates all inner thought, can be programmed to produce specific cognitive experiences while the conscious mind remains completely unaware of this manipulation. This theory has implications for cognitive autonomy, mental freedom, and understanding how human consciousness itself may be controlled through unconscious processing system manipulation.",

          "abstract": "This paper redefines the commonly observed “flow state” from the perspective of Kakushin Structural Theory (KST), presenting it as a specific manifestation of structurally driven intelligence. While flow has been extensively documented in psychology and neuroscience—characterized by concentration, immersion, hedonic continuity, ego dissolution, and temporal distortion—its structural mechanism has remained unexplained.We introduce the concept of Orbital Intelligence, describing it as a dynamic cognitive mode that emerges through the following three structural conditions:\n•\tCritical density of structural shards (prepared cognitive fragments)\n•\tChain of Shunten (seamless focal transitions)\n•\tSemiotic gravity induced by Core Belief (Kakushin)\nIn this framework, flow is not simply sustained concentration, but rather a balanced, self-propelling orbit of cognition—held between structural density and semantic gravity. We position orbital intelligence alongside other “human anomalies” previously defined in KST—namely insight, mastery, and intuition—showing that it functions as an integrative, continuous mode of operation.The paper concludes by outlining the designability of this state, and explores its applicability in learning, creative processes, and AI-augmented cognition. Through this structural redefinition of flow, we demonstrate an internal proof of the core axiom of KST: structure drives intelligence.",

Se analizan implicaciones clínicas, educativas y terapéuticas, proponiendo un modelo proyectivo-fractal que permite comprender cómo un mismo enunciado puede tener múltiples capas de impacto según la estructura del receptor. La propuesta surge de la observación sistemática de patrones repetitivos de conflicto y resonancia en diversos ámbitos (relacional, laboral, educativo y clínico), y plantea que la identificación consciente de estos órdenes puede facilitar la integración emocional, la mejora del vínculo terapéutico y el diseño de estrategias de comunicación con menor resistencia proyectiva.",

          "abstract": "Do prospective memory (PM) reminders act as a cognitive backup that preserves internal representations, or do they prompt a migration that restructures how intentions are maintained? We tested this in a student population (N=320) by crossing PM reminder reliability (0%, 50%, 100%) and availability (present vs. absent). Thought probes served as a real-time proxy for whether the intention remained activated during the retention interval between encoding and retrieval. In Session 1 (trust trials), reminders enhanced performance without reducing internal activation, consistent with the representational backup view. However, after experiencing reliable external support, Session 2 (critical trials) showed that those in the 100% condition reduced internal activation and reallocated attention to the ongoing task. Moreover, unexpectedly removing reminders dropped performance in the 100% condition below the 0% condition. These findings suggest that offloading reshapes how intentions are maintained and provides a lens for observing how memory adapts to changing external support.",

          "abstract": "There is growing recognition that short-term changes in speech perception influence speech production. These effects shed light on phonetic convergence – the subtle alignment of speech patterns that emerges between communication partners – and offer insights into interactions of perception and production. Across three experiments, we investigate the representations underlying perceptual effects on speech production. Building from the strong influence of preceding context on speech perception, we strategically pair contexts and target syllables to enhance or diminish target syllables’ perceptual distinctiveness and examine the impact of these perceptual effects on speech production. Experiment 1 shows that speech contexts rich in articulatory-phonetic information shift speech perception and alter acoustic patterns of speech production. Experiment 2 demonstrates that continuous natural speech filtered to possess subtly different spectral profiles that do not impact articulatory-phonetic information also impact both perception and production. Strikingly, Experiment 3 reveals that even nonspeech tones induce perceptual context effects that influence speech production. The findings point to a much broader scope of perception-production transfer than reported previously, and challenge the necessity of social interaction, covert imitation, and articulatory-phonetic information in sensorimotor speech interactions. This points to the need to extend models of speech motor control to account for perceptual influences of other talkers’ speech on speech production, and to accommodate general auditory processes in perception-production interactions.",

Although some\nresearch has linked mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to changes in eye movements, there are notable\nmethodological discrepancies among the existing studies.\nInclusion criteria: Studies will be included if they meet the following criteria regarding participants,\ndesign, and setting: recruitment of people with MCI who are over 60 years of age; any eye-tracking\nparadigm administered using an ET screen; and any setting. No restrictions will be applied at the outset\nof the literature search with regard to study design, publication type or data.\nMethods: This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Up to August 2025,\nthe following databases will be searched: PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of\nScience. Additional articles will be identified by searching grey literature and the reference lists of all\nrelevant included studies. Two reviewers will work independently to decide which studies to include\nor exclude. They will conduct a thorough examination of all titles, abstracts, and full-text studies. The\nresearch group will endeavour to extract the features of the included pieces of research using a\nbespoke data collection form. A tabular and narrative summary will be prepared at the end of the\nprocess to present the gathered information.\n\nKeywords: Mild Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, Eye movements, Digital biomarker, Review, Protocol",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia—the congenital absence of voluntary visual imagery—is a neurocognitive phenotype affecting approximately 1–4% of the population. Twin studies estimate heritability at 0.41–0.66, and neuroimaging reveals large effect sizes for frontoparietal connectivity differences, supporting a polygenic neurodevelopmental origin. This paper presents an integrative synthesis from 2020–2025, combining findings from genomics, neurodevelopment, and cognitive neuroscience. Candidate genes affecting cortical patterning (CYP26B1, FOXG1, TCF4), synaptic scaffolding (SHANK3), and neurotransmitter systems (COMT, DRD4, HTR2A, OXTR, BDNF) produce an atypical cognitive architecture that disrupts visual-frontal integration but supports compensatory verbal-analytic strengths. The proposed “Aphantasia-Plus” phenotype includes enhanced reasoning, trauma resilience, and systemizing cognition. The model generates testable predictions for genetic scoring, neuroimaging, and education outcomes, and reframes aphantasia as a neurodivergent specialization rather than a deficit.",

But can AI-generated creative works truly compete with human-authored works? In Study 1, participants (N=1,498 adults recruited from Prolific) read either a human-written or AI-generated story. Regardless of their story’s true origin, half of the participants were told that their story was written by a human, while the other half were told that their story was written by ChatGPT. After reading, participants rated the story’s quality and their level of absorption into the story. Participants rated the AI-generated story as higher in quality and more absorbing, but they rated the story better on both measures when they had been told it was written by a human. In Study 2, participants (N=424 adults recruited from Prolific) read both a human-written and AI-generated fictional short story and guessed each story’s origins. They also answered questions regarding their experiences with ChatGPT and other AI software and their experiences with fictional literature. While participants were significantly worse than chance at differentiating between the human-written and AI-generated stories, experience with AI software expertise were positively correlated with correct performance. Experience with fictional literature had no significant effect. The results from these studies suggest that AI programs might be able to generate human-level creative work but are not perceived as being able to do so.",

Surprisingly, two models predict a reversal of the redundant\ntarget effect (slower responses to two targets than to one target): the generalized standard\nserial model, and a specific form of a fixed-capacity parallel model. To test that prediction,\nwe measured performance for three different judgments of written words: color\ndetection, lexical decision, and semantic categorization. The color task yielded positive\nredundant target effects, which reject the standard serial model. The semantic task\nyielded consistently negative effects, which are consistent with either the standard serial\nmodel or some limited-capacity parallel models.

In Study 1 (N=689), messages promoting volunteerism were substantially less successful to the extent that they contained elements that conflicted with people’s motivations to volunteer. In Study 2 (N=1,101), the detrimental effects of providing mismatched messages (e.g., presenting liberal individuals with appeals highlighting conservative values) were greater in magnitude than the benefits of providing matched messages (e.g., presenting liberal individuals with appeals highlighting liberal values).

Substantial instability and inconsistencies cast doubts about the reliability of the obtained preferences for policymaking. Given the parallels between choice blindness manipulation (CBM) detection and risk preference (in)stability, I explore in this study explores whether CBM detection can indicate risk preference. An online randomized controlled experiment with 330 UK residents served to test the coincidence of CBM and risk preference stability along with common predictors, incl. task-, domain-, and individual-specific variables. Using 2 different stimuli to communicate risks and outcomes in elicitation gambles, covering five urban drainage and flood prevention outcomes, the results do not support CBM detection as an indicator of preference stability. Only about 1 in 4 participants detected at least one CBM and 1 in 10 manipulations were detected. Risk preferences were moderately stable across trials but inconsistent across treatment conditions; icon array stimuli led to risk-seeking and numeric stimuli led to risk-averse preferences. The significant predictors of CBM detection included task stimuli, choice latency, risk numeracy, age, and household flooding or waterbody pollution domains. Significant predictors of risk preference stability were gamble distinctness and risk numeracy, as also the only joint predictors of CBM detection and preference stability. By contrasting with theoretical explanations and earlier findings in literature, gaps to address in future research were identified. The empirical findings highlight a strong influence of choice architecture on preference construction also in this study, questioning neutrality and reliability of online risk preferences elicitation for policymaking.",

          "abstract": "Conventional wisdom and scientific research suggest that political conservatism is at odds with support for environmentalism. Across two survey studies and an experiment (total N = 1,995) we consider the possibility that this relationship varies by environmentalism type and ethnic-racial category. Whereas political conservatism was negatively related to support for environmentalism, this relationship was significantly weaker for initiatives that prioritize conservation of supposedly pristine nature (Wilderness Preservation; WP) than initiatives that advocate techno-fixes to ecological degradation (Ecomodernism; EM) or acknowledge and address power structures and the suffering of marginalized groups (Environmental Justice; EJ; Studies 1-3), and these patterns were generally more pronounced among White compared to Black and Latine participants (Studies 2 and 3). Study 3 provides causal evidence that the relationship of conservatism with support varies by environmentalism type and shows that this relationship varies by ethnic-racial category. Mediation analyses reveal that the weaker relationship of conservatism with WP support (versus EM and EJ) stemmed in part from the perception of EM and especially EJ as threats to U.S. society. We emphasize the importance of foregrounding sociocultural context in the study of political ideology, ‘polarization,’ and environmentalism.",
